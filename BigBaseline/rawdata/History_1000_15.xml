{{Year nav topic5|1977|radio|music|television|home video}}
In the year '''1977''', significant events in '''[[radio broadcasting]]''' included the [[President of the United States]] participating in a call-in radio program.

==Events==
*January – [[KIIK-FM|WRSQ-FM]] (104.9) signs on the air in [[Geneseo, Illinois]] as a sister station to WGEN-AM (1500 AM). The station's first call letters are short-lived, as the station will quickly adopt the callsign WGEN-FM. The initial format is [[country music]] with a community focus.
*February 18 – [[Belgischer Rundfunk]] (BRF) is founded and takes over responsibility for [[public service broadcasting|public-service]] radio broadcasting in the [[German language]] in Belgium.
*March 5 - President [[Jimmy Carter]] participates with [[Walter Cronkite]] in the ''Dial-a-President'' radio program on [[CBS]].
*May 12 - [[WTIC-FM]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] switches from [[European classical music|classical music]] to a new [[Top 40]] format designed by consultant [[Mike Joseph]]. This successful new approach will later be termed [[Hot Hits]].
*August 16 - Radio and television stations nationwide interrupt regular programming to report the death of [[Elvis Presley]].
*September 1 -- Dave Lingafelt begins airing "The Whacky Wake Up Crew" on [[WNNC]]-AM in Newton, North Carolina. He has been on the air for more than 35 years and has since purchased another AM station as well as 95.7 WXRC "The Ride."

===No dates===
*[[KSTP-FM]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] adopts its long-running [[soft rock]] format.

==Debuts==
*3 February: ''Adventure Theater'' (a children's program, not to be confused with ''[[Adventure Theater]]'', a 1956 anthology series on [[NBC]]) debuts on [[CBS]].&lt;ref name="dunningota"&gt;Dunning, John. (1998). ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-507678-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Closings==
*29 May: [[NBC Radio Network|NBC Radio]]'s all-news "News and Information Service" ceases operations, citing a low number of affiliates. Most stations switch to different formats, but [[KQV]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] launched a locally based production for its all-news format, which it maintains to the present day.

==Births==
* November - [[Heidi Cortez]], American model, writer, and radio host

==Deaths==
* [[Bud Ballou]], radio [[disc jockey]]
* [[Sid Collins]], (55, American broadcaster best known as the radio voice of the [[Indianapolis 500]] on the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network]] from 1952 to 1976.
* [[Bing Crosby]], 74, American singer, actor and early radio personality.
* [[Alan Reed]], 70, an American actor.

The '''Age of Discovery''', or the '''Age of Exploration''' (approximately from the beginning of the [[15th century]] until the end of the [[18th century]]) is an informal and loosely defined term for the [[historical period|period]] in [[Europe]]an  history in which extensive overseas exploration emerged as a powerful factor in [[Culture of Europe|European culture]] and was the beginning of [[globalization]]. It also marks the rise of the period of widespread adoption in Europe of [[colonialism]] and [[mercantilism]] as national policies. Many lands previously unknown to Europeans were discovered by them during this period, though most were already inhabited. From the perspective of many non-Europeans, the Age of Discovery marked the arrival of invaders from previously unknown continents. 
 
Global exploration started with the [[Portuguese discoveries]] of the Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], the coast of Africa, and the [[discovery of the sea route to India]] in 1498; and the [[Crown of Castile]] ([[Spain]]) the trans-Atlantic [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas between 1492 and 1502 and the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1519–1522. These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, and land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Australia that continued into the late [[19th century]], and ended with the exploration of the polar regions in the [[20th century]].

European overseas exploration led to the rise of [[global trade]] and the European [[colonial empire]]s, with the contact between the ''[[Old World]]'' (Europe, Asia and Africa) and the ''[[New World]]'' (the Americas and Australia) producing the [[Columbian Exchange]]; a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including [[Slavery|slaves]]), [[Infectious disease|communicable disease]]s and culture between the [[Eastern Hemisphere|Eastern]] and [[Western Hemisphere|Western]] [[Hemisphere of the Earth|Hemispheres]]. This represented one of the most-significant [[globalization|global]] events concerning ecology, agriculture and culture in history. The Age of Discovery and later [[Major explorations after the Age of Discovery|European exploration]] allowed the global mapping of the world, resulting in a new world-view and distant civilizations coming into contact, but also led to the propagation of diseases that decimated populations not previously in contact with Eurasia and Africa and to the enslavement, exploitation, military conquest and economic dominance by Europe and its colonies over native populations. It also allowed for the expansion of [[Christianity]] throughout the world: with the spread of [[Christian missionary|missionary]] activity, it eventually became the [[Largest religion|world's largest religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC Documentary: A History of Christianity by Diarmaid MacCulloch, Oxford University&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portuguese began systematically exploring the Atlantic coast of Africa from 1418, under the sponsorship of [[Henry the Navigator|Prince Henry]]. Under the direction of [[Henry the Navigator]], the Portuguese developed a new, much lighter ship, the [[caravel]], which could sail further and faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 1488 [[Bartolomeu Dias]] reached the Indian Ocean by this route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/bartolomeudias.html |title=Bartolomeu Dias |website=infoplease |publisher=Sandbox Networks, Inc. |date= |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] funded [[Christopher Columbus]]'s plan to sail west to reach the [[Indies]] by crossing the Atlantic. He landed on a continent uncharted by Europeans and seen as a [[new world]], the Americas. To prevent conflict between Portugal and Castile (the crown under which Columbus made the voyage), the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed dividing the world into two regions of exploration, where each had exclusive rights to claim newly discovered lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h17-am.html|title=Columbus to the Caribbean|author=|date=|work=fsmitha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/exploration/christopher-columbus|title=Christopher Columbus – Exploration |author=|date=|work=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1498, a Portuguese expedition commanded by [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sailing around Africa, opening up direct trade with Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Diffie, Bailey W. and George D. Winius, "Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580", p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; While other exploratory fleets were sent from Portugal to northern North America, in the following years [[Portuguese India Armadas]] also extended this Eastern oceanic route, touching sometimes South America and by this way opening a circuit from the New World to Asia (starting in 1500, under the command of [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]), and explored islands in the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans. Soon, the Portuguese sailed further eastward, to the valuable [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1512, landing in China one year later. In 1513, Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and reached the "other sea" from the New World. Thus, Europe first received news of the eastern and western Pacific within a one-year span around 1512. East and west exploration overlapped in 1522, when a Castilian (Spanish) expedition, led by Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and later by Spanish Basque navigator [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]], sailing westward, completed the first circumnavigation of the world,&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, Stefan, "Conqueror of the Seas – The Story of Magellan", Read Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4067-6006-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Spanish ''[[conquistador]]s'' explored the interior of the Americas, and later, some of the South Pacific islands.

Since 1495, the French and English and, much later, the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] entered the race of exploration after learning of these exploits, defying the Iberian monopoly on maritime trade by searching for new routes, first to the western coasts of North and South America, through the first English and French expeditions (starting with the first expedition of [[John Cabot]] in 1497 to the north, in the service of England, followed by the French expeditions to South America and later to North America), and into the Pacific Ocean around South America, but eventually by following the Portuguese around Africa into the Indian Ocean; discovering Australia in 1606, New Zealand in 1642, and Hawaii in 1778. Meanwhile, from the 1580s to the 1640s, Russians explored and conquered almost the whole of [[Russian conquest of Siberia|Siberia]], and Alaska in the 1730s.

==Background==
{{See also|Early world maps|Chronology of European exploration of Asia}}

===Rise of European trade===
Between the 12th and 15th centuries the European economy was transformed by the interconnecting of river and sea trade routes, causing Europe to become one of the world's most prosperous trading networks.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"&gt;{{cite book
|title=The Sea and Civilization: A Maritime History of the World |last=Paine |first= Lincoln |year= 2013 |publisher =Random House, LLC |location= New York |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345}} 

Before the 12th century the main obstacle to trade east of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] was lack of commercial incentive rather than inadequate ship design.  Economic growth of Spain followed the reconquest of [[Al-Andalus|parts of Muslim Spain]] and the siege of Lisbon (1147 AD). The decline of [[Fatamid|Fatimid Caliphate]] naval strength that started before the [[First Crusade]] helped the maritime Italian states, mainly Venice, Genoa and Pisa, dominate trade in the eastern Mediterranean, with Italian merchants becoming wealthy and politically influential.  The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in the late 11th century allowed for peaceful trade on the North Sea. The [[Hanseatic League]], a confederation of merchant guilds and their towns in northern Germany along the North Sea and Baltic Sea, was instrumental in commercial development of the region.  In the 12th century the region of Flanders, Hainault and Braband produced the finest quality textiles in northern Europe, which encouraged merchants from Genoa and Venice to sail there directly.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|316-38}} Nicolozzo Spinola made the first recorded direct voyage from Genoa to Flanders in 1277.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|328}}

===Technology: ship design and the compass===

Dhows had superior maneuverability and were used in the Indian Ocean before being built in Italy in the 13th century.]]Technological advancements that were important to the Age of Exploration were the adoption of the [[compass|magnetic compass]] and advances in ship design.  

The compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars.  The compass had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century and was adopted by the Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World|last=Merson |first= John|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press|location=Woodstock, New York |isbn= 0-87951-397-7|pages=|postscript = &lt;A companion to the PBS Series "The Genius That Was China"&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|351-2}} The first mention of use of the compass in Europe was in 1180.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|382}}  The Europeans used a "dry" compass, with a needle on a pivot.  The compass card was also a European invention.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Model ship 05.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pintle]]-and-[[gudgeon]] stern-post rudder of the [[Hanseatic league]] flagship ''[[Adler von Lübeck]]'' (1567–1581]] The Chinese also made several important improvements in ship design, such as the sternpost rudder, multiple masts and lateen sails.  These improvements gave greater maneuverability and allowed ships to sail at any time of the year.  These new style ships were produced in Italian states between 1280 and 1330, resulting in a boost in trade and connectivity between northern and southern Europe.&lt;ref name="Merson_1990"/&gt;  [[Cog (ship)|Cogs]] remained popular for trade because of their low cost. [[Galley]]s were also used in trade.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Ships grew in size, required smaller crews and were able to sail longer distances without stopping.  This led to significant lower long distance shipping costs by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

===Geography and maps===
The [[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]], a document dating from 40-60 AD, describes a newly discovered route through the Red Sea to India, with descriptions of the markets in towns around Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, including along the eastern coast of Africa, which states "for beyond these places the unexplored ocean curves around toward the west, and running along by the regions to the south of Aethiopia and Libya and Africa, it mingles with the western sea (possible reference to the Atlantic Ocean)".  European medieval knowledge about Asia beyond the reach of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was sourced in partial reports, often obscured by legends,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; dating back from the time of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] and his successors. 
Another source was the [[Radhanite|Radhanite Jewish trade networks]] of merchants established as go-betweens between Europe and the Muslim world during the time of the [[Crusader states]].

[[File:Ptolemy Cosmographia 1467 - world map.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy's world map]] (2nd century) in a 15th-century reconstruction]]
In 1154, the [[Geography in medieval Islam|Arab geographer]] [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] created a description of the world and a [[world map]], the [[Tabula Rogeriana]], at the court of King [[Roger II of Sicily]],&lt;ref name=houben&gt;Houben, 2002, pp. 102–04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley &amp; Woodward, 1992, pp. 156–61.&lt;/ref&gt; but still Africa was only partially known to either Christians, Genoese and Venetians, or the Arab seamen, and its southern extent unknown. There were reports of great African [[Sahara]], but the factual knowledge was limited for the Europeans to the Mediterranean coasts and little else since the Arab blockade of North Africa precluded exploration inland. Knowledge about the Atlantic African coast was fragmented and derived mainly from [[Early world maps|old]] Greek and Roman maps based on Carthaginian knowledge, including the time of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] exploration of [[Mauritania]]. The [[Red Sea]] was barely known and only trade links with the [[Maritime republics]], the [[Republic of Venice]] especially, fostered collection of accurate maritime knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian Ocean trade routes were sailed by Arab traders. Between 1405 and 1421, the [[Yongle Emperor]] of [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] sponsored a series of long range [[Treasure voyages|tributary missions]] under the command of [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The fleets visited [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] and [[Thailand]]. But the journeys, reported by [[Ma Huan]], a [[Muslim]] voyager and translator, were halted abruptly after the emperor's death&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and were not followed up, as the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade.

By 1400 a Latin translation of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia]]'' reached Italy coming from Constantinople. The rediscovery of Roman geographical knowledge was a revelation,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold 2002|Arnold 2002]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; both for mapmaking and worldview,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Love 2006|Love 2006]], p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; although reinforcing the idea that the Indian Ocean was landlocked.

=== Medieval travel (1241–1438) ===
[[File:Silk route copy.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Silk Road]] and [[spice trade]] routes later blocked by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1453 spurring exploration to find alternative sea routes]]
[[File:Travels of Marco Polo.png|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Marco Polo]] travels (1271–1295)]]

A prelude to the Age of Discovery was a series of European expeditions crossing [[Eurasia]] by land in the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#silk-road 2008|silk-road 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Mongols]] had threatened Europe with pillage and destruction,{{clarify|date=August 2013}} Mongol states also unified much of Eurasia and, from 1206 on, the ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'' allowed safe trade routes and communication lines stretching from the Middle East to China.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A series of Europeans took advantage of these to explore eastwards. Most were Italians, as trade between Europe and the Middle East was controlled mainly by the [[Maritime republics]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The close [[Italian city-states|Italian]] links to the [[Levant]] raised great curiosity and commercial interest in countries which lay further east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City of Fortune|last=Crowley|first=Roger|date=2011|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber|isbn=9780571245956|edition=Main|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}

There are a few accounts of merchants from North Africa and the Mediterranean region who traded in the Indian Ocean in late medieval times.&lt;ref name="Paine_2013"/&gt;

Christian embassies were sent as far as [[Karakorum]] during the [[Mongol invasions of the Levant]], from which they gained a greater understanding of the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} The first of these travellers was [[Giovanni da Pian del Carpine]], dispatched by [[Pope Innocent IV]] to the [[Great Khan]], who journeyed to [[Mongolia]] and back from 1241 to 1247.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; About the same time, Russian prince [[Yaroslav of Vladimir]], and subsequently his sons [[Alexander Nevsky]] and [[Andrey II of Vladimir]], travelled to the Mongolian capital. Though having strong political implications, their journeys left no detailed accounts. Other travellers followed, like French [[André de Longjumeau]] and Flemish [[William of Rubruck]], who reached China through Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marco Polo]], a Venetian merchant, dictated an account of journeys throughout Asia from 1271 to 1295, describing being a guest at the [[Yuan Dynasty]] court of [[Kublai Khan]] in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Travels]]'', and it was read throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1291, in a first Atlantic exploration attempt, merchant brothers [[Vadino and Ugolino Vivaldi]] sailed from Genoa with two galleys but disappeared off the Moroccan coast, feeding the fears of oceanic travel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 2006|Parry 2006]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1325 to 1354, a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] scholar from [[Tangier]], [[Ibn Battuta]], journeyed through North Africa, the Sahara desert, West Africa, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Horn of Africa, the Middle East and Asia, having reached China. After returning, he dictated an account of his journeys to a scholar he met in Granada, the ''[[Rihla]]'' ("The Journey"),&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunn 2004|Dunn 2004]], p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; the unheralded source on his adventures. Between 1357 and 1371 a book of supposed travels compiled by [[John Mandeville]] acquired extraordinary popularity. Despite the unreliable and often fantastical nature of its accounts it was used as a reference&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; for the East, Egypt, and the Levant in general, asserting the old belief that Jerusalem was the [[Axis mundi|centre of the world]].

Following the period of [[Timurid relations with Europe]], in 1439 [[Niccolò de' Conti]] published an account of his travels as a Muslim merchant to India and Southeast Asia and, later in 1466–1472, Russian merchant [[Afanasy Nikitin]] of [[Tver]] travelled to India, which he described in his book ''[[A Journey Beyond the Three Seas]]''.

These overland journeys had little immediate effect. The [[Mongol Empire]] collapsed almost as quickly as it formed and soon the route to the east became more difficult and dangerous. The [[Black Death]] of the 14th century also blocked travel and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] further limited the possibilities of European overland trade.

===Chinese missions (1405–1433)===
{{Further|Treasure voyages|Chinese exploration}}
[[File:Stellardiagram-Zhengho.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|"Mao Kun map", believed to be based on [[Zheng He]]'s travels, showing sailing directions between ports of SE Asia and as far as Malindi, in ''[[Wu Bei Zhi]]'' (1628)]]
The Chinese had wide connections through trade in Asia and had been sailing to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], and [[Egypt]] since the [[Tang Dynasty]] (AD 618–907). Between 1405 and 1421 the third Ming emperor [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] sponsored a series of long range [[tribute|tributary missions]] in the Indian Ocean under the command of admiral [[Zheng He]] (Cheng Ho).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A large fleet of new [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships was prepared for these international diplomatic expeditions. The largest of these junks—that the Chinese termed [[Chinese treasure ship|''bao chuan'' (treasure ships)]]—may have measured 121 metres (400&amp;nbsp;feet) stem to stern, and thousands of sailors were involved. The first expedition departed in 1405. At least seven well-documented expeditions were launched, each bigger and more expensive than the last. The fleets visited [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Malay Archipelago]] and [[Thailand]] (at the time called [[Siam]]), exchanging goods along the way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tamura 1997|Tamura 1997]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented gifts of gold, silver, [[porcelain]] and [[silk]]; in return, received such novelties as [[ostrich]]es, [[zebra]]s, [[camel]]s, [[ivory]] and [[giraffe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cromer 1995|Cromer 1995]], p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tsai 2002|Tsai 2002]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; After the emperor's death, Zheng He led a final expedition departing from Nanking in 1431 and returning to Beijing in 1433. It is very likely that this last expedition reached as far as [[Madagascar]]. The travels were reported by [[Ma Huan]], a Muslim voyager and translator who accompanied Zheng He on three of the seven expeditions, his account published as "Ying-Yai Sheng-Lam" (Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores) (1433).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 2006|Mancall 2006]], p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

These long distance journeys were not followed up, as the Chinese Ming dynasty retreated in the ''[[haijin]]'', a policy of [[isolationism]], having limited maritime trade. Travels were halted abruptly after the emperor's death, as the Chinese lost interest in what they termed barbarian lands turning inward,&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; and successor emperors felt the expeditions were harmful to the Chinese state; [[Hongxi Emperor]] ended further expeditions and [[Xuande Emperor]] suppressed much of the information about Zheng He's voyages.

==Atlantic Ocean (1419–1507)==

[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the Mediterranean and [[Black Sea]]]]

From the 8th century until the 15th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] and neighbouring [[maritime republics]] held the monopoly of European trade with the Middle East.   The [[Silk Road|silk]] and [[spice trade]], involving [[spice]]s, [[incense]], [[herb]]s, [[drug]]s and [[opium]], made these Mediterranean city-states phenomenally rich. Spices were among the most expensive and demanded products of the Middle Ages, as they were used in [[medieval medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;Spice importance for medieval [[humorism]] principles of medicine was such that shortly after entering the trade, apothecaries and physicians like [[Tomé Pires]] and [[Garcia de Orta|Garcia da Orta]] (see [[#Burns 2001|Burns 2001]], p. 14) were sent to India having studied spices in works like ''Suma Oriental'' (see [[#Pires 1512|Pires 1512]], p. lxii) and ''[[Colóquios dos simples e drogas da India]]'' ("Conversations on the simples, drugs and materia medica of India)&lt;/ref&gt; religious [[ritual]]s, [[cosmetics]], [[perfume]]ry, as well as [[food additive]]s and [[Food preservatives|preservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ScienceDaily 1998|ScienceDaily 1998]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They were all imported from Asia and Africa.

Muslim traders—mainly descendants of Arab sailors from [[Yemen]] and [[Oman]]—dominated maritime routes throughout the Indian Ocean, tapping source regions in the Far East and shipping for trading emporiums in India, mainly [[Kozhikode]], westward to [[Ormus]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Jeddah]] in the [[Red Sea]]. From there, overland routes led to the Mediterranean coasts. Venetian merchants distributed the goods through Europe until the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], that eventually led to the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, barring Europeans from important combined-land-sea routes.&lt;ref name=GT-DEX-1453-09&gt;{{cite web|title=

Forced to reduce their activities in the Black Sea, and at war with Venice, the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] had turned to North African trade of wheat, [[olive oil]] (valued also as an energy source) and a search for silver and gold. Europeans had a constant [[Commercial Revolution#Monetary factors|deficit in silver and gold]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], pp. 339–49.&lt;/ref&gt; as coin only went one way: out, spent on eastern trade that was now cut off. Several European mines were exhausted,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spufford 1989|Spufford 1989]], p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of [[bullion]] leading to the development of a complex banking system to manage the risks in trade (the very first state bank, ''[[Bank of Saint George|Banco di San Giorgio]]'', was founded in 1407 at Genoa). Sailing also into the ports of [[Bruges]] (Flanders) and England, Genoese communities were then established in Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Abu-Lughod 1991|Abu-Lughod 1991]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; who profited from their enterprise and financial expertise.

European sailing had been primarily close to land [[cabotage]], guided by [[portolan chart]]s. These charts specified proven ocean routes guided by coastal landmarks: sailors departed from a known point, followed a [[compass]] heading, and tried to identify their location by its landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first oceanic exploration Western Europeans used the [[compass]], as well as progressive new advances in [[cartography]] and [[astronomy]]. Arab navigational tools like the [[astrolabe]] and [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] were used for [[celestial navigation]].

===Portuguese exploration===

In 1297, with the Portuguese part of the [[reconquista]] completed, King [[Dinis of Portugal]] took personal interest in exports and in 1317 he made an agreement with Genoese merchant sailor [[Manuel Pessanha]] (Pesagno), appointing him first [[admiral]] of the [[Portuguese navy]], with the goal of defending the country against Muslim pirate raids.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of [[bubonic plague]] led to severe depopulation in the second half of the 14th century: only the sea offered alternatives, with most population settling in fishing and trading coastal areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1325 and 1357 [[Afonso IV of Portugal]] encouraged maritime commerce and ordered the first explorations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1960|Diffie 1960]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canary Islands]], already known to the Genoese, were claimed as officially discovered under patronage of the Portuguese but in 1344 Castile disputed them, expanding their rivalry into the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Butel 1999|Butel 1999]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure their monopoly on trade, Europeans (beginning with the Portuguese) attempted to install a mediterranean system of trade which used military might and intimidation to divert trade through ports they controlled; there it could be taxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trade and Civilization in the Indian Ocean: An Economic History from the Rise of Islam to 1750|last=Chaudhuri|first=K. N.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1415, [[Ceuta]] was [[Battle of Ceuta|conquered]] by the Portuguese aiming to control navigation of the African coast. Young prince [[Henry the Navigator]] was there and became aware of profit possibilities in the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] routes. For centuries [[Arab slave trade|slave and gold]] trade routes linking West Africa with the Mediterranean passed over the Western Sahara Desert, controlled by the Moors of North Africa.

Henry wished to know how far Muslim territories in Africa extended, hoping to bypass them and trade directly with West Africa by sea, find allies in legendary Christian lands to the south&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; like the long-lost Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and to probe whether it was possible to reach the [[Indies]] by sea, the source of the lucrative [[spice trade]]. He invested in sponsoring voyages down the coast of [[Mauritania]], gathering a group of merchants, shipowners and stakeholders interested in new sea lanes. Soon the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] (1419) and the [[Azores]] (1427) were reached. In particular, they were discovered by voyages launched by the command of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. The expedition leader himself, who established settlements on the island of Madeira, was [[João Gonçalves Zarco]].&lt;ref&gt;Joaquinn Pedro Oliveira Martins, The Golden Age Of Prince Henry The Navigator. (New York: Dutton), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, Europeans did not know what lay beyond [[Cape Non]] (Cape Chaunar) on the African coast, and whether it was possible to return once it was crossed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Locke 1824|Locke 1824]], p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; Nautical myths warned of oceanic monsters or an edge of the world, but Prince Henry's navigation challenged such beliefs: starting in 1421, systematic sailing overcame it, reaching the difficult [[Cape Bojador]] that in 1434 one of Prince Henry's captains, [[Gil Eanes]], finally passed.

A major advance was the introduction of the [[caravel]] in the mid-15th century, a small ship able to sail [[Windward and leeward|windward]] more than any other in Europe at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Evolved from fishing ships designs, they were the first that could leave the coastal [[cabotage]] navigation and sail safely on the open Atlantic. For [[celestial navigation]] the Portuguese used the [[Ephemerides]], which experienced a remarkable diffusion in the 15th century. These were astronomical charts plotting the location of the stars over a distinct period of time. Published in 1496 by the Jewish astronomer, astrologer, and mathematician [[Abraham Zacuto]], the [[Almanach Perpetuum]] included some of these tables for the movements of stars.&lt;ref&gt;Nissan Mindel, Rabbi Abraham Zacuto – (1450–1515), http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/111917/jewish/Rabbi-Abraham-Zacuto.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These tables revolutionized navigation, allowing the calculation of [[latitude]]. Exact [[longitude]], however, remained elusive, and mariners struggled to determine it for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parry 1981|Parry 1981]], p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 132–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Using the caravel, systematic exploration continued ever more southerly, advancing on average one degree a year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Russell-Wood 1998|Russell-Wood 1998]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Senegal]] and [[Cap-Vert|Cape Verde Peninsula]] were reached in 1445 and in 1446, [[Álvaro Fernandes]] pushed on almost as far as present-day [[Sierra Leone]].

In 1453 the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the hands of the [[Ottomans]] was a blow to Christendom and the established business relations linking with the east. In 1455 [[Pope Nicholas V]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanus Pontifex]]'' reinforcing the previous ''[[Dum Diversas]]'' (1452), granting all lands and seas discovered beyond Cape Bojador to King [[Afonso V of Portugal]] and his successors, as well as trade and conquest against Muslims and pagans, initiating a ''[[mare clausum]]'' policy in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Daus 1983|Daus 1983]], p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, who had been inquiring of Genoese experts about a seaway to India, commissioned the [[Fra Mauro map|Fra Mauro world map]], which arrived in Lisbon in 1459.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bagrow 1964|Bagrow 1964]], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1456 [[Diogo Gomes]] reached the [[Cape Verde]] archipelago. In the next decade several captains at the service of Prince Henry – including the Genoese [[Antonio da Noli]] and Venetian [[Alvise Cadamosto]] – discovered the remaining islands which were occupied during the 15th century. The Gulf of Guinea would be reached in the 1460s.

==== Portuguese exploration after Prince Henry ====
In 1460 [[Pedro de Sintra]] reached Sierra Leone. Prince Henry died in November that year after which, given the meagre revenues, exploration was granted to Lisbon merchant [[Fernão Gomes]] in 1469, who in exchange for the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea had to explore {{convert|100|mi|0|abbr=off}} each year for five years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 145–48.&lt;/ref&gt; With his sponsorship, explorers [[João de Santarém]], [[Pedro Escobar]], Lopo Gonçalves, [[Fernão do Pó]], and Pedro de Sintra made it even beyond those goals. They reached the Southern Hemisphere and the islands of the Gulf of Guinea, including [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] and [[Elmina]] on the Gold Coast in 1471. (In the Southern Hemisphere, they used the [[Southern Cross]] as the reference for celestial navigation.) There, in what came to be called the "Gold Coast" in what is today [[Ghana]], a thriving alluvial gold trade was found among the natives and Arab and [[Berbers|Berber]] traders.

In 1478 (during the War of the Castilian Succession), near the coast at Elmina was fought a large battle between a Castilian armada of 35 caravels and a Portuguese fleet for hegemony of the Guinea trade (gold, slaves, ivory and melegueta pepper). The war ended with a Portuguese naval victory followed by the official recognition by the Catholic Monarchs of Portuguese sovereignty over most of the disputed West African territories embodied in the Treaty of Alcáçovas, 1479. (See entry on Elmina.) This was the first colonial war among European powers.

In 1481 the recently crowned [[John II of Portugal|João II]] decided to build [[Elmina Castle|São Jorge da Mina]] [[factory (trading post)|factory]]. In 1482 the [[Congo River]] was explored by [[Diogo Cão]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; who in 1486 continued to [[Cape Cross]] (modern [[Namibia]]).

The next crucial breakthrough was in 1488, when [[Bartolomeu Dias]] rounded the southern tip of Africa, which he named "Cape of Storms" (Cabo das Tormentas), anchoring at [[Mossel Bay]] and then sailing east as far as the mouth of the [[Great Fish River]], proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible from the Atlantic. Simultaneously [[Pêro da Covilhã]], sent out travelling secretly overland, had reached [[Ethiopia]] having collected important information about the Red Sea and Quenia coast, suggesting that a sea route to the Indies would soon be forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Anderson 2000|Anderson 2000]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the cape was renamed by king [[John II of Portugal]] the "[[Cape of Good Hope]]" (Cabo da Boa Esperança), because of the great optimism engendered by the possibility of a sea route to India, proving false the view that had existed since [[Ptolemy]] that the Indian Ocean was [[Landlocked country|land-locked]].

Based on much later stories of the [[phantom island]] known as [[Bacalao]] and the carvings on [[Dighton Rock]] some have speculated that Portuguese explorer [[João Vaz Corte-Real]] discovered [[Newfoundland]] in 1473, but the sources cited are considered by mainstream historians to be unreliable and unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lusa|title=Portugueses chegaram à América 19 anos antes de Colombo|url=https://expresso.sapo.pt/cultura/2016-02-27-Portugueses-chegaram-a-America-19-anos-antes-de-Colombo|publisher=Expresso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portugal's neighbouring fellow Iberian rival, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], had begun to establish its rule over the [[Canary Islands]], located off the west African coast, in 1402, but then became distracted by internal Iberian politics and the repelling of Islamic invasion attempts and raids through most of the 15th century. Only late in the century, following the unification of the crowns of Castile and Aragon and the completion of the ''[[reconquista]]'', did an emerging modern Spain become fully committed to the search for new trade routes overseas. The [[Crown of Aragon]] had been an important maritime potentate in the Mediterranean, controlling territories in eastern Spain, southwestern France, major islands like [[Sicily]], [[Malta]], and the [[Kingdom of Naples]] and [[Sardinia]], with mainland possessions as far as Greece. In 1492 the [[Catholic Monarchs|joint rulers]] conquered the [[Emirate of Granada|Moorish kingdom of Granada]], which had been providing Castile with African goods through tribute, and decided to fund [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition in the hope of bypassing Portugal's monopoly on west African sea routes, to reach "the Indies" (east and south Asia) by travelling west.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Twice before, in 1485 and 1488, Columbus had presented the project to king [[John II of Portugal]], who rejected it.

On the evening of 3 August 1492, Columbus departed from [[Palos de la Frontera]] with three ships; one larger [[carrack]], ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', nicknamed ''Gallega'' (''the Galician''), and two smaller [[caravel]]s, ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (''the Painted'') and ''Santa Clara'', nicknamed ''[[Niña]]''. Columbus first sailed to the Canary Islands, where he restocked for what turned out to be a five-week voyage across the ocean, crossing a section of the Atlantic that became known as the [[Sargasso Sea]].

Land was sighted on 12 October 1492, and Columbus called the island (now [[The Bahamas]]) ''San Salvador'', in what he thought to be the "[[Caribbean|West Indies]]". Columbus also explored the northeast coast of [[Cuba]] (landed on 28 October) and the northern coast of [[Hispaniola]], by 5 December. He was received by the native [[cacique]] [[Guacanagaríx|Guacanagari]], who gave him permission to leave some of his men behind.
[[File:TresCarabelas.jpg|thumb|left|Replicas of ''[[Niña]]'', ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' and ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'' at [[Palos de la Frontera]], Spain]] Columbus left 39 men and founded the settlement of ''[[La Navidad]]'' in what is now [[Haiti]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Maclean 2008|Maclean 2008]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Before returning to Spain, he kidnapped some ten to twenty-five natives and took them back with him. Only seven or eight of the native 'Indians' arrived in Spain alive, but they made quite an impression on Seville.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Forbes 1993|Forbes 1993]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;
On the return, a storm forced him to dock in [[Lisbon]], on 4 March 1493. After a week in Portugal, he set sail for Spain and on 15 March 1493 arrived in [[Barcelona]], where he reported to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. Word of his discovery of new lands [[Columbus's Letter on the First Voyage|rapidly spread throughout Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mancall 1999|Mancall 1999]], p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Columbus and other Spanish explorers were initially disappointed with their discoveries—unlike Africa or Asia, the Caribbean islanders had little to trade with the Castilian ships. The islands thus became the focus of colonization efforts. It was not until the continent itself was explored that Spain found the wealth it had sought.

===Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)===
{{Main|Treaty of Tordesillas}}
[[File:Spain and Portugal.png|upright=0.9|thumb|The 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesilhas Treaty]] meridian (purple) and the later [[Maluku Islands]] [[180th meridian|antimeridian]] (green), set at the [[Treaty of Zaragoza (1529)]]]]

Shortly after Columbus's return from what would later be called the "West Indies", a division of influence became necessary to avoid conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 May 1493, two months after Columbus's arrival, the [[Catholic Monarchs]] received a [[Papal bull|bull]] (''[[Inter caetera]]'') from [[Pope Alexander VI]] stating that all lands west and south of a pole-to-pole line 100 leagues west and south of the [[Azores]] or the Cape Verde Islands should belong to Castile and, later, all mainlands and islands then belonging to India. It did not mention Portugal, which could not claim newly discovered lands east of the line.

King [[John II of Portugal]] was not pleased with the arrangement, feeling that it gave him far too little land—preventing him from reaching India, his main goal. He then negotiated directly with King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] of Spain to move the line west, and allowing him to claim newly discovered lands east of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davenport 1917|Davenport 1917]], pp. 107–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement was reached in 1494, with the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] that divided the world between the two powers. In this treaty the Portuguese received everything outside Europe east of a line that ran 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde]] islands (already Portuguese), and the islands discovered by [[Christopher Columbus]] on his first voyage (claimed for Castile), named in the treaty as [[Names of Japan#Jipangu|Cipangu]] and [[Antilia]] ([[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]). This gave them control over Africa, Asia and eastern South America (Brazil). The Spanish (Castile) received everything west of this line.  At the time of negotiation, the treaty split the known world of Atlantic islands roughly in half, with the dividing line about halfway between Portuguese Cape Verde and the Spanish discoveries in the Caribbean.

[[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] encountered in 1500 what is now known as the Brazilian coast, originally thought to be a large island.  Since it was east of the dividing line, he claimed it for Portugal and this was respected by the Spanish.  Portuguese ships sailed west into the Atlantic to get favourable winds for the journey to India, and this is where Cabral was headed on his journey, in a corridor the treaty was negotiated to protect.  Some suspect the Portuguese had secretly discovered Brazil earlier, and this is why they had the line moved eastward and how Cabral found it, but there is no reliable evidence of this.  Others suspect [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] secretly discovered Brazil in 1498, but this not considered credible by mainstream historians.

Later the Spanish territory would prove to include huge areas of the continental mainland of North and South America, though Portuguese-controlled Brazil would expand across the line, and settlements by other European powers ignored the treaty.

===A New World: Americas===
[[File:Waldseemuller map closeup with America.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of 1507 [[Waldseemüller map]] showing the name "America" for the first time.]]
Very little of the divided area had actually been seen by Europeans, as it was only divided by a geographical definition rather than control on the ground. Columbus's first voyage in 1492 spurred maritime exploration and, from 1497, a number of explorers headed west.

====North America====
That year [[John Cabot]], also a commissioned Italian, got [[letters patent]] from King [[Henry VII of England]]. Sailing from [[Bristol]], probably backed by the local [[Society of Merchant Venturers]], Cabot crossed the Atlantic from a northerly latitude hoping the voyage to the "West Indies" would be shorter&lt;ref&gt;[[#Croxton 2007|Croxton 2007]], web (on subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; and made a landfall somewhere in North America, possibly [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].
In 1499 [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] was licensed by the King of Portugal and together with [[Pêro de Barcelos]] they first sighted [[Labrador]], which was granted and named after him. After returning he possibly went to Bristol to sail in the name of England.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 463–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers [[Gaspar Corte-Real|Gaspar]] and [[Miguel Corte-Real|Miguel Corte Real]] explored and named the coasts of [[Greenland]] and also Newfoundland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 464–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Both explorations are noted in the 1502 [[Cantino planisphere]].

====The "True Indies" and Brazil====
In 1497, newly crowned King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] sent an exploratory fleet eastwards, fulfilling his predecessor's project of finding a route to the Indies. In July 1499 news spread that the Portuguese had reached the "true indies", as a letter was dispatched by the Portuguese king to the Spanish Catholic Monarchs one day after the celebrated return of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third expedition by Columbus in 1498 was the beginning of the first successful Castilian (Spanish) colonization in the [[West Indies]], on the island of Hispaniola. Despite growing doubts, Columbus refused to accept that he had not reached the Indies. During the voyage he discovered the mouth of the [[Orinoco River]] on the north coast of South America (now Venezuela) and thought that the huge quantity of fresh water coming from it could only be from a continental land mass, which he was certain was the Asian mainland.

As shipping between [[Seville]] and the West Indies grew, knowledge of the Caribbean islands, Central America and the northern coast of South America grew.
One of these Spanish fleets, that of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1499–1500, reached land at the coast of what is now [[Guyana]], when the two explorers seem to have separated in opposite directions. Vespucci sailed southward, discovering the mouth of the [[Amazon River]] in July 1499,&lt;ref name=Pohl1966&gt;{{cite book

In the beginning of 1500 [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzon]] was blown off course by a storm and reached what is now the north east coast of Brazil on 26 January 1500, exploring as far south as the present-day state of [[Pernambuco]]. His fleet was the first to fully enter the Amazon River estuary which he named ''Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce'' (''Saint Mary's River of the Freshwater Sea'').&lt;ref name=Morison1974&gt;{{cite book

The 1515–16 expedition was spurred on by reports of Portuguese exploration of the region (see below). It ended when de Solís and some of his crew disappeared when exploring a [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] river in a boat, but what it found re-ignited Spanish interest, and colonization began in 1531.

In April 1500, the [[2nd Portuguese India Armada (Cabral, 1500)|second Portuguese India Armada]], headed by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], with a crew of expert captains, including Bartolomeu Dias and [[Nicolau Coelho]], encountered the Brazilian coast as it swung westward in the Atlantic while performing a large "[[volta do mar]]" to avoid becalming in the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. On 21 April 1500 a mountain was seen and was named ''[[Monte Pascoal]]'', and on 22 April Cabral landed on the coast. On 25 April the entire fleet sailed into the harbour they named ''[[Porto Seguro]]'' (Port Secure). Cabral perceived that the new land lay east of the line of Tordesillas, and sent an envoy to Portugal with the discovery in letters, including the [[carta de Pêro Vaz de Caminha|letter]] of [[Pero Vaz de Caminha]]. Believing the land to be an island, he named it [[Ilha de Vera Cruz]] (Island of the True Cross).&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have suggested that the Portuguese may have encountered the South American bulge earlier while sailing the "volta do mar", hence the insistence of John II in moving the line west of Tordesillas in 1494—so his landing in Brazil may not have been an accident; although John's motivation may have simply been to increase the chance of claiming new lands in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crow 1992|Crow 1992]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; From the east coast, the fleet then turned eastward to resume the journey to the southern tip of Africa and India. Cabral was the first captain to touch four continents, leading the first expedition that connected and united Europe, Africa, the New World, and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hBTqPX4G9Y4C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=Cabral+four+continents&amp;hl=pt-PT&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zPIIU8HvE-af7AakkYDICw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cabral%20four%20continents&amp;f=false ''Foundations of the Portuguese Empire, 1415–1580''], Bailey Wallys Diffie and George D.

At the invitation of King Manuel I of Portugal, Amerigo Vespucci&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 456–62.&lt;/ref&gt;—a Florentine who had been working for a branch of the [[Medici Bank]] in [[Seville]] since 1491, fitting oceanic expeditions and travelling twice to [[The Guianas]] with [[Juan de la Cosa]] in the service of Spain&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2|Catholic Encyclopædia 2]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—participated as observer in these exploratory voyages to the east coast of South America. The expeditions became widely known in Europe after two accounts attributed to him, published between 1502 and 1504, suggested that the newly discovered lands were not the Indies but a "[[New World]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arciniegas 1978|Arciniegas 1978]], pp. 295–300.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Mundus novus'', Latin title of a contemporary document based on Vespucci letters to [[Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici]], which had become widely popular in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon understood that Columbus had not reached Asia but had found a new continent, the Americas. [[America (name)|The Americas were named]] in 1507 by [[Cartography|cartographer]]s [[Waldseemüller map|Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]], probably after Amerigo Vespucci.

In 1501–1502, one of these Portuguese expeditions, led by [[Gonçalo Coelho]] (and/or [[André Gonçalves (explorer)|André Gonçalves]] or [[Gaspar de Lemos]]), sailed south along the coast of South America to the bay of present-day [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Amerigo Vespucci's account states that the expedition reached the latitude "South Pole elevation 52° S", in the "cold" latitudes of what is now southern [[Patagonia]] (possibly near the Strait), before turning back. Vespucci wrote that they headed toward the southwest and south, following "a long, unbending coastline" (apparently coincident with the southern South American coast). This seems controversial, since he changed part of his description in the subsequent letter, stating a shift, from about 32° S (Southern Brazil), to south-southeast, to open sea; maintaining, however, that they reached 50°/52° S (if it was by his own decision or by D. Manuel's censors who had to pressure him to alter his account, because he had revealed far too much to Lorenzo de' Medici and into the public domain, is unknown).&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaadocs.mfah.org/icaadocs/THEARCHIVE/FullRecord/tabid/88/doc/839287/language/en-US/Default.aspx The Invention of America].

In 1503, [[Binot Paulmier de Gonneville]], challenging the Portuguese policy of ''[[mare clausum]]'', led one of the earliest [[French people|French]] [[Normandy|Normand]] and [[Brittany|Breton]] expeditions to Brazil. He intended to sail to the East Indies, but near the Cape of Good Hope his ship was diverted to west by a storm, and landed in the present day state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] (southern Brazil), on 5 January 1504.

In 1511–1512, Portuguese captains [[João de Lisboa]] and Estevão de Fróis reached the [[Rio de La Plata|River Plate]] estuary in present-day [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]], and went as far south as the present-day [[Gulf of San Matias]] at 42°S (recorded in the ''Newen Zeytung auss Pressilandt'' meaning "New Tidings from the Land of Brazil").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

After they had navigated for nearly {{convert|300|km|0|abbr=on}} to round the cape, they again sighted the continent on the other side, and steered towards the northwest, but a storm prevented them from making any headway.

In 1519, an expedition sent by the Spanish Crown to find a way to Asia was led by the experienced Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]]. The fleet explored the rivers and bays as it charted the South American coast until it found a way to the Pacific Ocean through the [[Strait of Magellan]].

In 1524–1525, [[Aleixo Garcia]], a Portuguese conquistador (possibly a veteran of the Solís expedition of 1516), led a private expedition of a few shipwrecked Castilian and Portuguese adventurers, that recruited about 2000 [[Guaraní people|Guaraní Indians]]. They explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], using the native trail network, the ''Peabiru''. They were also the first Europeans to cross the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reach the outer territories of the Inca Empire on the hills of the [[Andes]], near [[Sucre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novomilenio.inf.br/sv/svh009b.htm ''Peabiru, the route lost''] in English&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gama's route to India===

{{see also|Portuguese India Armadas}}

[[File:Caminho maritimo para a India.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Vasco da Gama]]'s 1497–1499 travel to India (black). Previous travels of [[Pêro da Covilhã]] (orange) and [[Afonso de Paiva]] (blue), and their common route (green)]]

Protected from direct Spanish competition by the treaty of Tordesillas, Portuguese eastward exploration and colonization continued apace. Twice, in 1485 and 1488, Portugal officially rejected [[Christopher Columbus]]'s idea of reaching India by sailing westwards. King [[John II of Portugal]]'s experts rejected it, for they held the opinion that Columbus's estimation of a travel distance of {{convert|2400|mi|km|-1}} was undervalued,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Morison 1942|Morison 1942]], pp. 65–75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in part because [[Bartolomeu Dias]] departed in 1487 trying the rounding of the southern tip of Africa, therefore they believed that sailing east would require a far shorter journey. Dias's return from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1488, and [[Pêro da Covilhã]]'s travel to [[Ethiopia]] overland indicated that the richness of the [[Indian Ocean|Indian Sea]] was accessible from the Atlantic. A long-overdue expedition was prepared.

Under new king [[Manuel I of Portugal]], on July 1497 a small exploratory fleet of four ships and about 170 men left [[Lisbon]] under the command of [[Vasco da Gama]]. By December the fleet passed the [[Great Fish River]]—where Dias had turned back—and sailed into unknown waters. On 20 May 1498, they arrived at [[Kozhikode|Calicut]]. The efforts of Vasco da Gama to get favourable trading conditions were hampered by the low value of their goods, compared with the valuable goods traded there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World|last=Bernstein|first=William J.|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=9780802144164|date=2008|location=New York|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Two years and two days after departure, Gama and a survivor crew of 55 men returned in glory to Portugal as the first ships to sail directly from Europe to India.

In 1500, a second, larger fleet of thirteen ships and about 1500 men were sent to India. Under command of [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] they made a first landfall on the Brazilian coast; later, in the Indian Ocean, one of Cabral's ships reached [[Madagascar]] (1501), which was partly explored by [[Tristão da Cunha]] in 1507; [[Mauritius]] was discovered in 1507, [[Socotra]] occupied in 1506. In the same year [[Lourenço de Almeida]] landed in [[Sri Lanka]], the eastern island named "[[Names of Sri Lanka|Taprobane]]" in remote accounts of [[Alexander the Great]]'s and 4th-century BC Greek [[geographer]] [[Megasthenes]]. On the Asiatic mainland the first [[factory (trading post)|factories (trading-posts)]] were established at Kochi and Calicut (1501) and then [[Old Goa|Goa]] (1510).

===The "Spice Islands" and China===
[[File:Malaccaship.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Replica of ''[[Flor de la Mar]]'' [[carrack]] housing the Maritime Museum of [[Malacca]]]]

In 1511, [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]] for Portugal, then the centre of Asian trade. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent several diplomatic missions: [[Duarte Fernandes]] as the first European envoy to the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] (modern [[Thailand]]).

Getting to know the secret location of the so-called "spice islands"—the [[Maluku Islands]], mainly the [[Banda Islands|Banda]], then the single world source of [[nutmeg]] and [[clove]]s, was the main purpose for the travels in the Indian sea—he sent an expedition led by [[António de Abreu]] to Banda (via [[Java]] and the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]), where they were the first Europeans to arrive in early 1512, after taking a route through which they also reached first the islands of [[Buru]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Milton 1999|Milton 1999]], pp. 5–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Armando|last=Cortesão|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h82D-Y0E3TwC&amp;lpg=PR81&amp;dq=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;pg=PR81#v=onepage&amp;q=Simao%20Afonso%20Bisagudo&amp;f=false|title=The Suma Oriental of Tomé Pires: an account of the east, from the Red Sea to Japan, written in Malacca and India in 1512–1515/The Book of Francisco Rodrigues rutter of a voyage in the Red Sea, nautical rules, almanack and maps, written and drawn in the east before 1515|publisher=The [[Hakluyt Society]]|year=1944|accessdate=2016-02-10|isbn=9788120605350}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Banda Abreu returned to Malacca, while his vice-captain [[Francisco Serrão]], after a separation forced by a shipwreck and heading north, reached once again Ambon and sank off [[Ternate]], where he obtained a license to build a Portuguese fortress-factory: the Fort of São João Baptista de Ternate, which founded the Portuguese presence in the [[Malay Archipelago]].

In May 1513 [[Jorge Álvares]], one of the Portuguese envoys, reached China. Although he was the first to land on [[Nei Lingding Island|Lintin Island]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]], it was [[Rafael Perestrello]]—a cousin of the famed [[Christopher Columbus]]—who became the first European explorer to land on the southern coast of mainland China and trade in [[Guangzhou]] in 1516, commanding a [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] vessel with a crew from a Malaysian junk that had sailed from [[Malacca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pfoundes 1882|Pfoundes 1882]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nowell 1947|Nowell 1947]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fernão Pires de Andrade]] visited Canton in 1517 and opened up trade with China. The Portuguese were defeated by the Chinese in 1521 at the [[Battle of Tunmen]] and in 1522 at the [[Battle of Xicaowan]], during which the Chinese captured Portuguese [[breech-loading swivel gun]]s and reverse engineered the technology, calling them "Folangji" 佛郎機 ([[Farangi|Frankish]]) guns, since the Portuguese were called "Folangji" by the Chinese. After a few decades, hostilities between the Portuguese and Chinese ceased and in 1557 the Chinese allowed the Portuguese to occupy [[Macau]].

To enforce a trade monopoly, [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]], and [[Strait of Hormuz|Hormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]], were seized by [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1507 and in 1515, respectively. He also entered into [[Diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] with [[Iran|Persia]]. In 1513 while trying to conquer [[Aden]], an expedition led by Albuquerque cruised the [[Red Sea]] inside the [[Bab al-Mandab]], and sheltered at [[Kamaran]] island. In 1521, a force under [[António Correia (admiral)|António Correia]] conquered [[Bahrain]], ushering in a period of almost eighty years of Portuguese rule of the Gulf archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cole 2002|Cole 2002]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Red Sea, [[Massawa]] was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under [[Estêvão da Gama (16th century)|Estevão da Gama]] penetrated as far as [[Suez]].

==Pacific Ocean (1513–1529)==
[[File:Balboa Voyage 1513.PNG|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]]'s travel to the "[[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]", 1513]]

===Discovery of the Pacific Ocean===
In 1513, about {{convert|40|mi|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Acandí]], in present-day [[Colombia]], Spanish [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] heard unexpected news of an "other sea" rich in gold, which he received with great interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Otfinoski 2004|Otfinoski 2004]], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; With few resources and using information given by ''[[cacique]]s'', he journeyed across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] with 190 Spaniards, a few native guides, and a pack of dogs.

Using a small [[brigantine]] and ten native [[canoe]]s, they sailed along the coast and made landfalls. On September 6, the expedition was reinforced with 1,000 men, fought several battles, entered a dense jungle and climbed the mountain range along the [[Chucunaque River]] from where this "other sea" could be seen. Balboa went ahead and, before noon September 25, he saw in the horizon an undiscovered sea, becoming the first European to have seen or reached the Pacific from the New World. The expedition descended towards the shore for a short reconnaissance trip, thus becoming the first Europeans to navigate the Pacific Ocean off the coast of the New World. After travelling more than {{convert|110|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, Balboa named the bay where they ended up [[Bay of San Miguel|''San Miguel'']]. He named the new sea [[Pacific Ocean|''Mar del Sur'' (South Sea)]], since they had travelled south to reach it. Balboa's main purpose in the expedition was the search for gold-rich kingdoms. To this end, he crossed through the lands of ''caciques'' to the islands, naming the largest one ''Isla Rica'' (Rich Island, today known as [[Isla del Rey (Panama)|Isla del Rey]]). He named the entire group ''[[Pearl Islands|Archipiélago de las Perlas]]'', which they still keep today.

===Subsequent developments to the east===
In 1515–1516, the Spanish fleet led by [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] sailed down the east coast of South America as far as [[Río de la Plata]], which Solís named shortly before he died, while trying to find a passage to the "South Sea".

At the same time, the Portuguese in Southeast Asia made the [[First Europeans in the Philippines|first European report on the western Pacific]], having identified [[Luzon]] east of [[Borneo]] and named its inhabitants the "[[Luções]]", in the modern [[Philippines]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 626&lt;/ref&gt;

===First circumnavigation===
[[File:Magellan's voyage EN.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Route of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]-[[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]] world circumnavigation (1519–1522)]]

By 1516 several Portuguese navigators, conflicting with King Manuel I of Portugal, had gathered in [[Seville]] to serve the newly crowned [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]. Among them were explorers Diogo and [[Duarte Barbosa]], [[Estêvão Gomes]], [[João Serrão]] and [[Ferdinand Magellan]], cartographers [[Jorge Reinel]] and [[Diogo Ribeiro]], cosmographers Francisco and [[Rui Faleiro|Ruy Faleiro]] and the Flemish merchant [[Christopher de Haro]]. Ferdinand Magellan—who had sailed in India for Portugal up to 1513, when the [[Maluku Islands]] were reached, kept contact with [[Francisco Serrão]] living there&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zweig 1938|Zweig 1938]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Donkin 2003|Donkin 2003]], p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;—developed the theory that the islands were in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] Spanish area, supported on studies by Faleiro brothers.

Aware of the efforts of the Spanish to find a route to India by sailing west, Magellan presented his plan to Charles I of Spain. The king and Christopher de Haro financed Magellan's expedition. A fleet was put together, and Spanish navigators such as [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] joined the enterprise. On August 10, 1519, they departed from Seville with a fleet of five ships—the [[flagship]] ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'' under Magellan's command, ''San Antonio'', ''Concepcion'', ''Santiago'' and ''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the first being a [[caravel]], and all others rated as [[carrack]]s or "naus"—with a crew of about 237 men from several nations, with the goal of reaching the Maluku Islands by travelling west, trying to reclaim it under Spain's economic and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[#DeLamar 1992|DeLamar 1992]], p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Detail from a map of Ortelius - Magellan's ship Victoria.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|''[[Victoria (ship)|Victoria]]'', the single ship to have completed the first world [[circumnavigation]]. (Detail from ''[[Maris Pacifici]]'' by [[Ortelius]], 1589.)]]

The fleet sailed further and further south, avoiding the Portuguese territories in Brazil, and became the first to reach [[Tierra del Fuego]] at the tip of the Americas. On October 21, starting in [[Cape Virgenes]], they began an arduous trip through a 373-mile (600&amp;nbsp;km) long strait that Magellan named ''Estrecho de Todos los Santos'', the modern [[Strait of Magellan]]. On November 28, three ships entered the Pacific Ocean—then named ''Mar Pacífico'' because of its apparent stillness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Catholic Encyclopædia 2007|Catholic Encyclopædia 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition managed to cross the Pacific. Magellan died in the [[battle of Mactan]] in the [[Philippines]], leaving the Spaniard [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] the task of completing the voyage, reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] in 1521. On September 6, 1522 ''Victoria'' returned to Spain, thus completing the first [[circumnavigation]] of the globe. Of the men who set out on five ships, only 18 completed the circumnavigation and managed to return to Spain in this single vessel led by Elcano. Seventeen others arrived later in Spain: twelve captured by the Portuguese in Cape Verde some weeks earlier, and between 1525 and 1527, and five survivors of the ''Trinidad''. [[Antonio Pigafetta]], a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] scholar and traveller who had asked to be on board and become a strict assistant of Magellan, kept an accurate journal that become the main source for much of what we know about this voyage.

This round-the-world voyage gave Spain valuable knowledge of the world and its oceans which later helped in the exploration and settlement of the [[Philippines]]. Although this was not a realistic alternative to the Portuguese route around Africa&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[Strait of Magellan]] was too far south, and the Pacific Ocean too vast to cover in a single trip from Spain) successive Spanish expeditions used this information to explore the Pacific Ocean and discovered routes that [[Manila galleon|opened up trade]] between [[Acapulco]], [[New Spain]] (present-day [[Mexico]]) and [[Manila]] in the Philippines.

===Westward and eastward exploration meet===
[[File:Pulau Maitara and Pulau Tidore from the Floridas Restaurant in Pulau Ternate (Ternate Island), The Moluccas (Maluku) (15182126636).jpg|thumb|View from [[Ternate]] to [[Tidore]] islands in the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]], where Portuguese Eastward and Spanish Westward explorations ultimately met and clashed between 1522 and 1529&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[[#Newitt 2005|Newitt 2005]], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Saavedra-1527-1529.svg|thumb|Saavedra's failed attempts to find a return route from the Maluku to New Spain (Mexico) in 1529]]
Soon after Magellan's expedition, the Portuguese rushed to seize the surviving crew and built a fort in [[Ternate]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 1525, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] sent another expedition westward to colonize the [[Maluku Islands]], claiming that they were in his zone of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. The fleet of seven ships and 450 men was led by [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] and included the most notable Spanish navigators: [[Juan Sebastián Elcano]] and Loaísa, who lost their lives then, and the young [[Andrés de Urdaneta]].

Near the [[Strait of Magellan]] one of the ships was pushed south by a storm, reaching 56° S, where they thought seeing "''earth's end''": so [[Cape Horn]] was crossed for the first time. The expedition reached the islands with great difficulty, docking at [[Tidore]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The conflict with the Portuguese established in nearby Ternate was inevitable, starting nearly a decade of skirmishes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lach 1998|Lach 1998]], p. 1397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt;

As there was not a set eastern limit to the Tordesillas line, both kingdoms organized meetings to resolve the issue. From 1524 to 1529 Portuguese and Spanish experts met at Badajoz-Elvas trying to find the exact location of the [[antimeridian]] of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. Each crown appointed three [[astronomy|astronomers]] and [[cartography|cartographers]], three [[navigation|pilots]] and three mathematicians. [[Lopo Homem]], Portuguese cartographer and cosmographer was in the board, along with cartographer [[Diogo Ribeiro]] on the Spanish delegation. The board met several times, without reaching an agreement: the knowledge at that time was insufficient for an [[History of longitude|accurate calculation of longitude]], and each group gave the islands to its sovereign. The issue was settled only in 1529, after a long negotiation, with the signing of [[Treaty of Zaragoza]], that attributed the Maluku Islands to Portugal and the [[Philippines]] to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Diffie 1977|Diffie 1977]], pp. 368, 473.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1525 and 1528 Portugal sent several expeditions around the Maluku Islands. [[Gomes de Sequeira]] and Diogo da Rocha were sent north by the governor of Ternate [[Jorge de Menezes]], being the first Europeans to reach the [[Caroline Islands]], which they named "Islands de Sequeira".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Galvano 1563|Galvano 1563]], p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; In 1526, Jorge de Meneses docked on [[Biak]] and [[Waigeo]] islands, Papua New Guinea. Based on these explorations stands the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]], one among several competing theories about the early discovery of Australia, supported by Australian historian [[Kenneth McIntyre]], stating it was discovered by [[Cristóvão de Mendonça]] and Gomes de Sequeira.

In 1527 [[Hernán Cortés]] fitted out a fleet to find new lands in the "South Sea" (Pacific Ocean), asking his cousin [[Álvaro de Saavedra Cerón]] to take charge. On October 31 of 1527 Saavedra sailed from [[New Spain]], crossing the Pacific and touring the north of [[New Guinea]], then named ''Isla de Oro''. In October 1528 one of the vessels reached the Maluku Islands. In his attempt to return to New Spain he was diverted by the northeast [[trade wind]]s, which threw him back, so he tried sailing back down, to the south. He returned to New Guinea and sailed northeast, where he sighted the [[Marshall Islands]] and the [[Admiralty Islands]], but again was surprised by the winds, which brought him a third time to the Moluccas. This westbound return route was hard to find, but was eventually discovered by [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] in 1565.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fernandez-Armesto 2006|Fernandez-Armesto 2006]], p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inland Spanish ''conquistadores'' (1519–1532)==
Rumours of undiscovered islands northwest of [[Hispaniola]] had reached Spain by 1511 and king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] was interested in forestalling further exploration. While Portuguese were making huge gains in the Indian Ocean, the Spanish invested in exploring inland in search of gold and valuable resources. The members of these expeditions, the "[[conquistadors]]", came from a variety of backgrounds including artisans, merchants, clergy, lesser nobility and freed slaves. They usually supplied their own equipment in exchange for a share in profits, having no direct connection with the royal army, and often no professional military training or experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[#U.C. 2009|U.C. 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Americas the Spanish found a number of empires that were as large and populous as those in Europe. However, small bodies of ''conquistadors'', with large armies of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous Americans]] groups, managed to conquer these states. During this time, [[pandemic]]s of European disease such as [[smallpox]] devastated the indigenous populations. Once Spanish [[sovereignty]] was established, the Spanish focused on the extraction and export of gold and silver.

In 1512, to reward [[Juan Ponce de León]] for exploring [[Puerto Rico]] in 1508, king Ferdinand urged him to seek these new lands. He would become governor of discovered lands, but was to finance himself all exploration.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 84–88.&lt;/ref&gt; With three ships and about 200 men, Léon set out from Puerto Rico in March 1513. In April they sighted land and named it ''[[Florida|La Florida]]''—because it was [[Easter]] (Florida) season—believing it was an island, becoming credited as the first European to land in the continent. The arrival location has been disputed between [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lawson 2007|Lawson 2007]], pp. 29–32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ponce de León Inlet]] and [[Melbourne Beach, Florida|Melbourne Beach]]. They headed south for further exploration and on April 8 encountered a current so strong that it pushed them backwards: this was the first encounter with the [[Gulf Stream]] that would soon become the primary route for eastbound ships leaving the Spanish Indies bound for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Weddle 1985|Weddle 1985]], p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They explored down the coast reaching [[Biscayne Bay]], [[Dry Tortugas]] and then sailing southwest in an attempt to circle [[Cuba]] to return, reaching [[Grand Bahama]] on July.

===Cortés' Mexico and the Aztec Empire===
{{main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}
{{See also|Spanish conquest of Yucatán|Spanish conquest of Guatemala}}
[[File:Ruta de Cortés.svg|thumb|Route of Cortés inland progress 1519–1521]]
In 1517 [[Cuba]]'s governor [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] commissioned a fleet under the command of [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Hernández de Córdoba]] to explore the [[Yucatán peninsula]]. They reached the coast where [[Mayans]] invited them to land, but were attacked at night and only a remnant of the crew returned. Velázquez then commissioned another expedition led by his nephew [[Juan de Grijalva]], who sailed south along the coast to [[Tabasco]], part of the Aztec empire. In 1518 Velázquez gave the mayor of the capital of Cuba, [[Hernán Cortés]], the command of an expedition to secure the interior of Mexico but, due to an old gripe between them, revoked the charter.

In February 1519 Cortés went ahead anyway, in an act of open mutiny. With about 11 ships, 500 men, 13 horses and a small number of cannons he landed in Yucatán, in [[Mayan civilization|Mayan]] territory,&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"&gt;[[#Grunberg 2007|Grunberg 2007]], magazine&lt;/ref&gt; claiming the land for the Spanish crown. From [[Trinidad]] he proceeded to [[Tabasco]] and won a battle against the natives. Among the vanquished was [[La Malinche]], his future mistress, who knew both (Aztec) [[Nahuatl language]] and Maya, becoming a valuable interpreter and counsellor. Through her, Cortés learned about the wealthy [[Aztec Empire]].

In July his men took over [[Veracruz]] and he placed himself under direct orders of new king [[Charles I of Spain]].&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; There Cortés asked for a meeting with Aztec Emperor [[Montezuma II]], who repeatedly refused. They headed to [[Tenochtitlan]] and on the way made alliances with several tribes. In October, accompanied by about 3,000 [[Tlaxcaltec]] they marched to [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], the second largest city in central Mexico. Either to instill fear upon the Aztecs waiting for him or (as he later claimed) wishing to make an example when he feared native treachery, they massacred thousands of unarmed members of the nobility gathered at the central plaza and partially burned the city.
[[File:Tenochtitlan y Golfo de Mexico 1524.jpg|thumb|left|Map of the island city [[Tenochtitlán]] and Mexico gulf made by one of Cortés' men, 1524, [[Newberry Library]], Chicago]]
Arriving in Tenochtitlan with a large army, on November 8 they were peacefully received by Moctezuma II, who deliberately let Cortés enter the heart of the Aztec Empire, hoping to know them better to crush them later.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; The emperor gave them lavish gifts in gold which enticed them to plunder vast amounts. In his letters to King Charles, Cortés claimed to have learned then that he was considered by the Aztecs to be either an emissary of the feathered serpent god [[Quetzalcoatl]] or Quetzalcoatl himself—a belief contested by a few modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Restall 2004|Restall 2004]], pp. 659–87.&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon learned that his men on the coast had been attacked, and decided to hostage Moctezuma in his palace, demanding a ransom as tribute to King Charles.

Meanwhile, Velasquez sent another expedition, led by [[Pánfilo de Narváez]], to oppose Cortès, arriving in Mexico in April 1520 with 1,100 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Cortés left 200 men in Tenochtitlan and took the rest to confront Narvaez, whom he overcame, convincing his men to join him. In Tenochtitlán one of Cortés's lieutenants committed a [[massacre in the Great Temple]], triggering local rebellion. Cortés speedily returned, attempting the support of Moctezuma but the Aztec emperor was killed, possibly stoned by his subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Castillo 1963|Castillo 1963]], p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish fled for the Tlaxcaltec during the ''[[La Noche Triste|Noche Triste]]'', where they managed a narrow escape while their back guard was massacred. Much of the treasure looted was lost during this panicked escape.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; After [[Battle of Otumba|a battle in Otumba]] they reached Tlaxcala, having lost 870 men.&lt;ref name="Grunberg 2007"/&gt; Having prevailed with the assistance of allies and reinforcements from [[Cuba]], Cortés [[Fall of Tenochtitlan|besieged Tenochtitlán]] and captured its ruler [[Cuauhtémoc]] in August 1521. As the Aztec Empire ended he claimed the city for Spain, renaming it Mexico City.

===Pizarro's Peru and the Inca Empire===
[[File:Conquest peru 1531 edited.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Francisco Pizarro]]'s route of exploration during the conquest of [[Peru]] (1531–1533)]]

A first attempt to explore western South America was undertaken in 1522 by [[Pascual de Andagoya]]. Native South Americans told him about a gold-rich territory on a river called Pirú. Having reached [[San Juan River (Colombia)]], Andagoya fell ill and returned to [[Panama]], where he spread news about "Pirú" as the legendary [[El Dorado]]. These, along with the accounts of success of [[Hernán Cortés]], caught the attention of Pizarro.

[[Francisco Pizarro]] had accompanied [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa|Balboa]] in the crossing of the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. In 1524 he formed a partnership with priest [[Hernando de Luque]] and soldier [[Diego de Almagro]] to explore the south, agreeing to divide the profits. They dubbed the enterprise the "''Empresa del Levante''": Pizarro would command, Almagro would provide military and food supplies, and Luque would be in charge of finances and additional provisions.

On 13 September 1524, the first of three expeditions left to conquer [[Peru]] with about 80 men and 40 horses. The expedition was a failure, reaching no farther than Colombia before succumbing to bad weather, hunger and skirmishes with hostile locals, where Almagro lost an eye. The place names bestowed along their route, ''Puerto deseado'' (desired port), ''Puerto del hambre'' (port of hunger) and ''Puerto quemado'' (burned port), attest to the difficulties of their journey. Two years later they began a second expedition with reluctant permission from the Governor of Panama. In August 1526, they left with two ships, 160 men and several horses. Upon reaching San Juan River they separated, Pizarro staying to explore the swampy coasts and Almagro sent back for reinforcements. Pizarro's main pilot sailed south and, after crossing the equator, captured a raft from [[Tumbes Region|Tumbes]]. To his surprise, it carried textiles, ceramic and much-desired gold, silver, and emeralds, becoming the central focus of the expedition. Soon Almagro joined with reinforcements and they resumed. After a difficult voyage facing strong winds and currents, they reached [[Atacames]] where they found a large native population under [[Inca]] rule, but they did not land.

Pizarro remained safe near the coast, while Almagro and Luque went back for reinforcements with proof of the [[El Dorado|rumoured gold]]. The new governor outright rejected a third expedition and ordered two ships to bring everyone back to Panama. Almagro and Luque grasped the opportunity to join Pizarro. When they arrived at the ''Isla de Gallo'', Pizarro drew a line in the sand, saying: ''"There lies Peru with its riches; Here, Panama and its poverty. Choose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian."'' Thirteen men decided to stay and became known as ''The Famous Thirteen''. They headed for ''La Isla Gorgona'', where they remained for seven months before the arrival of provisions.

They decided to sail south and, by April 1528, reached the northwestern Peruvian [[Tumbes Region]] and were warmly received by local ''Tumpis''. Two of Pizarro's men reported incredible riches, including gold and silver decorations around the chief's house. They saw for the first time a [[llama]] which Pizarro called "little camels". The natives named the Spanish "Children of the Sun" for their fair complexion and brilliant armours. They decided then to return to Panama to prepare a final expedition. Before leaving they sailed south through territories they named such as Cabo Blanco, port of Payta, Sechura, Punta de Aguja, Santa Cruz, and [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], reaching the ninth degree south.

In the spring of 1528 Pizarro sailed for Spain, where he had an interview with king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]]. The king heard of his expeditions in lands rich in gold and silver and promised to support him. The ''Capitulación de Toledo''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cervantes web|Cervantes web]], original text.&lt;/ref&gt; authorized Pizarro to proceed with the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]]. Pizarro was then able to convince many friends and relatives to join: his brothers [[Hernándo Pizarro]], [[Juan Pizarro (conquistador)|Juan Pizarro]], [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and also [[Francisco de Orellana]], who would later explore the [[Amazon River]], as well as his cousin [[Pedro Pizarro]].

Pizarro's third and final expedition left Panama for Peru on 27 December 1530. With three ships and one hundred and eighty men they landed near Ecuador and sailed to Tumbes, finding the place destroyed. They entered the interior and established the first Spanish settlement in [[Peru]], [[San Miguel de Piura]]. One of the men returned with an Incan envoy and an invitation for a meeting. Since the last meeting, the Inca had begun a [[Inca Civil War|civil war]] and [[Atahualpa]] had been resting in northern Peru following the defeat of his brother [[Huáscar]]. After marching for two months, they approached Atahualpa. He refused the Spanish, however, saying he would "be no man's tributary." There were fewer than 200 Spanish to his 80,000 soldiers, but Pizarro attacked and won the Incan army in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]], taking Atahualpa captive at the so-called [[The Ransom Room|ransom room]]. Despite fulfilling his promise of filling one room with gold and two with silver, he was convicted for killing his brother and plotting against Pizarro, and was executed.

In 1533, Pizarro invaded [[Cusco|Cuzco]] with indigenous troops and wrote to King Charles I: "''This city is the greatest and the finest ever seen in this country or anywhere in the Indies&amp;nbsp;... it is so beautiful and has such fine buildings that it would be remarkable even in Spain.''" After the Spanish had sealed the [[Spanish conquest of Peru|conquest of Peru]], [[Jauja]] in fertile [[Mantaro Valley]] was established as Peru's provisional capital, but it was too far up in the mountains, and Pizarro founded the city of [[Lima]] on 18 January 1535, which Pizarro considered one of the most important acts in his life.

==New trade routes (1542–1565)==
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] trade routes (blue) and the rival [[Manila galleon|Manila-Acapulco galleons]] trade routes (white) established in 1568]]

In 1543 three Portuguese traders accidentally became the first Westerners to reach and trade with Japan. According to [[Fernão Mendes Pinto]], who claimed to be in this journey, they arrived at [[Tanegashima]], where the locals were impressed by [[Firearms of Japan|firearms]] that would be immediately made by the Japanese on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pacey 1991|Pacey 1991]], p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish conquest of the [[Philippines]] was ordered by [[Philip II of Spain]], and [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] was the designated commander. Urdaneta agreed to accompany the expedition but refused to command and [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] was appointed instead. The expedition set sail on November 1564.&lt;ref&gt;N. McAlister, Lyle. (1984) ''Spain and Portugal in the New World: 1492–1700.'' p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending some time on the islands, Legazpi sent Urdaneta back to find a better return route. Urdaneta set sail from San Miguel on the island of [[Cebu]] on June 1, 1565, but was obliged to sail as far as [[38th parallel north|38 degrees North latitude]] to obtain favourable winds.
[[File:Namban-11.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]] attributed to [[Kanō Naizen]], 1570–1616 Japan]]

He reasoned that the [[trade wind]]s of the Pacific might move in a [[gyre]] as the Atlantic winds did. If in the Atlantic, ships made the ''[[Volta do mar]]'' to pick up winds that would bring them back from Madeira, then, he reasoned, by sailing far to the north before heading east, he would pick up trade winds to bring him back to North America. His hunch paid off, and he hit the coast near [[Cape Mendocino]], California, then followed the coast south. The ship reached the port of Acapulco, on October 8, 1565, having travelled {{convert|12000|mi|0|abbr=off}} in 130 days. Fourteen of his crew died; only Urdaneta and Felipe de Salcedo, nephew of López de Legazpi, had strength enough to cast the anchors.

Thus, a cross-Pacific Spanish route was established, between Mexico and the Philippines. For a long time these routes were used by the [[Manila galleon]]s, thereby creating a trade link joining China, the Americas, and Europe via the combined trans-Pacific and [[Transatlantic crossing|trans-Atlantic]] routes.

==Northern European involvement (1595 – 17th century)==
[[File:OrteliusWorldMap1570.jpg|thumb|In 1570 (May 20) Gilles Coppens de Diest at [[Antwerp]] published 53 maps created by [[Abraham Ortelius]] under the title ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', considered the "first modern atlas". Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; the atlas continued to be in demand till about 1612. This is the world map from this atlas.]]

Nations outside Iberia refused to acknowledge the Treaty of Tordesillas. France, the Netherlands and [[Kingdom of England|England]] each had a long [[Maritime history of Europe|maritime tradition]] and had been engaging in [[privateer]]ing. Despite Iberian protections, the new technologies and maps soon made their way north.

In 1568 the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] rebelled against the rule of [[Philip II of Spain]] leading to the [[Eighty Years' War]]. War between England and Spain also broke out. In 1580 Philip II became King of Portugal, as heir to the Crown. The combined empires were simply too big to go unchallenged by European rivals.

Philip's troops conquered the important trading cities of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]]. [[Antwerp]], then the most important port in the world, fell in 1585. The Protestant population was given two years to settle affairs before leaving the city.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1977|Boxer 1977]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Many settled in [[Amsterdam]]. Those were mainly skilled craftsmen, rich merchants of the port cities and refugees that fled religious persecution, particularly [[Sephardi Jews]] from Portugal and Spain and, later, the [[Huguenot]]s from France. The [[Pilgrim Fathers]] also spent time there before going to the New World. This mass immigration was an important driving force: a small port in 1585, Amsterdam quickly transformed into one of the most important commercial centres in the world. After the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 there was a huge expansion of maritime trade even though the defeat of the [[English Armada]] would confirm the naval supremacy of the Spanish navy over the emergent competitors.

The emergence of Dutch maritime power was swift and remarkable: for years Dutch sailors had participated in Portuguese voyages to the east, as able seafarers and keen mapmakers. In 1592, [[Cornelis de Houtman]] was sent by Dutch merchants to Lisbon, to gather as much information as he could about the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]]. In 1595, merchant and explorer [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], having travelled widely in the Indian Ocean at the service of the Portuguese, published a travel report in Amsterdam, the ''"Reys-gheschrift vande navigatien der Portugaloysers in Orienten"'' (''"Report of a journey through the navigations of the Portuguese in the East"'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Linschoten 1598|Linschoten 1598]], original book&lt;/ref&gt; This included vast directions on how to navigate between Portugal and the East Indies and to Japan. That same year Houtman followed this directions in the Dutch first exploratory travel that discovered a new sea route, sailing directly from Madagascar to [[Sunda Strait]] in Indonesia and signing a treaty with the [[Banten]] Sultan.

Dutch and British interest, fed on new information, led to a movement of commercial expansion, and the foundation of English (1600), and Dutch (1602) [[chartered companies]]. Dutch, French, and English sent ships which flouted the Portuguese monopoly, concentrated mostly on the coastal areas, which proved unable to defend against such a vast and dispersed venture.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Boxer 1969|Boxer 1969]], p 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploring North America===
[[File:Henry Hudson Map 26.png|thumb|right|Map of [[Henry Hudson]]'s 1609–1611 voyages to North America for the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC)]]

The 1497 English expedition led by Italian Venetian [[John Cabot]] (Giovanni Caboto) was the first of a series of French and English missions exploring North America. Spain put limited efforts into exploring the northern part of the Americas, as its resources were concentrated in Central and South America where more wealth had been found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Paine 2000|Paine 2000]], p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; These expeditions were hoping to find an oceanic [[Northwest Passage]] to Asian trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This was never discovered, but other possibilities were found, and in the early 17th century colonists from a number of Northern European states began to settle on the east coast of North America. In 1520–1521 the Portuguese [[João Álvares Fagundes]], accompanied by couples of mainland Portugal and the Azores, explored Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]] (possibly reaching the [[Bay of Fundy]] on the [[Minas Basin]]&lt;ref&gt;Mount Allison University, ''[http://www.mta.ca/marshland/topic3_europeans/european.htm Marshlands: Records of Life on the Tantramar: European Contact and Mapping]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt;), and established a fishing colony on the [[Cape Breton Island]], that would last until at least the 1570s or near the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;''Tratado das ilhas novas e descombrimento dellas e outras couzas, 1570'' Francisco de Souza, p. 6 [https://books.google.com/books/about/Tratado_das_ilhas_novas_e_descombrimento.html?id=3WMDAAAAQAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1524, Italian [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]] sailed at the behest of [[Francis I of France]], who was motivated by indignation over the division of the world between Portuguese and Spanish. Verrazzano explored the Atlantic Coast of North America, from [[South Carolina]] to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and was the first recorded European to visit what would later become the [[Virginia Colony]] and the United States. In the same year [[Esteban Gómez|Estevão Gomes]], a Portuguese [[cartography|cartographer]] who had sailed in Ferdinand Magellan's fleet, explored [[Nova Scotia]], sailing South through [[Maine]], where he entered [[New York Harbor]], the [[Hudson River]] and eventually reached [[Florida]] in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 [[Diogo Ribeiro]] world map outlines the East coast of North America almost perfectly. From 1534 to 1536, French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]], believed to have accompanied Verrazzano to Nova Scotia and Brazil, was the first European to travel inland in North America, describing the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], which he [[Name of Canada|named "The Country of Canadas]]", after [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquois names]], claiming what is now Canada for Francis I of France.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cartier E.B. 2009|Cartier E.B. 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#histori.ca 2009|Histori.ca 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Half Moon in Hudson.jpg|thumb|left|Henry Hudson's ship ''[[Halve Maen]]'' in the [[Hudson River]]]]

Europeans explored the Pacific Coast beginning in the mid-16th century. [[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the Pacific coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California]] was a peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gutierrez 1998|Gutierrez 1998]]. pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his discoveries, the myth persisted in Europe that California was an [[Island of California|island]]. His account provided the first recorded use of the name "California". [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo|João Rodrigues Cabrilho]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], was the first European to set foot in California, landing on September 28, 1542 on the shores of [[San Diego Bay]] and claiming California for Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#San Diego HS|San Diego HS]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; He also landed on [[San Miguel Island|San Miguel]], one of the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]], and continued as far as [[Point Reyes]]. After his death the crew continued exploring as far north as [[Oregon]].

The English naval commander [[Francis Drake]] sailed along the coast in 1579 somewhere north of Cabrillo's landing site—the actual location of Drake's landing was secret and is still undetermined
&lt;ref&gt;Sir Francis Drake Association | http://www.SirFrancisDrakeAssociation.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Drake N.Guild|Drake N.Guild]], web.&lt;/ref&gt;—and claimed the land for England,&lt;ref&gt;Edward Wright's World Chart 1599 documents a Land Claim | http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1179/0082288414Z.00000000027&lt;/ref&gt; calling it [[New Albion|Nova Albion]]. The term "Nova Albion" was therefore used on many European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish settlements.&lt;ref&gt;[[#USF 2010|USF 2010]], web&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1609 and 1611, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective [[Northern Sea Route|Northeast Passage]] to India, Kingdom of England's [[Henry Hudson]], under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), explored the region around present-day New York City, while looking for a western route to Asia. He explored the [[Hudson River]] and laid the foundation for [[New Netherland|Dutch colonization]] of the region. Hudson's final expedition ranged farther north in search of the [[Northwest Passage]], leading to his discovery of the [[Hudson Strait]] and [[Hudson Bay]]. After wintering in the [[James Bay]], Hudson tried to press on with his voyage in the spring of 1611, but his crew mutinied and they [[marooning|cast him adrift]].

===Search for a northern route===
[[File:Barentsz Full Map.jpg|thumb|1599 map of Arctic exploration by [[Willem Barentsz]] in his third voyage]]

France, the Netherlands, and England were left without a sea route to Asia, either via Africa or South America. When it became apparent that there was no route through the heart of the Americas, attention turned to the possibility of a passage through northern waters, which English called the [[Northwest Passage]]. The desire to establish such a route motivated much of the European exploration of both coasts of North America and in Russia. In Russia the idea of a possible seaway connecting the Atlantic and the Pacific was first put forward by the diplomat [[Dmitry Gerasimov|Gerasimov]] in 1525, although Russian settlers on the coast of the [[White Sea]], the [[Pomor]]s, had been exploring parts of the route as early as the 11th century.

In 1553 English explorer [[Hugh Willoughby]] with chief pilot [[Richard Chancellor]] were sent out with three vessels in search of a passage by London's [[Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands]]. During the voyage across the [[Barents Sea]], Willoughby thought he saw islands to the north, and islands called [[Willoughby's Land]] were shown on maps published by [[Petrus Plancius|Plancius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]] into the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hacquebord 1995|Hacquebord 1995]],&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels were separated by "terrible whirlwinds" in the [[Norwegian Sea]] and Willoughby sailed into a bay near the present border between Finland and Russia. His ships with the frozen crews, including Captain Willoughby and his journal, were found by Russian fishermen a year later. [[Richard Chancellor]] was able to drop anchor in the [[White Sea]] and trudge his way overland to Moscow and [[Ivan the Terrible]]'s Court, opening trade with Russia and the Company of Merchant Adventurers became the [[Muscovy Company]].

====Barentsz' Arctic exploration====
5 June 1594, Dutch [[cartographer]] [[Willem Barentsz]] departed from [[Texel]] in a fleet of three ships to enter the [[Kara Sea]], with the hopes of finding the [[Northeast Passage]] above [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Synge 1912|Synge 1912]], p. 258&lt;/ref&gt; At Williams Island the crew encountered a [[polar bear]] for the first time. They managed to bring it on board, but the bear rampaged and was killed. Barentsz reached the west coast of [[Novaya Zemlya]] and followed it northward, before being forced to turn back in the face of large [[iceberg]]s.

The following year, [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Orange]] named him chief pilot of a new expedition of six ships, loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ULT 2009|ULT 2009]], web&lt;/ref&gt; The party came across [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] "wild men" but eventually turned back upon discovering the [[Kara Sea]] frozen. In 1596, the States-General offered a high reward for anybody who ''successfully'' navigated the [[Northeast Passage]]. The Town Council of [[Amsterdam]] purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by [[Jan Rijp]] and [[Jacob van Heemskerk]], to search for the elusive channel, under the command of Barents. They set off on May, and on June discovered [[Bear Island (Norway)|Bear Island]] and [[Spitsbergen]], sighting its northwest coast. They saw a large bay, later called [[Raudfjorden]] and entered [[Magdalenefjorden]], which they named ''Tusk Bay'', sailing into the northern entrance of [[Forlandsundet]], which they called ''Keerwyck'', but were forced to turn back because of a shoal. On 28 June they rounded the northern point of [[Prins Karls Forland]], which they named ''Vogelhoek'', on account of the large number of birds, and sailed south, passing [[Isfjorden (Svalbard)|Isfjorden]] and [[Bellsund]], which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as ''Grooten Inwyck'' and ''Inwyck''.

[[File:Polar bear, Gerrit de Veer (1596).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of Willem Barentsz fighting a [[polar bear]]]]

The ships once again reached Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement. They parted ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed north. Barentsz reached [[Novaya Zemlya]] and, to avoid becoming entrapped in ice, headed for the [[Vaigatch Strait]] but became stuck within the icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on the ice. The crew used lumber from their ship to build a lodge they called ''Het Behouden Huys'' (The Kept House). Dealing with extreme cold, they used the merchant fabrics to make additional blankets and clothing and caught [[Arctic fox]]es in primitive traps, as well as polar bears. When June arrived, and the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, [[scurvy]]-ridden survivors took two small boats out into the sea. Barentsz died at sea on 20 June 1597, while studying charts. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach [[Kola (town)|Kola]] where they were rescued by a Russian merchant vessel. Only 12 crewmen remained, reaching Amsterdam in November. Two of Barentsz' crewmembers later published their journals, [[Jan Huyghen van Linschoten]], who had accompanied him on the first two voyages, and [[Gerrit de Veer]] who had acted as the ship's carpenter on the last.

In 1608, [[Henry Hudson]] made a second attempt, trying to go across the top of Russia. He made it to [[Novaya Zemlya]] but was forced to turn back. Between 1609 and 1611, Hudson, after several voyages on behalf of English merchants to explore a prospective Northern Sea Route to India, explored the region around modern New York City while looking for a western route to Asia under the auspices of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC).

===Dutch Australia and New Zealand===
[[File:Tasmanroutes.PNG|thumb|The route of [[Abel Tasman]]'s 1642 and 1644 voyages in [[New Holland (Australia)]] in the service of the VOC ([[Dutch East India Company]])]]

''[[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Ignota]]'' (Latin, "the unknown land of the south") was a hypothetical continent appearing on European maps from the 15th to the 18th centuries, with roots in a notion introduced by [[Aristotle]]. It was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. The discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion, like [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569) and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] even so late as 1767&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wilford 1982|Wilford 1982]], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large landmass in the Southern Hemisphere as a counterweight to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of this hypothetical continent.

[[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Medina 1918|Medina 1918]], pp. 136–246.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luís Vaz de Torres|Luis Váez de Torres]], a [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]n navigator working for the Spanish Crown, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]]. [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], a Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Australia del [[Espiritu Santo]]. He represented this to the King of Spain as the Terra Australis incognita. In fact, it was not Australia but an island in present-day [[Vanuatu]].
[[File:Duyfken replica, Swan River.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Duyfken]]'' replica, Swan River, Australia]]
[[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] navigator and colonial governor, [[Willem Janszoon]] sailed from the Netherlands for the East Indies for the third time on December 18, 1603, as captain of the ''[[Duyfken]]'' (or ''Duijfken'', meaning "Little Dove"), one of twelve ships of the great fleet of [[Steven van der Hagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mutch 1942|Mutch 1942]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Indies, Janszoon was sent to search for other outlets of trade, particularly in "the great land of Nova Guinea and other East and Southlands." On November 18, 1605, the ''Duyfken'' sailed from [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] to the coast of western [[New Guinea]]. Janszoon then crossed the eastern end of the [[Arafura Sea]], without seeing the [[Torres Strait]], into the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]]. On February 26, 1606, he made landfall at the [[Pennefather River]] on the western shore of [[Cape York Peninsula|Cape York]] in Queensland, near the modern town of [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]]. This is the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent. Janszoon proceeded to chart some {{convert|320|km|0|abbr=off}} of the coastline, which he thought was a southerly extension of New Guinea. In 1615, [[Jacob Le Maire|Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of Cape Horn proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island.

In 1642–1644 [[Abel Tasman]], also a Dutch explorer and [[merchant]] in the service of the VOC, circumnavigated [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] proving that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. He was the first known European [[Exploration|expedition]] to reach the islands of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (now [[Tasmania]]) and [[New Zealand]] and to sight the [[Fiji]] islands, which he did in 1643. Tasman, his navigator Visscher, and his merchant Gilsemans also mapped substantial portions of Australia, New Zealand and the [[Pacific Islands]].

==Russian exploration of Siberia (1581–1660)==
{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia|Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir|Siberian River Routes|List of Russian explorers}}
[[File:Siberiariverroutemap.png|right|thumb|[[Siberian river routes]] were of primary significance in the process of exploration.]]
In the mid-16th century the [[Tsardom of Russia]] conquered the Tatar khanates of [[Khanate of Kazan|Kazan]] and [[Astrakhan Khanate|Astrakhan]], thus annexing the entire [[Volga Region]] and opening the way to the [[Ural Mountains]]. The colonization of the new easternmost lands of Russia and further onslaught eastward was led by the rich merchants [[Stroganov]]s. Tsar [[Ivan IV]] granted vast estates near the Urals as well as tax privileges to [[Anikey Stroganov]], who organized large scale migration to these lands. Stroganovs developed farming, hunting, saltworks, fishing, and ore mining on the Urals and established trade with [[Siberia]]n tribes.

===Conquest of the Khanate of Sibir===
Around 1577, [[Semyon Stroganov]] and other sons of Anikey Stroganov hired a [[Cossack]] leader called [[Yermak]] to protect their lands from the attacks of [[Siberian Khanate|Siberian Khan]] [[Kuchum]]. By 1580 Stroganovs and Yermak came up with the idea of the military expedition to Siberia, in order to fight Kuchum in his own land. In 1581 Yermak began his voyage into the depths of [[Siberia]]. After a few victories over the khan's army, Yermak's people defeated the main forces of Kuchum on [[Irtysh River]] in a 3-day [[Battle of Chuvash Cape]] in 1582. The remains of the khan's army retreated to the [[steppe]]s, and thus Yermak captured the [[Siberia Khanate]], including its capital [[Qashliq]] near modern [[Tobolsk]]. Kuchum still was strong and suddenly attacked Yermak in 1585 in the dead of night, killing most of his people. Yermak was wounded and tried to swim across the Wagay River ([[Irtysh]]'s tributary), but drowned under the weight of his own [[Mail (armour)|chain mail]]. The Cossacks had to withdraw from Siberia completely, but thanks to Yermak's having explored all the main river routes in West Siberia, Russians successfully reclaimed all his conquests just several years later.
[[File:Yermak Timofeyevich and his band of adventurers crossing the Ural Mountains at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yermak Timofeyevich]] and his band of adventurers crossing the [[Ural Mountains]] at Tagil, entering Asia from Europe]]

===Siberian river routes===
In the early 17th century the eastward movement of Russians was slowed by the internal problems in the country during the [[Time of Troubles]]. However, very soon the exploration and colonization of the huge territories of Siberia was resumed, led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable [[furs]] and [[ivory]]. While [[Cossacks]] came from the Southern Urals, another wave of Russians came by the Arctic Ocean. These were [[Pomors]] from the [[Northwest Russia|Russian North]], who already had been making [[fur]] trade with [[Mangazeya]] in the north of the Western Siberia for quite a long time. In 1607 the settlement of [[Turukhansk]] was founded on the northern [[Yenisei River]], near the mouth of [[Lower Tunguska]], and in 1619 [[Yeniseysk]]y [[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] was founded on the mid-Yenisei at the mouth of the [[Upper Tunguska]].

Between 1620 and 1624 a group of fur hunters led by [[Demid Pyanda]] left [[Turukhansk]] and explored some {{convert|1430|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Lower Tunguska, wintering in the proximity of the [[Vilyuy]] and [[Lena River|Lena]] rivers. According to later legendary accounts (folktales collected a century after the fact), Pyanda discovered the Lena River. He allegedly explored some {{convert|1500|mi|0|abbr=off}} of its length, reaching as far as central [[Yakutia]]. He returned up the Lena until it became too rocky and shallow, and portaged to the [[Angara River]]. In this way, Pyanda may have become the first Russian to meet [[Yakuts]] and [[Buryats]]. He built new boats and explored some {{convert|870|mi|0|abbr=off}} of the Angara, finally reaching Yeniseysk and discovering that the Angara (a [[Buryat language|Buryat]] name) and [[Upper Tunguska]] (Verkhnyaya Tunguska, as initially known by Russians) are one and the same river.

In 1627 [[Pyotr Beketov]] was appointed Yenisei [[voevoda]] in [[Siberia]]. He successfully carried out the voyage to collect taxes from [[Zabaykalye]] Buryats, becoming the first Russian to step in [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]]. He founded the first Russian settlement there, Rybinsky ostrog. Beketov was sent to the Lena River in 1631, where in 1632 he founded [[Yakutsk]] and sent his Cossacks to explore the [[Aldan River|Aldan]] and farther down the Lena, to found new fortresses, and to collect taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakutsk soon turned into a major starting point for further Russian expeditions eastward, southward and northward. [[Maksim Perfilyev]], who earlier had been one of the founders of Yeniseysk, founded [[Bratsk]]y ostrog on the Angara in 1631, and in 1638 he became the first Russian to step into [[Transbaikalia]], travelling there from Yakutsk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#The Perfilyevs|The Perfilyevs]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sbaikal|Sbaikal]], web {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baikal sea.gif|thumb|right|A map of [[Irkutsk]] and [[Lake Baikal]] in its neighbourhood, as depicted in the late-17th-century [[Remezov Chronicle]]]]
In 1643 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] led a group of Cossacks from Yakutsk to the south of the [[Baikal Mountains]] and discovered [[Lake Baikal]], visiting its [[Olkhon Island]]. Later Ivanov made the first chart and description of Baikal.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lincoln 1994|Lincoln 1994]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russians reach the Pacific===
In 1639 a group of explorers led by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] became the first Russians to reach the Pacific Ocean and to discover the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], having built a winter camp on its shore at the [[Ulya River]] mouth. The Cossacks learned from the locals about the large [[Amur River]] far to the south. In 1640 they apparently sailed south, explored the south-eastern shores of the Okhotsk Sea, perhaps reaching the mouth of the [[Amur River]] and possibly discovering the [[Shantar Islands]] on their way back. Based on Moskvitin's account, [[Kurbat Ivanov]] drew the first Russian map of the [[Far East]] in 1642.

In 1643, [[Vasily Poyarkov]] crossed the [[Stanovoy Range]] and reached the upper [[Zeya River]] in the country of the [[Daur people|Daurs]], who were paying tribute to the [[Manchu]] Chinese. After wintering, in 1644 Poyarkov pushed down the Zeya and became the first Russian to reach the [[Amur River]]. He sailed down the Amur and finally discovered the mouth of that great river from land. Since his Cossacks provoked the enmity of the locals behind, Poyarkov chose a different way back. They built boats and in 1645 sailed along the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] coast to the [[Ulya River]] and spent the next winter in the huts that had been built by [[Ivan Moskvitin]] six years earlier. In 1646 they returned to Yakutsk.

[[File:Krsk koch.JPG|upright=0.7|thumb|left|A 17th-century [[Koch (boat)|koch]] in a museum in [[Krasnoyarsk]]. Kochi were the earliest [[icebreaker]]s and were widely used by Russians in the [[Arctic]] and on [[Siberia]]n rivers.]]
In 1644 [[Mikhail Stadukhin]] discovered the [[Kolyma River]] and founded [[Srednekolymsk]]. A merchant named [[Fedot Alekseyev Popov]] organized a further expedition eastward, and [[Semyon Dezhnyov]] became a captain of one of the [[Koch (boat)|kochi]]. In 1648 they sailed from [[Srednekolymsk]] down to the Arctic and after some time they rounded [[Cape Dezhnyov]], thus becoming the first explorers to pass through the [[Bering Strait]] and to discover [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and the [[Bering Sea]]. All their kochi and most of their men (including Popov himself) were lost in storms and clashes with the natives. A small group led by Dezhnyov reached the mouth of the [[Anadyr River]] and sailed up it in 1649, having built new boats from the wreckage. They founded [[Anadyrsk]] and were stranded there, until Stadukhin found them, coming from Kolyma by land.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Fisher 1981|Fisher 1981]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Stadukhin set off south in 1651 and discovered [[Penzhin Bay]] on the northern coast of the [[Okhotsk Sea]]. He also may have explored the western shores of [[Kamchatka]].

In 1649–50 [[Yerofey Khabarov]] became the second Russian to explore the [[Amur River]]. Through [[Olyokma]], [[Tungur]] and [[Shilka River]]s he reached Amur ([[Dauria]]), returned to [[Yakutsk]] and then back to Amur with a larger force in 1650–53. This time he [[Russian-Manchu border conflicts|was met with armed resistance]]. He built winter quarters at [[Albazin]], then sailed down Amur and found Achansk, which preceded the present-day [[Khabarovsk]], defeating or evading large armies of [[Transbaikal|Daurian]] [[Manchu]] Chinese and [[Koreans]] on his way. He charted the Amur in his ''Draft of the Amur river''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dymytryshyn 1985|Dymytryshyn 1985]], web&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Russians held on to the Amur Region until 1689, when by the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] this land was assigned to [[Imperial Chinese|Chinese Empire]] (it was returned, however, by the [[Treaty of Aigun]] in 1858).

In 1659–65 [[Kurbat Ivanov]] was the next head of [[Anadyrsk]]y ostrog after [[Semyon Dezhnyov]]. In 1660 he sailed from [[Anadyr Bay]] to [[Cape Dezhnyov]]. Atop his earlier pioneering charts, Ivanov is credited with creation of the early map of [[Chukchi Peninsula|Chukotka]] and [[Bering Strait]], which was the first to show on paper (very schematically) the yet undiscovered [[Wrangel Island]], both [[Diomede Islands]] and Alaska, based on the data collected from the natives of Chukotka.

So, by the mid-17th century, Russians established the borders of their country close to modern ones, and explored almost the whole of Siberia, except the eastern [[Kamchatka]] and some regions north of the Arctic Circle. The conquest of Kamchatka later would be achieved in the early 1700s by [[Vladimir Atlasov]], while the discovery of the Arctic coastline and Alaska would be completed by the [[Great Northern Expedition]] in 1733–1743.

European overseas expansion led to the contact between the Old and New Worlds producing the [[Columbian Exchange]],&lt;ref name="Mayne 2009"&gt;[[#Mayne 2009|Mayne 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; named after Columbus. It involved the transfer of goods unique to one hemisphere to another. Europeans brought cattle, horses, and sheep to the New World, and from the New World Europeans received tobacco, potatoes and [[maize]]. Other items becoming important in global trade were the [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] crops of the Americas, and the gold and silver brought from the Americas not only to Europe but elsewhere in the Old World.

The new trans-oceanic links and their domination by the European powers led to the [[Imperialism|Age of Imperialism]], where European colonial powers came to control most of the planet. The European appetite for trade, commodities, empire and slaves greatly affected many other areas of the world. Spain participated in the destruction of aggressive empires in the Americas, only to substitute its own, and forcibly replaced the original religions. The pattern of territorial aggression was repeated by other European empires, most notably the Dutch, Russian, French and British. Christianity replaced older "pagan" rituals, as were new languages, political and sexual cultures, and in some areas like North America, Australia, New Zealand and [[Argentina]], the [[indigenous peoples]] were abused and driven off most of their lands, being reduced to small, dependent minorities.

Similarly, in coastal Africa, local states supplied the appetite of European [[History of slavery|slave traders]], changing the complexion of coastal African states and fundamentally altering the nature of [[African slave trade|African slavery]], causing impacts on societies and economies deep inland. (See [[Atlantic slave trade]]).

Aboriginal peoples were living in North America at this time and still do today. There were many conflicts between Europeans and Natives. The Europeans had many advantages over the natives. They gave them diseases that they had not been exposed to before and this wiped out 50–90% of their population. (See [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Cook 1998|Cook 1998]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maize]] and [[Cassava|manioc]] were introduced into Africa in the 16th century by the Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;[[#OSU 2006|OSU 2006]], news.&lt;/ref&gt; They are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM The cassava transformation in Africa]". The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scitizen 2007|Scitizen 2007]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred W. Crosby]] speculated that increased production of maize, manioc, and other New World crops led to heavier concentrations of population in the areas from which slavers captured their victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th-century economy of China, the [[Ming Dynasty]] was stimulated by trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]]. China became involved in a new global trade of goods, plants, animals, and food crops known as the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Trade with [[Early modern Europe|European powers]] and the Japanese brought in massive amounts of silver, which then replaced copper and paper [[banknote]]s as the common [[medium of exchange]] in China. During the last decades of the Ming the flow of silver into China was greatly diminished, thereby undermining state revenues and indeed the entire Ming economy. This damage to the economy was compounded by the effects on agriculture of the incipient [[Little Ice Age]], natural calamities, crop failure, and sudden epidemics. The ensuing breakdown of authority and people's livelihoods allowed rebel leaders such as [[Li Zicheng]] to challenge [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] authority.

New crops that had come to Asia from the Americas via the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century contributed to the Asia's population growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Columbia University 2009|Columbia University 2009]], web.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the bulk of imports to China were silver, the Chinese also purchased New World crops from the [[Spanish Empire]]. This included [[sweet potato]]es, [[maize]], and peanuts, foods that could be cultivated in lands where traditional Chinese staple crops—wheat, millet, and rice—could not grow, hence facilitating a rise in the population of China.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"&gt;[[#Ebrey 2006|Ebrey 2006]], p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], pp. 198–201&lt;/ref&gt; In the Song Dynasty (960–1279), rice had become the major staple crop of the poor;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gernet 1962|Gernet 1962]], p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; after sweet potatoes were introduced to China around 1560, it gradually became the traditional food of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Crosby 1972|Crosby 1972]], p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of the Portuguese to Japan in 1543 initiated the [[Nanban trade|Nanban trade period]], with the Japanese adopting several technologies and cultural practices, like the [[arquebus]], European-style cuirasses, European ships, Christianity, decorative art, and language. After the Chinese had banned direct trade by Chinese merchants with Japan, the Portuguese filled this commercial vacuum as intermediaries between China and Japan. The Portuguese bought Chinese silk and sold it to the Japanese in return for Japanese-mined silver; since silver was more highly valued in China, the Portuguese could then use Japanese silver to buy even larger stocks of Chinese silk.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Spence 1999|Spence 1999]], pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1573—after the Spanish established a trading base in Manila—the Portuguese intermediary trade was trumped by the prime source of incoming silver to China from the Spanish Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Jesuit [[Matteo Ricci]] (1552–1610) was the first European allowed into the Forbidden City. He taught the Chinese how to construct and play the [[spinet]], translated Chinese texts into Latin and vice versa, and worked closely with his Chinese associate [[Xu Guangqi]] (1562–1633) on mathematical work.

As a wider variety of global luxury commodities entered the European markets by sea, previous European markets for [[luxury good]]s stagnated. The Atlantic trade largely supplanted pre-existing [[Maritime republics|Italian]] and [[Hanseatic League|German]] trading powers which had relied on their Baltic, Russian and Islamic trade links. The new commodities also caused [[social change]], as sugar, spices, silks and chinawares entered the luxury markets of Europe.

The European economic centre shifted from the Mediterranean to Western Europe. The city of [[Antwerp]], part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]], became "the centre of the ''entire'' international economy",&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1985|Braudel 1985]], p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt; and the richest city in Europe at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dunton 1896|Dunton 1896]], p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Centred in Antwerp first and then in [[Amsterdam]], "[[Dutch Golden Age]]" was tightly linked to the Age of Discovery. [[Francesco Guicciardini]], a Venetian envoy, stated that hundreds of ships would pass Antwerp in a day, and 2,000 carts entered the city each week. Portuguese ships laden with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[cinnamon]] would unload their cargo. With many foreign merchants resident in the city and governed by an oligarchy of banker-aristocrats forbidden to engage in trade, the economy of Antwerp was foreigner-controlled, which made the city very international, with merchants and traders from [[Venice]], [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]], Spain and Portugal and a policy of toleration, which attracted a large [[Orthodox Jew]]ish community. The city experienced three booms during its golden age, the first based on the pepper market, a second launched by New World silver coming from Seville (ending with the bankruptcy of Spain in 1557), and a third boom, after the [[Italian War of 1551–1559|Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]], in 1559, based on the textiles industry.

Despite initial hostilities, by 1549 the Portuguese were sending annual trade missions to [[Shangchuan Island]] in China. In 1557 they managed to convince the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] court to agree on a legal port treaty that would establish [[Macau]] as an official Portuguese trade colony.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese friar [[Gaspar da Cruz]] (c. 1520 February 5, 1570) wrote the first complete book on China and the Ming Dynasty that was published in Europe; it included information on its geography, provinces, royalty, official class, bureaucracy, shipping, architecture, farming, craftsmanship, merchant affairs, clothing, religious and social customs, music and instruments, writing, education, and justice.&lt;ref&gt;[[#AAS 1976|Aas 1976]], pp. 410–411.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DelftChina18thCenturyCompanieDesIndes.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Delftware]] depicting Chinese scenes, 18th century. [[Ernest Cognacq Museum]]]]
From China the major exports were [[silk]] and [[porcelain]], adapted to meet European tastes. The [[Chinese export porcelain]]s were held in such great esteem in Europe that, in English, ''[[wikt:china|china]]'' became a commonly–used synonym for ''porcelain''. [[Kraak porcelain]] (believed to be named after the Portuguese [[carrack]]s in which it was transported) was among the first Chinese ware to arrive in Europe in mass quantities. Only the richest could afford these early imports, and Kraak often featured in [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch still life]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;For a study on foreign objects in Dutch paintings, see [[#Hochstrasser 2007|Hochstrasser 2007]], ''Still life and trade in the Dutch golden age''.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a lively trade with the East, having imported 6 million porcelain items from China to Europe between the years 1602 to 1682.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Volker 1971|Volker 1971]], p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese workmanship impressed many. Between 1575 and 1587 [[Medici porcelain]] from [[Florence]] was the first successful attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain. Although Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do it when the supply to Europe was interrupted, after the death of [[Wanli Emperor]] in 1620. Kraak, mainly the [[blue and white porcelain]], was imitated all over the world by potters in [[Arita, Saga|Arita, Japan]] and [[Iran|Persia]]—where Dutch merchants turned when the fall of the Ming Dynasty rendered Chinese originals unavailable&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howard 1978|Howard 1978]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;—and ultimately in [[Delftware]]. Dutch and later [[English Delftware]] inspired by Chinese designs persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.

[[File:Heem, Jan Davidsz. de - A Richly Laid Table with Parrots - detail cup.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], detail of silverware from "A Richly Laid Table with Parrots", c. 1650]]

[[Antonio de Morga]] (1559–1636), a Spanish official in [[Manila]], listed an extensive inventory of goods that were traded by Ming China at the turn of the 16th to 17th century, noting there were "rarities which, did I refer to them all, I would never finish, nor have sufficient paper for it".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brook 1998|Brook 1998]], pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt; After noting the variety of silk goods traded to Europeans, Ebrey writes of the considerable size of commercial transactions: In one case a galleon to the Spanish territories in the New World carried over 50,000 pairs of silk stockings. In return China imported mostly silver from Peruvian and Mexican mines, [[Manila galleon|transported via Manila]]. Chinese merchants were active in these trading ventures, and many emigrated to such places as the [[Philippines]] and Borneo to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ebrey 2006, p. 211"/&gt;

The increase in gold and silver experienced by [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] coincided with a major [[inflation]]ary cycle both within Spain and Europe, known as the [[price revolution]]. Spain had amassed large quantities of gold and silver from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Walton 1994|Walton 1994]], pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1520s large scale extraction of silver from Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began. With the opening of the silver mines in [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potosí]] in 1546 large shipments of silver became the fabled source of wealth. During the 16th century, Spain held the equivalent of US$1.5 trillion (1990 terms) in gold and silver from [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]. Being the most powerful European monarch at a time full of war and religious conflicts, the [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg]] rulers spent the wealth in wars and arts across Europe. "I learnt a proverb here", said a French traveller in 1603: "Everything is dear in Spain except silver".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; The spent silver, suddenly spread throughout a previously cash-starved Europe, caused widespread inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tracy 1994|Tracy 1994]], p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The inflation was worsened by a growing population with a static production level, low salaries and a rising cost of living, which damaged local industry. Increasingly, Spain became dependent on the revenues flowing in from the mercantile empire in the Americas, leading to Spain's first bankruptcy in 1557 due to rising military costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Braudel 1979|Braudel 1979]], pp. 523–25&lt;/ref&gt; Phillip II of Spain defaulted on debt payments in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. The increase in prices as a result of currency circulation fuelled the growth of the commercial [[middle class]] in Europe, the ''[[bourgeoisie]]'', which came to influence the politics and culture of many countries.

One effect of the inflation, particularly in Great Britain, was that tenant farmers who held long term leases from lords saw real decreases in rent. Some lords opted to sell their leased land, giving rise to small land-owing farmers such as [[yeoman]] and gentlemen farmers.&lt;ref&gt;

The term ''{{lang|la|anno Domini}}'' is [[Medieval Latin]] and means "in the year of the Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/Anno%20Domini |title=Anno Domini |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online Dictionary |year=2003 |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |quote=Etymology: Medieval Latin, in the year of the Lord |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is often presented using "our Lord" instead of "the Lord",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Anno+Domini |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=782}} "since AD stands for ''anno Domini'', 'in the year of (Our) Lord'"&lt;/ref&gt; taken from the full original phrase "''anno Domini nostri Jesu Christi''", which translates to "''in the year of our Lord Jesus Christ".

This [[calendar era]] is based on the traditionally reckoned year of the [[annunciation|conception]] or [[Nativity of Jesus|birth]] of [[Jesus of Nazareth]], with ''AD'' counting years from the start of this [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], and ''BC'' denoting years before the start of the era. There is no [[year zero]] in this scheme, so the year AD&amp;nbsp;1 immediately follows the year 1&amp;nbsp;BC. This dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] of [[Scythia Minor]], but was not widely used until after 800.&lt;ref name="Teresi1997"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/97jul/zero.htm |authorlink=Dick Teresi |first=Dick |last=Teresi |title=Zero |journal=[[The Atlantic]] |date=July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778–9}}

The [[Gregorian calendar]] is the most widely used [[calendar]] in the world today. For decades, it has been the unofficial global standard, adopted in the pragmatic interests of international communication, transportation, and commercial integration, and recognized by international institutions such as the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html |last=Eastman |first=Allan |title=A Month of Sundays |publisher=Date and Time |accessdate=2010-05-04 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506002355/http://www.timeanddate.com/newsletter/all-the-time/a-month-of-sundays5.html |archivedate=2010-05-06 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, [[English language|English]] followed [[Latin]] usage by placing the "AD" abbreviation before the year number.{{efn|This convention comes from grammatical usage. ''{{lang|la|Anno 500}}'' means "in the year 500"; ''{{lang|la|anno domini 500}}'' means "in the year 500 of Our Lord". Just as "500 in the year" is not good English syntax, neither is 500 AD; whereas "AD 500" preserves syntactic order when translated.&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Manual of Style'' 2010, pp. 476–7; Goldstein 2007, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}} However, BC is placed after the year number (for example: AD&amp;nbsp;{{CURRENTYEAR}}, but 68&amp;nbsp;BC), which also preserves syntactic order. The abbreviation is also widely used after the number of a [[century]] or [[millennium]], as in "fourth century AD" or "second millennium AD" (although conservative usage formerly rejected such expressions).&lt;ref&gt;''Chicago Manual of Style,'' 1993, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Because BC is the English abbreviation for ''Before Christ'', it is sometimes incorrectly concluded that AD means ''After Death'', i.e., after the death of Jesus. However, this would mean that the approximate 33 years commonly associated with the life of Jesus would neither be included in the BC nor the AD time scales.&lt;ref&gt;Donald P. Ryan, (2000), 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terminology that is viewed by some as being more neutral and inclusive of non-Christian people is to call this the Current or [[Common Era]] (abbreviated as CE), with the preceding years referred to as Before the Common or Current Era (BCE). [[Astronomical year numbering]] and [[ISO 8601]] avoid words or abbreviations related to Christianity, but use the same numbers for AD years.

== History ==
The ''Anno Domini'' dating system was devised in 525 by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] to enumerate the years in his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. His system was to replace the [[Era of Martyrs|Diocletian era]] that had been used in an old [[Easter table]] because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecuted Christians]].{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=767}} The last year of the old table, Diocletian 247, was immediately followed by the first year of his table, AD 532. When he devised his table, [[Julian calendar]] years were identified by naming the [[consul]]s who held office that year—he himself stated that the "present year" was "the consulship of [[Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]]", which was 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161226031734/http://hbar.phys.msu.ru/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm Nineteen year cycle of Dionysius] Introduction and First Argumentum.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Dionysius implied that [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Jesus' incarnation]] occurred 525 years earlier, without stating the specific year during which his birth or conception occurred. "However, nowhere in his exposition of his table does Dionysius relate his epoch to any other dating system, whether consulate, [[Olympiad]], [[Anno Mundi|year of the world]], or [[regnal year]] of Augustus; much less does he explain or justify the underlying date."{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=778}}

[[Bonnie J. Blackburn]] and [[Leofranc Holford-Strevens]] briefly present arguments for 2 BC, 1 BC, or AD 1 as the year Dionysius intended for the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] or [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]]. Among the sources of confusion are:{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|pp=778–9}}
* In modern times, [[incarnation]] is synonymous with the conception, but some ancient writers, such as [[Bede]], considered incarnation to be synonymous with the Nativity.
* The civil or consular year began on [[1 January]] but the Diocletian year began on 29 August (30 August in the year before a Julian leap year).
* There were inaccuracies in the lists of consuls.
* There were confused summations of emperors' regnal years.

It is not known how Dionysius established the year of Jesus's birth. Two major theories are that Dionysius based his calculation on the Gospel of Luke, which states that Jesus was "about thirty years old" shortly after "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar", and hence subtracted thirty years from that date, or that Dionysius counted back 532 years from the first year of his new table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Teres|first=Gustav|date=October 1984|title=Time computations and Dionysius Exiguus|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1984JHA....15..177T|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177-188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tøndering, Claus, ''[http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/years.php The Calendar FAQ: Counting years]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&amp;pg=PA347|last=Mosshammer|first=Alden A|title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era|location=Oxford|date=2009|pages=345-347}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been speculated by Georges Declercq&lt;ref&gt;Declercq, Georges, "Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era" Turnhout, Belgium, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; that Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was intended to prevent people from believing the imminent [[End of the world (religion)|end of the world]]. At the time, it was believed by some that the [[resurrection of the dead]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The old ''[[Anno Mundi]]'' calendar theoretically commenced with the [[Dating creation|creation of the world]] based on information in the [[Old Testament]]. It was believed that, based on the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar, Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the ''Anno Mundi'' calendar marking the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik. Walter de Gruyter, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mosshammer, Alden A.: The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 254, p. 270, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anno Mundi'' 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the resurrection and the end of the world&lt;ref&gt;Declercq, Georges: Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; but this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius.

=== Popularization ===
The [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] historian the Venerable Bede, who was familiar with the work of Dionysius Exiguus, used ''Anno Domini'' dating in his ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'', completed in 731. In this same history, he also used another [[Latin]] term, ''ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus anno sexagesimo'' ("in fact in the 60th year before the time of the Lord's incarnation"), equivalent to the English "before Christ", to identify years before the first year of this era.&lt;ref&gt;Bede 731, Book 1, Chapter 2, first sentence.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Dionysius and Bede regarded ''Anno Domini'' as beginning at the incarnation of Jesus, but "the distinction between Incarnation and Nativity was not drawn until the late 9th century, when in some places the Incarnation epoch was identified with Christ's conception, i.e., the Annunciation on March 25" (''Annunciation style'').{{sfn|Blackburn|Holford-Strevens|2003|p=881}}

[[File:Charlemagne Agostino Cornacchini Vatican 2.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Charlemagne]] by [[Agostino Cornacchini]] (1725), at [[St. Peter's Basilica]], Vatican City. Charlemagne promoted the usage of the ''Anno Domini'' epoch throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]].]]
On the continent of [[Europe]], ''Anno Domini'' was introduced as the era of choice of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] by the English cleric and scholar [[Alcuin]] in the late eighth century. Its endorsement by Emperor [[Charlemagne]] and [[List of Frankish Kings#Carolingian dynasty|his successors]] popularizing the use of the epoch and spreading it throughout the [[Carolingian Empire]] ultimately lies at the core of the system's prevalence. According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], [[pope]]s continued to date documents according to [[regnal years]] for some time, but usage of AD gradually became more common in [[Roman Catholic]] countries from the 11th to the 14th centuries.&lt;ref name=CathEncy&gt;Patrick, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to]] the system begun by Dionysius.&lt;ref name=CathEncy-Chron &gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern Orthodox]] countries only began to adopt AD instead of the [[Byzantine calendar]] in 1700 when [[Russia]] did so, with others adopting it in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Although ''Anno Domini'' was in widespread use by the 9th century, the term "Before Christ" (or its equivalent) did not become common until much later. Bede used the expression ''"anno igitur ante incarnationem Dominicam"'' (so in the year before the incarnation of the Lord) twice. ''"Anno an xpi nativitate"'' (in the year before the birth of Christ) is found in 1474 in a work by a German monk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Rolevinck]] in ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]'' (1474) used ''Anno an xpi nativitatem'' (in the ...(th) year before the birth of Christ) for all years between [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] and [[Jesus]]. "xpi" is the [[Greek language|Greek]] χρι in Latin letters, which is an abbreviation for ''Christi''. This phrase appears upside down in the centre of [[recto|recto folios]] (right hand pages). From Jesus to [[Pope Sixtus IV]] he usually used ''Anno Christi'' or its abbreviated form ''Anno xpi'' (on [[verso]] folios—left hand pages). He used ''Anno mundi'' alongside all of these terms for all years.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1627, the French [[Jesuit]] [[theologian]] [[Denis Pétau]] (Dionysius Petavius in Latin), with his work ''De doctrina temporum'', popularized the usage ''ante Christum'' (Latin for "Before Christ") to mark years prior to AD.&lt;ref&gt;

===New year===
{{See|New Year}}
When the reckoning from Jesus' incarnation began replacing the previous dating systems in western Europe, various people chose different Christian feast days to begin the year: [[Christmas]], [[Annunciation]], or [[Easter]]. Thus, depending on the time and place, the year number changed on different days in the year, which created slightly different styles in chronology:&lt;ref&gt;[[C. R. Cheney]], [http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam032/99027383.pdf ''A Handbook of Dates, for students of British history''], Cambridge University Press, 1945–2000, pp. 8–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
* From 25 March 753 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the incarnation of Jesus. That first "Annunciation style" appeared in [[Arles]] at the end of the 9th century, then spread to Burgundy and northern Italy. It was not commonly used and was called ''calculus pisanus'' since it was adopted in [[Pisa]] and survived there till 1750.
* From 25 December 753 AUC (today in 1 BC), i.e., notionally from the birth of Jesus. It was called "Nativity style" and had been spread by Bede together with the ''Anno Domini'' in the early Middle Ages. That reckoning of the Year of Grace from Christmas was used in France, England and most of western Europe (except Spain) until the 12th century (when it was replaced by Annunciation style), and in Germany until the second quarter of the 13th century.
* From 25 March 754 AUC (today in AD 1). That second "Annunciation style" may have originated in [[Fleury Abbey]] in the early 11th century, but it was spread by the Cistercians. [[Florence]] adopted that style in opposition to that of Pisa, so it got the name of ''calculus florentinus''. It soon spread in France and also in England where it became common in the late 12th century and lasted until 1752.
* From Easter, starting in 754 AUC (AD 1). That ''mos gallicanus'' (French custom) bound to a [[moveable feast]] was introduced in France by king [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]] (r. 1180–1223), maybe to establish a new style in the provinces reconquered from England. However, it never spread beyond the ruling élite.
With these various styles, the same day could, in some cases, be dated in 1099, 1100 or 1101.

== Birth date of Jesus ==
{{see also|Date of birth of Jesus|Nativity of Jesus#Date of birth|Chronology of Jesus#Year of Jesus' birth}}
The date of birth of Jesus of Nazareth is not stated in the gospels or in any secular text, but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.&lt;ref name=JDG324 &gt;{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical evidence is too fragmentary to allow a definitive dating,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett 1992, p579: "Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating".&lt;/ref&gt; but the date is estimated through two different approaches – one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the Nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L. Maier]] "The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos: nativity and chronological studies'' by Jerry Vardaman, Edwin M.

==Other eras==
{{further|Calendar era}}
During the first six centuries of what would come to be known as the Christian era, European countries used various systems to count years. Systems in use included [[List of Roman consuls|consular dating]], imperial [[regnal year]] dating, and [[Anno Mundi|Creation dating]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Although the last non-imperial consul, [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius|Basilius]], was appointed in 541 by Emperor [[Justinian I]], later emperors through [[Constans II]] (641–668) were appointed consuls on the first 1 January after their accession. All of these emperors, except Justinian, used imperial post-consular years for the years of their reign, along with their regnal years.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Bagnall and Klaas A. Worp, ''[https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/11125 Chronological Systems of Byzantine Egypt]'', Leiden, Brill, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Long unused, this practice was not formally abolished until Novell XCIV of the law code of [[Leo VI the Wise|Leo VI]] did so in 888.

Another calculation had been developed by the [[Alexandria]]n monk [[Annianus of Alexandria|Annianus]] around the year AD 400, placing the Annunciation on 25 March AD 9 (Julian)—eight to ten years after the date that Dionysius was to imply. Although this incarnation was popular during the early centuries of the [[Byzantine Empire]], years numbered from it, an ''Era of Incarnation'', were exclusively used and are yet used, in [[Ethiopia]]. This accounts for the seven- or eight-year discrepancy between the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and [[Ethiopian calendar]]s. Byzantine chroniclers like [[Maximus the Confessor]], [[George Syncellus]], and [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] dated their years from Annianus' [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world. This era, called ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', "year of the world" (abbreviated AM), by modern scholars, began its first year on 25 March 5492 BC. Later Byzantine chroniclers used ''Anno Mundi'' years from 1 September 5509 BC, the [[Byzantine calendar|Byzantine Era]]. No single ''Anno Mundi'' epoch was dominant throughout the [[Christian world]]. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' used an era beginning with the birth of [[Abraham]], dated in 2016 BC (AD 1 = 2017 Anno Abrahami).&lt;ref&gt;Alfred von Gutschmid, ''Kleine Schriften'', F. Ruehl, Leipzig, 1889, p.433.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spain and Portugal continued to date by the [[Era of the Caesars]] or [[Spanish Era]], which began counting from 38 BC, well into the Middle Ages. In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last Catholic country to adopt the ''Anno Domini'' system.&lt;ref name=CathEncy/&gt;

The [[Era of Martyrs]], which numbered years from the accession of [[Diocletian]] in 284, who launched the last yet most severe [[persecution of Christians]], was used by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] and is still used, officially, by the Coptic Orthodox and [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] churches. It was also used by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] church. Another system was to date from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], which as early as [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] and [[Tertullian]] was believed to have occurred in the consulate of the Gemini (AD 29), which appears in some [[Middle Ages|medieval]] manuscripts.

The term ''common era'' does not appear in this book; the term ''Christian era'' [lowercase] does appear a number of times. Nowhere in the book is the abbreviation explained or expanded directly.
&lt;/ref&gt; the alternative abbreviations [[Common Era|CE and BCE]], (sometimes written C.E. and B.C.E.) are sometimes used in place of AD and BC.

The "Common/Current Era" ("CE") terminology is often preferred by those who desire a term that does not explicitly make religious references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ce_info1.htm |author=Robinson, B.A.|title=Justification of the use of "CE" &amp; "BCE" to identify dates.

For example, Cunningham and Starr (1998) write that "B.C.E./C.E. …do not presuppose faith in [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and hence are more appropriate for [[interfaith dialog]] than the conventional B.C./A.D."&lt;ref name=Cunningham2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Cunningham|first=ed. by Philip A.|title=Pondering the Passion : what's at stake for Christians and Jews?|year=2004|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|location=Lanham, Md.

== No year zero: start and end of a century ==
{{Further|0 (year)|Astronomical year numbering|Millennium|Century}}
In the AD year numbering system, whether applied to the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar]]s, AD 1 is preceded by 1 BC. There is no year "0" between them, so a new century begins in a year which has "01" as the final digits (e.g., 1801, 1901, 2001). New millennia likewise are considered to have begun in 1001 and 2001. This is at odds with the common conception that centuries and millennia begin when the trailing digits are zeroes (1800, 1900, 2000, etc.); for example, the [[Millennium celebrations|worldwide celebration of the new millennium]] took place on New Year's Eve 1999, when the year number ticked over to 2000.&lt;ref name="Teresi1997"/&gt;

For computational reasons, [[astronomical year numbering]] and the [[ISO 8601]] standard designate years so that AD 1 = year 1, 1 BC = year 0, 2 BC = year −1, etc.{{efn|To convert from a year BC to [[astronomical year numbering]], reduce the absolute value of the year by 1, and prefix it with a negative sign (unless the result is zero). For years AD, omit the AD and prefix the number with a plus sign (plus sign is optional if it is clear from the context that the year is after the year 0).&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, 1992, p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;}} In common usage, ancient dates are expressed in the Julian calendar, but ISO 8601 uses the Gregorian calendar and astronomers may use a variety of time scales depending on the application. Thus dates using the year 0 or negative years may require further investigation before being converted to BC or AD.

In [[Anglo-Israelism]] and some currents of U.S. [[Christian fundamentalism]], the idea has been advanced that modern [[Germans]] are partly descended from the ancient [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]]. This notion was entertained by [[Edward Hine]], although it is incorrect as the native Germans are actually to this day referenced as Allemanni in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] language. The only link to the region of Germany by Assyria is the speculative expedition into that region by mythological Prince Trebeta who allegedly colonized what is today [[Trier]], which is annunciated by the [[Archbishops of Trier]] in records known as the [[Gesta Treverorum]].

==British Israelism==
The idea can be traced to Edward Hine, an early proponent of [[British Israelism]], deriving the [[Anglo-Saxons]] from the [[Ten Lost Tribes|Ten Lost Tribes of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; The link between British Israelism, Assyrian, and Germanic ties is in a hypothetical sense by British Novelist Edward Hine comparing ancient Assyria and neighboring Israel to 20th century Britain and Germany. [[John Wilson (historian)|John Wilson]], the intellectual founder of British Israelism, had considered that not only the people of Great Britain, but all the [[Germanic peoples]] were descended from the Ten Lost Tribes. Hine took a more particularist view, deciding that only the British nation fulfilled the prophecy for Israel — he acknowledged an ethnic affiliation between Britons and Germans, but thought this reflected what he considered was a close relationship between the ancient Israelites and their neighbors the Assyrians (who had taken the Ten Lost Tribes into captivity in Assyria). Likewise, Britain and Germany's status as two great powers of the modern age he considered reflective of the ancient glories of the Kingdom of Israel and of Assyria. So there were two original competing views as to the relationship between the Germans and British-Israel; either the British people, alone, were identified with the Tribes of Israel ([[Edward Hine]]) or they included the Germans ([[John Wilson (historian)|John Wilson]]) and other European peoples (including the Dutch and Scandinavians).&lt;ref&gt;The Standard of Israel, 1876, Vol II, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Hine maintained that ''only'' the Ten Tribes of Israel were included within the British race and excluded the Continental Teutonic or German peoples, who he instead believed descended from Assyrians not Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Life From The Dead, 1874, Vol. I, pp. 327-328&lt;/ref&gt; Hine believed all the tribes of Israel settled in Britain only, with [[Manasseh]] who became the Americans (who mostly descended from British stock). Hine had identified the Ten Tribes as being together in Britain in that Ephraim were the drunkards and ritualists, Reuben the farmers, Dan the mariners, Zebulan the lawyers and writers, Asher the soldiers etc., or that these tribes were regional or local people in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Hine, The English Nation Identified with the Lost House of Israel by Twenty-Seven Identifications, (Manchester: Heywood, 1870), p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; Hine's particularist view was received with some hostility by other British Israelites, who maintained that other Europeans descended from the lost tribes of Israel, not solely Britain.&lt;ref&gt;The Standard of Israel, 1876, Vol.II, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hine believed that all of the ancient peoples mentioned in the Bible must also be present in the modern world, in order for the prophecies concerning them to be fulfilled. If a people was "lost" to the ages, it meant simply that the people must have migrated to a new region, changed their [[ethnonym]], and forgotten their history. Hine considered the Assyrians as such a "lost" people (unlike for example, the Egyptians), and he made no mention in his writings of the modern Assyrian community in the Middle East — a community that was largely unknown to Europe in his time. Although Assyria is portrayed as one of the great enemies of Israel in the Bible, Hine took pains to explain that he did not consider Germany to be an enemy of Britain, and his writings do not betray any anti-German feelings. In his ''Forty Seven Identifications'', he did admit ‘The Germans are not our enemies, and there is evidence to show that they could not become our enemies’.&lt;ref&gt;''Banner of Israel'', 1917, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers in his tradition, however, have often set Germany in the biblical role of Assyria as an enemy to Britain.

British Israelism often compares the militarism of the [[Nazi Germany|German Empire]] with that of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] as narrated in the Bible, by analogy establishing Britain, as the threatened party, with the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]. After World War II, the comparison was also extended to the supposed brutality towards the Jewish population.&lt;ref&gt;Julia M. O'Brien, ''Nahum and Atrocity'', Continuum International Publishing Group (2002), {{ISBN|1-84127-300-7}}, p. 115, quoting Craigie (1958)...&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revision of Assyrian extent of territory==

Adherents of the Assyria-Germany connection often revise the extent of land the Assyrians controlled (see [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]). British Israelites, for example, who equate Assyria to Germany claim that the Neo-Assyrian Empire extended to the [[Black Sea]] region and further north.&lt;ref name="earth-history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-history.com/Various/Compendium/hhc2ch01.htm|title=Volume 2 Chapter 1|website=Earth-history.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream historians, by contrast, believe land controlled by the Assyrians during the Neo-Assyrian Empire did not stretch that far, but only reached into southern, south western and north eastern [[Anatolia]], bordering [[Armenia]]. There is no historical evidence that the Assyrians crossed the [[Caucasus]] into Europe in Assyrian records of the time, and the furthest extent of their conquests would have been the southern borders of the Caucasus and the south eastern edge of the Black sea.&lt;ref&gt;''World History'', Volume 1, William J. Duiker, Cengage Learning, 2009, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]], which took control over the Assyrians and Babylonians in the 6th century BC. did extend its territory to the Black Sea and north-west into [[Thrace]]. British Israelites, however, maintain that this extended territory already existed ''before'' the Persians, often quoting as evidence the [[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]], which lists Assyria as having already extended to the Black Sea region.&lt;ref name="earth-history.com"/&gt; British Israelites also cite [[Pliny the Elder]], who mentioned a tribe dwelling around the north-western regions of the Black Sea (Romania or Ukraine) in the 1st century AD called the ''Assyriani'', who they believe were Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-history.com/Various/Compendium/hhc2toc.htm|title=Compendium History Vol. 2|website=Earth-history.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking the legends of Trebeta as having founded Trier in Germany in 2053 BC (1300 years before the establishment of Rome in 753 BC) as literal fact, and revising the extent of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] into south-western parts of Europe, British Israelites believe that the ancient Assyrians had a vast territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-history.com/Various/Compendium/hhc2ch03.htm|title=Volume 2 Chapter 3|website=Earth-history.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further corroborate this belief, British Israelites often quote from the [[Austrian Chronicle of 95 Seigneurs]] (see below).

==Jews deported by Assyrians to Germany==
British Israelites who adhere to the Assyria-German identification believe that a small portion of Jews were deported to Germany by the Assyrians.&lt;ref name="earth-history.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earth-history.com/Various/Compendium/hhc2ch04.htm|title=Volume 2 Chapter 4|website=Earth-history.com|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite II Kings 18: 13 which notes that the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] sacked several cities of Judah and captured several Jewish inhabitants. This deportation has been verified by archaeology, since an ancient Assyrian prism records Sennacherib deported a population of Judah
(see [[Taylor and Sennacherib Prisms]]). This population of Judah was deported (with the [[House of Israel]]) to the [[Medes]] but British Israelites believe that the Jews and Israelites who were deported by the Assyrians to the Medes, did not stay there, but migrated over time into parts of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalfarm.org/lostisrael/index.shtml|title=AnimalFarm.org - The British Nation Identified with Lost Israel  By Edward Hine|website=Animalfarm.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 14th-century [[Austrian Chronicle of 95 Seigneurs]] is usually cited by British Israelites, as it purports to trace an early Jewish settlement in Germany or Austria. The Chronicle connects the [[Dukes of Austria]] with the Jews rather than the Assyrians but states that Central Europe became to accept the Jewish faith or Jewish customs from 708-704 BC. British Israelites provide an answer for this: they believe since the Assyrians had long controlled parts of Europe (especially Germany) that the Germans or Austrians became to accept Jewish customs and faith in the 8th century BC because Sennacherib (who captured several cities in Judah) had deported its Jewish inhabitants into Eastern Europe along the Danube River, eventually reaching Austria and Germany.&lt;ref name="earth-history.com1"/&gt; The Chronicle lists 'Jewish Kings' who began from 708-704 BC during which a duke called Gennan converted to Judaism. Consequently, this Jewish population intermarried with the local rulers in the regions of Austria and Hungary, the pagans were subdued and the whole country was Jewish until c. 227 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Yair Davidiy, "Lost Israelite Identity" (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

Often cited to support these theories, is the legend of '''Judaesaptan'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://britam.org/now/now21.html|title=Brit-Am Now 21|first=Betty Matteson|last=Rhodes|website=britam.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Jewish Virtual Library]], this was a legendary Jewish kingdom, which several thousands of years ago sat in Austria or central Europe; it first appeared in writing in [[Gottfried Hagen]]'s chronicle ''Reimchronik'' (1270).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10396.html]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203831/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10396.html |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolfgang Lazius]] in the 16th century attempted to find the remains of the kingdom but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;H. Gold, ''Geschichte der Juden in Wien'' (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anglo-Saxons not Germanic==
British Israelites who are proponents of Hine's German-Assyria connection do not believe that the [[Anglo-Saxons]] were Germanic, but instead of [[Scythians|Scythian]] heritage, who ultimately descended from the ancient Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, ''Forty-seven Identifications'', (1878), pp. 16-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Hine pointed out that the Anglo-Saxons only spoke a Germanic language, and that the term 'German' was an [[exonym]] and that the Saxons were distinct to the other continental Germanic tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, pp. 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The term German, is an exonym of Deutsch and Deutschland (Germany).&lt;/ref&gt; Hine believed that the Anglo-Saxons were only in Germany for a short time as part of their migration to the appointed 'Islands' (which he identified as Britain) as their final resting place, as told where the Israelites would be resettled in Isaiah 24: 15; 42: 4; 49: 1; 51: 5 and Jeremiah 31: 10.&lt;ref&gt;Hine, pp. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first-mentioned "Germans" were actually a Celtic tribe, which had formerly lived east of the Rhine River. The Encyclopædia Britannica says: "Of the Gaulish [Celtic] tribes west of the Rhine... the Treveri claimed to be of German origin, and the same claim was made by a number of tribes in Belgium.... The meaning of this claim is not quite clear, as there is some obscurity concerning the origin of the name Germani. It appears to be a Gaulish term, and there is no evidence that it was ever used by the Germans themselves. According to Tacitus it was first applied to the Tungri, whereas Caesar records that four Belgic tribes... were collectively known as Germani.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide Church of God==
{{Further|Worldwide Church of God|Ambassador College}}
[[Herbert W. Armstrong]] in Chapter 5 of his ''Mystery of Ages'' (1985), "The Assyrians settled in central Europe, and the Germans, undoubtedly, are, in part, the descendents of the ancient Assyrians." (p.&amp;nbsp;183). In this, Armstrong draws upon the opinions of [[Herman L. Hoeh]], published in his 1963 ''Compendium of World History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=vol. 2, ch. 1: "If the Germans admitted to themselves and the world who they really are, all the world would recognize in Imperial Germany the reconstituted Assyrian Empire &amp;mdash; once the terror of all the civilized world!"|url=http://www.earth-history.com/Various/Compendium/hhc2ch01.htm|website=Earth-history.com|accessdate=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such suggestions are informed by Jerome's simile with Psalms 83:8.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeh, "Germany in Prophecy!" (1962). Also in Hoeh (1963) vol.2 ch.1.: "Jerome, who lived at the time when the Indo-Germanic tribes were invading Europe, provides this startling answer ... Yes! Jerome said so! But how did he know? He saw them! He was an eyewitness to their migrations from Mesopotamia and the shores of the Black and Caspian seas!"&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoeh (1963) draws on [[Verstegan]] (1605) and [[Johannes Turmair]] (1526) to conclude that ''[[Theod|Deutsch]]'' really derives from ''[[Tuisto]]'' whom he in turn identifies with [[Shem]]:
:''Tuitsch or Tuisto: Chief of thirty-two dukes. Noah gave him all the land between the Don River and the Rhine or what was called Grossgermania. This is the beginning of the 'neolithic' settlement of Europe. Tuitsch is, according to all ancient German commentaries and chronicles, a son of Noah. But which son? Noah adopted Tuitsch's children as his own. The ancient Germans understood the name Tuitsch to be the title 'Teacher.' He was therefore the great patriarch of his family who taught the divine will to his children. Tuitsch is the father of Mannus (who is the Assyrian Ninus). The son of Mannus, Trebeta, is the same man who is called the son of Ninus in classical writers. The son of Mannus or Ninus &amp;mdash; Trebeta &amp;mdash; built Trier, the first town of Germany.

As with Anglo-Israelism itself, proposed German-Assyrian connections enjoy no empirical support and are not current among mainstream historians, anthropologists, archaeologists or historical linguists.

Influenced by the [[Utopian socialism|utopian socialist]] [[Henri Saint-Simon]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; Comte developed the ''positive philosophy'' in an attempt to remedy the social malaise of the [[French Revolution]], calling for a new social doctrine based on the [[sciences]]. Comte was a major influence on 19th-century thought, influencing the work of social thinkers such as [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[George Eliot]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture25a.html#course&lt;/ref&gt; His concept of ''sociologie'' and  [[social evolutionism]] set the tone for early [[social theorist]]s and [[anthropologist]]s such as [[Harriet Martineau]] and [[Herbert Spencer]], evolving into modern academic sociology presented by [[Émile Durkheim]] as practical and objective [[social research]].

Comte's social theories culminated in his "[[Religion of Humanity]]",&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; which presaged the development of non-theistic [[Religious humanism|religious humanist]] and [[Secular humanism|secular humanist]] organizations in the 19th century. Comte may have coined the word ''altruisme'' ([[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=altruism (n .)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Auguste Comte was born in [[Montpellier]],&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; [[Hérault]] on 19 January 1798. After attending the [[Citadel of Montpellier|Lycée Joffre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mediatheque.montpellier-agglo.com/22887393/0/fiche___document/&amp;RH=1219250799417 |publisher= Montpellier Agglomeration |title= Rencontre avec Annie Petit "Auguste Comte" |date= 2007-10-19 |accessdate= 2008-10-15 |quote= "''Né à Montpellier, brillant élève du Lycée Joffre''..." Translation: "Born in Montpellier, shining student of the Lycée Joffre..." |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090215021044/http://mediatheque.montpellier-agglo.com/22887393/0/fiche___document/%26RH%3D1219250799417 |archivedate= 15 February 2009 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then the [[University of Montpellier]], Comte was admitted to the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris. The École Polytechnique was notable for its adherence to the French ideals of [[republicanism]] and [[Progress (history)|progress]]. The École closed in 1816 for reorganization, however, and Comte continued his studies at the medical school at Montpellier. When the École Polytechnique reopened, he did not request readmission.

Following his return to Montpellier, Comte soon came to see unbridgeable differences with his [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Monarchism|monarchist]] family and set off again for Paris, earning money by small jobs. In August 1817 he found an apartment at 36 [[rue Bonaparte]] in Paris' [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6ème]] (where he lived until 1822) and later that year he became a student and secretary to  [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who brought Comte into contact with intellectual society and greatly influenced his thought therefrom. During that time Comte published his first essays in the various publications headed by Saint-Simon, ''L'Industrie'', ''Le Politique'', and ''[[L'Organisateur]]'' ([[Charles Dunoyer]] and [[Charles Comte]]'s ''[[Le Censeur Européen]]''), although he would not publish under his own name until 1819's "La séparation générale entre les opinions et les désirs" ("The general separation of opinions and desires"). In 1824, Comte left Saint-Simon, again because of unbridgeable differences. Comte published a ''Plan de travaux scientifiques nécessaires pour réorganiser la société'' (1822) (''Plan of scientific studies necessary for the reorganization of society''). But he failed to get an academic post. His day-to-day life depended on sponsors and financial help from friends. Debates rage as to how much Comte appropriated the work of Saint-Simon.&lt;ref name="Pickering 192ff."&gt;Pickering (2006), p. 192ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte married [[Caroline Massin]] in 1825. In 1826, he was taken to a mental health hospital, but left without being cured – only stabilized by French alienist [[Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol]] – so that he could work again on his plan (he would later attempt suicide in 1827 by jumping off the [[Pont des Arts]]). In the time between this and their divorce in 1842, he published the six volumes of his ''Cours.''

Comte developed a close friendship with [[John Stuart Mill]]. From 1844, he fell deeply in love with the Catholic [[Clotilde de Vaux]], although because she was not divorced from her first husband, their love was never consummated. After her death in 1846 this love became quasi-religious, and Comte, working closely with Mill (who was refining his own such system) developed a new "[[Religion of Humanity]]". [[John Kells Ingram]], an adherent of Comte, visited him in Paris in 1855.

He published four volumes of ''[[Système de politique positive]]'' (1851–1854). His final work, the first volume of ''La Synthèse Subjective'' ("The Subjective Synthesis"), was published in 1856.

Comte died in Paris on 5 September 1857 from stomach cancer and was buried in the famous [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]], surrounded by cenotaphs in memory of his mother, Rosalie Boyer, and of Clotilde de Vaux.
His apartment from 1841–1857 is now conserved as the [[Maison d'Auguste Comte]] and is located at 10 rue Monsieur-le-Prince, in Paris' [[6th arrondissement of Paris|6th arrondissement]].

==Thought==

===Comte's positivism===
{{Main|Positivism|Law of three stages}}
Comte first described the [[epistemology|epistemological]] perspective of positivism in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1848 work, ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in English in 1865). The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasised the inevitable coming of [[social science]]. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ |title= Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte |website= plato.stanford.edu|chapter= Auguste Comte |publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year= 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte was also the first to distinguish natural philosophy from science explicitly. For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. His work ''View of Positivism'' would therefore set out to define, in more detail, the empirical goals of sociological method.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Comte offered an [[Sociocultural evolution|account of social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general 'law of three stages'.

Comte's stages were (1) the ''[[theological]]'' stage, (2) the ''[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]'' stage, and (3) the ''positive'' stage.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt;  (1) The Theological stage was seen from the perspective of 19th century France as preceding the [[Age of Enlightenment]], in which man's place in society and society's restrictions upon man were referenced to God. Man blindly believed in whatever he was taught by his ancestors. He believed in a supernatural power. [[Fetishism]] played a significant role during this time. (2) By the "Metaphysical" stage, Comte referred not to the Metaphysics of [[Aristotle]] or other ancient Greek philosophers. Rather, the idea was rooted in the problems of French society subsequent to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. This Metaphysical stage involved the justification of ''universal rights'' as being on a vauntedly higher plane than the authority of any human ruler to countermand, although said rights were not referenced to the sacred beyond mere metaphor. This stage is known as the stage of investigation, because people started reasoning and questioning, although no solid evidence was laid. The stage of investigation was the beginning of a world that questioned authority and religion. (3) In the Scientific stage, which came into being after the failure of the revolution and of [[Napoleon]], people could find solutions to social problems and bring them into force despite the proclamations of ''human rights'' or prophecy of ''the will of God.'' Science started to answer questions in full stretch. In this regard he was similar to [[Karl Marx]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]]. For its time, this idea of a Scientific stage was considered up-to-date, although from a later standpoint, it is too derivative of [[classical physics]] and [[academic history]]. Comte's [[law of three stages]] was one of the first theories of [[social evolutionism]].

[[File:Comte's Theory of Science.png |thumb|left|''Comte's Theory of Science'' – According to Comte, the whole of the sciences consists of theoretical and applied knowledge. Theoretical knowledge can generally be divided into physics and biology, which are the object of his research and can be further partitioned into subfields such as botany, zoology or mineralogy. Comte's ranking of scientific fields - in order, mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology and sociology - symbolizes a decreasing range of research and complexity of theoretical tools, but a growing complexity of the phenomena under investigation. Each field in this ranking depends upon those that came before it; for instance, our understanding of chemistry depends upon our understanding of physics, as all chemical phenomena are more complicated than the physics that underlie them, and although the laws of chemistry are affected by the laws of physics, the converse is not true. Similarly, sciences that appear earlier in Comte's hierarchy are considered to be older and more advanced than those which come later.]]

The other universal law he called the "encyclopedic law". By combining these laws, Comte developed a systematic and hierarchical classification of all sciences, including inorganic physics ([[astronomy]], [[earth science]] and [[chemistry]]) and organic physics ([[biology]] and, for the first time, ''physique sociale'', later renamed ''sociologie''). Independently from [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]]'s introduction of the term in 1780, Comte re-invented "sociologie", and introduced the term as a neologism, in 1838. Comte had earlier used the term "social physics", but that term had been appropriated by others, notably by [[Adolphe Quetelet]].

{{quote|The most important thing to determine was the natural order in which the sciences stand — not how they can be made to stand, but how they must stand, irrespective of the wishes of any one....This Comte accomplished by taking as the criterion of the position of each the degree of what he called "positivity", which is simply the degree to which the phenomena can be exactly determined. This, as may be readily seen, is also a measure of their relative complexity, since the exactness of a science is in inverse proportion to its complexity. The degree of exactness or positivity is, moreover, that to which it can be subjected to mathematical demonstration, and therefore mathematics, which is not itself a concrete science, is the general gauge by which the position of every science is to be determined. Generalizing thus, Comte found that there were five great groups of phenomena of equal classificatory value but of successively decreasing positivity. To these he gave the names: astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology.|[[Lester F. Ward]], ''The Outlines of Sociology'' (1898)}}

This idea of a special science (not the humanities, not [[metaphysics]]) for the social was prominent in the 19th century and not unique to Comte. It has recently been discovered that the term "sociology" (as a term considered coined by Comte) had already been introduced in 1780, albeit with a different meaning, by the French essayist [[Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès]] (1748–1836).&lt;ref&gt;''Des Manuscrits de Sieyès. 1773–1799'', Volumes I and II, published by Christine Fauré, Jacques Guilhaumou, Jacques Vallier et Françoise Weil, Paris, Champion, 1999 and 2007. See also Jacques Guilhaumou, ''Sieyès et le non-dit de la sociologie: du mot à la chose, in Revue d'histoire des sciences humaines'', Number 15, November 2006. ''Naissances de la science sociale''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ambitious (or many would say 'grandiose') way that Comte conceived of this special science of the social, however, was unique. Comte saw this new science, sociology, as the last and greatest of all sciences, one which would include all other sciences and integrate and relate their findings into a cohesive whole. It has to be pointed out, however, that he noted a seventh science, one even greater than sociology. Namely, Comte considered "[[Anthropology]], or true science of Man [to be] the last gradation in the Grand Hierarchy of Abstract Science."&lt;ref&gt;1874 translation of ''System of Positive Polity'', Vol. II, pages 356–347, cited in Urbanowicz, Charles F. 1992. "Four-Field Commentary". ''Anthropology Newsletter''. Volume 33, Number 9, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of Brazil.svg|left|thumb|The motto ''Ordem e Progresso'' ("Order and Progress") in the [[flag of Brazil]] is inspired by Auguste Comte's motto of positivism: ''L'amour pour principe et l'ordre pour base; le progrès pour but'' ("Love as a principle and order as the basis; Progress as the goal"). Several of those involved in the military coup d'état that deposed the [[Empire of Brazil]] and proclaimed Brazil to be [[Republic of Brazil|a republic]] were followers of the ideas of Comte.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wais.stanford.edu/Brazil/brazil_orderandprogress42703.html BRAZIL: Order and Progress, Ronald Hilton, World Association of International Studies Forum Q&amp;A, 4/27/03]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Comte's explanation of the Positive philosophy introduced the important relationship between theory, practice and human understanding of the world. On page 27 of the 1855 printing of [[Harriet Martineau]]'s translation of ''The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte'', we see his observation that, "If it is true that every theory must be based upon observed facts, it is equally true that facts can not be observed without the guidance of some theories. Without such guidance, our facts would be desultory and fruitless; we could not retain them: for the most part we could not even perceive them."&lt;ref&gt;Comte, A. b (1974 reprint). ''The positive philosophy of Auguste Comte freely translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau''. New York: AMS Press. (Original work published in 1855, New York: Calvin Blanchard, p. 27.b)&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte's emphasis on the interconnectedness of social elements was a forerunner of modern [[functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]]. Nevertheless, as with many others of Comte's time, certain elements of his work are now viewed as eccentric and unscientific, and his grand vision of sociology as the centerpiece of all the sciences has not come to fruition.

His emphasis on a quantitative, mathematical basis for decision-making remains with us today. It is a foundation of the modern notion of Positivism, modern quantitative [[statistical analysis]], and business decision-making. His description of the continuing cyclical relationship between theory and practice is seen in modern business systems of [[Total Quality Management]] (TQM) and [[Continual improvement process|Continuous Quality Improvement]] where advocates describe a continuous cycle of theory and practice through the four-part cycle of [[Plan-Do-Check-Act]] ([[PDCA]], the [[Shewhart cycle]]). Despite his advocacy of quantitative analysis, Comte saw a limit in its ability to help explain social phenomena.

The early sociology of [[Herbert Spencer]] came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms.

Comte's fame today owes in part to [[Émile Littré]], who founded ''The Positivist Review'' in 1867. Debates continue to rage, however, as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor, [[Henri de Saint-Simon]].

Comte influenced the [[Young Turks]] political movement.&lt;ref&gt;http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/hanioglu.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===The religion of humanity===
[[File:Templo positivista.jpg|thumb|right|Positivist temple in [[Porto Alegre]]]]
In later years, Comte developed the '[[religion of humanity]]' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the '[[positivist calendar]]'. For close associate [[John Stuart Mill]], it was possible to distinguish between a "good Comte" (the author of the ''Course in Positive Philosophy'') and a "bad Comte" (the author of the secular-religious ''system'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; The ''system'' was unsuccessful but met with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859) to influence the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour autrui" ("live for others"), from which comes the word "[[altruism]]".&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)" According to Davies (p. 28-29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law of three stages===
{{Main|Law of three stages}}
Comte was agitated by the fact that no one had synthesized physics, chemistry, and biology into a coherent system of ideas, so he began an attempt to reasonably deduce facts about the social world from the use of the sciences. Through his studies, he concluded that the growth of the human mind progresses in stages, and so must societies. He claimed the history of society could be divided into three different stages: theological, metaphysical, and positive. The Law of three Stages, an evolutionary theory, describes how history of societies is split into three sections due to new thoughts on philosophy. Comte believed that evolution was the growth of the human mind, splitting into stages and evolving through these stages. Comte concluded that society acts similarly to the mind.&lt;ref name="Delaney, Tim 2003"&gt;Delaney, Tim. "Auguste Comte". Council for Secular Humanism. ''Council for Secular Humanism'', Oct.-Nov. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions&amp;nbsp;{{ndash}} each branch of our knowledge&amp;nbsp;{{ndash}} passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the Theological, or fictitious; the Metaphysical, or abstract; and the Scientific, or positive.|A. Comte&lt;ref&gt;From ''The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte'' (trans. Harriet Martineau; London, 1853), Vol. I, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Law of Three Stages is the evolution of society in which the stages have already occurred or are currently developing. The reason why there are newly developed stages after a certain time period is that the system "has lost its power" and is preventing the progression of civilization, causing complicated situations in society. 10.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"&gt;Comte, Auguste, and Gertrud Lenzer. Auguste Comte and Positivism: The Essential Writings. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The only way to escape the situation is for people within the civilized nations to turn towards an "organic" new social system. Comte refers to kings to show the complications of re-establishment on society. Kings feel the need to reorganize their kingdom, but many fail to succeed because they do not consider that the progress of civilization needs reform, not perceiving that there is nothing more perfect than inserting a new, more harmonious system. Kings fail to see the effectiveness of abandoning old systems because they do not understand the nature of the present crisis. But in order to progress, there needs to be the necessary consequences that come with it, which is caused by a "series of modifications, independent of the human will, to which all classes of society contributed, and of which kings themselves have often been the first agents and most eager promoters".&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; The people themselves have the ability to produce a new system. This pattern is shown through the theological stage, metaphysical stage, and positive stage.

# Theological Stage
##The first stage, the theological stage, relies on supernatural or religious explanations of the phenomena of human behavior because "the human mind, in its search for the primary and final causes of phenomena, explains the apparent anomalies in the universe as interventions of supernatural agents".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bourdeau, Michel. Auguste Comte. Stanford University. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ [April 28, 2016].&lt;/ref&gt; The Theological Stage is the "necessary starting point of human intelligence", when humans turn to supernatural agents as the cause of all phenomena.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"&gt;"Auguste Comte." Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6Th Edition (2015): 1. MAS Ultra   School Edition. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; In this stage, humans focus on discovering absolute knowledge. Comte disapproved this stage because it turned to simple explanation humans created in their minds that all phenomena was caused by supernatural agents, rather than human reason and experience. Comte refers to Bacon’s philosophy that "there can be no real knowledge except that which rests upon observed facts", but he observes that the primitive mind could not have thought that way because it would have only created a vicious circle between observations and theories.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; "For if, on the one hand, every positive theory must necessarily be founded upon observations, it is, on the other hand, no less true that, in order to observe, our mind has need of some theory or other".&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Because the human mind could not have thought in that way in the origin of human knowledge, Comte claims that humans would have been "incapable of remembering facts", and would not have escaped the circle if it were not for theological conceptions, which were less complicated explanations to human life.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Although Comte disliked this stage, he explains that theology was necessary in the beginning of the developing primitive mind. 
## Fetishism
## Polytheism
## Monotheism
# Metaphysical or Abstract Stage
::The second stage, the metaphysical stage, is merely a modification of the first because a supernatural cause is replaced by an "abstract entity";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; it is meant to be a transitional stage, where there is the belief that abstract forces control the behavior of human beings. Because it is a transitional stage between the theological stage and the positive stage, Comte deemed it the least important of the three stages and was only necessary because the human mind cannot make the jump from the theological to the positive stage on its own. 

::The metaphysical stage is the transitional stage. Because "Theology and physics are so profoundly incompatible", and their "conceptions are so radically opposed in character", human intelligence must have a gradual transition.&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Other than this, Comte says that there is no other use for this stage. Although it is the least important stage, it is necessary because humans could not handle the significant change in thought from theological to positivity.&lt;ref name="Delaney, Tim 2003"/&gt; The metaphysical stage is just a slight modification of the previous stage, when people believed in the abstract forces rather than the supernatural. The mind begins to notice the facts themselves, caused by the emptiness of the metaphysical agents through "over subtle qualification that all right-minded persons considered them to be only the abstract names of the phenomena in question".&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; The mind becomes familiar with concepts, wanting to seek more, and therefore is prepared to move into the positive stage.

:3. Positive stage
::The last stage – the positive stage – is when the mind stops searching for the cause of phenomena and realizes that laws exist to govern human behavior, and that this stage can be explained rationally with the use of reason and observation, both of which are used to study the social world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Delaney, Tim. Auguste Comte. Council for Secular Humanism, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This stage relies on science, rational thought, and empirical laws. Comte believed that this study of sociology he created was "the science that [came] after all the others; and as the final science, it must assume the task of coordinating the development of the whole of knowledge"&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; because it organized all of human behavior.

The final, most evolved stage is the positivist stage, the stage when humans give up on discovering absolute truth, and turn towards discovering, through reasoning and observation, actual laws of phenomena.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; Humans realize that laws exist, and that the world can be rationally explained through science, rational thought, laws, and observation. Comte was a positivist, believing in the natural rather than the supernatural, and so he claimed that his time period, the 1800s, was in the positivist stage.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; He believed that within this stage, there is a hierarchy of sciences: mathematics, astronomy, terrestrial physics, chemistry, and physiology. Mathematics, the "science that relates to the measurement of magnitudes", is the most perfect science of all, and is applied to the most important laws of the universe.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; Astronomy is the most simple science, and is the first "to be subjected to positive theories".&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; Physics is less satisfactory than astronomy, because it is more complex, having less pure and systemized theories. Physics, as well as chemistry, are the "general laws of the inorganic world", and are harder to distinguish.&lt;ref name="Comte, Auguste 1975"/&gt; Physiology completes the system of natural sciences, and is the most important of all sciences because it is the "only solid basis of the social reorganization that must terminate the crisis in which the most civilized nations have found themselves".&lt;ref name="Auguste Comte 2015"/&gt; This stage will fix the problems in current nations, allowing progression and peace.
 
===A famous error of Comte===
Auguste Comte is famous for writing in his book "''The Positive Philosophy''" that people would never learn the chemical composition of the planets.  In thirty years people were beginning to learn just that through spectroscopy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spiff.rit.edu/richmond/asras/chemcomp_i/chemcomp_i.html How do we know the composition of stars?]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Balik''' ({{lang-bg|Балик}}, [[Byzantine Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Μπαλίκας}}; fl. c. 1320 and died 1347) was a noble of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] who increased the autonomy of his province and became [[Despot (court title)|despot]] of the [[Principality of Karvuna]]. During the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347]] he supported the regent [[Anna of Savoy]] against pretender [[John VI Kantakouzenos]]. Balik died in 1347, either during an outbreak of the [[Black Death]] or killed during a retaliation campaign led by [[Umur Beg]], on behalf of [[John V Palaiologos]], that destroyed Dobruja's seaports. His brother [[Dobrotitsa]] succeeded him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30331">The '''Bancroft Prize''' is awarded each year by the trustees of [[Columbia University]] for books about [[diplomacy]] or the history of the [[Americas]]. It was established in 1948 by a bequest from [[Frederic Bancroft]].  The prize has been generally considered to be among the most prestigious awards{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} in the field of American history writing and comes with a $10,000 stipend (raised from $4,000 beginning in 2004).  Seventeen winners had their work supported by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and 16 winners were also recipients of the [[Pulitzer Prize for History]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neh.gov/projects/prizewinners.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The prize was affected by the post-award controversy involving the scholarship of [[Michael A. Bellesiles]], who received the prize for his work in 2001. Following independent investigations, Columbia University rescinded the prize for the first time.

'''Bonapartism''' is the political ideology of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and his followers and successors. It was later used to refer to people who hoped to restore the [[House of Bonaparte]] and its style of government. After Napoleon, the term was applied to the French politicians who seized power in the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]], ruling in the [[French Consulate]] and subsequently in the [[First French Empire|First]] and [[Second French Empire|Second]] French Empires under the [[House of Bonaparte]] (the family of Bonaparte and his nephew [[Napoleon III of France|Louis-Napoleon]]). The term was used more generally for a political movement that advocated a dictatorship or [[authoritarian]] [[centralized government|centralized state]], with a [[strongman (political)|strongman]] charismatic leader based on [[populism|anti-elitist]] rhetoric, army support, and conservatism.

[[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] developed a vocabulary of political terms that included Bonapartism, derived from their analysis of the career of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. [[Karl Marx]] was a student of [[Jacobinism]] and the [[French Revolution]], and was a contemporary critic of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. He used "Bonapartism" to refer to a situation in which counter-revolutionary military officers seize power from revolutionaries, and use selective reforms to co-opt the radicalism of the popular classes. Marx argued that in the process, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower ruling class.

According to his essay "[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]" (1852), Marx believed that both Napoleon and his nephew [[Napoleon III]] had corrupted revolutions in [[France]] in this way. In this document, he drew attention to what he calls the phenomenon's repetitive history by saying: "Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce."

More generally, "Bonapartism" may be used to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by military leadership within revolutionary movements or governments. Many &lt;!--who, specifically, with cite to RS --&gt;modern-day [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] and other leftists use the phrase "left Bonapartist" to describe those, such as [[Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong|Mao]], who controlled 20th-century bureaucratic socialist regimes. In addition, [[Leon Trotsky]] was accused of using his position as commander of the [[Red Army]] to gain top-level power after [[Lenin]]'s death.

Noted political scientists and historians greatly differ on the definition and interpretation of Bonapartism. Sudhir Hazareesingh's book ''The Legend of Napoleon'' explores numerous interpretations of the term. He says that it refers to a 
"popular national leader confirmed by popular election, above party politics, promoting equality, progress, and social change, with a belief in religion as an adjunct to the State, a belief that the central authority can transform society and a belief in the 'nation' and its glory and a fundamental belief in national unity."{{cn|date=December 2015}} Hazareesingh believes that although recent research shows Napoleon used forced conscription of French troops, some men must have fought believing in Napoleon's ideals. He says that to argue Bonapartism co-opted the masses is an example of the Marxist perspective of [[false consciousness]]: the idea that the masses can be manipulated by a few determined leaders in the pursuit of ends. 

==Ideology==

Philosophically, Bonapartism was Napoleon's adaptation of principles of the [[French Revolution]] to suit his imperial form of rule. Desires for public order, French national glory, and emulation of the [[Roman Empire]] had combined to create a [[Caesarism|Caesarist]] ''coup d'etat'' for General Bonaparte on [[18 Brumaire]]. Though he espoused adherence to revolutionary precedents, he "styled his direct and personal rule on the Old Regime monarchs."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Truesdell |first=Matthew |title=Spectacular Politics: Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte and the Fête impériale, 1849-1870 |year=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-510689-3|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8f1SwirhmHMC&amp;pg=PA58 |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Bonapartists, the most significant lesson of the Revolution was that unity of government and the governed was paramount. 

The [[Bee (mythology)|honey bee]] was a prominent political emblem for both the First and Second Empires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.napoleon.org/en/essential_napoleon/symbols/index.asp#abeilles |title=History of the Two Empires: The Symbols of Empire |author= |year=2008 |publisher=Fondation Napoléon |accessdate=17 September 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the Bonapartist ideal of devoted service, self-sacrifice and social loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Englund |first=Steven  |title=Napoleon: A Political Life |year=2005 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-674-01803-7 |page=240 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N-ZJbxGwU4cC&amp;pg=PA240|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining characteristics of political Bonapartism were flexibility and adaptability. [[Napoleon III]] once commented on the diversity of opinions in his cabinet, united under the banner of Bonapartism. Referring to the leading figures in the government of the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]], he remarked: "The [[Empress Eugenie|Empress]] is a [[Legitimist]], [[Duc de Morny|Morny]] is an [[Orléanist]], [[Prince Napoléon Bonaparte|Prince Napoleon]] is a [[republicanism|Republican]], and I myself am a [[Socialist]]. There is only one Bonapartist, [[Persigny]]&amp;nbsp;–  and he is mad!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jerrold |first=Blanchard |title=The Life of Napoleon III |year=1882 |publisher=Longmans, Green |location=London |page=378 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hbUwAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA378|accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Common Violet.JPG|thumb|During his exile to Elba (1814–1815), Napoleon Bonaparte announced he would return in the spring. The violet became a symbol of this and of Bonapartism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lindsay|first=Suzanne G.|title=Funerary Arts and Tomb Cult: Living with the Dead in France, 1750-1870|year=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2261-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pONxfBACLPUC&amp;pg=PA172 172] (footnote 16)}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[France|French]] [[politics|political]] history, ''[[Bonapartiste]]s'' were [[monarchist]]s who desired a French Empire under the House of Bonaparte, the [[Corsica]]n family of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (Napoleon I of France) and his nephew Louis-Napoleon ([[Napoleon III of France]]).

Bonapartism developed after Napoleon I was exiled to [[Elba]]. The Bonapartists helped him regain his power, leading to the [[Hundred Days]] period. Some of his acolytes could not accept his defeat in 1815 at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] or the [[Congress of Vienna]], and continued to promote the Bonaparte ideology. After Napoleon I's death in exile on [[Saint Helena]] in 1821, many of these people transferred their allegiance to other members of his family. After the death of Napoleon's son, the Duke of Reichstadt (known to Bonapartists as [[Napoleon II]]), Bonapartist hopes rested on several different members of the family.&lt;ref name=Riff1990&gt;{{Cite book|last=Riff |first=Michael A.|title=Dictionary of Modern Political Ideologies |year=1990 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-3289-9|page=33 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh4NAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disturbances of 1848 gave hope to the nascent political undercurrent. Bonapartism, as an ideology of politically neutral French peasants and workers (EJ Hobsbawm), was essential in the election of Napoleon I's nephew Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte as [[President of France|President]] of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], and gave him the political support necessary for his 1852 discarding of the constitution and proclaiming the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte assumed the title [[Napoleon III]] to acknowledge the brief reign of Napoleon's son Napoleon II at the end of the [[Hundred Days]] in 1815 (see the [[abdication of Napoleon (1815)|abdication of Napoleon I]] in 1815).

In 1870, the [[French National Assembly]] forced Napoleon III to sign a declaration of war against Prussia; France suffered a disastrous defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The emperor surrendered to the Prussians and their German allies to avoid further bloodshed at the [[Battle of Sedan (1870)]]. He went into exile after a parliamentary coup created the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Acton|first=Lord |authorlink=John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton |title=The Cambridge Modern History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SNFmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA495|accessdate=18 September 2011|year=1909|publisher=Macmillan Co. |location=New York |page=495ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonapartists continued to agitate for another member of the family to be placed on the throne. From 1871 forward, they competed with [[Monarchist]] groups that favoured the restoration of the family of [[Louis-Philippe]], [[King of the French]] (1830–1848) (the [[Orléanist]]s), and also with those who favoured the restoration of the [[House of Bourbon]], the traditional French [[royal family]] ([[Legitimist]]s). The strength of these three factions combined was powerful, but they did not unite on the choice of the new French monarch. Monarchist fervor eventually waned, and the French Republic became more or less a permanent facet of French life. Bonapartism was slowly relegated to being the civic faith of a few romantics as more of a hobby than a practical political philosophy. The death knell for Bonapartism was probably sounded when [[Eugène Bonaparte]], the only son of Napoleon III, was [[Anglo-Zulu War|killed in action]] while serving as a [[British Army]] officer in [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] in 1879. Thereafter Bonapartism ceased to be a significant political force.

The current head of the Bonaparte family is the Prince Napoleon, great-great-great-grandson of Napoleon I's brother Jérôme Bonaparte, [[Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon|Jean-Christophe Napoléon]] (born 1986). There are no remaining descendants in the male line from any other of Napoleon's brothers. There is no serious political movement that aims to restore any of these men to the imperial throne of France.

==Bonapartist claimants==
[[File:Pierson - Jérôme Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|Jérôme Bonaparte, founder of the legitimate line]]

After becoming Emperor in 1804, Napoleon I established a Law of Succession, providing that the Bonapartist claim to the throne should pass firstly to Napoleon's own legitimate male descendants through the male line. At that time he had no legitimate sons, and it seemed unlikely he would have any due to the age of his wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Joséphine]]. He eventually achieved an annulment, without Papal approval, of his marriage to Josephine. He married the younger [[Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma]], with whom he had one son. 

The law of succession provided that if Napoleon's own direct line died out, the claim passed first to his older brother Joseph and his legitimate male descendants through the male line, then to his younger brother Louis and his legitimate male descendants through the male line. His other brothers, Lucien and Jerome, and their descendants, were omitted from the succession (even though Lucien was older than Louis) because they had either politically opposed the Emperor or made marriages of which he disapproved. Napoleon abdicated in favor of his son after his defeat in 1815. Although the Bonapartes were deposed and the old Bourbon monarchy restored, Bonapartists recognized this child as Napoleon II. A sickly child, he was virtually imprisoned in Austria, and died young and unmarried, without any descendants. When the Bonaparte Empire was restored to power in France in 1852, the Emperor was Napoleon III, [[Louis Bonaparte]]'s only living legitimate son (their brother Joseph having died in 1844 without having had a legitimate son, only daughters).

In 1852, Napoleon III enacted a new decree on the succession. The claim was given to his own male legitimate descendants in the male line (though at that time he had no son, Louis later had a legitimate son, [[Eugène Bonaparte]], who was recognized by Bonapartists as "Napoleon IV" before dying young and unmarried). If Napoleon III's line died out, he decreed that the claim should pass to Jerome, Napoleon's youngest brother (who had previously been excluded), and his male descendants by Princess [[Catharina of Württemberg]] in the male line. (Excluded were his descendants by his first marriage, to the American commoner [[Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte|Elizabeth Patterson]], of which Napoleon I had greatly disapproved.) The Bonapartist claimants since 1879, have been the descendants of Jerome and Catherine of Württemberg in the male line.

The Bonapartist laws of succession were far from traditional. The family members ignored [[primogeniture]] (by excluding [[Lucien Bonaparte]] and his descendants); they annulled marriages to achieve their goals; and they did not submit to the Pope's rights as final arbiter on the validity of marriages. The very claim of the Bonaparte family to rule France was far from traditional.

==Marxism==

Based on the career of [[Louis Bonaparte]], [[Marxism]] and [[Leninism]] defined Bonapartism as a political expression.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1852/18th-brumaire/], Marxists website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] was a student of [[Jacobinism]] and the [[French Revolution]], as well as a contemporary critic of the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] and [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. He used the term ''[[Bonapartism (Marxism)|Bonapartism]]'' to refer to a situation in which [[counterrevolutionary]] military officers seize power from [[revolutionaries]], and use selective [[reformism]] to co-opt the radicalism of the masses. In the process, Marx argued, Bonapartists preserve and mask the power of a narrower [[ruling class]]. He believed that both Napoleon I and Napoleon III had corrupted revolutions in France in this way.  Marx offered this definition of and analysis of Bonapartism in ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte]]'', written in 1852. In this document, he drew attention to what he calls the phenomenon's repetitive history with one of his most quoted lines, typically condensed aphoristically as: "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Surveys in Exile |last=Marx |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Marx |editor=David Fernbach |year=1973 |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth, UK |isbn=978-0-14-021603-5 |page=146 |quote=Hegel remarks somewhere that all great events and characters of world history occur, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx believed that a Bonapartist regime could exert great power, because there was no class with enough confidence or power to firmly establish its authority in its own name. A leader who appeared to stand above the class struggle could take the mantle of power. He believed that this was an inherently unstable situation, as the apparently all-powerful leader would be swept aside when the class struggle in society was resolved. 

[[Leon Trotsky]] described [[Joseph Stalin]]'s regime as Bonapartist, as he believed it was balanced between the [[proletariat]], victorious but shattered by war, and the [[bourgeoisie#The Marxist view|bourgeoisie]], broken by the revolution but struggling to re-emerge.  The failure of Stalin's regime to disintegrate under the shock and disruption of the losses of the Second World War, and the success of its expansion into Eastern Europe, challenged this analysis. Many [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]] rejected the idea that Stalin's regime was Bonapartist. [[Tony Cliff]] described such regimes as [[State capitalism#Use by Trotskyists|state capitalist]] in type and not as deformed [[socialist state|workers' states]] at all. In the last year of his life, Trotsky argued the example of Napoleon's expanding empire. He had achieved the abolition of serfdom in Poland and other French holdings, but his empire was still "Bonapartist."

"Bonapartism" may be used generally to describe the replacement of civilian leadership by military leadership within revolutionary movements or governments. Some modern-day Trotskyists and others on the left use the phrase ''left Bonapartist'' to describe leaders such as Stalin and [[Mao Zedong]], who controlled left-wing or populist totalitarian regimes. Bonapartism was an example of the Marxist idea of false consciousness: the masses could be manipulated by a few determined leaders in the pursuit of ends.

==Bonapartism in the French political spectrum==

According to historian [[René Rémond]]'s famous 1954 book, ''Les Droites en France'', Bonapartism constitutes one of the three French [[right-wing]] families; the latest one after [[far-right]] [[Legitimism]] and [[center-right]] [[Orleanism]]. Both [[Boulangisme]] and [[Gaullism]] would be forms of Bonapartism.

However, Bonapartists have consistently disagreed with this classification, as one of the fundamentals of Bonapartism as an ideology is the refusal to adhere to the left-right divide, which they see as an obstacle to the welfare and unity of the nation. Martin S Alexander, in his book "French History since Napoleon" (London, Arnold, New York, Oxford University Press, 1999) notes that Bonapartism as an idea would not have made a significant impact if it had been classifiable as either left-wing or right-wing. The historian Jean Sagnes in "The roots of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte's Socialism" notes that the future Emperor of the French edited his political works through far-left publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Sagnes |title= Les racines du socialisme de Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte |location= Toulouse |publisher= Privat |date= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Bonapartist philosophy would fit into the space occupied by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Parti Socialiste]], the [[Democratic Movement (France)|Mouvement Démocrate]], the [[European Social Liberal Party|Nouveau Centre]] and the left wing of the conservative [[Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]], as these parties occupy the ideological space between parties advocating class struggle and race-based politics, both of which are anathema to Bonapartists, as contrary to the ideal of national unity and religious and ethnic tolerance. This is demonstrated by Napoleonic policy towards industrial disputes, one expression of which&amp;nbsp;– as Frank McLynn writes&amp;nbsp;–  is that strikes were forbidden by Napoleon I but in exchange the police sometimes prevented wages from being lowered,{{sfnp|McLynn|1998|page=482}} while another is the [[Napoleon and the Jews|assimilation and protection of the Jews.]]

The Marxist theory of "Left" and "Right" Bonapartism can be considered an illustration of what McLynn refers to as Napoleon I's appeal in equal measure "to both the Right and the Left",{{sfnp|McLynn|1998|page=667}} and what Vincent Cronin describes as "middle of the way", or "moderate" government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vincent Cronin |date=1994 |title=Napoleon |publisher=HarperCollins |chapter=Chapter 19 |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon III situated Bonapartism (or the "Napoleonic Idea") between the radicals and conservatives (respectively the Left and the Right) in "Des Idées Napoléoniennes", published in 1839. He expounded on this point to explain that Bonapartism, as practiced by his uncle Napoleon the Great (and represented by himself) was in the middle of "two hostile parties, one of which looks only to the past, and the other only to the future" and combined "the old forms" of the one and the "new principles" of the other.

==Modern Bonapartism==
{{further|Neo-Bonapartism}}

In contemporary times, the term "Bonapartism" has been used in a general sense to describe autocratic, highly centralized regimes dominated by the military.&lt;ref name=Calhoun&gt;{{Cite book |last=Calhoun |first=Craig J. |authorlink=Craig Calhoun |title=Dictionary of the Social Sciences |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=978-0-19-512371-5 |page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfISGq3aB2UC&amp;pg=PA47 |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, an official ''Mouvement Bonapartiste'' exists, based in France, headed by Paul-Napoléon Pierre Calland with an unknown number of members around the world. Its official mission statement is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]o defend, make known and to spread the principles and values of Bonapartism. [The movement] is based on popular support for a policy of recovery combining the efforts of individuals, associations and State services. The movement defends the Bonapartist principles on which it is founded, and which govern its internal organisation. It also defends the memory of Napoleon the Great, as well as those of Napoleon III and their sons, Napoleon II and Napoleon IV. It recognises Napoleon IV as having reigned without governing, by virtue of the plebiscite of May 1870. The movement recognises no emperor after 1879, because of the absence of a plebiscite. Republican, it gives priority to the happiness, interest and glory of peoples, and envisages the restoration of the Empire only if the foundations of the regime are republican and approved by referendum."&lt;ref name=mouvementbonapartiste&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mouvementbonapartiste.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/bonapartist-movement |title=Bonapartist Movement |year=2011 |publisher=Mouvement Bonapartiste |accessdate=18 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''calendar era''' is the '''year numbering''' system used by a [[calendar]]. For example, the [[Gregorian calendar]] numbers its years in the Western [[Christian era]] (the [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] churches have their own Christian eras). The instant, date, or year from which time is marked is called the ''[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]'' of the era. There are many different calendar eras such as [[Saka Era]].

In antiquity, [[regnal year]]s were counted from the accession of a monarch. This makes the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East]] very difficult to reconstruct, based on disparate and scattered king lists, such as the [[Sumerian King List]] and the Babylonian [[Canon of Kings]]. In East Asia, reckoning by [[era name]]s chosen by ruling monarchs ceased in the 20th century except for [[Japan]], where they are still used.

==Ancient dating systems==

===Assyrian eponyms===
{{main|Eponym dating system}}

For over a thousand years, ancient [[Assyria]] used a system of [[Eponym dating system|eponyms]] to identify each year. Each year at the [[Akitu]] festival (celebrating the Mesopotamian new year), one of a small group of high officials (including the king in later periods) would be chosen by lot to serve as the ''[[limmu]]'' for the year, which meant that he would preside over the Akitu festival and the year would bear his name. The earliest attested ''limmu'' eponyms are from the Assyrian trading colony at [[Kültepe|Karum Kanesh]] in Anatolia, dating to the very beginning of the 2nd millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CDLI: The Old and Middle Assyrian limmu officials|url=http://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=list_of_old_assyrian_limmu_officials|website=Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they continued in use until the end of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]], ca. 612 BC.

Assyrian scribes compiled ''limmu'' lists, including an unbroken sequence of almost 250 eponyms from the early 1st millennium BC. This is an invaluable chronological aid, because a solar eclipse was recorded as having taken place in the ''limmu'' of Bur-Sagale, governor of [[Tell Halaf|Guzana]]. Astronomers have identified this eclipse as [[Assyrian eclipse|one that took place on 15 June, 763 BC]], which has allowed absolute dates of 892 to 648 BC to be assigned to that sequence of eponyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millard|first1=Alan|title=The Eponyms of the Assyrian Empire, 910-612 BC (State Archives of Assyria Studies, Vol. 2)|date=1994|publisher=Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-9514567155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list of absolute dates has allowed many of the events of the Neo-Assyrian Period to be dated to a specific year, avoiding the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|chronological debates]] that characterize earlier periods of Mesopotamian history.

===Olympiad dating===
Among the ancient Greek historians and scholars, a common method of indicating the passage of years was based on the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], first held in [[776 BC]]. The Olympic Games provided the various independent city-states with a mutually recognizable system of dates. Olympiad dating was not used in everyday life. This system was in use from the 3rd century BC. The modern Olympic Games (or Summer Olympic Games beginning 1896) do not continue the four year periods from ancient Greece: the 669th Olympiad would have begun in the summer of 1897, but the modern Olympics were first held in 1896.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;Blackburn, B. &amp; Holford-Strevens, L. (1999, 2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the Year: an exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning'' (corrected printing). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-214231-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|769}}

===Indiction cycles===
Another common system was the [[indiction]] cycle (15 indictions made up an agricultural tax cycle in Roman Egypt, an indiction being a year in duration). Documents and events began to be dated by the year of the cycle (e.g., "fifth indiction", "tenth indiction") in the 4th century, and this system was used long after the tax ceased to be collected. It was used in [[Gaul]], in [[Egypt]], and in most parts of Greece until the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt|Islamic conquest]], and in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] until its conquest in 1453. 

The rule for computing the indiction from the AD year number, which he had just invented, was stated by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]: add 3 and divide by 15; the remainder is the indiction, with 0 understood to be the fifteenth indiction.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|770}} Thus 2001 was the ninth indiction.&lt;ref&gt;Nautical Almanac Office of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] and [[Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]]. (2000)''[[The Nautical Almanac]] for the year 2001''. [[Washington, DC]]: [[Government Printing Office]] and [[London, England]], UK: [[The Stationery Office]]. p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the year for the indiction varied.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|769–71}}

===Seleucid era===
{{main|Seleucid era}}

The Seleucid era was used in much of the Middle East from the 4th century BC to the 6th century AD, and continued until the 10th century AD among Oriental Christians. The era is computed from the epoch 312 BC: in August of that year [[Seleucus I Nicator]] captured [[Babylon]] and began his reign over the Asian portions of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire. Thus depending on whether the calendar year is taken as starting on 1 [[Tishri]] or on 1 [[Nisan]] (respectively the start of the Jewish civil and ecclesiastical years) the Seleucid era begins either in 311 BC (the Jewish reckoning) or in 312 BC (the Greek reckoning: October–September).

===Ancient Rome===

====Consular dating====
An early and common practice was Roman '[[Roman consul|consular]]' dating. This involved naming both [[Consul Ordinarius|''consules ordinarii'']] who had taken up this office on January 1 (since 153 BC) of the relevant civil year.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|6}} Sometimes one or both consuls might not be appointed until November or December of the previous year, and news of the appointment may not have reached parts of the Roman empire for several months into the current year; thus we find the occasional inscription where the year is defined as "after the consulate" of a pair of consuls.

The use of consular dating ended in AD 541 when the emperor [[Justinian I]] discontinued appointing consuls. The last consul nominated was [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius]]. Soon afterwards, imperial regnal dating was adopted in its place.

====Dating from the founding of Rome====
Another method of dating, rarely used, was ''[[anno urbis conditae]]'' (Latin: "in the year of the founded city" (abbreviated AUC), where "city" meant Rome). (It is often incorrectly given that AUC stands for ''[[ab urbe condita]]'', which is the title of [[Livy|Titus Livius]]'s history of Rome.)

Several epochs were in use by Roman historians. Modern historians usually adopt the epoch of [[Varro]], which we place in 753 BC.

The system was introduced by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in the 1st century BC. The first day of its year was Founder's Day (April 21), although most modern historians assume that it coincides with the modern historical year (January 1 to December 31). It was rarely used in the [[Roman calendar]] and in the early Julian calendar – naming the two [[consul]]s that held office in a particular year was dominant. AD {{CURRENTYEAR}} is thus approximately the same as AUC {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} ({{CURRENTYEAR}} + 753).

About AD 400, the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] used the AUC era. Pope [[Boniface IV]] (about AD 600) may have been the first to use both the AUC era and the ''Anno Domini'' era (he put AD 607 = AUC 1360).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007|reason='although it occurs occasionally in papal documents of the time of John XIII (965-972), it was not the rule before the twelfth century': http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04636c.htm - and that's not even about using abbreviations}}

====Regnal years of Roman emperors====
Another system that is less commonly found than might be thought was the use of the [[regnal year]] of the [[Roman emperor]]. At first, [[Augustus]] indicated the year of his reign by counting how many times he had held the office of consul, and how many times the [[Roman Senate]] had granted him [[Tribune|Tribunican]] powers, carefully observing the fiction that his powers came from these offices granted to him, rather than from his own person or the many [[Roman legion|legion]]s under his control. His successors followed his practice until the memory of the [[Roman Republic]] faded (about AD 200), when they began to use their regnal year openly.

====Dating from the Roman conquest====
Some regions of the [[Roman Empire]] dated their calendars from the date of Roman conquest, or the establishment of Roman rule.

The [[Spanish era]] counted the years from 38 BC, probably the date of a new tax imposed by the Roman Republic on the subdued population of Iberia. The date marked the establishment of Roman rule in Spain and was used in official documents in Portugal, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], and in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], into the 14th century. This system of calibrating years fell to disuse in 1381 and was replaced by today's ''Anno Domini''.&lt;ref&gt;Gedaliah ibn Jechia the Spaniard, ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah'', Jerusalem 1962, p. 271 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods, the [[Decapolis]] and other Hellenized cities of Syria and Palestine used the [[Pompeian era]], counting dates from the Roman general [[Pompey]]'s conquest of the region in 63 BC.

===Maya===
A different form of calendar was used to track longer periods of time, and for the inscription of calendar dates (i.e., identifying when one event occurred in relation to others). This form, known as the Long Count, is based upon the number of elapsed days since a mythological starting-point. According to the calibration between the Long Count and Western calendars accepted by the great majority of Maya researchers (known as the GMT correlation), this starting-point is equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or 6 September in the Julian calendar (−3113 astronomical).

===Other dating systems===
A great many local systems or [[era]]s were also important, for example the year from the foundation of one particular city, the regnal year of the neighboring [[History of Persia|Persian emperor]], and eventually even the year of the reigning [[Caliph]].

==Late Antiquity and Middle Ages==
Most of the traditional calendar eras in use today were introduced at the time of transition from [[Late Antiquity]] to the [[Early Middle Ages]], roughly between the 6th and 10th centuries.

===Christian era===
*The ''[[Etos Kosmou]]'' of the [[Byzantine Calendar]] places Creation at the beginning of its year 1, namely 5509 BC. Its first known use occurred in the 7th century AD, although its precursors were developed about AD 400. The year 7509 of this era began in September 2000.
*The [[Era of Martyrs]] or Era of Diocletian is reckoned from the beginning of the reign of Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]]; the first year of this era was 284/5. It was not the custom to use regnal years in Rome, but it was the custom in Roman Egypt, which the emperor ruled through a prefect (the king of Egypt). The year number changed on the first day of the Egyptian month [[Thoth]] (29 August three years out of four, 30 August the year before a Roman leap year.) Diocletian abolished the special status of Egypt, which thereafter followed the normal Roman calendar: consular years beginning on 1 January. This era was used in the Easter tables prepared in Alexandria long after the abdication of Diocletian, even though Diocletian was a notorious persecutor of Christians. The Era of Diocletian was retained by the [[Coptic calendar|Coptic Church]] and used for general purposes, but by 643 the name had been changed to Era of the Martyrs.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|766–7}}
*The [[Ethiopian calendar|Incarnation Era]] is used by [[Ethiopia]]. Its epoch is August 29, AD 8 in the Julian calendar.
*The [[Armenian calendar]] has its era fixed at AD 552.

====Dionysian "Common Era"====
{{Main|Anno Domini|Common Era}}

The era based on the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of [[Christ]] was introduced by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in 525 and is in continued use with various reforms and derivations. The distinction between the Incarnation being the conception or the [[Nativity of Jesus]] was not drawn until the late ninth century.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|881}} The beginning of the numbered year varied from place to place: when, in 1600, Scotland adopted January 1 as the date the year number changes, this was already the case in much of continental Europe. England adopted this practice in 1752.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|7}}

* A.D. (or AD) – for the [[Latin]] ''[[Anno Domini]]'', meaning "in the year of (our) Lord". This is the dominant or Western Christian Era; AD is used in the Gregorian calendar. ''[[Anno Salutis]]'', meaning "in the year of salvation" is identical. Originally intended to number years from the Incarnation of [[Jesus]], according to modern thinking the calculation was a few years off. Years preceding AD 1 are numbered using the BC era, avoiding zero or negative numbers. AD was also used in the medieval [[Julian calendar]], but the first day of the year was either March 1, [[Easter]], March 25, September 1, or December 25, not January 1. To distinguish between the Julian and Gregorian calendars, ''O.S.'' and ''N.S.'' were often added to the date, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries, when both calendars were in common use. [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] (O.S.) was used for the Julian calendar and for years not beginning on January 1. [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] (N.S.) was used for the Gregorian calendar and for Julian calendar years beginning on January 1. Many countries switched to using January 1 as the start of the numbered year at the same time as they switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, but others switched earlier or later.
* B.C. (or BC) – meaning "Before Christ". Used for years before AD 1, counting backwards so the year ''n'' BC is ''n'' years before AD 1. Thus there is no [[year zero|year 0]].
* C.E. (or CE) and B.C.E. (or BCE)  – meaning "[[Common Era]]" and "Before the Common Era", numerically equivalent to AD and BC, respectively (in writing, "AD" ''precedes'' the year number, but "CE" ''follows'' the year: AD 1 = 1 CE.)&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press Stylebook''. (2007). New York: Basic Books. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00489-8}}. "Because the full phrase would read ''in the year of the Lord 96'', the abbreviation A.D. goes before the figure for the year: ''A.D. 96.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The  Latin equivalent ''vulgaris aera'' was used as early as 1615  by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;A 1635 English edition of that book has the title page in English – so far, the earliest-found usage of "Vulgar Era" in English. The English phrase "common Era" appears at least as early as 1708.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
In Latin, "Common Era" is written as ''Vulgaris Aera''. It also occasionally appears as ''æra vulgaris'', ''aera vulgaris'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aera Christiana'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.&lt;/ref&gt; The English abbreviations C.E. and B.C.E. were introduced in the 19th century  by Jewish intellectuals, wishing to avoid the abbreviation for ''dominus'' "lord" in implicit reference to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Use of "C.E." and "B.C.E.": [[Morris Jacob Raphall]]. ''Post-Biblical History of The Jews'' (1856). 
Explicit use of "b.c.e." for "before the common era": 
Max Stern, ''Lemaʼan Yilmedu: A Second Hebrew Reader for Jewish Schools and Private Instruction'' (1881), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; By the later 20th century, the abbreviations had come into wider usage by authors who wished to emphasize [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt; John Sumser, ''The Conflict Between Secular and Religious Narratives in the United States: Wittgenstein, Social Construction, and Communication'' (2016), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5SFsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69   p. 69].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dionysian-derived=====
* [[Astronomical year numbering]] equates its year 0 with 1 BC, and counts negative years from 2 BC backward (−1 backward), so 100 BC is −99.
* The [[Holocene calendar|human era]], also named Holocene era, proposed by [[Cesare Emiliani]] adds 10,000 to AD years, so that AD 1 would be the year 10,001.&lt;ref&gt;Cesare, E. (1993). [Correspondence]. ''Nature, 336'', 716.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Anno Lucis]]'' of [[Freemasonry]] adds 4000 years to the AD year.

===Islamic===
*[[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] (or AH) – for the Latinized ''[[Anno Hegirae]]'', meaning "in the year of the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]", [[Muhammad]]'s flight from Mecca to Medina in September 622, which occurred in its first year, used in the [[Islamic calendar]]. Since the Islamic calendar is a purely [[lunar calendar]] of about 354 days, its year count increases faster than that of [[solar calendar|solar]] and [[lunisolar calendar]]s.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}
*[[A.H.S.]] (or AHS){{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} is used by the [[Iranian calendar]] to denote the number of ''solar'' years since the Hijra. The year beginning at the vernal equinox equals the number of the Gregorian year beginning at the preceding January 1 minus 621.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}

===Hindu===
*[[Hindu calendar]], counting from the start of the [[Kali Yuga]], with its epoch on February 18, 3102 BC Julian (January 23, 3102 BC Gregorian), based on Aryabhata (6th century).
*[[Vikrama Samvat]], 56-57 BC, introduced about the 12th century.
*[[Saka Era|S.E.]] or (SE) – for the [[Saka|Saka Era]], used in some [[Hindu calendar]]s and in the [[Indian national calendar]], with an epoch near the vernal equinox of year 78 (its year 0); its usage spread to Southeast Asia before year 1000. This era is also used (together with the Gregorian calendar) in the Indian national calendar, the official civil calendar used in communiques issued by the Government of India.

===Southeast Asia===
The Hindu Saka Era influences the calendars of southeast Asian [[Greater India|indianized kingdom]]s.
*[[Buddhist calendar|B.E.]] – for the [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]], introduced by [[Vajiravudh]] in 1912, which has an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] (origin) of 544 BC. This year is called year 1 in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Burma]], but year 0 in [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]. Thus the year 2500 B.E. occurred in 1956 in the former countries, but in 1957 in the latter. In Thailand in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era, dating from the founding of [[Bangkok]] on April 6, 1782. In 1912 New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941 Prime Minister [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [[Thai solar calendar]] using the Thai Buddhist Era aligned to the western solar calendar.
*'''BE''' for Burmese Era – from [[Burmese calendar]] originally with an epochal year 0 date of 22 March 638; from which derived '''CS''' for [[Chula Sakarat]] era; variously known as '''LE''' Lesser Era; '''ME''' Minor Era – the Major or Great Era being the [[Saka Era]] of the [[Indian national calendar]]
:B.E. of the Bahá'í calendar is below.

===Bahá'í===
*[[Bahai calendar|B.E.]] – The [[Bahá'í calendar]] dates from the year of the declaration of the [[Báb]]. Years are counted in the Bahá'í Era (BE), which starts its year 1 from March 21, 1844.

===Jewish===
*[[Anno Mundi|A.M.]] (or AM) – for the Latin ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', meaning "in the year of the world", has its epoch in the year 3761 BC. This was first used to number the years of the modern [[Hebrew calendar]] in 1178 by [[Maimonides]]. Precursors with epochs one or two years later were used since the 3rd century, all based on the [[Seder Olam Rabba]] of the 2nd century. The year beginning in the northern autumn of 2000 was 5761 AM).

===Zoroastrian===
*The [[Zoroastrian calendar]] used regnal years since the reform by [[Ardeshir I]], but after the fall of the [[Sassanid empire]], the ascension of the last Sassanid ruler, [[Yazdegerd III of Persia]], crowned June 16, 632, continued to be used as the reference year, abbreviated [[Yazdegerd era|Y.Z.]] or "Yazdegerd era".

==Modern==
{{main|List of calendars}}

===Political===
*The Republican Era of the [[French Republican Calendar]] was dated from September 22, 1792, the day of the proclamation of the [[French First Republic]]. It was used in Revolutionary France from October 24, 1793 (on the Gregorian calendar) to December 31, 1805.
*The [[Positivist calendar]] of 1844 takes 1789 as its epoch.
*The [[Minguo calendar|Republican era]] is used by the [[Republic of China]] since 1912, which is the first year of the republic. Coincidentally, this is the same as the [[Juche#Calendar|Juche era]] used in [[North Korea]], the year of the birth of its founder [[Kim Il-Sung]].
* The [[Era Fascista]] 'Fascist Era' was instituted by the [[Fascism|Italian Fascists]] and used [[Roman numerals]] to denote the number of years since the [[March on Rome]] in 1922. Therefore, 1934, for example, was XII E.F. (''era fascista''). This era was abolished with the fall of fascism in Italy on July 25, 1943, but restored in the northern part of the country during the [[Italian Social Republic]]. The Gregorian calendar remained in simultaneous use and a double numbering was adopted: the year of the [[Common era]] was presented in Arabic numerals and the year of the fascist era in Roman numerals. The year of the Fascist calendar began on October 29, so, for example, October 27, 1933 was XI E.F. but October 30, 1933 was XII E.F.
*China traditionally reckoned by the regnal year of its emperors, see [[Chinese era name]]. Most Chinese do not assign numbers to the years of the [[Chinese calendar]], but the few who do, like expatriate Chinese, use a continuous count of years from the reign of the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]], using 2698 BC as year 1. Western writers begin this count at either 2637 BC or 2697 BC (see [[Chinese calendar#Beginnings|Chinese calendar]]). Thus, the Chinese years 4637, 4697, or 4698 began in early 2000.
*In Korea, from 1952 until 1961 years were numbered via ''[[Dangun#Dating|Dangi]]'' years, where 2333 BC was regarded as the first such year.
*The [[Assyrian calendar]], introduced in the 1950s, has its era fixed at 4750 BC.
*The [[Japanese calendar]] dates from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan]]. The current emperor took the throne in early 1989, which became Heisei 1, which was until then Shōwa 64 (for its first seven days).
*The [[United States]] government sometimes uses a calendar of the era of its [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence]], fixed on July 4, 1776, together with the ''Anno Domini'' civil calendar. For instance, its [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] is dated "the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html U.S. Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presidential proclamation (United States)|Presidential proclamations]] are also dated in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/ The White House: Presidential Actions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
*[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health#Role in Scientology|A.D.]] – "After [[Dianetics]]". In [[Scientology]], years are numbered relative to the first publication of the book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' (1950).&lt;ref name="LATcostly"&gt;Sappell, J., &amp; Welkos, R. W. (1990, June 28). [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062890,0,6570814.story Costly Strategy Continues to Turn Out Bestsellers]. ''Los Angeles Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Discordian calendar|Y.O.L.D.]] – In the [[Discordian calendar]], the standard designation for the year number is YOLD (Year of [[Eris (mythology)|Our Lady of Discord]]). The calendar begins counting from January 1, 1166 BC in the [[Discordian]] year 0, ostensibly the date of origin of the [[Greyface|Curse of Greyface]]. An alternate designation, A.D.D. has been occasionally seen (Anno Domina Discordia, a Latin translation of YOLD, but presumably also a play on [[attention deficit disorder]]).
*e.v. – ''Era vulgaris''. (From Latin, meaning "common era", usually stylized in lowercase.) The [[Thelemic]] calendar is used by some Thelemites to designate a number of years since [[Aleister Crowley]]'s inauguration of the so-called [[Aeon_(Thelema)#Aeon_of_Horus|Aeon of Horus]], which occurred on March 20, 1904, and coincides with both the Thelemic new year and a holiday known as the Equinox of the Gods. The abbreviation "A.N.", for ''Aerae Novae'' ("New Era" in Latin), is sometimes also used.

===Practical===
*[[Before Present|B.P.]] – for [[Before Present]], specifically, the number of [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] years before 1950.
*[[Human Era|HE]] – for counting elapsed years of the [[Holocene]] from near the beginning of the [[Neolithic revolution]] of the [[Holocene epoch]], specifically by adding exactly 10,000 years to AD (Anno Domini) or CE (Common Era) years, and subtracting BC/BCE years from 10001.
*[[Julian day number]] – for counting days, not years, its era fixed at noon January 1, 4713 BC in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]]. This equals November 24, 4714 BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]. From noon of this day to noon of the next day was day 0. Multiples of 7 are Mondays. Negative values can also be used. Apart from the choice of the zero point and name, this Julian day and Julian date are not related to the [[Julian calendar]]. It does not count years, so, strictly speaking, it has no era, but it does have an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]. Today (noon-to-noon UTC) the value is {{#expr:({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}-0.5) round 0}}.
* [[Unix time]] – for counting elapsed seconds since the [[Unix epoch]] set at 00:00:00 or midnight UTC of January 1, 1970, though there are problems with Unix implementation of [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="189079">The [[Book of Joshua]] lists almost 400 ancient [[Levant]]ine city names (including alternative names and derivatives in the form of words describing citizens of a town) which refer to over 300 distinct locations in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]. Each of those cities, with minor exceptions (e.g. [[Hamath]], [[Gubla]]) is placed in one of the 12 regions, according to the [[tribes of Israel]] and in most cases additional details like neighbouring towns or geographical landmarks are provided. It has been serving as one of the primary sources for identifying and locating a number of [[Middle Bronze Age|Middle Bronze]] to [[Iron Age]] [[Levant]]ine cities mentioned in ancient [[Egypt]]ian and [[Canaan]]ite documents, most notably in the [[Amarna correspondence]].

Gibbethon belonged to Ekron, the more so in view of the fact that Gab-bu-tú-nu is recorded in an epigraph of Sargon II, who seized Ekron

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6980">'''Corporate liberalism''' is a thesis in United States [[historiography]] in which the corporate elite become "both the chief beneficiaries of and the chief lobbyists for the supposedly anti-business regulations".&lt;ref name=Long/&gt; The idea is that both owners of corporations as well as high up government officials came together to become the class of elites. The elite class then conspires (or, less maliciously, the system motivates the elite) to keep power away from the low or middle class. Presumably, to avoid the risk of revolution from the poor and powerless and to avoid the realization of [[class conflict]], the elite have the working class pick sides in a mock conflict between business and state.&lt;ref name=Long/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oglesby/&gt; 

== Overview ==
Corporate liberalism's principal text is [[James Weinstein (author)|James Weinstein]]'s ''The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State''.

{{quote box|align=right|width=40%| quoted=1 |quote  = Corporate liberalism functions via a façade of opposition between a purportedly progressive statocracy and a purportedly pro-market plutocracy. The con operates by co-opting potential opponents of the establishment; those who recognise that something’s amiss with the statocratic wing are lured into supporting the plutocratic wing, and vice versa...Perhaps the balance of power shifts slightly toward one side or the other; but the system remains essentially unchanged. (Which explains, for example, why the recent much-trumpeted power shift in Congress has resulted in precious little policy change.)|source=—[[Roderick T. Long]]&lt;ref name=Long/&gt;}}
[[Carl Oglesby]] describes corporate liberalism as a cooperation between those with the most military power and those with the most industrial power. Oglesby suggests that "corporate liberalism...performs for the corporate state a function quite like what the Church once performed for the feudal state. It seeks to justify its burdens and protect it from change".&lt;ref name="Oglesby"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061011033218/http://www.radicaleducation.org/sds_documents/oglesby_future.html Let Us Shape the Future, November 27 1965, lecture by Carl Oglesby - SDS President - spoke at a March on Washington, Available at web.archive.org and accessed January 12 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roderick T. Long]] writes similarly that state and corporate power have a symbiotic relationship. Long writes about the alleged realizations of corporate liberalism during the 1960s, the realizations that the business class was hardly a "persecuted minority" and that the state hardly a "bulwark of the poor against the plutocracy".&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;[http://aaeblog.com/2007/02/06/remembering-corporate-liberalism/ "Remembering Corporate Liberalism", Austro-Athenian Empire: Roderick's blog, posted February 6 2007, accessed January 12 2013].&lt;/ref&gt;

Weinstein's idea of corporate liberalism should not be confused with [[Ellis W. Hawley]]'s use of the term ([[Daniel T. Rodgers]] noted that Hawley's use of "corporate liberalism" was more a description of [[liberal corporatism]] than anything else). It should not also be confused with the concepts developed by Martin J. Sklar, who invented the term "corporate liberalism" in an article on Woodrow Wilson first published in 1960 when he was in graduate school in history at the University of Wisconsin. Sklar published the essay in ''Studies on the Left'', where he and James Weinstein were co-editors. Sklar's writing about corporate liberalism was a major influence on Weinstein's thinking (which Weinstein himself acknowledged in the preface to his book, ''The Corporate Ideal in the Liberal State''). Arguing that the rise of the large corporation "as the dominant mode of business enterprise" was the result of a concerted effort by capitalists and like-minded political leaders and intellectuals, Sklar wrote that corporate liberalism was the "bourgeois Yankee cousin of modern European and English social democracy". 

Sklar subsequently refined and developed the corporate liberal concept in a 1988 book, ''The Corporate Reconstruction of American Capitalism'', which significantly differed from Weinstein's interpretation. On pages 34–35, Sklar defined corporate liberalism as the ideology of the political movement that accomplished the corporate reconstruction of the United States political-economic order on the basis of a mutual adjustment between [[corporate capitalism]] and the [[Liberalism in the United States|American liberal tradition]]. In keeping with that tradition, corporate liberalism upheld the corporate administered market and the rise of regulatory government, but not a "corporate state" or a statist command system. Sklar did not see corporate liberalism as simply the ideology of corporate capitalists, but rather as a broad cross-class ideology "expressing the inter-relations of corporate capitalists, political leaders, intellectuals, proprietary capitalists, professionals, and reformers, workers and trade union leaders, populists, and socialists—all of those who could, to a greater or lesser extent, identify their outlook or their interest in administered markets and government regulation, with the rise, legitimation, and institutionalization of the corporate capitalist order".  

According to Sklar’s account, corporate liberalism was not a monolithic ideology, but unfolded in several major political variants that there were at once "mutually complimentary and in conflict with one another". On the left, they were [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s "statist-tending corporate liberalism"; on the center-left, [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s "regulatory corporate liberalism"; and on the center-right, [[William Howard Taft]]'s "minimalist regulatory corporate liberalism". Sklar contined saying: "It was from this three-way progressive split that sprang the major divisions of twentieth-century American politics with respect to political-economic policy formation".

Other historians who advocate similar theories of United States history include [[Gabriel Kolko]] and [[Murray Rothbard]]. The thesis of corporate liberalism has similarities with the ideas of the [[organizational synthesis]] school of [[Alfred D. Chandler Jr.]], [[Samuel P. Hays]], [[Robert Wiebe]] and [[Louis Galambos]].

The "'''Dark Ages'''" is a historical [[periodization]] traditionally referring to the [[Middle Ages]], that asserts that a demographic, cultural, and economic deterioration occurred in Western Europe following the [[decline of the Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1989|edition=2|quote=a term sometimes applied to the period of the Middle Ages to mark the intellectual darkness characteristic of the time; often restricted to the early period of the Middle Ages, between the time of the fall of Rome and the appearance of vernacular written documents.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dark+age|title=Definition of DARK AGE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'', Vol. X. Roma, 1602, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; The concept thus came to characterize the entire Middle Ages as a time of intellectual darkness between the fall of Rome and the [[Renaissance]]; this became especially popular during the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=Mommsen227228/&gt;

As the accomplishments of the era came to be better understood in the 18th and 20th centuries, scholars began restricting the "Dark Ages" appellation to the [[Early Middle Ages]] (c. 5th–10th century).&lt;ref name=Mommsen226227&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mommsen | first = Theodore E.| authorlink =Theodor Ernst Mommsen | title = Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages' | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–227| publisher = [[Medieval Academy of America]] | location = Cambridge MA | year = 1942 | jstor = 2856364| doi = 10.2307/2856364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ker, W.

Images like this one celebrate the triumph of Christianity over the paganism of Antiquity.]]

The idea of a Dark Age originated with the Tuscan scholar [[Petrarch]] in the 1330s.&lt;ref name=mommsen&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mommsen | first = Theodore E.| authorlink =Theodor Ernst Mommsen | title = Petrarch's Conception of the 'Dark Ages' | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 226–242 | publisher = [[Medieval Academy of America]] | location = Cambridge MA | year = 1942 | jstor = 2856364| doi = 10.2307/2856364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; Writing of the past, he said: "Amidst the errors there shone forth men of genius; no less keen were their eyes, although they were ''surrounded by darkness'' and dense gloom".&lt;ref&gt;[[Petrarch]] (1367). ''Apologia cuiusdam anonymi Galli calumnias'' (''Defence against the calumnies of an anonymous Frenchman''), in Petrarch, ''Opera Omnia'', Basel, 1554, p. 1195. This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article, where the source is given in a footnote. Cf. also Marsh, D, ed., (2003), ''Invectives'', Harvard University Press, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity|Christian]] writers, including Petrarch himself,&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt; had long used traditional [[metaphor]]s of '[[light versus darkness]]' to describe '[[Good and evil|good versus evil]]'. Petrarch was the first to give the metaphor [[secularity|secular]] meaning by reversing its application. He now saw Classical Antiquity, so long considered a 'dark' age for its lack of Christianity, in the 'light' of its cultural achievements, while Petrarch's own time, allegedly lacking such cultural achievements, was seen as the age of darkness.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt;

From his perspective on the Italian peninsula, Petrarch saw the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and classical period as an expression of greatness.&lt;ref name=mommsen/&gt; He spent much of his time travelling through Europe, rediscovering and republishing classic [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] texts. He wanted to restore the Latin language to its former purity. [[Renaissance humanism|Renaissance humanists]] saw the preceding 900 years as a time of stagnation, with history unfolding not along the religious outline of [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s [[Six Ages of the World]], but in ''cultural'' (or secular) terms through progressive development of classical ideals, literature, and art.

Petrarch wrote that history had two periods: the classic period of [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], followed by a time of darkness in which he saw himself living. In around 1343, in the conclusion of his epic ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', he wrote: "My fate is to live among varied and confusing storms. But for you perhaps, if as I hope and wish you will live long after me, there will follow a better age. This sleep of forgetfulness will not last forever. When the darkness has been dispersed, our descendants can come again in the former pure radiance."&lt;ref&gt;[[Petrarch]] (1343). ''[[Africa (Petrarch)|Africa]]'', IX, 451-7. This quotation comes from the English translation of Mommsen's article.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, historians [[Leonardo Bruni]] and [[Flavio Biondo]] developed a three-tier outline of history. They used Petrarch's two ages, plus a modern, 'better age', which they believed the world had entered. Later the term 'Middle Ages' - Latin ''media tempestas'' (1469) or  ''medium aevum'' (1604) - was used to describe the period of supposed decline.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;
Albrow, Martin, ''The global age: state and society beyond modernity'' (1997), p. 205.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===
During the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]s of the 16th and 17th centuries, Protestants generally had a similar view to Renaissance Humanists such as Petrarch, but also added an [[Anti-Catholicism|Anti-Catholic]] perspective. They saw classical antiquity as a golden time, not only because of its Latin literature, but also because it witnessed the beginnings of Christianity. They promoted the idea that the 'Middle Age' was a time of darkness also because of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church, such as:  Popes ruling as kings, veneration of [[Relic|saints' relics]], a licentious priesthood, and institutionalized moral hypocrisy.&lt;ref&gt;F. Oakley, ''The medieval experience: foundations of Western cultural singularity'' (University of Toronto Press, 1988), pp. 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baronius=== 
In response to the Protestants, Catholics developed a counter-image to depict the [[High Middle Ages]] in particular as a period of social and religious harmony, and not 'dark' at all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Daileader|Daileader, Philip]] (2001). ''The High Middle Ages''. The Teaching Company. {{ISBN|1-56585-827-1}}. "Catholics living during the Protestant Reformation were not going to take this assault lying down. They, too, turned to the study of the Middle Ages, going back to prove that, far from being a period of religious corruption, the Middle Ages were superior to the era of the Protestant Reformation, because the Middle Ages were free of the religious schisms and religious wars that were plaguing the 16th and 17th centuries."&lt;/ref&gt; The most important Catholic reply to the ''Magdeburg Centuries'' was the ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'' by Cardinal [[Caesar Baronius]]. Baronius was a trained historian who produced a work that the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' in 1911 described as "far surpassing anything before"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=History |volume=13} |page=530 |first=James Thomson |last=Shotwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] regarded as "the greatest history of the Church ever written".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]] (1906). ''[[s:Lectures on Modern History|Lectures on Modern History]]'', p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Annales'' covered the first twelve centuries of Christianity to 1198, and was published in twelve volumes between 1588 and 1607. It was in Volume X that Baronius coined the term "dark age" for the period between the end of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in 888&lt;ref&gt;Baronius's actual starting-point for the "dark age" was 900 (''annus Redemptoris nongentesimus''), but that was an arbitrary rounding off due mainly to his strictly [[annalists|annalistic]] approach. Later historians, e.g. Marco Porri in his Catholic ''History of the Church'' [http://contemplativinelmondo.splinder.com (''Storia della Chiesa'')] or the Lutheran ''Christian Cyclopedia'' [http://www.lcms.org/ca/www/cyclopedia/02/display.asp?t1=s&amp;word=SAECULUMOBSCURUM ("Saeculum Obscurum")], have tended to amend it to the more historically significant date of 888, often rounding it down further to 880. The first weeks of 888 witnessed both the final break-up of the Carolingian Empire and the death of its deposed ruler [[Charles the Fat]]. Unlike the end of the Carolingian Empire, however, the end of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] cannot be precisely dated, and it was the latter development that was responsible for the "lack of writers" that Baronius, as a historian, found so irksome.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first stirrings of [[Gregorian Reform]] under [[Pope Clement II]] in 1046:

{{quote|"The new age (''saeculum'') which was beginning, for its harshness and barrenness of good could well be called iron, for its baseness and abounding evil leaden, and moreover for its lack of writers (''inopia scriptorum'') dark (''obscurum'')".&lt;ref&gt;[[Caesar Baronius|Baronius, Caesar]] (1602). ''[[Annales Ecclesiastici]]'', Vol. X. Roma, p. 647. "Novum incohatur saeculum quod, sua asperitate ac boni sterilitate ferreum, malique exudantis deformitate plumbeum, atque inopia scriptorum, appellari consuevit obscurum."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Significantly, Baronius termed the age 'dark' because of the paucity of written records. The "lack of writers" he referred to may be illustrated by comparing the number of volumes in [[Jacques Paul Migne|Migne]]'s ''[[Patrologia Latina]]'' containing the work of Latin writers from the 10th century (the heart of the age he called 'dark') with the number containing the work of writers from the preceding and succeeding centuries. A minority of these writers were historians.

[[File:European Output of Manuscripts 500–1500.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Medieval production of manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: "Charting the "Rise of the West": Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;409–445 (416, table 1)&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the Middle Ages was also a period of low activity in copying. Note that this graph does not include the Byzantine Empire.]]

There is a sharp drop from 34 volumes in the 9th century to just 8 in the 10th. The 11th century, with 13, evidences a certain recovery, and the 12th century, with 40, surpasses the 9th, something the 13th, with just 26, fails to do. There was indeed a 'dark age', in Baronius's sense of a "lack of writers", between the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 9th century and the beginnings, some time in the 11th, of what has been called the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Furthermore, there was an earlier period of "lack of writers" during the 7th and 8th centuries.  So, in Western Europe, two 'dark ages' can be identified, separated by the brilliant but brief [[Carolingian Renaissance]].

Baronius's 'dark age' seems to have struck historians, for it was in the 17th century that the term started to proliferate in various European languages, with his original Latin term ''{{lang|la|saeculum obscurum}}'' being reserved for the period he had applied it to. But while some, following Baronius, used 'dark age' neutrally to refer to a dearth of written records, others used it pejoratively, lapsing into that lack of objectivity that has discredited the term for many modern historians.

The first British historian to use the term was most likely [[Gilbert Burnet]], in the form 'darker ages' which appears several times in his work during the later 17th century. The earliest reference seems to be in the "Epistle Dedicatory" to Volume I of ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' of 1679, where he writes: "The design of the reformation was to restore Christianity to what it was at first, and to purge it of those corruptions, with which it was overrun in the later and darker ages."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1679). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. I. Oxford, 1929, p. ii.&lt;/ref&gt; He uses it again in the 1682 Volume II, where he dismisses the story of "St George's fighting with the dragon" as "a legend formed in the darker ages to support the humour of chivalry".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert Burnet|Burnet, Gilbert]] (1682). ''The History of the Reformation of the Church of England'', Vol. II. Oxford, 1829, p. 423. Burnet also uses the term in 1682 in ''The Abridgement of the History of the Reformation of the Church of England'' (2nd Edition, London, 1683, p. 52) and in 1687 in ''Travels through France, Italy, Germany and Switzerland'' (London, 1750, p. 257). The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' erroneously cites the last of these as the earliest recorded use of the term in English.&lt;/ref&gt; Burnet was a bishop chronicling how England became Protestant, and his use of the term is invariably pejorative.

===Enlightenment===
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 17th and 18th centuries, many critical thinkers saw religion as antithetical to reason. For them the Middle Ages, or "Age of Faith", was therefore the opposite of the [[Age of Reason]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Bartlett (historian)|Bartlett, Robert]] (2001). "Introduction: Perspectives on the Medieval World", in ''Medieval Panorama''. {{ISBN|0-89236-642-7}}. "Disdain about the medieval past was especially forthright amongst the critical and rationalist thinkers of the Enlightenment. For them the Middle Ages epitomized the barbaric, priest-ridden world they were attempting to transform."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Voltaire]] were vocal in attacking the Middle Ages as a period of social regress dominated by religion, while [[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' expressed contempt for the "rubbish of the Dark Ages".&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon, Edward]] (1788). ''The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', Vol. 6, Ch. XXXVII, paragraph 619.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet just as Petrarch, seeing himself at the cusp of a "new age", was criticising the centuries before his own time, so too were Enlightenment writers.

Consequently, an evolution had occurred in at least three ways. Petrarch's original metaphor of light versus dark has expanded over time, implicitly at least. Even if later humanists no longer saw themselves living in a ''dark'' age, their times were still not ''light'' enough for 18th-century writers who saw themselves as living in the ''real'' Age of Enlightenment, while the period to be condemned stretched to include what we now call [[Early Modern]] times. Additionally, Petrarch's metaphor of darkness, which he used mainly to deplore what he saw as a lack of secular achievement, was sharpened to take on a more explicitly anti-religious and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] meaning.

Nevertheless, the term 'Middle Ages', used by Biondo and other early humanists after Petrarch, was in general use before the 18th century to denote the period before the Renaissance. The earliest recorded use of the English word "medieval" was in 1827. The concept of the Dark Ages was also in use, but by the 18th century it tended to be confined to the earlier part of this period. The earliest entry for a capitalized "Dark Ages" in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' is a reference in [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s ''History of Civilization in England'' in 1857.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; Starting and ending dates varied: the Dark Ages were considered by some to start in 410, by others in 476 when there was no longer an emperor in Rome, and to end about 800, at the time of the Carolingian Renaissance under [[Charlemagne]], or alternatively to extend through to the end of the 1st millennium.

===Romanticism===
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the [[Romanticism|Romantics]] reversed the negative assessment of Enlightenment critics with a vogue for [[medievalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Michael (2007). ''Medievalism: The Middle Ages in Modern England''. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "[[Goths|Gothic]]" had been a term of opprobrium akin to "[[Vandal]]" until a few self-confident mid-18th-century English "Goths" like [[Horace Walpole]] initiated the [[Gothic Revival]] in the arts. This stimulated interest in the Middle Ages, which for the following generation began to take on the idyllic image of an "Age of Faith". This, reacting to a world dominated by Enlightenment [[rationalism]], expressed a romantic view of a [[Golden Age]] of [[chivalry]].  The Middle Ages were seen with [[nostalgia]] as a period of social and environmental harmony and spiritual inspiration, in contrast to the excesses of the [[French Revolution]] and, most of all, to the environmental and social upheavals and [[utilitarianism (architecture)|utilitarianism]] of the developing [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Alice K. (1971). ''A Dream of Order: The Medieval Ideal in Nineteenth-Century English Literature''. University of Nebraska Press, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantics' view is still represented in modern-day [[Renaissance fair|fairs and festivals]] celebrating the period with '[[Merry England|merrie]]' costumes and events.

Just as Petrarch had twisted the meaning of light versus darkness, so the Romantics had twisted the judgment of the Enlightenment. However, the period they idealized was largely the [[High Middle Ages]], extending into [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] times. In one respect, this negated the religious aspect of Petrarch's judgment, since these later centuries were those when the power and prestige of the Church were at their height. To many, the scope of the Dark Ages was becoming divorced from this period, denoting mainly the centuries immediately following the fall of Rome.

==Modern academic use==
{{See also|Medieval studies}}
The term was widely used by 19th-century historians. In 1860, in ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', [[Jacob Burckhardt]] delineated the contrast between the medieval 'dark ages' and the more enlightened [[Renaissance]], which had revived the cultural and intellectual achievements of antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, John (2008). ''The Road from Eden: Studies in Christianity and Culture''. Palo Alto, CA: Academica Press, p. 148, fn 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early 20th century saw a radical re-evaluation of the Middle Ages, which called into question the terminology of darkness,&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; or at least its more pejorative use. The historian [[Denys Hay]] spoke ironically of "the lively centuries which we call dark".&lt;!--This quote has also been attributed to A. T. Hatto, and if correct, this would be the more original reference, but but pending a source we must be content with the Hay reference.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Denys Hay|Hay, Denys]] (1977). ''Annalists and Historians''. London: Methuen, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; More forcefully, a book about the [[history of German literature]] published in 2007 describes "the dark ages" as "a popular if ignorant manner of speaking".&lt;ref&gt;Dunphy, Graeme (2007). "Literary Transitions, 1300–1500: From Late Mediaeval to Early Modern" in: ''The Camden House History of German Literature'' vol IV: "Early Modern German Literature".  The chapter opens: "A popular if uninformed manner of speaking refers to the medieval period as "the dark ages." If there is a dark age in the literary history of Germany, however, it is the one that follows: the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the time between the Middle High German ''Blütezeit'' and the full blossoming of the Renaissance. It may be called a dark age, not because literary production waned in these decades, but because nineteenth-century aesthetics and twentieth-century university curricula allowed the achievements of that time to fade into obscurity."&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern historians do not use the term "dark ages", preferring terms such as [[Early Middle Ages]].  But when used by some historians today, the term "Dark Ages" is meant to describe the economic, political, and cultural problems of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Review Article: Travel and Trade in the Dark Ages, Treadgold, Warren, Journal
The International History Review Volume 26, 2004 - Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Globalisation, Ecological Crisis, and Dark Ages, Sing C. Chew, Journal of Global Society,Volume 16, 2002 - Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt;  For others, the term Dark Ages is intended to be neutral, expressing the idea that the events of the period seem 'dark' to us because of the paucity of the [[Recorded history|historical record]].&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; The term is used in this sense (often in the singular) to reference the [[Bronze Age collapse]] and the subsequent [[Greek Dark Ages]],&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; the [[dark ages of Cambodia]] (c. 1450-1863), and also a hypothetical [[Digital Dark Age]] which would ensue if the [[electronic document]]s produced in the current period were to become unreadable at some point in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081027174646 'Digital Dark Age' May Doom Some Data], ''[[Science Daily]]'', October 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Byzantinist]]s have used the term "Byzantine Dark Ages" to refer to the period from the earliest [[Muslim conquests]] to about 800,&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Lemerle|Lemerle, Paul]] (1986). ''Byzantine Humanism'', translated by Helen Lindsay and Ann Moffat. Canberra, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; because there are no extant historical texts in Greek from this period, and thus the history of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and its territories that were conquered by the Muslims is poorly understood and must be reconstructed from other contemporaneous sources, such as religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Whitby|Whitby, Michael]] (1992). "Greek historical writing after Procopius" in ''Byzantine and Early Islamic Near East'', ed. Averil Cameron and Lawrence I. Conrad, Princeton, pp. 25–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lemerle, Paul (1986). ''Byzantine Humanism'', translated by Helen Lindsay and Ann Moffat. Canberra, p. 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "dark age" is not restricted to the discipline of history. Since the archaeological evidence for some periods is abundant and for others scanty, there are also archaeological dark ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onderzoekinformatie.nl/en/oi/nod/onderzoek/OND1320349/ Project: Exploring the Early Holocene Occupation of North-Central Anatolia: New Approaches for Studying Archaeological Dark Ages] Period of Project: 09/2007-09/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Late Middle Ages]] significantly overlap with the [[Renaissance]], the term 'Dark Ages' has become restricted to distinct times and places in medieval Europe. Thus the 5th and 6th centuries in [[Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]], at the height of the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invasions, have been called "the darkest of the Dark Ages",&lt;ref&gt;[[John Cannon (historian)|Cannon, John]] and Griffiths, Ralph (2000). ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Monarchy (Oxford Illustrated Histories)'', 2nd Revised edition. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, p. 1. The first chapter opens with the sentence: "In the darkest of the Dark Ages, the fifth and sixth centuries, there were many kings in Britain but no kingdoms."&lt;/ref&gt; in view of the [[societal collapse]] of the period and the consequent lack of historical records. Further south and east, the same was true in the formerly Roman province of [[Roman Dacia|Dacia]], where history after the Roman withdrawal went unrecorded for centuries as [[Slavs]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]], and others struggled for supremacy in the [[Danube]] basin, and events there are still disputed. However, at this time the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arab Empire]] is often considered to have experienced its [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]] rather than Dark Age; consequently, usage of the term must also specify a geography. While [[Petrarch]]'s concept of a Dark Age corresponded to a mostly Christian period following pre-Christian Rome, today the term mainly applies to the cultures and periods in Europe that were least Christianized, and thus most sparsely covered by [[chronicle]]s and other contemporary sources, at the time mostly written by Catholic clergy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

However, from the later 20th century onwards, other historians became critical even of this nonjudgmental use of the term, for two main reasons.&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; Firstly, it is questionable whether it is ever possible to use the term in a neutral way: scholars may intend this, but ordinary readers may not understand it so. Secondly, 20th-century scholarship had increased understanding of the history and culture of the period,&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Martin (1993). ''[http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-00894-6.html Discovering Anglo-Saxon England]''. University Park, PA: Penn State Press.&lt;/ref&gt; to such an extent that it is no longer really 'dark' to us.&lt;ref name=dmas/&gt; To avoid the value judgment implied by the expression, many historians now avoid it altogether.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/151663/Dark-Ages Encyclopædia Britannica] "It is now rarely used by historians because of the value judgment it implies. Though sometimes taken to derive its meaning from the fact that little was then known about the period, the term's more usual and pejorative sense is of a period of intellectual darkness and barbarity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fate of Rome: Climate, Disease, and the End of an Empire (The Princeton History of the Ancient World) |publisher=Princeton University Press |author=Kyle Harper |year=2017 |page=12 |quote=These used to be called the Dark Ages. That label is best set aside. It is hopelessly redolent of Renaissance and Enlightenment prejudices. It altogether underestimates the impressive cultural vitality and enduring spiritual legacy of the entire period that has come to be known as "late antiquity". At the same time we do not have to [[wikt:euphemize|euphemize]] the realities of imperial disintegration, economic collapse and societal disintegration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern popular use==
[[File:Gossuin de Metz - L'image du monde - BNF Fr. 574 fo42 - miniature.jpg|thumb|right|Medieval artistic illustration of the [[spherical Earth]] in a 14th-century copy of ''[[Gautier de Metz|L'Image du monde]]'' (c. 1246)]]
Science historian [[David C. Lindberg]] criticised the public use of 'dark ages' to describe the entire Middle Ages as "a time of [[ignorance]], [[Barbarian|barbarism]] and [[superstition]]" for which "blame is most often laid at the feet of the [[Christian Church|Christian church]], which is alleged to have placed religious authority over personal experience and rational activity".&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, "The Medieval Church Encounters the Classical Tradition: Saint Augustine, Roger Bacon, and the Handmaiden Metaphor", in David C. Lindberg and Ronald L. Numbers, ed. ''When Science &amp; Christianity Meet'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 2003), p.8&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of science [[Edward Grant]] writes that "If revolutionary rational thoughts were expressed in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]], they were made possible because of the long medieval tradition that established the use of reason as one of the most important of human activities".&lt;ref&gt;Edward Grant. ''God and Reason in the Middle Ages'', Cambridge 2001, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Lindberg says that, contrary to common belief, "the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in the essay of Ted Peters about Science and Religion at "Lindsay Jones (editor in chief). Encyclopedia of Religion, Second Edition. Thomson Gale. 2005. p.8182"&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] due to the [[Migration Period]] a lot of classical Greek texts were lost there, but part of these texts survived and they were studied widely in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Around the eleventh and twelfth centuries in the [[High Middle Ages]] stronger monarchies emerged; borders were restored after the invasions of [[Vikings]] and [[Hungarians|Magyars]]; technological developments and agricultural innovations were made which increased the food supply and population. And the rejuvenation of science and scholarship in the West was due in large part to the new availability of Latin translations of [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, D. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''  Chicago. University of Chicago Press. p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another view of the period is reflected by more specific notions such as the 19th-century claim&lt;ref name=bunk&gt;Historian [[Jeffrey Burton Russell]], in his book ''[[Inventing the Flat Earth]]'' "... shows how nineteenth-century anti-Christians invented and spread the falsehood that educated people in the Middle Ages believed that the earth was flat" [http://www.asa3.org/ASA/topics/history/1997Russell.html Russell's summary of his book]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flat"&gt;{{Cite book

The '''Drachenfels Club''' is a society for the preservation and care of monuments in the vicinity of the German town of [[Bad Dürkheim]]. It owns numerous [[natural monument]]s and [[listed building]]s, some of which it has been given and others which it has established itself.

== History ==
The Drachenfels Club was founded in 1873 under the chairmanship of Wilhelm Schepp. Its name came from the first project that the society undertook: to make the Dragon Cave (''Drachenhöhle'') accessible. The cave lies under the [[Drachenfels (Central Palatinate Forest)|Drachenfels]], a hill in the borough of [[Bad Dürkheim]], which is linked to the legend of the ''[[Nibelung]]''. Other renovations and the enclosure of spaces and natural monuments took place the following year. A short time later, probably around 1875, the new club was given the Laura Hut (''Laurahütte'') in [[Leistadt]], which it had not built itself, but was able to use the legacy of the Retzer family from [[Freinsheim]]. From 1896 the club built its most expensive structure: the  [[Bismarck Tower (Kallstadt)|Bismarck Tower]] on the [[Peterskopf (Haardt)|Peterskopf]]. Innumerable new [[refuge hut]]s were built and countless renovations of buildings and natural sites followed. The club's activities were put on hold during the [[Second World War]]. In 1947 it was re-founded in its present form.

{{Marxism|Philosophy}}

'''Economic determinism''' is a socioeconomic theory that [[economic]] relationships (such as being an owner or [[capitalist]], or being a worker or proletarian) are the foundation upon which all other social and political arrangements in society are based. The theory stresses that societies are divided into competing [[social class|economic classes]] whose relative political power is determined by the nature of the economic system. In the version associated with [[Karl Marx]], the emphasis is on the [[proletariat]] who are considered to be locked in a [[class struggle]] with the capitalist class, which will eventually end with the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system and the gradual development of [[socialism]]. [[Marxist theory|Marxist thinkers]] have dismissed plain and unilateral economic [[determinism]] as a form of "vulgar Marxism", or "[[economism]]", nowhere included in Marx's works.

In the writing of American history the term is associated with historian [[Charles A. Beard]] (1874–1948), who was not a Marxist but who emphasized the long-term political contest between bankers and business interest on the one hand, and agrarian interests on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Coleman, "Beard, McDonald, and Economic Determinism in American Historiography," ''Business History Review'' (1960) 34#1 pp. 113-121 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3111785 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Marxist philosophy==
According to [[Marx]], each social [[mode of production]] produces the [[materialism|material conditions]] of its reproduction, that is, [[ideology]] (which gathers all the political, law and cultural spheres). Thus, ideology permits the mode of production to reproduce itself. Furthermore, Marx and Engels are said to have believed,&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx &amp; Friedrich Engels, "The German Ideology," from Selected Writings, pg 120&lt;/ref&gt; should a [[revolution]]ary force change the mode of production, the dominant class will immediately set out to create a new society to protect this new economic order. In the modernity of their era, Marx and Engels felt the [[ruling class|propertied class]] had essentially accomplished the establishment of a new societal and economic order, instinctively creating a society protective of their capitalist interests. They made this statement to the [[Bourgeoisie]] in the [[Communist Manifesto]]: "Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your [[jurisprudence]] is but the will of your class, made into law for all, a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economic conditions of the existence of your class."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, ''Communist Manifesto'', pg 35&lt;/ref&gt; The [[young Marx]] hence criticized man's [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], a concept which he later replaced by the critique of [[commodity fetishism]]. "Vulgar [[Marxism]]" has considered that the relation between the economical [[infrastructure]] and the ideological [[base and superstructure|superstructure]] was a [[unicausality|unicausal]] one, and thus believed in economic determinism. Engels said "The final causes of all social changes and [[political revolution]] are to be sought, not in men's brains, not in man's insight into internal truth and justice... but in the economies of each epoch."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Engels, ''Socialism -- Utopian and Scientific'', pg 54&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Engels advocated a revolution in economic structure as the only valid way of improving society and ending the oppression of the working class.

==Criticism==
Other Marxists and Marx-scholars—including [[György Lukács]], [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Louis Althusser]], [[Maurice Godelier]], [[Franz Jakubowski]], [[Edward P. Thompson]] and [[Michael Lowy]]—completely reject the interpretation of Marx and Engels as "economic determinists". They claim this idea is based on a poor and selective reading of Marx and Engels' work.

They argue that this interpretation originated in the early years of the [[Second International]] and was popularised by [[Karl Kautsky]] and [[Nikolai Bukharin]], among many others. They refer to the disclaimers by Engels (see [[historical materialism]]) to the effect that while Marx and himself had focused a lot on the economic aspects, they were very aware that this did ''not'' in fact constitute the totality of society or of social life. However, some have viewed such comments as Engels's attempt to extricate himself from an untenable position: [[Max Weber]] and other influential sociological and economic thinker agreed that Marx's views were really unidimensional in regard to economic determinism. They did not agree that economic determinism was a vulgar interpretation of Marx. They regarded this to be the explicitly stated and true interpretation of Marx (See own admission in Friedrich Engels, ''Socialism—Utopian and Scientific'', pg 54). They criticized the simplicity in Marx's arguments and held that ideas and cultural beliefs and values determine societal progress and the evolution of society. (See [[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism|Weber's ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'']] (1905)).

Non-Marxist scholars have also objected that economic determinism is overly generalized, insofar as any serious historical explanation of ''economic'' realities must always refer to ''non-economic'' realities. This became obvious when one had to specify exactly of what the economic determinism precisely consisted. In addition, a lot of confusion about "economic determinism" is due to the conflation of the "commercial" with the "economic". For Marx at least, these were very ''different'' concepts.

The dynamic of history according to Marx was shaped precisely by the clash of those interests ([[class struggle]]), and that clash ''could not be understood'' simply in terms of economic self-interest, because it also involved human needs, customs, traditions, morals and values encompassing a whole way of life. On the other hand, Lenin wrote that "an idea that captures the minds of the masses becomes a material force," meaning that the said needs, customs, traditions, morals and values can be equated to economic forces.

The end result of economic determinism in this view is both [[economism]] (a narrow focus on how people earn their livelihood) and economic [[reductionism]] (the attempt to reduce a complex social reality to one factor—the economic—such that this one factor ''causes'' all other aspects of society).

==Notable economic determinists==

American geostrategist [[Thomas P. M. Barnett]] describes himself as an economic determinist in his book ''The Pentagon's New Map''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43865">The '''European History Network''' has run a number of projects under the banner of the Creating Links and Overviews for a New History Agenda (CLIOH) since 1988, including CLIOH, CLIOHnet and CLIOHnet2. Both CLIOHRES and CLIOH-WORLD are currently in operation as of December 2011. It was initially founded as the ECTS History Network, a pilot project of the [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].

==CLIOH-WORLD==

[http://meldinger.uib.no/engelsk.php?id=51001123731 University of Bergen news]&lt;/ref&gt; CLIOHnet2, CLIOHRES) to improve the understanding of national histories as they are studied, taught and learned in European universities. These projects have linked national historical narratives, and prepared tools and materials to structure history programs. These help make learners aware of how national historical viewpoints have been created, and how and why they may contrast with the beliefs and understandings about history in neighboring countries.

CLIOH-WORLD is using its consolidated experience and methodology to develop the learning and teaching of [[European Union]] history, including [[European integration]] and expansion, and to encourage awareness and understanding of the links between European history and the histories of other continents. CLIOH-WORLD has five working groups:

=== Working groups ===

==== 1. History of European Integration and of the European Union ====
'''Why is there a need for the History of EU and European Integration?'''

History is an important tool not only for increasing knowledge of the human past, but also for enhancing the awareness and the identity of human social and political communities, of which the [[European Union]] is one. In order to achieve a better understanding of what the European Union is and what it means to be a European citizen it is essential to improve the knowledge and understanding of both the history of the European integration process and the history of the European Union itself. Universities are an important place where students can acquire such essential knowledge and awareness in a mature way.

European Union History is not the same as the History of [[European Integration]] and vice versa: the two terms cover different aspects of European History. The main focus of the History of the European Union is on the history of a very dense kind of European Integration, centred on institutionalised forms of integration and on the member states of the European Union.

On the contrary, the History of European Integration also covers aspects of integration that go beyond the European Union. Moreover, to reach a mature comprehension of the complex political, social, economic and juridical framework in which the EU has been conceived and built, it is important to broaden our view back in history before 1945 and [[World War II]]. One of the most obvious tools of analysis that history offers is ‘historical perspective’, the diachronic dimension that provides important insights into present-day phenomena. The understanding of long term aspects, events and processes, is also vital in building a critically aware European citizenship.

The task of the [[Working group|Working Group]] is to increase both knowledge and understanding of the European integration process and the history of the European Union. In order to reach such important goals the group has decided to map the current situation and to produce and disseminate Guidelines and Reference points for Higher Education programmes in Europe. Our{{Who|date=January 2011}} findings are offered freely as information, ideas and recommendations. The tools produced by the group can be adopted by or may simply inspire those who face the need to (re)design history programmes.

'''The Role of History of EU and European Integration on European Universities: the Mapping Results'''

The Working Group undertook an extensive survey of the current state of European Union and European Integration History learning and teaching, through detailed mapping of selected countries (Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the UK), and supplemented this with further sample-based mapping of other countries in Europe (Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, Malta, Romania) and beyond Europe (Japan). On this basis the Group feels confident that it has produced a reasonably representative basis on which to assess the field.

Although the mapping covered a broad and diverse range of countries and institutions, a number of common points were evident. In particular, it was striking that there is very little learning/teaching specifically dedicated to the history of the European Union or European integration. Courses devoted to these subjects are overwhelmingly oriented towards political science, legal or linguistic studies. Where there was evidence of a historical approach to the subject it tended to be framed within either national histories (the relations between one state and the rest of Europe) or included in general histories of Europe, wherein the history of the EU and of European integration was treated either as a discrete part of the whole or implicitly (rather than explicitly) embedded in studies of post-1945 west European political and economic development.

The difficulty of identifying historical approaches to the subject underlined the problems of defining what that history is, however. There are a number of issues that make a neat definition of European Union history and the history of European integration problematic. These are principally chronological and thematic. If we seek to add a historical dimension to existing institutional studies of the European Union and of European integration, for example, questions arise about cultural and historical connections (what might be termed ‘European-ness’) which in turn open up problems of periodisation (specifically, whether an exclusively post-1945 focus is adequate, but if not how should the chronological parameters be defined?).

The importance of history in programmes of European Studies is in fact not very pronounced, although history is often mentioned in the programme descriptions. Even where European Union history is reasonably well covered, it is usually as one optional module, a fact which raises issues about coherence, or the importance of thinking about what that History is. Although dealing with “Europe” is quite popular in European academic institutions and many universities and departments offer courses on “European history” or the history of European regions, an explicit focus on European History or the history of European integration is not very widespread.

“European history” is often seen as history that happened in Europe or parts of it, not in a comparative way that contrasts or connects different structures and addresses the process of European integration. With these problems and questions in mind, it was possible to return to the original mapping results with a view to identifying ‘interesting’ practice that might illuminate some of these issues and how they had been addressed, and allow the Group to move towards a more meaningful interpretation of what constitutes European Union history and the history of European integration. It is these results that are to be used to inform the development of guidelines framed within the language and methodology of Tuning.

'''What can we learn from examples of good and interesting practice?'''

Examples of good and interesting practice{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} can be found in all of the countries that were mapped in detail. These examples can be found on several levels.
1.) On the level of programmes it is seen{{By whom|date=January 2011}} as good practice if courses on European Union history and the history of European integration are a – preferably compulsory – part of programmes of European studies or European history.

2.) Courses are seen as good and interesting practice if they cover European Union history and history of European integration in a way that goes beyond an institutional history of the European Union and its organisations. Some selected examples will illustrate these examples of good and interesting practice. At the beginning of the Masters programme “Sociology – European societies“ (Freie Universität Berlin [DE]) there is a module that deals with “the process of political integration in Europe and the development of European societies after 1945”.

The link between European integration and the development of societies broadens the horizon of the history of European integration. Critical views on the process of integration are also presented in a lecture series forming part of the Master of European Studies (MES) offered by the Europa-Universität Viadrina, Frankfurt on Oder (DE). What is interesting{{According to whom|date=January 2011}} in this example is also the interior multi-disciplinary approach, also used in other courses such as “Interdisciplinary Analysis of EU“ (in the “Integrated Studies of Europe” Programme, Universität Bremen [DE] ).

Here topics such as cultural pluralism and “European identity” or the transformation of the welfare state and “social Europe” are dealt with. The latter topic is the main focus of the Master in European Union Studies offered at Paris-Lodron Universität, Salzburg (AT). Here, courses on social and economic history in the longue durée (18th – 21st centuries) and courses that put EU integration in a pan-European and global framework can be seen as examples of good practice. That is also the case in a course on “Transnational History” at St Andrews (UK) that deals with the interconnections between European societies and non-European regions from the 18th century. That the history of integration after 1945 is very much affected by historical events that happened before 1945 is dealt with in a course on “European History since 1945” (University College, University of London [UK])

There particular attention is paid to the impact of experiences and memories of war, occupation, resistance and the holocaust in the period after 1945. Also the programme in European Studies (M.E.S.) at the University of Vienna, Austria, offers compulsory courses on “Plans for Europe in a historical context before 1945” and “Basics of European integration politics on a historical foundation”. A comparative and transnational approach to the idea of Europe in a long durée perspective is pursued in the second cycle programme in “European Historical Studies” at the University of Évora (Portugal).

Emphasis on the above-mentioned aspect of “European-ness” can be seen in several courses, such as “Culture and Identities in a Contested Continent” (Open University, UK). Here, Europe is defined as a contested and a dynamic space, rather than as a fixed geographical entity. Ideas and concepts of Europe are also part of the programmes on the European Union and European integration at the University of Coimbra (Portugal) that are mainly taught from a historical perspective.

The Faculty of Humanities (Letters) of the University of Coimbra emerges as an example of interesting practice due to the strong presence of the subject across a range of scopes and levels: from a single course unit on EU history compulsory for history students to first and second cycle programmes on European Studies where History is one of the five major fields of research. It can be considered good practice to offer joint studies that stress a broad transnational perspective. The University of Coimbra is – as one example among many – a member of a network of Universities that, with the support of the European Commission, organises a Master in European Studies: “The Process of Building Europe“.

'''Good practice in EU and European Integration history'''

As the group mapped the situation and took a deeper look at examples of good and interesting practice, several factors emerged that – by integrating historical approaches – are useful for improving learning and teaching of European Union and European integration history:

# Placing recent decades in a longue durée perspective, including history before 1945.
# Dealing with aspects of European-ness (perceptions and representations, memory and history), hence with cultural and social history as well as with institutional history.
# Analysing ‘integration’ as a complex process that comprises both integration and disintegration.
# Adding a view of European history from outside Europe and analysing the links of European societies with non-European regions.
# Adopting an inter and multi-disciplinary approach.
# Offering joint programmes on the basis of cooperation between universities. These general findings can be elaborated and specified in terms of key competences seen as useful for students in programmes that deal with European Union and European integration history.

'''What should we know, understand and be able to do? Key Competences in EU-history and the History of European Integration'''

According to the Tuning Educational Structures in Europe project, the objective of single course modules and degree programmes is to develop “competences”, in the broadest sense, in the learner. In substance the central element in organising the learning process is what the person involved will know, understand and be able to do at the end of it.

Attitude too, in this case the historical mind-set or approach, is fundamental. Using the Tuning results of the History Subject Area Group as a starting point, we have examined in depth a number of key competences to be developed in studies in the area of the History of the European Union and European Integration. These may be exemplified by the following:

'''A critical awareness of the relationship between current events in the EU and processes in the past and awareness of differences in historiographical outlooks in various periods and contexts'''

Learners should be aware that EU history does not start with European integration in the form of the European communities after 1945 and that processes and structures going further back than 1945 strongly influence the present situation in the EU and the perception of the EU by its inhabitants. Learners should be aware that current events are often seen through an inherited perspective that is historically based in national and regional frameworks.

Knowledge of the history of Europe is necessary to be able to interpret the different perceptions of current events in various European nations and regions. The knowledge that the learners should acquire in order to be aware of a relationship between current events and processes in the past is not primarily based on simple facts and dates but also on a knowledge of basic structures, the economic and social situation, demography, religion and political systems.

Learners should also be able to identify the role of national or regional myths and interpret the often “invented“ significance of certain historical events in the context of the “identities” forged by European nations and their instrumental use and propagation in national/nationalistic historiography.

'''Ability to place events and structures in historical perspective'''

While a literal interpretation of European Union history – its institutional history / development since 1945 – can be reasonably easily defined and adds to legal and political science approaches, it is important that students also develop an appreciation of European history that predates World War II. Students should be able to demonstrate an understanding of the complex and contested historical origins of the European Union and be able to justify their chosen definition of what constitutes EU history.

This will require them to understand the complementary and divergent natures of specific (e.g. local or national) histories within the EU (to examine the EU as [more than] the sum of its parts) as well as external perspectives on the EU. They should, therefore, demonstrate an understanding of the multiplicity of EU histories defined both chronologically and geographically. By examining the internal and external histories of the EU, students will be able to define “EU history” and its place in world history.

'''Ability to define suitable research topics to contribute to historiographical knowledge and debate'''

The learner should be able to identify a number of significant studies relating to the history of European integration and cooperation during the 20th and the 21st centuries, including for example the concrete acts regarding it, the ideas surrounding it and the obstacles to it; to connect these works with the historical and political context in which they were produced; and to define the position of the author with respect to the historical, political, methodological and theoretical questions addressed.

The learner should be able, on this basis, to pose new questions for research having the potential to advance knowledge and debate, of a complexity appropriate to the level of study. The learner should be able to elaborate a research plan, organised around bibliography, documents and other sources (oral, written, material), as appropriate to address the questions posed and to revise (broaden, perfect) it in relation to his or her findings.

'''Ability to identify and utilise appropriate sources of information for a research project'''

The European Union is sometimes compared to an onion (as a sphere) with concentric layers. This is because it has a horizontal synchronic geographical segmentation and a diachronic vertical periodization. Learners need to acquire competences that allow them to distinguish, compare and analyse different periods and spaces of European and European Union history. This will require competences in finding, classifying and using critically sources of information appropriate to the historical time period, geographical space or phenomena analysed.

Students should have at least a basic knowledge of the methodology of related disciplines and an ability to use this interdisciplinary methodological arsenal (e.g. International Relations theories, security studies, comparative political sociology and political science theory). Learners should be able to combine sources of different kinds (e.g. treaties, European Union law, the acquis communitaire [the body of EU law established until now], audiovisual materials, press releases, discourses, political programmes) and forms (written, electronic sources, official sites of EU administration), address them with critical awareness and analyse them in the appropriate historical, national, international or EU community context.

'''Interdisciplinarity'''

The learner should be aware of and able to use tools of other human sciences as well as those of the various branches of historical research. This entails understanding that different kinds of history (e.g. economic, political, intellectual, cultural, social, institutional, legal, diplomatic, gender and religious history; history of international relations) as well as other human sciences (anthropology, literary criticism, history of language, art history, archaeology, law, sociology, philosophy) are indispensable tools for creating a critical awareness of the relationship between current events related to EU history and the processes of the past, a critical point in student competences.

Moreover, the learner should understand and be critically aware that many of these different branches of history or human sciences may offer a specific focused viewpoint for analyzing the history of the EU in a more profound way. This kind of perspective allows the learner to perceive the differences between the various approaches to EU history and to European history in a broader sense, fostering critical awareness of the way many political discourses are founded on a specific historical view of Europe and its history.

In fact, many different approaches may be used, both in studying the European Union, and in studying European History, but not all of them are equally correct in terms of historical analysis and methodology: some are functional to particular political points of view and based on revisionist or nationalist perspectives. The history of the European Union is more than the sum of the histories of many different countries plus the history of the European Union itself. The EU, just like European citizenship and European identity, can be considered multi-layered or stratified. It is a complex system and requires a multi-faceted approach.

==== 2. World and Global History ====
{{Emptysection|date=February 2013}}

==== 3. E-learning and Digitisation ====
The arrival of the digital age has transformed and is continuing to transform the study of history and the way it is taught. History has embraced the opportunities presented by digitization and e- learning; it is now grasping the ever-greater possibilities offered and tackling the challenges that come with them. Indeed, history as discipline possesses the necessary tools, particularly in the vital area of source criticism, to evaluate and validate the vast amount of information made available through the new technologies.

Interest in making archival materials and collections available has therefore been widely spread among historians. There are many university-based projects to digitise collections of archival materials, history journals are well represented in scholarly on- line source collections such as [[Project Muse]] and [[JSTOR]], and discussion forums are a regular feature of history modules. The value of such developments for the scholar and student of history are evident.

Digital collections reduce the need to travel to archives, search engines enable relevant material to be found more quickly, the availability of materials online reduces the pressure on paper resources in the library and enable more students to use the same materials simultaneously, and, lastly, e-learning tools provide the opportunity to extend the contact time between teachers and students, and amongst students themselves. E-learning also opens up apparently limitless possibilities for distance learning, allowing students across the globe to learn together online.

There are of course a number of problems associated with digitization and e-learning that have yet to be resolved or that must, at least, be acknowledged alongside the opportunities opened up. Digitization has proceeded unevenly, with, for example, a disproportionate representation of English-language materials, and it often reflects the same biases to be found in more traditional collections of materials: thus men tend to be more visible as historical protagonists than women.

Search engines can limit the unwary scholar to a narrow gaze, only identifying those documents which contain particular terms, while missing others with a more subtle relevance to a particular question, and plucking journal articles and primary materials from their context. In terms of e-learning, teachers and students have both expressed concerns about the extent to which online interaction compares favourably with a more traditional lesson in a classroom.

''' The Importance of Digitization and e-Learning to CLIOHWORLD Project'''

The importance of engaging with the digital world has been understood by all the CLIOH projects, not least the current CLIOHWORLD. CLIOHWORLD maintains a website to facilitate communication with its many members, and also to reach out to a much wider audience of scholars, teachers and students of history. Central to the CLIOHWORLD project is the dissemination of learning materials.

The project has already pioneered making available electronically resources for teaching which represent the latest scholarship on numerous key topics related to thematic and national histories. CLIOHWORLD’s current focus is on improving European citizens’ understanding of their own history, especially the history of integration, while placing Europe in a global context. It is not surprising that in order to achieve this, several of the working groups on the project have produced readers and online teaching guides dedicated to their particular fields, and that more are in preparation.

'''Tasks of the Working Group on Digitization'''

The tasks of the Working Group are threefold: to increase the visibility of CLIOHWORLD online; to map the current use of digital and e-learning resources for teaching purposes in universities; and to produce a report which explores the opportunities and challenges related to recent developments in digitization and e-learning.

'''(1) Increasing visibility of CLIOHWORLD and associated projects'''

One of the wonders of the digital age has been the proliferation of resources online, but this presents the challenge of how to maintain a profile in what can often seem like a jungle of information. Our Working Group has made it a priority to raise the profile of CLIOHWORLD by giving it, and its sister organisation CLIOHRES, a presence on the ubiquitous Wikipedia and creating a CLIOHWORLD page on the increasingly popular social networking site Facebook.

It is particularly appropriate that CLIOHWORLD should be found on both these sites, for it ties in with the project’s aims to reach out across the continent, and now globally, to promote a critical understanding of European history, and to disseminate teaching materials to help learners of all ages study this topic. Links to the considerable resources on European history already available on the CLIOHWORLD website have been included on both pages. As mentioned above, many of the other Working Groups of CLIOHWORLD expect to produce online resources related to their particular themes and links to these can be added as appropriate to Wikipedia and Facebook.

'''(2) Mapping the current use of digital and e-learning resources for teaching purposes in universities'''

It is easy to assume that engagement with digital and e-learning resources is universal and at the same level, yet many universities, and departments within them, are at different stages of taking advantage of the opportunities such resources offer. The Working Group is mapping the use of digital and e-learning resources in the universities of CLIOHWORLD partners using an online survey. We hope to identify what digital resources are being used by individuals and their colleagues to support their teaching; get a sense of the way in which e-learning tools are being utilised to facilitate and enhance student experience; and explore the extent to which such endeavours are supported at a departmental, faculty and institutional level.

The last issue addressed in the questionnaire is the challenges faced by teachers in making use of digital resources and e-learning tools. It is often assumed, for example, that young people are automatically computer literate and skilled in the use of search engines and digital resources, but it is often the case that they require training and support. Tied closely with this is our final question which addresses the issue of competencies.

The Tuning project has identified a number of key competencies which students of history can be expected to demonstrate. Three competences are related to the use of digital and e-learning resources: knowledge of and ability to use information retrieval tools, such as […] e-references; ability to use computer and internet resources for elaborating historical or related data; and ability to identify and utilise appropriately sources of information […] for research projects. We hope to identify the extent to which the competences listed are sufficient to enable a student to use digital materials and e-learning tools.

Our initial results suggest that considerable numbers of university lecturers are making use of some digital resources and e-learning tools, but that not all resources available are used equally. Thus databases of sources are more popular than YouTube videos, and e-learning platforms are used more often than wikis and blogs. Many expressed concerns about the limited nature of training available to staff, which helps explain the disproportionate use of the least challenging digital and e-learning resources. The results from this questionnaire will feed into our third output which is a report.

'''(3) Information gathering on digitization and e-learning'''

The field of digitization and e-learning is fast-moving and Working Group 3 aims to keep CLIOHWORLD abreast of those changes, as well as produce materials that can be used a guide for scholars, teachers and students. Thus, the group is working on a report which builds on and updates the research it conducted for CLIOHnet 2 and explores new developments in digitization and e-learning resources. Three main areas for further research have been identified:

'''(a) Researching history'''

Digital resources have transformed the experience of researching. Comparing the Gutenbergian book format and new digital formats increases our awareness of the opportunities offered and limitations imposed by both media and the experience of using them. As digital resources have increased, so too have digital research aids, like Zotero, and understanding their role and place in global historical research is vital.

Such tools are designed to facilitate the building of international virtual research groups and to enhance the individual researcher’s experience of online research. Questions remain, however, around the extent to which such tools improve scholarly enquiry. Do such tools represent a threat to the traditional historical skills associated with archival research? Similarly, the proliferation of online resources is changing the nature and role of archives and libraries, and it is useful to consider the consequences of these developments.

'''(b) Publishing history'''

Just as digitization is changing the nature of the archiving of primary materials, it is also influencing the publication of secondary materials. Journals are published online as a matter of course and projects to digitise books are underway in a number of guises. It is important to note though that while online journals are extremely popular amongst scholars, there is perhaps still some resistance to reading books online or using the new electronic book readers like Kindle. Other new methods for publishing historical material like Drupal, WordPress and so on also need to be discussed, for they raise wider questions about the effect of open-access publishing and the barriers to achieving this.

'''(c) Teaching history'''

Digital resources and e-learning tools have the potential to enhance teaching. Digital resources relieve pressure on more traditional sources and make available to students previously inaccessible documents and materials. Where digital resources are concerned, however, it is vital that teachers of history also equip students to deal with the challenges they pose. The, at times, lax checks and balances which govern online publishing mean that the unwary may use unreliable or poor quality materials in the place of more scholarly resources.

Universities are also increasingly aware of the opportunities for expanding their reach and recruitment using e-learning tools, with lectures being posted on YouTube and online courses being developed to enable distance learning. Even social networking sites like Facebook and virtual worlds like Second Life are proving to be of use to educational institutions, facilitating communication and, in the latter case, enabling the recreation of artefacts, battlegrounds and even cities of the past.

The Working Group has interviewed one teacher of history on her experiences of using Second Life as a teaching tool and will include details of this case study in the report. As the interview highlighted, questions remain, however, about the extent to which such online interaction is an adequate or satisfying replacement for traditional classroom based activities.

==CLIOHRES==
[http://www.cliohres.net/ CLIOHRES] (“Creating Links and Innovative Overviews for a New History Research Agenda for the Citizens of a Growing Europe") is a Sixth Framework Programme Network of Excellence organized by a group of 45 [[university|universities]], many of which are CLIOH.net members.

A five-year project, it aims at achieving and disseminating greater understanding of both the actual histories and the representations of the past current in Europe today, highlighting both diversities and connections and explaining the development context. It brings together historians, geographers, art historians, linguists, theologists, philologists, sociologists and philosophers in order to explore how differences, connections, conflicts and positive interaction have developed in the past and can develop in the future. It involves 180 research staff and doctoral students from 31 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Communities in European history |last=Pan-Montojo |first=Juan |authorlink= |author2=Frederik Pedersen |year=2007 |publisher=Edizioni Plus |location= |isbn=88-8492-462-6 |page=8 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T7aH-tU3x3UC&amp;pg=PR8&amp;dq |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLIOHRES has six thematic working groups. They are:

# States, legislation, institutions
# Power and culture, including language, art and architecture
# Religious and Philosophical concepts
# Work, Gender and Society
# Frontiers and Identities
# Europe and the World

=== Work, Gender and Society Thematic Working Group ===
The exact priorities, pathways and specific work-plan of the Thematic Working Group (TWG) of Cliohres responsible for work, gender and society will be defined by the Group and will follow the general scheme outlined. However, on the basis of previous planning, the agenda is to examine the different ways in which society has organized itself in different times and places, with respect to the organization of labor, the definition of gender roles, civic and family structures.

The ways these forms of organization have been or have not been exported to other parts of the world, the extent to which they define a kind of European-ness, or vice versa, the extent to which national, regional and chronological differences are significant within Europe will be examined as will the links with colonial society and with political and economic changes in the role of Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries. The central methodological core around which this TWG will work sees the study of gender as a valuable tool for understanding social evolutions rather than as an end in itself.

'''Exploration''' is the act of [[wikt:search|searching]] for the purpose of discovery of [[information]] or resources. Exploration occurs in all [[Sessility (zoology)|non-sessile]] animal species, including humans. In human [[history]], its most dramatic rise was during the [[Age of Discovery]] when [[European peoples|European]] explorers sailed and charted much of the rest of the world for a variety of reasons. Since then, [[major explorations after the Age of Discovery]] have occurred for reasons mostly aimed at information discovery.

In [[scientific research]], exploration is one of three purposes of empirical research (the other two being description and [[explanation]]). The term is often used metaphorically. For example, an individual may speak of exploring the Internet, sexuality, etc.&lt;!-- How are these metaphors? They fit the definition - searching for the discovery of information. --&gt;

==Notable periods of human exploration==

===Phoenician galley sailings===
The [[Phoenicia]]ns (1550 BCE–300 BCE) traded throughout the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Asia Minor]] though many of their routes are still unknown today. The presence of tin in some Phoenician artifacts suggests that they may have traveled to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. According to Virgil's [[Aeneid]] and other ancient sources, the legendary Queen [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] was a Phoenician from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] who sailed to [[North Africa]] and founded the city of Carthage.

===Carthaginean exploration of Western Africa===
[[Hanno the Navigator]] (500 BC), a [[Carthage|Carthaginean]] navigator explored the Western Coast of [[Africa]].

===Greek &amp; Roman exploration of Northern Europe and Thule===
* The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] explorer from [[Marseille]], [[Pytheas]] (380 – ''c.'' 310 BC) was the first to circumnavigate [[Great Britain]], explore [[Germany]], and reach ''[[Thule]]'' (most commonly thought to be the [[Shetland Islands]] or [[Iceland]]).
* Romans -under [[Augustus]] emperor- reached and explored all the [[Baltic Sea]]

===Roman explorations ===
;Africa Exploration
The Romans organized expeditions to cross the [[Sahara]] desert with five different routes:

*through the western Sahara, toward the [[Niger]] river and actual [[Timbuktu]]. 
*through the Tibesti mountains, toward Lake Chad and actual [[Nigeria]] 
*through the [[Nile]] river, toward actual [[Uganda]]. 
*though the western coast of Africa, toward the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Cape Verde]] islands. 
*through the [[Red Sea]], toward actual [[Somalia]] and perhaps [[Tanzania]].

All these expeditions were supported by legionaries and had mainly a commercial purpose. Only the one done by emperor [[Nero]] seemed to be a preparative for the conquest of [[Ethiopia]] or [[Nubia]]: in 62 AD two legionaries explored the sources of the Nile river.

One of the main reasons of the explorations was to get gold using the camel to transport it.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Jonathan 2002. ''The Roman Army in Tripolitana and Gold Trade with Sub-Saharan Africa''. APA Annual Convention. New Orleans.&lt;/ref&gt;

The explorations near the African western and eastern coasts were supported by Roman ships and deeply related to the naval commerce (mainly toward the [[Indian Ocean]]).
Romans organized several explorations also in Northern Europe, and as far as Asia up to China .

;30 BC-640 AD: With the acquisition of Ptolemaic Egypt, [[Roman trade with India|The Romans begin trading with India]]. The Empire now has a direct connection to the [[Spice trade]] Egypt had established beginning in 118 BC.

;100 AD-166 AD: [[Romano-Chinese relations]] begin. [[Ptolemy]] [[Geography (Ptolemy)|writes]] of the [[Golden Chersonese]] (i.e. [[Malay Peninsula]]) and the trade port of [[Kattigara]], now identified as [[Óc Eo]] in northern [[Vietnam]], then part of [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]], a province of the Chinese [[Han dynasty|Han Empire]]. The [[Twenty-Four Histories|Chinese historical texts]] describe Roman embassies, from a land they called ''[[Daqin]]''.

;2nd century: Roman traders reach [[Siam]], [[Cambodia]], [[Sumatra]], and [[Java]].

;161: An embassy from Roman Emperor [[Antoninus Pius]] or his successor [[Marcus Aurelius]] reaches Chinese [[Emperor Huan of Han]] at [[Luoyang]].

;226: A Roman diplomat or merchant lands in northern Vietnam and visits [[Nanjing]], China and the court of [[Sun Quan]], ruler of [[Eastern Wu]]

===Chinese exploration of Central Asia===
During the 2nd century BC, the [[Han dynasty]] explored much of the Eastern Northern Hemisphere. Starting in 139 BC, the Han diplomat [[Zhang Qian]] traveled west in an unsuccessful attempt to secure an alliance with the Da [[Yuezhi]] against the [[Xiongnu]] (the Yuezhi had been evicted from [[Gansu]] by the Xiongnu in 177 BC); however, Zhang's travels discovered entire countries which the Chinese were unaware of, including the [[Hellenistic civilization|remnants of the conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] (r. 336–323 BC).{{sfnm|di Cosmo|2002|1pp=247–249|Yü|1986|2p=407|Torday|1997|3p=104|4a1=Morton|4a2=Lewis|4y=2005|4pp=54–55}} When Zhang returned to China in 125 BC, he reported on his visits to [[Dayuan]] ([[Fergana]]), [[Kangju]] ([[Sogdiana]]), and [[Daxia]] ([[Bactria]], formerly the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] which had just been subjugated by the Da Yuezhi).{{sfn|Torday|1997|pp=105–106}} Zhang described Dayuan and Daxia as agricultural and urban countries like China, and although he did not venture there, described Shendu (the [[Indus River]] valley of [[Northwestern India]]) and Anxi ([[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] territories) further west.{{sfn|Torday|1997|pp=108–112}}

===Viking Age===
[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|Viking settlements and voyages]]
From about 800 AD to 1040 AD, the [[Vikings]] explored Europe and much of the Western Northern Hemisphere via rivers and oceans. For example, it is known that the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Viking]] explorer, [[Erik the Red]] (950–1003), sailed to and settled in [[Greenland]] after being expelled from [[Iceland]], while his son, the [[Iceland]]ic explorer [[Leif Ericson]] (980–1020), reached [[Newfoundland]] and the nearby North American coast, and is believed to be the first [[Europe]]an to land in [[North America]].

===Polynesian Age===
[[File:Migraciones austronesias.png|thumb|[[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] expansion map]]
[[Polynesians]] were a maritime people, who populated and explored the central and [[Oceania|south Pacific]] for around 5,000 years, up to about 1280 when they discovered [[New Zealand]]. The key invention to their exploration was the [[outrigger canoe]], which provided a swift and stable platform for carrying goods and people. Based on limited evidence, it is thought that the voyage to New Zealand was deliberate. It is unknown if one or more boats went to New Zealand, or the type of boat, or the names of those who migrated. 2011 studies at [[Wairau Bar]] in New Zealand show a high probability that one origin was Ruahine Island in the [[Society Islands]]. Polynesians may have used the prevailing north easterly [[trade winds]] to reach New Zealand in about three weeks. The Cook Islands are in direct line along the migration path and may have been an intermediate stopping point. There are cultural and language similarities between [[Cook Islanders]] and New Zealand [[Māori people|Maori]]. Early Maori had different legends of their origins, but the stories were misunderstood and reinterpreted in confused written accounts by early European historians in New Zealand trying to present a coherent pattern of Maori settlement in New Zealand.

Mathematical modelling based on DNA [[Identity by descent|genome studies]], using [[state-of-the-art]] techniques, have shown that a large number of Polynesian migrants (100–200), including women, arrived in New Zealand around the same time, in about 1280.  [[Otago University]] studies have tried to link distinctive DNA teeth patterns, which show special dietary influence, with places in or nearby the [[Society Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Otago University. Wairau Bar Studies 2011.Dr L. Matisoo-Smith.2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese exploration of the Indian Ocean===
The Chinese explorer, [[Wang Dayuan]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1311–1350) made two major trips by ship to the Indian Ocean. During 1328–1333, he sailed along the [[South China Sea]] and visited many places in [[Southeast Asia]] and reached as far as [[South Asia]], landing in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]]. Then in 1334–1339, he visited [[North Africa]] and [[East Africa]]. Later, the Chinese admiral [[Zheng He]] (1371–1433) made [[Treasure voyages|seven voyages]] to [[Arabia]], [[East Africa]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Thailand]].

===European Age of Discovery===
[[File:Viajes_de_colon_en.svg|thumb|300px|The Transatlantic [[voyages of Christopher Columbus|voyages]] of [[Christopher Columbus]]]]
The [[Age of Discovery]], also known as the Age of Exploration, is one of the most important periods of geographical exploration in human history. It started in the early 15th century and lasted until the 17th century. In that period, Europeans discovered and/or explored vast areas of the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. [[Portuguese empire|Portugal]] and [[Spanish empire|Spain]] dominated the first stages of exploration, while other European nations followed, such as [[British empire|England]], [[Dutch empire|Netherlands]], and [[French colonial empire|France]].

[[File:Map of Portuguese Carreira da India.gif|300px|thumb|Outward and return voyages of the [[Portuguese India Armadas|Portuguese India run]] in the Atlantic and the Indian oceans, with the [[North Atlantic Gyre]] (''[[Volta do mar]]'') picked up by [[Henry the Navigator|Henry]]'s navigators, and the outward route of the South Atlantic westerlies that [[Bartolomeu Dias]] discovered in 1488, followed and explored by the expeditions of [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]]]]
The most important explorers of this period include: [[Diogo Cão]] (c.1452 –c.1486) who discovered and ascended the [[Congo River]] and reached the coasts of the present-day [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]]; [[Bartolomeu Dias]] (c. 1450–1500), who was the first European to reach the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and other parts of the [[South Africa]]n coast; [[Christopher Columbus]] (1451–1506), who led a [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ([[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]) expedition across the Atlantic, [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovering America]]; [[Vasco da Gama]] (1460–1524), a navigator who made the first trip from Europe to India and back by the Cape of Good Hope, discovering the ocean route to the [[East]]; [[Pedro Alvares Cabral]] (c. 1467/68–c.1520) who, following the path of Gama, claimed [[Brazil]] and led the first expedition that linked Europe, Africa, America, and Asia; [[Diogo Dias]], who discovered the eastern coast of [[Madagascar]] and rounded the corner of Africa; explorers such as [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]] and [[Pedro Mascarenhas]] (1470–1555), among others, who discovered and mapped the [[Mascarene Islands]] and other archipelagos; [[António de Abreu]] (c.1480–c.1514) and [[Francisco Serrão]] (14?–1521), who led the first direct European fleet into the Pacific Ocean (on its western edges), through the [[Sunda Islands]], reaching the [[Moluccas]]; [[Juan Ponce de León]] (1474–1521), who discovered and mapped the coast of [[Florida]]; [[Vasco Núñez de Balboa]] (c. 1475–1519), who was the first European to view the Pacific Ocean from American shores (after crossing the [[Isthmus of Panama]]) confirming that America was a separate continent from Asia; [[Ferdinand Magellan]] (1480–1521), who was the first navigator to cross the Pacific Ocean, discovering the [[Strait of Magellan]], the [[Tuamotus]] and [[Mariana Islands]], achieving a nearly complete [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth, in multiple voyages, for the first time; [[Juan Sebastian Elcano]] (1476–1526), who completed the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|global circumnavigation]]; [[Aleixo Garcia]] (14?–1527), who explored the territories of present-day southern Brazil, [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]], crossing the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]] and reaching the [[Andes]] (near [[Sucre]]); [[Jorge de Menezes]] (c. 1498–?), who discovered [[Papua New Guinea]]; [[García Jofre de Loaísa]] (1490–1526), who discovered the [[Marshall Islands]]; [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] (1490–1558), who discovered the [[Mississippi River]] and was the first European to sail the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and cross [[Texas]]; [[Jacques Cartier]] (1491–1557), who drew the first maps of part of central and maritime Canada; [[Andres de Urdaneta]] (1498–1568), who discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas; [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]] (1510–1554), who discovered the [[Grand Canyon]] and the [[Colorado River]]; [[Francisco de Orellana]] (1511–1546), who was the first European to navigate the length of the [[Amazon River]].

[[File:Cook Three Voyages 59.png|thumb|300px|The routes of Captain [[James Cook]]'s voyages. The first voyage is shown in '''&lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;''', second voyage in '''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;green&lt;/span&gt;''', and third voyage in '''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;'''.]]
Continuing in the second half of the 16th century and the 17th century with explorers such as [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] (1498–1568), who discovered the maritime route from Asia to the Americas; [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira|Álvaro de Mendaña]] (1542–1595), who discovered the [[Tuvalu]] archipelago, the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Wake Island]]; [[Willem Janszoon]] (1570–1630), who made the first recorded European landing in Australia; [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]] (1565–1614), who discovered the [[Pitcairn Islands]] and the [[Vanuatu]] archipelago; [[Yñigo Ortiz de Retez]], who discovered and reached eastern and northern [[New Guinea]]; [[Luis Váez de Torres]] (1565–1613), who discovered the [[Torres Strait]] between [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]]; [[Henry Hudson]] (156?–1611), who explored the [[Hudson Bay]] in Canada; [[Samuel de Champlain]] (1574–1635), who explored  [[St. Lawrence River]] and the [[Great Lakes]] (in Canada and northern United States); [[Abel Tasman]] (1603–1659), who explored North Australia, discovered [[Tasmania]] and [[New Zealand]]; and [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] (1643–1687), who explored the Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada, and the entire length of the Mississippi River.

Long after the golden age of discovery, other explorers ''completed'' the world map, such as various [[Russian Empire|Russians]] explorers, reaching the [[Siberia]]n Pacific coast and the [[Bering Strait]], at the extreme edge of Asia and Alaska (North America); [[Vitus Bering]] (1681–1741) who in the service of the Russian Navy, explored the [[Bering Strait]], the [[Bering Sea]], the North American coast of [[Alaska]], and some other northern areas of the Pacific Ocean; and [[James Cook]], who explored the east coast of Australia, the [[Hawaiian Islands]], and circumnavigated the Antarctic continent.

===Space exploration===
Humanity is continuing to follow the impulse to explore, moving beyond [[Earth]].  [[Space exploration]] started in the 20th century with the invention of exo-atmospheric [[rocket]]s.  This has given humans the opportunity to travel to the [[moon]], and to send robotic explorers to other [[planet]]s and far beyond.

Both of the [[Voyager probes]] have left the [[Solar System]], bearing imprinted gold discs with multiple data types.

A 2015 study, performed on mobile phone data  and on GPS tracks of private vehicles in [[Italy]], demonstrated that  individuals naturally split into two well-defined categories according to their mobility habits, dubbed "returners" and "explorers".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/150908/ncomms9166/full/ncomms9166.html|title = Returners and Explorers dichotomy in Human Mobility|last = Luca Pappalardo|date = 8 September 2015|journal = Nature Communications|doi = 10.1038/ncomms9166|pmid = 26349016|display-authors=etal|volume=6|pages=8166|pmc=4569739}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Explorers" showed a star-like  mobility pattern: they have a central core of locations (composed by home and work places) around which distant core of locations gravitates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bigdatatales.com/blog/2015/09/23/are-you-a-returner-or-an-explorer-ask-big-data/|title = Are you a returner or an explorer?

He achieved wide recognition in his day and—while primarily influential within the [[Continental philosophy|continental]] tradition of philosophy—has become increasingly influential in the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/hegel/|title=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|first=Redding|last=Paul|authorlink=Paul Redding|date=13 February 1997|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hegel remains a divisive figure, his canonical stature within [[Western philosophy]] is universally recognized.

Hegel's principal achievement was his development of a distinctive articulation of [[idealism]], sometimes termed ''[[absolute idealism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;This term is actually quite rare in Hegel's writings. It does not occur anywhere in ''The Science of Logic'' (though he comes close in a remark on p. 124 of the [2010] di Giovanni translation, GW 21.142). In the ''Encyclopedia'' presentation of his logic it can be found only at §45R. Greraets, Suchting and Harris note in the introduction to their translation of this later text that the term is more strongly associated with English movement in that later part of the 19th century (Hackett: 1991, xiii).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the dualisms of, for instance, mind and nature and [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]] are overcome. His philosophy of spirit conceptually integrates psychology, the state, history, art, religion and philosophy. His account of the [[master–slave dialectic]] has been highly influential, especially in 20th-century France.&lt;ref&gt;Overwhelmingly due to [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s influential lectures published as ''Introduction à la lecture de Hegel'' (Paris, 1947), selections translated into English by James Nichols as ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'' (New York, 1969). See, for instance, Aimé Patri, "Dialectique du Maître et de l’Esclave", Le Contrat Social, V, No. a (July–August 196r), 234, cited in Editor's Introduction (vii) on the extent of their influence.&lt;/ref&gt; Of special importance is his concept of spirit (''[[Geist]]'', sometimes also translated as "mind") as the historical manifestation of the logical concept and the [[Aufheben|"sublation"]] (''Aufhebung'', integration without [[Reduction (philosophy)|elimination or reduction]]) of seemingly contradictory or opposing factors: examples include the apparent opposition between nature and [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and between [[immanence]] and [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]. Hegel has been seen in the 20th century as the originator of the [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]] triad,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Solomon]], ''In the Spirit of Hegel'', Oxford University Press, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; but as an explicit phrase it originated with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]].&lt;ref name=Fichte&gt;"Review of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]''" ([http://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/trad/fichte/jgf-aenesidemus.html "Rezension des Aenesidemus"], ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung|de}}'', February 11–12, 1794). Trans. Daniel Breazeale. In {{cite book| last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel has influenced many thinkers and writers whose own positions vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;"One of the few things on which the analysts, pragmatists, and existentialists agree with the dialectical theologians is that Hegel is to be repudiated: their attitude toward Kant, Aristotle, Plato, and the other great philosophers is not at all unanimous even within each movement; but opposition to Hegel is part of the platform of all four, and of the Marxists, too." [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm "The Hegel Myth and Its Method"] in ''From Shakespeare to Existentialism: Studies in Poetry, Religion, and Philosophy'', Beacon Press, Boston, 1959 (pp.&amp;nbsp;88–119).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Barth]] described Hegel as a "Protestant [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]"&lt;ref&gt;"Why did Hegel not become for the Protestant world something similar to what Thomas Aquinas was for Roman Catholicism?" (Karl Barth, ''Protestant Thought from Rousseau to Ritschl: Being the Translation Of Eleven Chapters of Die Protestantische Theologie im 19. Jahrhundert'', 268 Harper, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] wrote that "all the great philosophical ideas of the past century—the philosophies of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], German [[existentialism]], and [[psychoanalysis]]—had their beginnings in Hegel."&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Merleau-Ponty (trans. Herbert L. and Patricia Allen Dreyfus), ''Sense and Nonsense'', Northwestern University Press, 1964, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
=== Early years ===
==== Childhood ====
[[File:Stuttgart-Hegel-Birthplace-2006-04-09a.jpg|thumb|left|The birthplace of Hegel in [[Stuttgart]], which now houses the Hegel Museum]]
He was born on August 27, 1770 in [[Stuttgart]], capital of the [[Duchy of Württemberg]] in southwestern Germany. Christened Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, he was known as Wilhelm to his close family. His father, Georg Ludwig, was ''Rentkammersekretär'' (secretary to the revenue office) at the court of [[Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg]].&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|2–3, 745}} Hegel's mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa (née Fromm), was the daughter of a lawyer at the High Court of Justice at the Württemberg court. She died of a "bilious fever" (''Gallenfieber'') when Hegel was thirteen. Hegel and his father also caught the disease, but they narrowly survived.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkard, ''Hegel: A Biography'', p. 3, incorrectly gives the date as September 20, 1781, and describes Hegel as aged eleven. Cf. the index to Pinkard's book and his "Chronology of Hegel's Life", which correctly give the date as 1783 (pp. 773, 745); see also [[:de:Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Studien und Interessen|German Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel had a sister, Christiane Luise (1773–1832); and a brother, Georg Ludwig (1776–1812), who was to perish as an officer in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|4}}

At the age of three, he went to the German School. When he entered the Latin School two years later, he already knew the [[first declension]], having been taught it by his mother. In 1776, he entered Stuttgart's ''[[gymnasium illustre]]'' and during his adolescence read voraciously, copying lengthy extracts in his diary. Authors he read include the poet [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] and writers associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[Christian Garve]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. His studies at the ''Gymnasium'' were concluded with his ''[[Abitur]]rede'' ("graduation speech") entitled "The abortive state of art and scholarship in Turkey"&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|16}} ("den verkümmerten Zustand der Künste und Wissenschaften unter den Türken").&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Rosenkranz]], ''Hegels Leben'', Duncker und Humblot, 1844, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tübingen (1788–1793) ====
At the age of eighteen, Hegel entered the [[Tübinger Stift]] (a Protestant seminary attached to the [[University of Tübingen]]), where he had as roommates the poet and philosopher [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] and the philosopher-to-be [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | editor=[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1993 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT419&amp;dq=%22Hegel%22%22Tübinger+Stift.+1789–1790+shares+a+roomwith+Hölderlin+and+Schelling+and+forms+friendship+with+them%22 419]| id={{ISBN|1-13982495-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing a dislike for what they regarded as the restrictive environment of the Seminary, the three became close friends and mutually influenced each other's ideas. All greatly admired Hellenic civilization and Hegel additionally steeped himself in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and Lessing during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=H.S.|title=Phenomenology and System|date=1995|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They watched the unfolding of the [[French Revolution]] with shared enthusiasm. Schelling and Hölderlin immersed themselves in theoretical debates on [[Kantian philosophy]], from which Hegel remained aloof. Hegel at this time envisaged his future as that of a ''Popularphilosoph'', i.e. a "man of letters" who serves to make the abstruse ideas of philosophers accessible to a wider public; his own felt need to engage critically with the central ideas of Kantianism did not come until 1800. 

Although the violence of the [[Reign of Terror]] in 1793 dampened Hegel's hopes, he continued to identify with the moderate [[Girondin]] faction and never lost his commitment to the principles of 1789, which he would express by drinking a toast to the [[storming of the Bastille]] every fourteenth of July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Good |first1=James Allan |title=A Search for Unity in Diversity: The "Permanent Hegelian Deposit" in the Philosophy of John Dewey |date=2006 |publisher=Lexington Books |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Bern (1793–1796) and Frankfurt (1797–1801) ====
Having received his theological certificate (''[[consistory (Protestantism)|Konsistorial]]examen'') from the Tübingen Seminary, Hegel became ''Hofmeister'' (house tutor) to an aristocratic family in [[Bern]] (1793–1796). During this period, he composed the text which has become known as the ''[[Life of Jesus (Hegel)|Life of Jesus]]'' and a book-length manuscript titled "The Positivity of the Christian Religion". His relations with his employers becoming strained. Hegel accepted an offer mediated by Hölderlin to take up a similar position with a wine merchant's family in [[Frankfurt]], where he moved in 1797. Here, Hölderlin exerted an important influence on Hegel's thought.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|80}} While in Frankfurt, Hegel composed the essay "Fragments on Religion and Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.documenta.de/research/assets/Uploads/Hegel-Fragment-on-Love.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008103100/http://www3.documenta.de/research/assets/Uploads/Hegel-Fragment-on-Love.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1799, he wrote another essay entitled "The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60921.pdf The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate"]&lt;/ref&gt; unpublished during his lifetime.

Also in 1797, the unpublished and unsigned manuscript of "[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]" was written. It was written in Hegel's hand, but thought to have been authored by either Hegel, Schelling, Hölderlin, or an unknown fourth person.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;Kai Hammermeister, ''The German Aesthetic Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career years ===
==== Jena, Bamberg and Nuremberg (1801–1816) ====
In 1801, Hegel came to [[Jena]] with the encouragement of his old friend Schelling, who held the position of Extraordinary Professor at the [[University of Jena|University]] there. Hegel secured a position at the University as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' (unsalaried lecturer) after submitting an [[inaugural dissertation]] on the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;The title of Hegel's thesis was ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium'' (''Philosophical Dissertation on the Orbits of the Planets''); published, with a German translation by Wolgang Neuser, as ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium / Philosophische erörterung über die Planetenbahnen'', Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, Hegel's first book ''[[The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy]]'' was completed. He lectured on "Logic and Metaphysics" and gave joint lectures with Schelling on an "Introduction to the Idea and Limits of True Philosophy" and held a "Philosophical Disputorium". In 1802, Schelling and Hegel founded a journal, the ''Kritische Journal der Philosophie'' (''Critical Journal of Philosophy''), to which they each contributed pieces until the collaboration was ended when Schelling left for [[Würzburg]] in 1803.

In 1805, the University promoted Hegel to the position of Extraordinary Professor (unsalaried) after he wrote a letter to the poet and minister of culture [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] protesting at the promotion of his philosophical adversary [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]] ahead of him.&lt;ref name=pinkard&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinkard|first=Terry|title=Hegel: A Biography|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-49679-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}} Hegel attempted to enlist the help of the poet and translator [[Johann Heinrich Voß]] to obtain a post at the newly renascent [[University of Heidelberg]], but he failed; to his chagrin, Fries was later in the same year made Ordinary Professor (salaried) there.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|224–25}}

[[File:Hegel-and-Napoleon-in-Jena-1806.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|"Hegel and Napoleon in Jena" (illustration from ''Harper's Magazine'', 1895), whose meeting became proverbial due to Hegel's notable use of ''[[Weltseele]]'' ("world-soul") in reference to Napoleon ("the world-soul on horseback", ''{{lang|de|die Weltseele zu Pferde}}'')&lt;ref&gt;Note that ''Weltseele zu Pferde'' is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in the letter. The letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859 (L. Noack, ''Schelling und die Philosophie der Romantik'', 1859, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=7NO__b_nwrsC&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]). It is used without attribution by [[Meyer Kayserling]] in his ''Sephardim'' (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in ''Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen'' 2 (1861) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4zBFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA770  p. 770], who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's "bad jokes" (''schlechte Witze''). The phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century, e.g. G. Baur in ''Reden gehalten in der Aula der Universität Leipzig beim Rectoratswechsel am 31. October 1874'' (1874), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=INxiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With his finances drying up quickly, Hegel was now under great pressure to deliver his book, the long-promised introduction to his System. Hegel was putting the finishing touches to this book, ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on 14 October 1806 in the [[Battle of Jena]] on a plateau outside the city. On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena. Hegel recounted his impressions in a letter to his friend [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;I saw the Emperor – this world-soul [''[[Weltseele]]''] – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.&lt;ref&gt;''{{lang|de|den Kaiser – diese Weltseele – sah ich durch die Stadt zum Rekognoszieren hinausreiten; es ist in der Tat eine wunderbare Empfindung, ein solches Individuum zu sehen, das hier auf einen Punkt kontentriert, auf einem Pferde sitzend, über die Welt übergreift und sie beherrscht.}}''Hegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F. I. Niethammer,  no. 74 (p. 119) in ''Briefe von und an Hegel'' ed. Hoffmeister, vol. 1 (1970), cited after H. Schnädelbach in Wolfgang Welsch, Klaus Vieweg (eds.), ''Das Interesse des Denkens: Hegel aus heutiger Sicht'', Wilhelm Fink Verlag (2003),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NrkPdUO5VRsC&amp;pg=PA233  p. 223]; trans. Pinkard (2000:228).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pinkard (2000) notes that Hegel's comment to Niethammer "is all the more striking since at that point he had already composed the crucial section of the ''Phenomenology'' in which he remarked that the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] had now officially passed to another land (Germany) that would complete 'in thought' what the Revolution had only partially accomplished in practice".&lt;ref&gt;Pinkard (2000:228f).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Napoleon chose not to close down Jena as he had other universities, the city was devastated and students deserted the university in droves, making Hegel's financial prospects even worse. The following February, Hegel's landlady Christiana Burkhardt (who had been abandoned by her husband) gave birth to their son Georg Ludwig Friedrich Fischer (1807–1831).&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|192}}

In March 1807, Hegel moved to [[Bamberg]], where Niethammer had declined and passed on to Hegel an offer to become editor of a newspaper, the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Bamberger Zeitung|de}}''. Unable to find more suitable employment, Hegel reluctantly accepted. Ludwig Fischer and his mother (whom Hegel may have offered to marry following the death of her husband) stayed behind in Jena.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|238}}

In November 1808, Hegel was again through Niethammer, appointed headmaster of a ''Gymnasium'' in [[Nuremberg]], a post he held until 1816. While in Nuremberg, Hegel adapted his recently published ''Phenomenology of Spirit'' for use in the classroom. Part of his remit being to teach a class called "Introduction to Knowledge of the Universal Coherence of the Sciences", Hegel developed the idea of an encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences, falling into three parts (logic, philosophy of nature and philosophy of spirit).&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|337}}

In 1811, Hegel married Marie Helena Susanna von Tucher (1791–1855), the eldest daughter of a Senator. This period saw the publication of his second major work, the ''Science of Logic'' (''Wissenschaft der Logik''; 3 vols., 1812, 1813 and 1816), and the birth of his two legitimate sons, [[Karl von Hegel|Karl Friedrich Wilhelm]] (1813–1901) and Immanuel Thomas Christian (1814–1891).

==== Heidelberg and Berlin (1816–1831) ====
Having received offers of a post from the Universities of [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]], Hegel chose Heidelberg, where he moved in 1816. Soon after, his illegitimate son Ludwig Fischer (now ten years old) joined the Hegel household in April 1817, having thus far spent his childhood in an orphanage&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|354–55}} as his mother had died in the meantime.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|356}}

Hegel published ''The Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Outline'' (1817) as a summary of his philosophy for students attending his lectures at Heidelberg.

[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In 1818, Hegel accepted the renewed offer of the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin, which had remained vacant since [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s death in 1814. Here, Hegel published his ''Philosophy of Right'' (1821). Hegel devoted himself primarily to delivering his lectures; and his lecture courses on aesthetics, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of history and the history of philosophy were published posthumously from lecture notes taken by his students. His fame spread and his lectures attracted students from all over Germany and beyond.

In 1819–1827, he made several trips to [[Weimar]] (twice), where he met Goethe, [[Brussels]], the [[Northern Netherlands]], [[Leipzig]], [[Vienna]] through [[Prague]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Siep xxii"&gt;Ludwig Siep, ''Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit'', Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel was appointed [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the University in October 1829, but his term as Rector ended in September 1830. Hegel was deeply disturbed by the riots for reform in Berlin in that year. In 1831, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decorated him with the [[Order of the Red Eagle]], 3rd Class for his service to the Prussian state.&lt;ref name="Siep xxii"/&gt; In August 1831, a [[cholera]] epidemic reached Berlin and Hegel left the city, taking up lodgings in [[Kreuzberg]]. Now in a weak state of health, Hegel seldom went out. As the new semester began in October, Hegel returned to Berlin with the (mistaken) impression that the epidemic had largely subsided. By November 14, Hegel was dead. The physicians pronounced the cause of death as cholera, but it is likely he died from a different gastrointestinal disease. He is said to have uttered the last words "And he didn't understand me" before expiring.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''[[Europe: A History]]'', 1996, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with his wishes, Hegel was buried on November 16 in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]] next to Fichte and [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand Solger]].

Hegel's son Ludwig Fischer had died shortly before while serving with the Dutch army in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] and the news of his death never reached his father.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|548}} Early the following year, Hegel's sister Christiane committed suicide by drowning. Hegel's remaining two sons—[[Karl von Hegel|Karl]], who became a historian; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Immanuel Hegel|de|3=Immanuel Hegel|lt=Immanuel}}, who followed a theological path—lived long and safeguarded their father's ''[[Nachlaß]]'' and produced editions of his works.

== Philosophical work ==
{{Hegelianism}}

=== Freedom ===
Hegel's thinking can be understood as a constructive development within the broad tradition that includes [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. To this list, one could add [[Proclus]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Plotinus]], [[Jakob Böhme]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. What all these thinkers share, which distinguishes them from [[materialists]] like [[Epicurus]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] and from [[empiricists]] like [[David Hume]], is that they regard freedom or self-determination both as real and as having important [[ontology|ontological]] implications for soul or mind or divinity. This focus on freedom is what generates Plato's notion (in the ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'') of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as having a higher or fuller kind of reality than inanimate objects possess. While [[Aristotle]] criticizes Plato's "Forms", he preserves Plato's cornerstones of the ontological implications for self-determination: ethical reasoning, the soul's pinnacle in the hierarchy of nature, the order of the cosmos and an assumption with reasoned arguments for a prime mover. Kant imports Plato's high esteem of individual sovereignty to his considerations of moral and noumenal freedom as well as to God. All three find common ground on the unique position of humans in the scheme of things, known by the discussed categorical differences from animals and inanimate objects.

In his discussion of "Spirit" in his ''Encyclopedia'', Hegel praises Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]]'' as "by far the most admirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this topic".&lt;ref&gt;par. 378&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' and his ''[[Science of Logic]]'', Hegel's concern with Kantian topics such as freedom and morality and with their ontological implications is pervasive. Rather than simply rejecting Kant's dualism of freedom versus nature, Hegel aims to subsume it within "true infinity", the "Concept" (or "Notion": ''Begriff''), "Spirit" and "ethical life" in such a way that the Kantian duality is rendered intelligible, rather than remaining a brute "given".

The reason why this subsumption takes place in a series of concepts is that Hegel's method in his ''Science of Logic'' and his ''Encyclopedia'' is to begin with basic concepts like "Being" and "Nothing" and to develop these through a long sequence of elaborations, including those already mentioned. In this manner, a solution that is reached in principle in the account of "true infinity" in the ''Science of Logic'''s chapter on "Quality" is repeated in new guises at later stages, all the way to "Spirit" and "ethical life" in the third volume of the ''Encyclopedia''.

In this way, Hegel intends to defend the germ of truth in Kantian dualism against reductive or eliminative programs like those of materialism and empiricism. Like Plato, with his dualism of soul versus bodily appetites, Kant pursues the mind's ability to question its felt inclinations or appetites and to come up with a standard of "duty" (or, in Plato's case, "good") which transcends bodily restrictiveness. Hegel preserves this essential Platonic and Kantian concern in the form of infinity going beyond the finite (a process that Hegel in fact relates to "freedom" and the "ought"),&lt;ref name=miller&gt;See ''Science of Logic'', trans. Miller [Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–136, 138}} the universal going beyond the particular (in the Concept) and Spirit going beyond Nature. Hegel renders these dualities intelligible by (ultimately) his argument in the "Quality" chapter of the "Science of Logic". The finite has to become infinite in order to achieve reality. The idea of the absolute excludes multiplicity so the subjective and objective must achieve synthesis to become whole. This is because as Hegel suggests by his introduction of the concept of "reality",&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|111}} what determines itself—rather than depending on its relations to other things for its essential character—is more fully "real" (following the Latin etymology of "real", more "thing-like") than what does not. Finite things do not determine themselves because as "finite" things their essential character is determined by their boundaries over against other finite things, so in order to become "real" they must go beyond their finitude ("finitude is only as a transcending of itself").&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|145}}

The result of this argument is that finite and infinite—and by extension, particular and universal, nature and freedom—do not face one another as two independent realities, but instead the latter (in each case) is the self-transcending of the former.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|146}} Rather than stress the distinct singularity of each factor that complements and conflicts with others—without explanation—the relationship between finite and infinite (and particular and universal and nature and freedom) becomes intelligible as a progressively developing and self-perfecting whole.

=== Progress ===
The mystical writings of [[Jakob Böhme]] had a strong effect on Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Mills (psychologist)|Jon Mills]], ''The Unconscious Abyss: Hegel's Anticipation of Psychoanalysis'', SUNY Press, 2002, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Böhme had written that the [[Fall of Man]] was a necessary stage in the [[evolution]] of the [[universe]]. This evolution was itself the result of God's desire for complete self-awareness. Hegel was fascinated by the works of Kant, Rousseau and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and by the [[French Revolution]]. Modern philosophy, culture and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, [[Philosophy of self|self]] and [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. Hegel's main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that in different contexts he called "the absolute Idea" (''[[Science of Logic]]'', sections 1781–1783) or "absolute knowledge" (''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', "(DD) Absolute Knowledge").

According to Hegel, the main characteristic of this unity was that it evolved through and manifested itself in [[contradiction]] and negation. Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of [[reality]]—[[consciousness]], history, philosophy, art, nature and society—leads to further development until a [[rationality|rational]] unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts by lifting them up (''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'') to a higher unity. This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension. It is rational because the same, underlying, [[logic]]al, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious [[wikt:whole|whole]] is not a thing or [[being]] that lies outside of other existing things or minds. Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who through their own understanding bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself. Hegel's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a philosophy of absolute negation—as long as absolute negation is at the center, systematization remains open, and makes it possible for human beings to become subjects.&lt;ref name="Schroeder2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Schroeder|title=Between Freedom and Necessity: An Essay on the Place of Value|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfT6aQvkVfAC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=2012-12-17|year=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1302-5|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mind" and "Spirit" are the common English translations of Hegel's use of the German "[[Geist]]". Some{{Who|date=December 2012}} have argued that either of these terms overly "psychologize" Hegel,{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} implying a kind of disembodied, solipsistic consciousness like [[ghost]] or "soul". Geist combines the meaning of spirit—as in god, ghost, or mind—with an intentional force. In Hegel's early philosophy of nature (draft manuscripts written during his time at the University of Jena), Hegel's notion of "Geist" was tightly bound to the notion of "[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]]", from which Hegel also derived the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]], but in his later works (after Jena) he did not explicitly use his old notion of "Aether" anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Gruner: "Hegel's Aether Doctrine", [[VDM Publishing|VDM Publ]]., 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-639-28451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Hegel's [[Conception (idea)|conception]] of [[knowledge]] and mind (and therefore also of reality) was the notion of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] in [[Subtraction|difference]]—that is, that mind [[Externalization|externalizes]] itself in various forms and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that stand outside of it or opposed to it; and that through recognizing itself in them, is "with itself" in these external manifestations so that they are at one and the same time mind and other-than-mind. This notion of identity in difference, which is intimately bound up with his conception of contradiction and negativity, is a principal feature differentiating Hegel's thought from that of other philosophers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Civil society ===
{{see also|Civil society}}
Hegel made the distinction between civil society and state in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm|title=Hegel's Philosophy of Right: Preface|first=|last=Hegel, G. W. F.|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, civil society (Hegel used the term "''bürgerliche Gesellschaft''" though it is now referred to as ''Zivilgesellschaft'' in German to emphasize a more inclusive community) was a stage in the [[dialectical|dialectical relationship]] that occurs between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the micro-community of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Pelczynski, A.Z.; 1984; 'The Significance of Hegel's separation of the state and civil society' pp1-13 in Pelczynski, A.Z. (ed.); 1984; ''The State and Civil Society''; Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, the term was split, like Hegel's followers, to the [[political left]] and [[political right|right]]. On the left, it became the foundation for [[Karl Marx]]'s civil society as an [[base and superstructure|economic base]];&lt;ref name="glob"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zaleski | first = Pawel | authorlink = | title = Tocqueville on Civilian Society. A Romantic Vision of the Dichotomic Structure of Social Reality | journal = Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = | publisher = Felix Meiner Verlag | location = | year = 2008 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the right, it became a description for all non-state (and the state is the peak of the objective spirit) aspects of society, including culture, society and politics. This liberal distinction between [[political society]] and [[civil society]] was followed by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="glob" /&gt; In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear. For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of "lesser" and not fully realized types of civil society as these societies were not fully conscious or aware—as it were—as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror such as Napoleon to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized.

=== State ===
Hegel's State is the final culmination of the embodiment of freedom or right (''Rechte'') in the ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]].'' The State subsumes family and civil society and fulfills them. All three together are called "ethical life" (''[[Sittlichkeit]]''). The State involves three "[[wikt:moment#Noun|moments]]". In a Hegelian State, citizens both know their place and choose their place. They both know their obligations and choose to fulfill their obligations. An individual's "supreme duty is to be a member of the state" (''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', section 258). The individual has "substantial freedom in the state". The State is "objective spirit" so "it is only through being a member of the state that the individual himself has objectivity, truth, and ethical life" (section 258). Furthermore, every member both loves the State with genuine patriotism, but has transcended mere "team spirit" by reflectively endorsing their citizenship. Members of a Hegelian State are happy even to sacrifice their lives for the State.

=== Heraclitus ===
According to Hegel, "[[Heraclitus]] is the one who first declared the nature of the infinite and first grasped nature as in itself infinite, that is, its essence as process. The origin of philosophy is to be dated from Heraclitus. His is the persistent Idea that is the same in all philosophers up to the present day, as it was the Idea of Plato and Aristotle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hegel, G. W. F.|title=Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie|year=1979|pages=336–337|url=http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich/Vorlesungen+%C3%BCber+die+Geschichte+der+Philosophie/Erster+Teil%3A+Griechische+Philosophie/Erster+Abschnitt.+Von+Thales+bis+Aristoteles/Erstes+Kapitel.+Von+Thales+bis+Anaxagoras/D.+Philosophie+des+Heraklit | accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hegel, Heraclitus's great achievements were to have understood the nature of the infinite, which for Hegel includes understanding the inherent contradictoriness and negativity of reality; and to have grasped that reality is becoming or process and that "being" and "nothingness" are mere empty abstractions. According to Hegel, Heraclitus's "obscurity" comes from his being a true (in Hegel's terms "speculative") philosopher who grasped the ultimate philosophical truth and therefore expressed himself in a way that goes beyond the abstract and limited nature of common sense and is difficult to grasp by those who operate within common sense. Hegel asserted that in Heraclitus he had an antecedent for his logic: "[...] there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Justus | last=Hartnack |others=Lars Aagaard-Mogensen (trans.) | title=An Introduction to Hegel's Logic | year=1998 | publisher=Hackett Publishing | isbn=0-87220-424-3| pages=16–17}} Hartnack quotes Hegel, ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy'', Volume I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel cites a number of fragments of Heraclitus in his ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Hegel, G. W. F. | title=Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie | year=1979 | pages=319–343 | url=http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich/Vorlesungen+%C3%BCber+die+Geschichte+der+Philosophie/Erster+Teil%3A+Griechische+Philosophie/Erster+Abschnitt.+Von+Thales+bis+Aristoteles/Erstes+Kapitel.+Von+Thales+bis+Anaxagoras/D.+Philosophie+des+Heraklit | accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One to which he attributes great significance is the fragment he translates as "Being is not more than Non-being", which he interprets to mean the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Sein und Nichts sei dasselbe''&lt;br&gt;Being and non-being are the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus does not form any abstract nouns from his ordinary use of "to be" and "to become" and in that fragment seems to be opposing any identity A to any other identity B, C and so on, which is not-A. However, Hegel interprets not-A as not existing at all, not nothing at all, which cannot be conceived, but indeterminate or "pure" [[being]] without [[particular]]ity or specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Frederick Charles | last=Copleston | pages=Chapter X | year=2003 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn=0-8264-6901-9 | nopp=true | title=A History of Philosophy: Volume 7: 18th and 19th century German philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure being and pure non-being or nothingness are for Hegel pure abstractions from the reality of becoming and this is also how he interprets Heraclitus. This interpretation of Heraclitus cannot be ruled out, but even if present is not the main gist of his thought.

For Hegel, the inner movement of reality is the process of God thinking as manifested in the evolution of the universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that when fully and properly understood, [[reality]] is being [[Idealism|thought]] by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process in and through philosophy. Since human thought is the image and fulfillment of God's thought, God is not [[Ineffability|ineffable]] (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable), but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality. Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a [[dialectic|dialectical process]], so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming.

For his god, Hegel does not take the logos of Heraclitus but refers rather to the [[nous]] of [[Anaxagoras]], although he may well have regarded them the same as he continues to refer to god's plan, which is identical to God. Whatever the nous thinks at any time is actual [[Substance theory|substance]] and is identical to limited being, but more remains to be thought in the substrate of non-being, which is identical to pure or unlimited thought.

The universe as becoming is therefore a combination of being and non-being. The particular is never complete in itself, but to find completion is continually transformed into more comprehensive, complex, self-relating particulars. The essential nature of being-for-itself is that it is free "in itself;" that is, it does not depend on anything else such as matter for its being. The limitations represent fetters, which it must constantly be casting off as it becomes freer and more self-determining.&lt;ref&gt;The notable Introduction to ''Philosophy of History'' expresses the historical aspects of the dialectic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hegel began his philosophizing with commentary on the Christian religion and often expresses the view that he is a Christian, his ideas of God are not acceptable to some Christians even though he has had a major influence on 19th- and 20th-century theology.

=== Religion ===
As a graduate of a Protestant seminary, Hegel's theological concerns were reflected in many of his writings and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he task that touches the interest of philosophy most nearly at the present moment: to put God back at the peak of philosophy, absolutely prior to all else as the one and only ground of everything." (Hegel, "How the Ordinary Human Understanding Takes Philosophy as displayed in the works of Mr. Krug", ''Kritisches Journal der Philosophie'', I, no. 1, 1802, pages&amp;nbsp;91–115)&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel's thoughts on the person of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] stood out from the theologies of the Enlightenment. In his posthumously published ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]], Part 3'', Hegel is shown as being particularly interested with the demonstrations of God's existence and the ontological proof.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''[[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]]: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker.'' Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; He espouses that "God is not an abstraction but a concrete God&amp;nbsp;[...] God, considered in terms of his eternal Idea, has to generate the Son, has to distinguish himself from himself; he is the process of differentiating, namely, love and Spirit". This means that Jesus as the Son of God is posited by God over against himself as other. Hegel sees both a relational unity and a metaphysical unity between Jesus and God the Father. To Hegel, Jesus is both divine and human. Hegel further attests that God (as Jesus) not only died, but "[...]&amp;nbsp;rather, a reversal takes place: God, that is to say, maintains himself in the process, and the latter is only the death of death. God rises again to life, and thus things are reversed".

The philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has argued that there was great stress on the sharp criticisms of traditional Christianity appearing in Hegel's so-called early theological writings. Kaufmann admits that Hegel treated many distinctively Christian themes and "sometimes could not resist equating" his conception of spirit (Geist) "with God, instead of saying clearly: in God I do not believe; spirit suffices me".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1965, pp. 276–77&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann also points out that Hegel's references to God or to the divine—and also to spirit—drew on classical Greek as well as Christian connotations of the terms. Kaufmann goes on:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to his beloved Greeks, Hegel saw before him the example of Spinoza and, in his own time, the poetry of Goethe, Schiller, and Hölderlin, who also liked to speak of gods and the divine. So he, too, sometimes spoke of God and, more often, of the divine; and because he occasionally took pleasure in insisting that he was really closer to this or that Christian tradition than some of the theologians of his time, he has sometimes been understood to have been a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1965, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Hegel himself, his philosophy was consistent with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; This led Hegelian philosopher, jurist and politician {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Friedrich Göschel|de}} (1784–1861) to write a treatise demonstrating the consistency of Hegel's philosophy with the Christian doctrine of the immortality of the human soul. Göschel's book on this subject was titled ''Von den Beweisen für die Unsterblichkeit der menschlichen Seele im Lichte der spekulativen Philosophie: eine Ostergabe'' (Berlin: Verlag von Duncker und Humblot, 1835).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10043317_00005.html|title=MDZ-Reader  - Band  - Von den Beweisen für die Unsterblichkeit der menschlichen Seele im Lichte der spekulativen Philosophie / Göschel, Carl Friedrich|website=reader.digitale-sammlungen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the 1870s and 1880s, Rev. T. R. Vickroy and Susan E. Blow - who were both minor associates of the St. Louis Hegelians - independently of each other translated various chapters from Göschel's book into English, and had their translations published in ''The Journal of Speculative Philosophy''. ''The Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' (in print from 1867-1893) was the official journal of the St. Louis Philosophical Society. The St. Louis Philosophical Society - the organization which served as the hub of the St. Louis Hegelians - had been co-founded in January 1866 by 2 disciples of Hegel in America, William Torrey Harris (1835-1909) and [[Henry Conrad Brokmeyer]] (1826-1906). Rev. Thomas Rhys Vickroy (December 27, 1833 - April 19, 1904), a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, had been the first president (1866-1871) of Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. While President at Lebanon Valley College, Vickroy also held various professorships there. For example, one year he was Professor of Philosophy and the Greek Language and Literature, and another year he was Professor of Belles-Lettres and Philosophy. Susan Elizabeth Blow (June 7, 1843 - March 27, 1916) was an educator who in 1873 opened the first successful public kindergarten in the U. S. - in the Des Peres School, in the Carondelet neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker''. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel seemed to have an ambivalent relationship with [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[myth]] and [[Paganism]]. He formulates an early philosophical example of a [[disenchantment]] narrative, arguing that Judaism was responsible both for realizing the existence of ''Geist'' and, by extension, for separating nature from ideas of spiritual and magical forces and challenging [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 85-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hegel's manuscript "[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]" suggests that Hegel was concerned about the perceived decline in myth and enchantment in his age, and that he therefore called for a "new myth" to fill the cultural vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Hegel published four works during his lifetime:&lt;br&gt;
(1) ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (or ''The Phenomenology of Mind''), his account of the evolution of consciousness from sense-perception to absolute knowledge, published in 1807.

(2) ''[[Science of Logic]]'', the logical and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] core of his philosophy, in three volumes (1812, 1813 and 1816, respectively), with a revised first volume published in 1831.

(3) ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', a summary of his entire philosophical system, which was originally published in 1816 and revised in 1827 and 1830.

(4) ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', his political philosophy, published in 1820.

During the last ten years of his life, Hegel did not publish another book, but thoroughly revised the ''Encyclopedia'' (second edition, 1827; third, 1830).&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann (1980), ''Discovery of the Mind 1: Goethe, Kant and Hegel'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In his political philosophy, he criticized [[Karl Ludwig von Haller]]'s reactionary work, which claimed that laws were not necessary. He also published some articles early in his career and during his Berlin period. A number of other works on the [[philosophy of history]], [[Philosophy of religion|religion]], [[aesthetics]] and the [[history of philosophy]] were compiled from the lecture notes of his students and published posthumously.

{{see also|Hegelianism}}
There are views of Hegel's thought as a representation of the summit of early 19th-century Germany's movement of philosophical [[idealism]]. It would come to have a profound impact on many future philosophical schools, including schools that opposed Hegel's specific [[dialectical idealism]], such as [[existentialism]], the [[historical materialism]] of Marx, [[historism]] and [[British idealism|British Idealism]].

Hegel's influence was immense both within philosophy and in the other sciences. Throughout the 19th century many chairs of philosophy around Europe were held by Hegelians and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]—among many others—were all deeply influenced by, but also strongly opposed to many of the central themes of Hegel's philosophy. Scholars continue to find and point out Hegelian influences and approaches in a wide range of theoretical and/or learned works, such as [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s ''magnum opus'' on strategic thought, ''[[On War]]'' (1831).&lt;ref&gt;Cormier, Youri. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.2013.859166?tab=permissions#.U9etAfldXGA "Hegel and Clausewitz: Convergence on Method, Divergence on Ethics"], ''International History Review'', Volume 36, Issue 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After less than a generation, Hegel's philosophy was suppressed and even banned by the [[Prussia]]n [[right-wing]] and was firmly rejected by the [[left-wing]] in multiple official writings.

After the period of [[Bruno Bauer]], Hegel's influence did not make itself felt again until the philosophy of British Idealism and the 20th-century Hegelian [[Western Marxism]] that began with [[György Lukács]]. The more recent movement of [[communitarianism]] has a strong Hegelian influence.

=== Reading Hegel ===
Some of Hegel's writing was intended for those with advanced knowledge of philosophy, although his ''Encyclopedia'' was intended as a textbook in a [[university]] [[course (education)|course]]. Nevertheless, Hegel assumes that his readers are well-versed in [[Western philosophy]]. Especially crucial are [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and Kant's immediate successors, most prominently [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. Those without this background would be well-advised to begin with one of the many general introductions to his thought. As is always the case, difficulties are magnified for those reading him in translation. In fact, Hegel himself argues in his ''Science of Logic'' that the German language was particularly conducive to philosophical thought.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G.W.F. ''Science of Logic''. trans. George di Giovanni. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2010. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Walter Kaufmann, the basic idea of Hegel's works, especially the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', is that a philosopher should not "confine him or herself to views that have been held but penetrate these to the human reality they reflect". In other words, it is not enough to consider propositions, or even the content of consciousness; "it is worthwhile to ask in every instance what kind of spirit would entertain such propositions, hold such views, and have such a consciousness. Every outlook in other words, is to be studied not merely as an academic possibility but as an existential reality".&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann (1966), ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', Anchor, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann has argued that as unlikely as it may sound, it is not the case that Hegel was unable to write clearly, but that Hegel felt that "he must and should not write in the way in which he was gifted".&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann, 1966, ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Left and right Hegelianism ===
Some historians have spoken of Hegel's influence as represented by two opposing camps. The [[Right Hegelians]], the allegedly direct disciples of Hegel at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]], advocated a [[Protestant]] orthodoxy and the [[political conservatism]] of the post-[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] Restoration period. The [[Young Hegelians|Left Hegelians]], also known as the Young Hegelians, interpreted Hegel in a [[revolutionary]] sense, leading to an advocation of [[atheism]] in religion and [[liberal democracy]] in politics.

In more recent studies, this paradigm has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Löwith]], ''From Hegel to Nietzsche: The Revolution in Nineteenth-Century Thought'', translated by David E. Green, New York: Columbia University Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; No Hegelians of the period ever referred to themselves as "Right Hegelians", which was a term of insult originated by [[David Strauss]], a self-styled Left Hegelian. Critiques of Hegel offered from the Left Hegelians radically diverted Hegel's thinking into new directions and eventually came to form a disproportionately large part of the literature on and about Hegel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Left Hegelians also influenced Marxism, which inspired global movements, encompassing the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] and myriad revolutionary practices up until the present moment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

20th-century interpretations of Hegel were mostly shaped by [[British idealism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]] and [[Fascism]]. According to [[Benedetto Croce]], the [[Italian Fascist]] [[Giovanni Gentile]] "holds the honor of having been the most rigorous neo-Hegelian in the entire history of Western philosophy and the dishonor of having been the official philosopher of Fascism in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedetto Croce]], ''Guide to Aesthetics'', Translated by Patrick Romanell, "Translator's Introduction", The Library of Liberal Arts, The Bobbs–Merrill Co., Inc., 1965&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the fall of the Soviet Union a new wave of Hegel scholarship arose in the West without the preconceptions of the prior schools of thought. {{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Jaeschke|de}} and [[Otto Pöggeler]] in Germany as well as Peter Hodgson and [[Howard Kainz]] in the United States are notable for their recent contributions to post-Soviet Union thinking about Hegel.

=== Triads ===
{{main|Thesis, antithesis, synthesis}}
In previous modern accounts of Hegelianism (to undergraduate classes, for example), especially those formed prior to the Hegel renaissance, Hegel's [[dialectic]] was most often characterized as a three-step process, "[[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]"; namely, that a "thesis" (e.g. the [[French Revolution]]) would cause the creation of its "antithesis" (e.g. the [[Reign of Terror]] that followed) and would eventually result in a "synthesis" (e.g. the [[constitutional state]] of free citizens). However, Hegel used this classification only once and he attributed the terminology to Kant. The terminology was largely developed earlier by Fichte. It was spread by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]] in accounts of Hegelian philosophy and since then the terms have been used as descriptive of this type of framework.

The "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" approach gives the sense that things or ideas are contradicted or opposed by things that come from outside them. To the contrary, the fundamental notion of Hegel's dialectic is that things or ideas have internal contradictions. From Hegel's point of view, analysis or comprehension of a thing or idea reveals that underneath its apparently simple identity or unity is an underlying inner contradiction. This contradiction leads to the dissolution of the thing or idea in the simple form in which it presented itself and to a higher-level, more complex thing or idea that more adequately incorporates the contradiction. The triadic form that appears in many places in Hegel (e.g. being–nothingness–becoming, immediate–mediate–concrete and abstract–negative–concrete) is about this movement from inner contradiction to higher-level integration or unification.

For Hegel, reason is but "speculative", not "dialectical".&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel and Language'', edited by Jere O'Neill Surber. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HFpQHr07IAkC&amp;pg=PA238 p. 238].&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the traditional description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis was mistaken, a few scholars like [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] have attempted to discard the triadic approach altogether. According to their argument, although Hegel refers to "the two elemental considerations: first, the idea of freedom as the absolute and final aim; secondly, the means for realising it, i.e. the subjective side of knowledge and will, with its life, movement, and activity" (thesis and antithesis), he does not use "synthesis", but instead speaks of the "Whole": "We then recognised the State as the moral Whole and the Reality of Freedom, and consequently as the objective unity of these two elements". Furthermore, in Hegel's language the "dialectical" aspect or "moment" of thought and reality, by which things or thoughts turn into their opposites or have their inner contradictions brought to the surface, what he called ''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'', is only preliminary to the "speculative" (and not "synthesizing") aspect or "moment", which grasps the unity of these opposites or contradiction.

It is widely admitted today that the old-fashioned description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis is inaccurate. Nevertheless, such is the persistence of this misnomer that the model and terminology survive in a number of scholarly works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gustav E. Mueller|editor=Jon Stewart|title=The Hegel Myths and Legends|url=|accessdate=|year=1996|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=0-8101-1301-5|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
In the last half of the 20th century, Hegel's philosophy underwent a major renaissance. This was due to (a) the rediscovery and re-evaluation of Hegel as a possible philosophical progenitor of Marxism by philosophically oriented Marxists; (b) a resurgence of the historical perspective that Hegel brought to everything; and (c) an increasing recognition of the importance of his [[dialectical method]]. [[György Lukács]]' ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) helped to reintroduce Hegel into the Marxist canon. This sparked a renewed interest in Hegel reflected in the work of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Gotthard Günther]] among others. In ''[[Reason and Revolution]]'' (1941), [[Herbert Marcuse]] made the case for Hegel as a revolutionary and criticized [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]'s thesis that Hegel was a totalitarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Robinson | title=The Freudian Left: Wilhelm Reich, Geza Roheim, Herbert Marcuse | year=1990 | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=0-87220-424-3| page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hegel renaissance also highlighted the significance of Hegel's early works, i.e. those written before ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. The direct and indirect influence of Kojève's lectures and writings (on ''The Phenomenology of Spirit'' in particular) mean that it is not possible to understand most French philosophers from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to [[Jacques Derrida]] without understanding Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;French philosopher [[Vincent Descombes]] introduced the term "post-Kojèvian discourse" to designate the period of French philosophy after the 1930s (Vincent Descombes, ''Modern French Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 1980, pp. 158–9).&lt;/ref&gt; American [[neoconservative]] [[political science|political theorist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s controversial book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) was heavily influenced by Kojève.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Howard | last=Williams |author2=David Sullivan |author3=Gwynn Matthews  | title=Francis Fukuyama and the End of History | year=1997 | publisher=University of Wales Press | isbn=0-7083-1428-7 | pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss theologian [[Hans Küng]] has also advanced contemporary scholarship in Hegel studies.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Beginning in the 1960s, Anglo-American Hegel scholarship has attempted to challenge the traditional interpretation of Hegel as offering a metaphysical system: this has also been the approach of [[Z. A. Pelczynski]] and [[Shlomo Avineri]]. This view, sometimes referred to as the "non-metaphysical option", has had a decided influence on many major English language studies of Hegel in the past forty years.

Late 20th-century literature in Western [[Theology]] that is friendly to Hegel includes works by such writers as [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), [[Dale M. Schlitt]] (1984), [[Theodore Geraets]] (1985), [[Philip M. Merklinger]] (1991), [[Stephen Rocker]] (1995) and [[Cyril O'Regan]] (1995).

Two prominent American philosophers, [[John McDowell]] and [[Robert Brandom]] (sometimes referred to as the "[[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] Hegelians"), have produced philosophical works exhibiting a marked Hegelian influence. Each is avowedly influenced by the late [[Wilfred Sellars]], also of Pittsburgh, who referred to his seminal work ''Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind'' (1956) as a series of "incipient ''Méditations Hegeliennes''" (in homage to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1931 work, ''[[Cartesian Meditations|Méditations cartésiennes]]'').

Beginning in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, a fresh reading of Hegel took place in the West. For these scholars, fairly well represented by the Hegel Society of America and in cooperation with German scholars such as Otto Pöggeler and Walter Jaeschke, Hegel's works should be read without preconceptions. Marx plays little-to-no role in these new readings. Some American philosophers associated with this movement include [[Lawrence Stepelevich]], [[Rudolf Siebert]], Richard Dien Winfield and [[Theodore Geraets]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Criticism ===
Criticism of Hegel has been widespread in the 19th and the 20th centuries. A diverse range of individuals including [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[A. J. Ayer]] have challenged Hegelian philosophy from a variety of perspectives. Among the first to take a critical view of Hegel's system was the 19th-century German group known as the [[Young Hegelians]], which included Feuerbach, Marx, Engels and their followers. In Britain, the Hegelian [[British idealism]] school (members of which included [[Francis Herbert Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] and in the United States [[Josiah Royce]]) was challenged and rejected by [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophers Moore and Russell. In particular, Russell considered "almost all" of Hegel's doctrines to be false.&lt;ref&gt;B. Russell, ''History of Western Philosophy'', chapter 22, paragraph 1, p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Hegel's interpretation of history, Russell commented: "Like other historical theories, it required, if it was to be made plausible, some distortion of facts and considerable ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 735.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] such as Ayer and the [[Vienna Circle]] criticized both Hegelian philosophy and its supporters, such as Bradley.

Hegel's contemporary Schopenhauer was particularly critical and wrote of Hegel's philosophy as "a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking".&lt;ref&gt;On the Basis of Morality.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of Hegel, whom Schopenhauer had also described as a "clumsy charlatan".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to "On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason. Page 1. [[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, only five students ended up attending Schopenhauer's lectures so he dropped out of [[academia]]. Kierkegaard criticized Hegel's "absolute knowledge" unity.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard Concluding Unscientific Postscriptt&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist and philosopher [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] also criticized the obscure complexity of Hegel's works, referring to Hegel's writing as an "unclear thoughtless flow of words".&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Boltzmann, ''Theoretical physics and philosophical problems: Selected writings'', p. 155, [[D. Reidel]], 1974, {{ISBN|90-277-0250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Robert Pippin notes that some view Hegel as having "the ugliest prose style in the history of the German language".&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Pippin, ''Hegel's Idealism: The Satisfaction of Self-Consciousness (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 5&lt;/ref&gt; Russell wrote in ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) that Hegel was "the hardest to understand of all the great philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1972|page=730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Popper]] wrote that "there is so much philosophical writing (especially in the Hegelian school) which may justly be criticized as meaningless verbiage".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (New York: Routledge, 1963), 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Popper also makes the claim in the second volume of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Hegel's system formed a thinly veiled justification for the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute rule]] of [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] and that Hegel's idea of the ultimate goal of history was to reach a [[sovereign state|state]] approximating that of 1830s [[Prussia]]. Popper further proposed that Hegel's philosophy served not only as an inspiration for [[communism|communist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] totalitarian governments of the 20th century, whose dialectics allow for any belief to be construed as rational simply if it could be said to exist. Kaufmann and [[Shlomo Avineri]] have criticized Popper's theories about Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Walter Kaufmann (1959), [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm ''The Hegel Myth and Its Method'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaiah Berlin]] listed Hegel as one of the six architects of modern [[authoritarianism]] who undermined [[liberal democracy]], along with Rousseau, [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], Fichte, [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah, ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty'' (Princeton University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Voegelin argued that Hegel should be understood not as a philosopher, but as a "sorcerer", i.e. as a [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] thinker.&lt;ref&gt;Voegelin, Eric (1972). "On Hegel—A Study in Sorcery", in  J. T. Fraser, F. Haber &amp; G. Muller (eds.), ''The Study of Time''. Springer-Verlag. 418--451 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of Hegel as a hermetic thinker was elaborated by Glenn Alexander Magee,&lt;ref&gt;Magee, Glenn Alexander (2001), ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that interpreting Hegel's body of work as an expression of mysticism and hermetic ideas leads to a more accurate understanding of Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;"I do not argue that merely that we ''can'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, just as we can understand him as a German or a Swabian or an idealist thinker. Instead, I argue that we ''must'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, if we are to truly understand him at all." Magee 2001, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Globalization''' [[-ise vs -ize|or]] '''[[wiktionary:globalisation#English|globalisation]]''' is the process  of [[foreign relations|interaction]] and integration between people, companies, and governments [[world]]wide. Globalization has grown due to advances in [[transportation]] and [[communication]] technology. With increased global interactions comes the growth of international [[trade]], [[idea]]s, and [[culture]]. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, [[wiktionary:conflict|conflicts]] and [[diplomacy]] are also large parts of the [[history of globalization]], and modern globalization.

Economically, globalization involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology, and data.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990). ''Globalization, Knowledge and Society'' London: Sage. {{ISBN|9780803983236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlbrowKing1990"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Martin |last1=Albrow|first2=Elizabeth |last2=King|title=Globalization, knowledge, and society: readings from International sociology|url={{google books|id=lfe1AAAAIAAJ|plainurl=yes}}|year=1990|publisher=Sage Publications|isbn=978-0-8039-8323-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[steam locomotive]], [[steamship]], [[jet engine]], and [[container ship]]s are some of the advances in the means of [[transport]] while the rise of the [[telegraph]] and its modern offspring, the [[Internet]] and [[mobile phone]]s show development in [[telecommunication]]s infrastructure. All of these improvements have been major factors in globalization and have generated further [[interdependence]] of [[Economy|economic]] and cultural activities around the globe.&lt;ref name="Imagining"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.elon.edu/e-web/predictions/150/1830.xhtml | title=Imagining the Internet | publisher=Elon University School of Communications | work=History of Information Technologies | accessdate=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stever_1972"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stever | first1 = H.

Though many scholars place the [[History of globalization|origins of globalization]] in [[modernity|modern times]], others trace its history long before the [[Europe]]an [[Age of Discovery]] and voyages to the [[New World]], some even to the third millennium BC.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GL-H-10"&gt;{{cite web |title=Globalization and Global History |page=127 |url=http://58.192.114.227/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20110522/20110522005012939.pdf |accessdate=3 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale globalization began in the 1820s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H.|first=O'Rourke, Kevin|last2=G.|first2=Williamson, Jeffrey|date=1 April 2002|title=When did globalisation begin?|url=https://academic.oup.com/ereh/article-abstract/6/1/23/540507|journal=European Review of Economic History|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023|issn=1361-4916|pages=23–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century and early 20th century, the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly.

In 2000, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) identified four basic aspects of globalization: [[trade]] and [[Financial transaction|transactions]], [[capital (economics)|capital]] and [[investment]] movements, [[Human migration|migration]] and movement of people, and the dissemination of knowledge.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"&gt;International Monetary Fund .

[http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2000/041200to.htm 12 April 2000: IMF Publications.]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, environmental challenges such as [[global warming]], cross-boundary [[water pollution|water,]] [[air pollution]], and [[overfishing|over-fishing]] of the ocean are linked with globalization.&lt;ref name="Bridges2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridges|first=G.|title=Grounding Globalization: The Prospects and Perils of Linking Economic Processes of Globalization to Environmental Outcomes|journal=Economic Geography|year=2002|volume=78|pages=361–86|doi=10.2307/4140814|issue=3|ref=harv|jstor=4140814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalizing processes affect and are affected by [[business]] and [[Employment|work]] organization, economics, socio-cultural resources, and the [[natural environment]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''globalization'' derives from the word ''globalize'', which refers to the emergence of an international network of economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=globalization|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest known usages of the term as a noun was in a 1930 publication entitled ''Towards New Education'', where it denoted a holistic view of human experience in education.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50297775?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Globalization&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|date=September 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'globalization' had been used in its economic sense at least as early as 1981, and in other senses since at least as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/06levitt.html | title=Theodore Levitt, 81, Who Coined the Term 'Globalization', Is Dead | date=6 July 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Feder, Barnaby J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Levitt is credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later half of the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and [[empire]] across [[Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] from the 15th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G. (ed.). (2004). ''Globalization in World History.'' London: Norton, pp. 4–8. {{ISBN|978-0393979428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the complexity of the concept, various research projects, articles, and discussions often stay focused on a single aspect of globalization.&lt;ref name="GCSP"&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of the Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Martin Albrow]] and Elizabeth King define globalization as "all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society."&lt;ref name="Albrow" /&gt; In ''The Consequences of Modernity'', [[Anthony Giddens]] writes: "Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide [[social relation]]s which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony. (1991). ''The Consequences of Modernity'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p. 64. {{ISBN|9780745609232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Roland Robertson]], professor of sociology at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and an early writer in the field, described globalization as "the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization : social theory and global culture|last=Robertson|first=Roland|publisher=Sage|year=1992|isbn=0803981872|edition= Reprint.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Global Transformations'', [[David Held]] and his co-writers state:
{{quote|text=Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening, deepening and speeding up of global interconnection, such a definition begs further elaboration. ... Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional. At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions. Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents. Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term. ... A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements: extensity (stretching), intensity, velocity and impact.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David; Goldblatt, David; McGrew, Anthony; Perraton, Jonathan (1999). ''Global Transformations'' Cambridge: Polity Press. {{ISBN|9780745614984}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=|}}

Held and his co-writers' definition of globalization in that same book as "transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity and impact—generating transcontinental or inter-regional flows" was called "probably the most widely-cited definition" in the 2014 [[Pankaj Ghemawat|DHL Global Connectiveness Index]].&lt;ref name="DHL"/&gt;

Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson, in his book ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'', states that globalization:
{{quote|is the process of world shrinkage, of distances getting shorter, things moving closer. It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Thomas. (2001). ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'' Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1930865150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Globalization is the extension of social relations across world-space, defining that world-space in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing world-time.&lt;ref name=James2005&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2005 | last=James |first=Paul | title=  ‘Arguing Globalizations: Propositions Towards an Investigation of Global Formation’ | url= https://www.academia.edu/5246805/Arguing_Globalizations_Propositions_Towards_an_Investigation_of_Global_Formation | journal= Globalizations | volume= 2 | issue=  2 | pages=193–209 | doi=10.1080/14747730500202206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Manfred Steger]], professor of [[global studies]] and research leader in the [[Global Cities Institute]] at [[RMIT University]], identifies four main empirical [[dimensions of globalization]]: economic, political, cultural, and [[Ecology|ecological]]. A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four. The ideological dimension, according to Steger, is filled with a range of [[Norm (social)|norms]], claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last=Steger|first=Manfred|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955226-9|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization "emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of '[[Community of practice|communities of practice]]' ([[Étienne Wenger|Wenger]], 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians."&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;{{Rp|424}} They note the term was used "in education to describe the global life of the mind"; in [[international relations]] to describe the extension of the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]]; and in journalism to describe how the "American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; They have also argued that four different forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.&lt;ref name=James2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=‘Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies’|url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies|journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|volume=12|issue=1–2|author1=Manfred B. Steger|author2=Paul James}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and [[Polity|polities]], including [[Imperialism|imperial]] agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of [[Commodity|commodities]] and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of [[refugee]]s and [[Immigration|migrants]] are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most [[Deregulation|deregulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|title=‘Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens’|url=https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens|journal=Citizenship Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=208–23|doi=10.1080/13621025.2014.886440|pmid=|access-date=|via=|last1=James|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] popularized the term [[The World Is Flat|"flat world"]], arguing that [[Global trade|globalized trade]], [[outsourcing]], [[supply chain|supply-chaining]], and political forces had permanently changed the world, for better and worse. He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L. "The Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention". ''Emerging: A Reader.'' Ed. Barclay Barrios. Boston: Bedford, St. Martins, 2008. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] defined "economic globalization" as the opening and deregulation of [[Commodity market|commodity]], [[Capital market|capital]], and [[Labour economics|labor markets]] that led toward present [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization. He used "political globalization" to refer to the emergence of a transnational [[élite]] and a phasing out of the [[nation-state]]. Meanwhile, he used "cultural globalization" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture. Other of his usages included "[[Ideology|ideological]] globalization", "[[Technology|technological]] globalization", and "social globalization".&lt;ref&gt;Fotopoulos, Takis. (2001).

"Globophobia" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the [[balloon phobia|fear of balloons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henwood|first1=Doug|title=Beyond Globophobia|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/beyond-globophobia|work=[[The Nation]]|date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Ross|title=Globophobia|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/12049/globophobia-17/|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=20 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor=George Ritzer|editorlink=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XKnmvRATtfAC|page=16}}|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of globalization}}
{{See also|Timeline of international trade}}

There are both [[Proximate and ultimate causation|distal and proximate causes]] which can be traced in the historical factors affecting globalization. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Rourke |first=Kevin H. |first2=Jeffrey G. |last2=Williamson |year=2002 |title=When Did Globalization Begin? |journal=European Review of Economic History |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=23–50 |doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic===
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The 13th century world-system, as described by [[Janet Abu-Lughod]]]]
{{Main|Archaic globalization}}

Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly the 1600s. This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt;

Also posited is a "multi-polar" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], 17th-century Japanese [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]]]]

The German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|B.C.E.]]  This archaic globalization existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture that reached from [[India]] to [[Spain]], including [[Alexandria]] and the other [[Alexander the Great|Alexandrine]] cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of [[import]]ing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade. Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09"&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. (1998). ''ReOrient: Global economy in the Asian age.''

Trade on the [[Silk Road]] was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, [[South Asian history|Indian subcontinent]], [[Persia]], Europe, and [[Arabia]], opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and [[religion]]s, [[syncretic]] philosophies, and various technologies, as well as [[disease]]s, also traveled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, [[Missionary|missionaries]], robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, [[language]]s, and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/legacy-silk-road | title = The Legacy of the Silk Road | publisher = Yale Global | date = 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
{{Main|Proto-globalization}}

"[[Early modern period|Early modern]]-" or "proto-globalization" covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800. The concept of "proto-globalization" was first introduced by [[historian]]s [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]]. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high "modern globalization" in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G., ed., 2003. Globalization in World History. New York City, NY: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-97942-3}} pp. 4–5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, K.N. (1965\1999). ''The English East India Company: The Study of an Early Joint-stock Company 1600–1640 (Vol. 4).'' London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of [[expansionism]], the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. European, [[Muslim]], Indian, [[Southeast Asia]]n, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.

===Modern===
According to economic historians Kevin H. O'Rourke, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, and Guillaume Daudin, several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815-1870:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/trade-and-empire/BE789F27408634F4749D61F013897C04|title=Trade and empire (Chapter 4) - The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|pages=100–101|language=en|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe.
* Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
* New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires.
* A gradual move towards greater liberalization in European countries.
During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] allowed [[standardization|standardized]] production of household items using [[economies of scale]] while rapid [[population growth]] created sustained [[demand]] for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and [[railroads]] made inland transportation cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; More nations embraced [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] such as in [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]]. The invention of [[shipping container]]s in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/how-the-invention-of-a-box-changed-our-world/2006/06/11/1149964409162.html%0A|title=How the invention of a box changed our world – Business – smh.com.au|last=Gittins|first=Ross|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], work by politicians led to the agreements of the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], in which major governments laid down the framework for [[International monetary systems|international monetary policy]], commerce, and finance, and the founding of several [[international institution]]s intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering [[trade barrier]]s. Initially, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | title = World Exports as Percentage of Gross World Product | publisher=[[Global Policy Forum]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712023541/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2008 | accessdate =11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 [[South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement]].

Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to [[middle class]]es in [[developed countries]]. [[Open skies]] policies and [[low-cost carrier]]s have helped to bring [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between different countries. More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location. This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

[[Student exchange program]]s became popular after [[World War II]], and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.&lt;ref name=varghese/&gt;

''Globalization: The Essentials.''  NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[revolutions of 1989]] and subsequent [[liberalization]] in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness. The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process. In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled. Most migration occurred between the [[Developing country|developing countries]] and [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name =Saggi2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saggi | first1 = Kamal | year = 2002 | title = Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and International Technology Transfer: A Survey | url = | journal = World Bank Research Observer | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 191–235 | doi = 10.1093/wbro/17.2.191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy.

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-[[border]] movement of goods, services, technology, and capital.&lt;ref name="Joshi, Rakesh Mohan 2009"&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-568909-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as [[tariff]]s, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing [[economic integration]] between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, T: "Year 12 Economics", p. 9. Tim Riley Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality. Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace. Economic globalization also includes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864808614|title=International business: competing in the global marketplace|last=Hill|first=Charles W.

A [[free-trade area]] is the region encompassing a [[trade bloc]] whose member countries have signed a [[Free trade|free-trade]] agreement (FTA). Such agreements involve cooperation between at least two countries to reduce trade barriers{{snd}} [[import quota]]s and [[tariff]]s{{snd}} and to increase trade of [[good (economics)|goods]] and services with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an [[open border]].
Arguably the most significant free-trade area in the world is the [[European Union]], a [[Political union|politico]]-[[economic union]] of [[Member state of the European Union|{{EUnum}} member states]] that are primarily located in [[Europe]]. The EU has developed [[European Single Market]] through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states.

[[Trade facilitation]] looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximise efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives.

Global trade in services is also significant. For example, in [[India]], [[business process outsourcing]] has been described as the "primary engine of the country's development over the next few decades, contributing broadly to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth, employment growth, and poverty alleviation".&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuruvilla |first=Sarosh |last2=Ranganathan |first2=Aruna |title=Economic Development Strategies And Macro- And Micro-Level Human Resource Policies: The Case Of India's "Outsourcing" Industry|journal=Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review|date=October 2008|volume=62|issue=1|pages=39–72|ref=harv |doi=10.1177/001979390806200103|url=http://ilr.sagepub.com/content/62/1/39.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15777592?story_id=E1_TVSSSVJN|accessdate=16 April 2011|title=Outsourcing to Africa: The world economy calls &amp;#124; The Economist|date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William I. Robinson]]'s theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallerstein's World Systems Theory.  He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.  Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|journal=International Sociology|volume=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.  This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six different countries, each contributing to a part of the production process.

{{Main|Cultural globalization}}

Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, [[popular culture]] media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B. Steger, eds, [https://uws.academia.edu/PaulJames Globalization and Culture: Vol. 4, Ideologies of Globalism], Sage Publications, London, 2010.  {{Cite book|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|last1=Inda|first1=Jonathan|last2=Rosaldo|first2=Renato|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|chapter=Introduction: A World in Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavour to communicate across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.

[[Cultural diffusion]] is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|styles]], [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]] etc.
Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities. For example, [[sushi]] is available in Germany as well as Japan, but [[Disneyland Paris|Euro-Disney]] outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for "authentic" French pastry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v25n3/globalization.pdf |title=Globalization and Culture |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |last2=Barber |first2=Benjamin |journal=Cato Policy Report |date=May–June 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India].

Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television.

Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, [[evangelism|evangelists]], imperialists, and traders. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and more recently sects such as [[Mormonism]] are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Elizabeth. 2005.

The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Thomas. 2004.

In: Comparative Education Review, vol. 48, no. 3, pp. 274–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization. Music genres such as [[jazz]] and [[reggae]] began locally and later became international phenomena. Globalization gave support to the [[world music]] phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. (2002.) "The music industry in the new millennium: Global and Local Perspectives."

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[UNESCO]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/cscl/IntlFlows_EN.pdf |title=International Flows of Selected Goods and Services |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.

Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia — Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization is a diverse phenomenon which relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries. The Indian experience particularly reveals the [[Cultural pluralism|plurality]] of the impact of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Biswajit (2011).

In general, globalization may ultimately reduce the importance of [[nation state]]s. [[Supranational]] institutions such as the [[European Union]], the [[WTO]], the [[G8]] or the [[International Criminal Court]] replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could ultimately lead to a [[global union]], based on the [[European Union]] model.&lt;ref name="mcclintock1"&gt;John McClintock (2010). "The Uniting of Nations: An Essay on Global Governance (3rd ed. revised and updated)". Publisher: P.I.E. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intergovernmentalism]] is a term in [[political science]] with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by [[Stanley Hoffmann]]; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Multi-level governance]] is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.  It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.

Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states. [[Multiple citizenship]], also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or  dual nationality, is a person's [[citizenship]] status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one [[Sovereign state|state]] under the laws of those states.

Increasingly, [[non-governmental organization]]s influence public policy across national boundaries, including [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian aid]] and [[International development|developmental efforts]].&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Accion International]], the Acumen Fund (now [[Acumen Fund|Acumen]]) and the [[Echoing Green]] have combined the [[business model]] with [[philanthropy]], giving rise to business organizations such as the [[Global Philanthropy Group]] and new associations of philanthropists such as the [[Global Philanthropy Forum]].  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery|title=Vaccine Delivery|work=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hudson Institute]] estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at [[US$]]59 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/2012IndexofGlobalPhilanthropyandRemittances.pdf ''The Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances 2012''.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced [[isolationism|isolationist]] policies. For example, the [[North Korea]]n government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.&lt;ref name=nkr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/2008-exodus.htm |title=North Korean Refugees NGO |publisher=Northkoreanrefugees.com |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhcr&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,PRK,4562d8cf2,487ca236c0,0.html |title=UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 – North Korea |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dimensions==
Scholars also occasionally discuss other, less common dimensions of globalization, such as [[environmental globalization]] (the internationally coordinated practices and regulations, often in the form of international treaties, regarding environmental protection)&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Karl S. |last=Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url={{google books|id=UdLK-UGj7YkC|page=1|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[military globalization]] (growth in global extent and scope of security relationships).&lt;ref name="Krishnan2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Armin |last=Krishnan|title=War as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting|url={{google books|id=1ymrCwAAQBAJ|page=PA157|plainurl=yes}}|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00049-5|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"/&gt;

===Movement of people===

As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the [[Atlantic ocean]] used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Boustan, Adain May . "Fertility and Immigration." UCLA. 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable.

[[Tourism]] is travel for pleasure. The developments in technology and transport infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref name="Barom2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]] |journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |date=January 2013 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228162347/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Travel visa|visa]] is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country. Some countries – such as those in the [[Schengen Area]] – have agreements with other countries allowing each other's citizens to travel between them without visas. The [[World Tourism Organization]] announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/travel/visa-requirements-for-tourism-eased-around-the-world-says-un-agency-365446391.html Visa requirements for tourism eased around the world, says UN agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |title=Visa Openness Report 2015 January 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123123959/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigration]] is the international movement of people into a destination [[country]] of which they are not natives or where they do not possess [[citizenship]] in order to settle or reside there, especially as [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] citizens, or to take-up [[employment]] as a [[migrant worker]] or temporarily as a [[foreign worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/immigration|title=immigration|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigration| title=immigrate|publisher=Merriam-Webster, In.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCUK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's who: Definitions|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research/the_truth_about_asylum/the_facts_about_asylum|first=|last=|publisher=Refugee Council|location=London, England|year=2016|access-date= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[International Labour Organization]], {{as of|2014|lc=y}} there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, [[freedom of movement for workers in the European Union]] means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.

Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in [[international education]].  More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many [[international student]]s now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.&lt;ref name="gribble"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gribble | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Policy options for managing international student migration: the sending country's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 25–39 | doi=10.1080/13600800701457830}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contributions that [[foreign student]]s make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to [[immigration]] and visa policies and procedures.&lt;ref name="varghese"&gt;Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[transnational marriage]] is a [[marriage]] between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to [[citizenship]] and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.
In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

===Movement of information===

{{Internet users by region}}
Before electronic communications, long-distance communications relied on [[mail]]. Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The [[electric telegraph]] was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.

The [[Internet]] has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries. For example, [[Facebook]] is a [[social networking service]] which has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|1.65 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2016|3|31|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Facebook-Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Info – Facebook Newsroom|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact,  "makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions, practices, problems, life conditions etc. in different parts of the world are interrelated. possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Berglez |date=2008 |title=WHAT IS GLOBAL JOURNALISM? |journal=Journalism Studies |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=845–858 &lt;!--was originally "5" but that's confusing--&gt; |doi=10.1080/14616700802337727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{See also|List of globalization-related indices}}

One index of globalization is the ''KOF Index of Globalization'', which measures three important dimensions of globalization:  economic, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/ | title=KOF Index of Globalization | publisher=The KOF Swiss Economic Institute | work=ethz.ch | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[A.T.

Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as [[trade]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[portfolio investment]], and [[income]].  However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vujakovic | first1 = Petra | year = 2010 | title = How to Measure Globalization?

==Support and criticism==
{{See also|Criticisms of globalization}}
Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade. [[philosophy|Philosophical]] differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[social movements]].  Proponents of [[economic growth]], [[economic expansion|expansion]] and [[economic development|development]], in general, view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the well-being of human [[society]].&lt;ref name=Sen1970&gt;Sen, Amartya K. (1970).  ''Collective choice and social welfare.'' San Francisco, CA: Holden-Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social well-being on a global or local scale;&lt;ref name=Sen1970 /&gt; this includes those who social or [[natural environment|natural]] [[sustainability]] of long-term and continuous economic expansion, the social [[structural inequality]] caused by these processes, and the [[Colonialism|colonial]], [[Imperialism|imperialistic]], or [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[ethnocentrism]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[cultural appropriation]] that underlie such processes.

Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. [[Xenophobia]] is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia|title=Definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia|title=Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]], including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs. They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the [[Gini coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238991~menuPK:492138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis – Measuring Inequality|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Happy Planet Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happyplanetindex.org/ |title=The Happy Planet Index |publisher=Neweconomics.org |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to a "multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"&lt;ref name="The Hidden Connections"&gt;{{cite book | last = Capra | first = Fritjof | year = 2002 | title = The Hidden Connections | publisher=Random House | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-385-49471-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they claim are the [[unintended consequences]] of globalization. Others point out that, while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of western-style democracy, this has been accompanied by an increase in inter-ethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorrells, Kathryn. Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion on globalization===

A 2005 study by Peer Fiss and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"&gt;Fiss, Peer and Hirsch, Pal: "The Discourse of Globalization: Framing and Sensemaking of an Emerging Concept. American Sociological Review, February 2005. vol. 70 no 1: 29–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999. This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;

A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably.&lt;ref&gt;"Africans and Asians Tend to View Globalization Favorably. Europeans and Americans are More Skeptical". World Public Opinion.org. 7 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC found that 50% of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly, while 35% believed it was proceeding too slowly.&lt;ref name=bbc08&gt;{{cite web| title = Widespread Unease about Economy and Globalization – Global poll| author = BBC World Service| date = 2008| accessdate = 24 March 2015| url = http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173226/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| archivedate = 3 September 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that "a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects." The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Philip. 2004. [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace "Globalization: Europe's Wary Embrace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191739/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace|date=29 June 2011}}. Yale Global, 1 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Danish poll in 2007, 76% responded that globalization is a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684528,00.html Why Denmark Loves Globalisation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiss, ''et al.'', surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007]]. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.&lt;ref name="ip08"&gt;Greg Ip: "The Declining Value Of Your College Degree", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, {{as of|1998|lc=y}} there was a perception in Japan that the economy was "Small and Frail". However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as ''[[internationalization]]'' and ''globalization'' to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi. 1998. "Japan," ''Domestic Adjustments to Globalization''; (ed, Charles E. Morrison and Hadi Soesastro), Tokyo: Japan center for International Exchange, 1998, pp. 76–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"/&gt; Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism. Opponents consider governments as agents of [[neo-colonialism]] that are subservient to [[multinational corporations]].&lt;ref name="visuality.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shoa |first=S.

In the book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.&lt;ref name="The End of Poverty"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sachs | first = Jeffrey | year = 2005 | title = The End of Poverty | publisher=The Penguin Press | location = New York, New York | isbn = 1-59420-045-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhagwati | first = Jagdish | title = In Defense of Globalization | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | location = Oxford, New York | url =| isbn =978-0195330939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.

In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url= http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name="Wolf2004"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0300102529|accessdate= 6 April 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120230/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|archivedate= 10 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.&lt;ref name="DDollar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dollar, David|author2=Kraay, Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic [[interdependence]] promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=Globalisation promotes peace
|first1=Ju Hyun |last1=Pyun |first2=Jong-Wha |last2=Lee |date=21 March 2009 |url=http://www.voxeu.org/article/globalisation-promotes-peace}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea had been very powerful during the globalization of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was a central doctrine of [[classical liberals]] of that era, such as the young [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883–1946).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Roy Harrod]], ''[[The Life of John Maynard Keynes]]'', Macmillan, 1951; [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006. Keynes had colourfully described the globalization before World War I in ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'', Macmillan, 1919, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some opponents of globalization see the phenomenon as a promotion of corporate interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Laurence|last=Lee|title=WTO blamed for India grain suicides|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2ED53A8B-1058-49CF-B9FF-3D96639456D1.htm|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=17 May 2007|accessdate=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that the increasing autonomy and strength of [[corporate entity|corporate entities]] shapes the political policy of countries.&lt;ref name="The Corporation"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bakan | first = Joel | authorlink =Joel Bakan | year = 2004 | title = The Corporation | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-7432-4744-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perkins | first = John | authorlink = John Perkins (author)| year = 2004 | title = Confessions of an Economic Hit Man | publisher=Berrett-Koehler | location = San Francisco, California | isbn = 1-57675-301-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They advocate global institutions and policies that they believe better address the moral claims of poor and working classes as well as environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/index.php?cd_language=2&amp;id_menu= |title=Fórum Social Mundial |publisher=Forumsocialmundial.org.br |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic arguments by [[fair trade]] theorists claim that unrestricted free trade benefits those with more [[Leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] (i.e. the rich) at the expense of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_viewpoints_nafta_legacy_at10/|title=NAFTA at 10|work=Economic Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization allows corporations to [[outsource]] manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits.&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"/&gt; Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually [[agricultural production]]s. Larger countries often subsidize their [[Agricultural subsidy|farmers]] (e.g., the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.&lt;ref name="Hurst E.

===Global democracy===
{{Main|Democratic globalization}}

'''Democratic globalization''' is a movement towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]] that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO), political cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker [[David Held]]. Advocates of [[democratic globalization]] argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building [[International political economy|global political institutions]]. Dr. [[Francesco Stipo]], Director of the United States Association of the [[Club of Rome]], advocates unifying nations under a [[world government]], suggesting that it "should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |title=USACOR.org |publisher=USACOR.org |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Douglas|title=The Case for a United Nations  Parliamentary Assembly|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|publisher=The World Federalist Movement–Institute for Global Policy|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531054746/http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global civics===
{{Main|Global civics|Multiculturalism}}
{{See also|Global citizenship}}

Global civics suggests that [[civics]] can be understood, in a global sense, as a [[social contract]] between [[Global citizenship|global citizens]] in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World citizen]] has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional [[geopolitical]] divisions derived from national [[citizenship]]. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in [[Socrates]], whom [[Plutarch]] quoted as saying: "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitizens.org.au|title=World Citizens Association Australia|work=World Citizens Association Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary?

Baha'i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Language and Universalization: a ‘Linguistic Ecology’ Reading of Bahá’í Writ | first = Gregory Paul | last = Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes) | title = The Journal of Bahá’í Studies | publisher = Association for Bahá’í Studies | series = | volume =Volume IX (1) | year =1999 | location = Ottawa | pages = 51–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of "[[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalization]]" as an alternative.

[[Cosmopolitanism]] is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single [[community]] based on a shared [[morality]]. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmopolitan|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, "Cosmopolitan Patriots," Critical Inquiry 23, no. 3 (Spring, 1997): 617–639.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian philosopher [[Marshall McLuhan]] popularized the term ''[[Global village (term)|Global Village]]'' beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan and Bruce R. Powers (17 September 1992) The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st century .

===International cooperation===
'''Military cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see [[START I]], [[START II]], [[START III]], and [[New START]]) and the establishment of [[NATO]]'s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the [[G8]] Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government |title=International cooperation as a stepping-stone to a world government &amp;#124; Global Policy Journal – Practitioner, Academic, Global Governance, International Law, Economics, Security, Institutions, Comment &amp; Opinion, Media, Events, Journal |publisher=Global Policy Journal |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the [[Montreal Protocol]], in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"/&gt;

In ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'', [[Christopher Lasch]] analyzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |title=The treachery of the lites Elite sense of irresponsibility |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.
Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalisation of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as "world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of  national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have "withdrawn from common life".
Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. 
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D. A., Soule, S. A., &amp; Kriesi, H. (2004). The Blackwell companion to social movements. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the [[Battle of Seattle (1999)|Battle of Seattle]] in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8).&lt;ref name="stwr.org"/&gt; Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===
{{Main|Anti-capitalist movements}}
[[File:Worldbank protest jakarta.jpg|thumb|World Bank Protester, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises.  Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of  Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425–51|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues  are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South").{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===

[[Corporatism|Corporatist]] ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations ([[Legal personality|artificial or juridical persons]]) over those of [[natural person]]s, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | title=Corporatism Goes Global | author=Ottaway, Marina | journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations | volume=7 | issue=3 | date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books ([[Naomi Klein]]'s 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'', for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' &amp; ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]'') popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, [[consumerism]], which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lived effects of the Contemporary Economy: Globalization, Inequality, and Consumer Society. | author=Storper Michael | journal=Public Culture | year=2000 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=375–409 | doi=10.1215/08992363-12-2-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of [[consumer education]] into school [[curriculum|curricula]]. Social activists hold materialism is connected to [[Big-box store|global retail merchandizing]] and [[supplier convergence]], [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent.

The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a "[[movement of movements]]"—who advocate [[fair trade]] rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, "A Movement of Movements", New York: Verso, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005.

Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) include: [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], [[Red Cross]], [[Free The Children]] and [[CARE International]]. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

====Social inequality====
{{Main|Social inequality|International inequality}}

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally.  Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak [[trade union|labor unions]]: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.&lt;ref name="Hurst E. Charles P.41"/&gt; They also cite an increase in the exploitation of [[child labour|child labor]]: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them. Examples include [[quarry]]ing, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography.&lt;ref name="Edmonds_Pavcni"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pavcnik | first = Nina |date=September 2005 | title = Child Labor in the Global Economy | journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–220 | doi = 10.1257/0895330053147895 | last2 = Pavcnik | first2 = Nina | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often participate in the workforce in [[precarious work]], including [[export-oriented employment]].  Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seguino|first1=Stephanie|last2=Grown|first2=Caren|date=November 2006|title=Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1081–104|doi=10.1002/jid.1295|ref=harv|author-link1=Stephanie Seguino|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.4614}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version – via the World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, and more remain overlooked when assessing the impact of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes|first=Benería|others=Berik, Günseli,, Floro, Maria|isbn=9780415537483|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that [[neoliberalism]], the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been "oversold", with the benefits of neoliberal policies being "fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries" and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, "hurt the level and sustainability of growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=June 3, 2016 |title=Globalization's True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts|url=http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/|work=TIME|location= |access-date=July 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-global governance===
{{Main|Global governance}}

Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the [[World Federalist Movement]] (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. (2006.) ''The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations.'' New York: Harper Collins. {{ISBN|978-0375501654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the [[League of Nations]] and, later, the [[United Nations]].

===Environmentalist opposition===
[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation]] of the [[Madagascar]] Highland Plateau has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]
{{Main|Environmentalism}}
{{See also|Global warming|Climate change|Deforestation}}

[[Environmentalism]] is a broad philosophy, ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ideology.html |title=Ideology and Sustainability |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald Bailey from the February 2002 issue |url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/02/01/debunking-green-myths |title=Debunking Green Myths |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gibson. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and social movement regarding concerns for environmental [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as [[global warming]], [[climate change]], global [[water supply]] and [[Water crisis|water crises]], inequity in [[energy consumption]] and [[energy conservation]], transnational [[air pollution]] and pollution of the [[world ocean]], [[overpopulation]], world [[habitat]] [[sustainability]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity]] and [[species extinction]].

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Nicholas. (2002). ''Global Ethics and Environment''. Routledge Science. {{ISBN|978-0415197359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of" environmental [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J., and John Boli. 2012. ''The Globalization Reader'', 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0470655634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], the director and founder of Local Futures/[[International Society for Ecology and Culture]], criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that "centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization." She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0871566435|edition= Sierra Club Books paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

== Food security ==
{{Main|Food security}}
The globalization of food production is associated with a more efficient system of food production. This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions. This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|title=Food Security and International Trade Unpacking disputed narratives|last=Clapp|first=J|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway's limited crop range advocates globalization of food production and availability. The northern-most country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met. The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Flaten and Hisano, 2007. Food Security Policy in a Food Importing Country: The Case of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name "Irān", meaning "land of the [[Aryan]]s", is the [[New Persian]] continuation of the old genitive plural ''aryānām'' (proto-Iranian, meaning "of the Aryans"), first attested in the [[Avesta]] as ''airyānąm'' (the text of which is composed in [[Avestan language|Avestan]], an old [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] spoken in northeastern Greater Iran, or in what are now [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]).&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Iranica1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/zoroastrianism-i-historical-review | title=ZOROASTRIANISM i.

While up until the end of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian period]] in the 3rd century CE, the idea of "Irān" had an ethnic, linguistic, and religious value, it did not yet have a political import. The idea of an "Iranian" empire or kingdom in a political sense is a purely [[Sasanian]] one. It was the result of a convergence of interests between the new dynasty and the [[Zoroastrian]] clergy, as we can deduce from the available evidence. This convergence gave rise to the idea of an Ērān-šahr "Kingdom of the Iranians", which was "ēr" ([[Middle Persian]] equivalent of [[Old Persian]] "ariya" and Avestan "airya").&lt;ref name="Encyclopaedia Iranica2"/&gt;

==Definition==
[[Richard Nelson Frye]] defines Greater Iran as including "much of the Caucasus, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Central Asia, with cultural influences extending to China and western India." According to Frye, "Iran means all lands and peoples where Iranian languages were and are spoken, and where in the past, multi-faceted Iranian cultures existed."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Nelson Frye|Frye, Richard Nelson]], ''Greater Iran'', {{ISBN|1-56859-177-2}} p.''xi''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Foltz]] notes that while "A general assumption is often made that the various Iranian peoples of 'greater Iran'—a cultural area that stretched from Mesopotamia and the Caucasus into [[Khwarizm]], [[Transoxiana]], Bactria, and the [[Pamirs]] and included Persians, Medes, Parthians and Sogdians among others—were all 'Zoroastrians' in pre-Islamic times... This view, even though common among serious scholars, is almost certainly overstated." Foltz argues that "While the various Iranian peoples did indeed share a common [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] and pool of religious myths and [[Religious symbol|symbols]], in actuality a variety of deities were worshipped—particularly [[Mitra]], the god of covenants, and [[Anahita]], the goddess of the waters, but also many others—depending on the time, place, and particular group concerned".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], "Religions of the Silk Road: Premodern Patterns of globalization", Palgrave Macmillan, rev. 2nd edition, 2010. pg 27&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[J. P. Mallory]] and [[Douglas Q. Adams]] most of Western ''greater Iran'' spoke Southwestern Iranian languages in the Achaemenid era while the Eastern territory spoke Eastern Iranian languages related to Avestan.&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J. P.; Adams, D. Q. (1997), Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture, London and Chicago: Fitzroy-Dearborn, {{ISBN|1-884964-98-2}}. pg 307: "Dialetically, Old Persian is regarded as a southwestern Iranian language in contrast to the east Iranian Avestan which covered most of the rest of Greater Iran. However, it is important to note that during the Achaemeid era, the official language of the empire was [[Aramaic]], which was the mother tongue of the ancient [Iraqis], since it was the language of literature, religion, and science at that time. [Aramaic] language had a great impact on Persian and survived as the dominant language in the middle east until the [Islamic conquest].&lt;/ref&gt;

George Lane also states that after the dissolution of the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Ilkhanids]] became rulers of greater Iran&lt;ref&gt;George Lane, "Daily life in the Mongol empire", Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006. pg 10" The year following 1260 saw the empire irrevocably split but also signaled the emergence of the two greatest achievements of the house of Chinggis, namely the Yuan dynasty of greater China and the Il-Khanid dynasty of greater Iran.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Uljaytu]], according to Judith G. Kolbas, was the ruler of this expanse between 1304–1317 A.D.&lt;ref&gt;Judith G. Kolbas, "The Mongols in Iran", Excerpt from 399: "Uljaytu, Ruler of Greater Iran from 1304-1317 A.D."&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary sources, including Timurid historian Mir Khwand, define Iranshahr (Greater Iran) as extending from the Euphrates to the Oxus&lt;ref&gt;Mīr Khvānd, Muḥammad ibn Khāvandshāh, Tārīkh-i rawz̤at al-ṣafā.

Iranshahr stretches from the Euphrates to the Oxus, and it is the center of the prosperity of the World.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, and until recent times, ethnicity has never been a defining separating criterion  in these regions. In the words of Richard Nelson Frye:{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

{{quote|Many times I have emphasized that the present peoples of Central Asia, whether Iranian or Turkic speaking, have one culture, one religion, one set of social values and traditions with only language separating them. | Richard Nelson Frye}}

Only in modern times did western colonial intervention and ethnicity tend to become a dividing force between the provinces of Greater Iran. As [[Patrick Clawson]] states, "ethnic nationalism is largely a nineteenth century phenomenon, even if it is fashionable to retroactively extend it."&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Clawson]]. ''Eternal Iran''. Palgrave Macmillan. 2005 {{ISBN|1-4039-6276-6}} p.23&lt;/ref&gt; "Greater Iran" however has been more of a cultural super-state, rather than a political one to begin with.

In the work ''Nuzhat al-Qolub'' ({{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|نزهه القلوب|fa}}}}), the medieval geographer [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] wrote:

{{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|چند شهر است اندر ایران مرتفع تر از همه|fa}}}}&lt;br /&gt;
''Some cities in Iran are above the rest,''&lt;br /&gt;

The ''Cambridge History of Iran'' takes a geographical approach in referring to the "historical and cultural" entity of "Greater Iran" as "areas of Iran, parts of Afghanistan, and Chinese and Soviet Central Asia".&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Iran, Vol. III: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Periods'', [[Ehsan Yarshater]], Review author[s]: [[Richard N. Frye]], [[International Journal of Middle East Studies]], Vol. 21, No. 3. (Aug., 1989), pp.415. Link: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/163454]&lt;/ref&gt; A detailed list of these territories follows in this article.

==In Persian literature==
{{empty section|date=January 2016}}

==Background==
Greater Iran is called ''Iranzamin'' ({{lang|fa|{{nastaliq|ایرانزمین|fa}}}}) which means "The Land of Iran". ''Iranzamin'' was in the mythical times opposed to the ''Turanzamin'' the Land of [[Turan]], which was located in the upper part of Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dehkhoda Dictionary]], [[Dehkhoda]], see under entry "Turan"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pre-Islamic period, Iranians distinguished two main regions in the territory they ruled, one Iran and the other ''Aniran''. By Iran they meant all the regions inhabited by [[ancient Iranian peoples]], this region was more extensive in the past. This notion of ''Iran'' as a territory (opposed to ''Aniran'') can be seen as the core of early Greater Iran. Later many changes occurred in the boundaries and areas where Iranians lived but the languages and culture remained the dominant medium in many parts of the Greater Iran.

As an example, the Persian language (referred to, in Persian, as ''Farsi'') was the main literary language and the language of correspondence in Central Asia and Caucasus prior to the Russian occupation, Central Asia being the birthplace of modern Persian language. Furthermore, according to the British government, Persian language was also used in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]], prior to the British Occupation and Mandate in 1918-1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk/~siamakr/Kurdish/KURDICA/1999/FEB/Iraq-policy.html|title=The old www.cogsci.ed.ac.uk server|work=ed.ac.uk|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Imperial Russia]] continuously advancing south in the course of two wars against Persia, and the treaties of Turkmenchay and Gulistan in the western frontiers, plus the unexpected death of [[Abbas Mirza]] in 1823, and the murdering of Persia's Grand [[Vizier]] (Mirza AbolQasem Qa'im Maqām), many Central Asian khanates began losing hope for any support from Persia against the [[Tsar]]ist armies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nasser Takmil Homayoun|Homayoun, N. T.]], ''Kharazm: What do I know about Iran?''. 2004. {{ISBN|964-379-023-1}}, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian armies occupied the [[Aral Sea|Aral]] coast in 1849, [[Tashkent]] in 1864, [[Bukhara]] in 1867, [[Samarkand]] in 1868, and [[Khiva]] and [[Amudarya]] in 1873.

:''"Many Iranians consider their natural sphere of influence to extend beyond Iran's present borders. After all, Iran was once much larger. Portuguese forces seized islands and ports in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 19th century, the Russian Empire wrested from [[Tehran]]'s control what is today Armenia, [[Republic of Azerbaijan]], and part of Georgia. Iranian elementary school texts teach about the Iranian roots not only of cities like [[Baku]], but also cities further north like [[Derbent]] in southern Russia. The [[Shah]] lost much of his claim to western Afghanistan following the Anglo-Iranian war of 1856-1857. Only in 1970 did a [[UN]] sponsored consultation end Iranian claims to [[suzerainty]] over the [[Persian Gulf]] island nation of [[Bahrain]]. In centuries past, Iranian rule once stretched westward into modern Iraq and beyond. When the western world complains of Iranian interference beyond its borders, the Iranian government often convinced itself that it is merely exerting its influence in lands that were once its own. Simultaneously, Iran's losses at the hands of outside powers have contributed to a sense of grievance that continues to the present day."'' -[[Patrick Clawson]] of the [[Washington Institute for Near East Policy]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Clawson]].

:''"Iran today is just a rump of what it once was. At its height, Iranian rulers controlled Iraq, Afghanistan, Western Pakistan, much of Central Asia, and the Caucasus. Many Iranians today consider these areas part of a greater Iranian sphere of influence."'' -[[Patrick Clawson]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Clawson]]. ''Eternal Iran''. Palgrave. 2005. Coauthored with [[Michael Rubin (historian)|Michael Rubin]]. {{ISBN|1-4039-6276-6}} p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"Since the days of the [[Achaemenids]], the Iranians had the protection of geography. But high mountains and vast emptiness of the Iranian plateau were no longer enough to shield Iran from the Russian army or British navy. Both literally, and figuratively, Iran shrank. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Afghanistan were Iranian, but by the end of the century, all this territory had been lost as a result of European military action."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Clawson]].

==Provinces and regions==
In the 8th century, Iran was conquered by the [[Abbassids]] who ruled from [[Baghdad]], and the territory of Iran at that time was known to be composed of two portions: ''[[Persian Iraq]]'' (western portion) and ''Khorasan'' (eastern portion). The dividing region was mostly along with [[Gurgan]] and [[Damghan|Damaghan]] cities. Especially the [[Ghaznavids]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqs]] and [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]] divided their [[Empire]] to Iraqi and Khorasani regions. This point can be observed in many books such as ''"Tārīkhi Baïhaqī"'' of [[Abolfazl Beyhaqi|Abul Fazl Bayhqi]], ''Faza'ilul al-anam min rasa'ili hujjat al-Islam'' (a collection of letters of [[Al-Ghazali]]) and other books. Transoxiana and [[Chorasmia]] were mostly included in the Khorasanian region.

====Bahrain====
{{See also|Persians in Bahrain|Huwala|Ajam of Bahrain}}
The "Ajam" and "Huwala" are ethnic communities of Bahrain of Persian origin. The Persians of Bahrain are a significant and influential ethnic community whose ancestors arrived in Bahrain within the last 1,000 years as laborers, merchants and artisans. They have traditionally been merchants living in specific quarters of [[Manama]] and [[Muharraq]]. Bahrain's Persians who adhere to the [[Shia]] sect of Islam are [[Ajam]] and the Persians who adhere to the [[Sunni]] sect are called [[Huwala]], who migrated from [[Larestan]] in Iran to the [[Persian Gulf]] in the seventeenth and eighteenth century.

The immigration of Persians to Bahrain began when the Greek [[Seleucid]] kingdom which was ruling Bahrain at the time fell and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] successfully invaded Bahrain, but it is often believed that mass immigration started during the 1600s when [[Abbas I of Persia]] invaded Bahrain. After settling in Bahrain, some of the Persians were effectively Arabized. They usually settled in areas inhabited by the indigenous [[Baharna]], probably because they share the same Shia Muslim faith, however, some Sunni Persians settled in areas mostly inhabited by Sunni Arab immigrants such as [[Hidd]] and [[Galali]]. In [[Muharraq]], they have their own neighborhood called Fareej Karimi named after a rich Persian man called Ali Abdulla Karimi.

From the 6th century BC to the 3rd century BC, Bahrain was a prominent part of the Persian Empire by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]], an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian dynasty]]. Bahrain was referred to by the Greeks as "[[Tylos]]", the centre of pearl trading, when [[Nearchus]] discovered it while serving under [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name="Larsen"&gt;''Life and Land Use on the Bahrain Islands: The Geoarcheology of an Ancient ...'' by Curtis E. Larsen p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; From the 3rd century BC to the arrival of Islam in the 7th century AD, Bahrain was controlled by two other Iranian dynasties, the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]] and the [[Sassanids]].

In the 3rd century AD, the Sassanids succeeded the Parthians and controlled the area for four centuries until the arrival of Islam.&lt;ref name="Federal Research Division page 7"/&gt; [[Ardashir I|Ardashir]], the first ruler of the Iranian Sassanid dynasty marched to Oman and Bahrain and defeated Sanatruq&lt;ref&gt;Robert G.

Shapur constructed a new city there and named it Batan Ardashir after his father.&lt;ref name="Mojtahed-Zadeh"/&gt; At this time, Bahrain incorporated the southern Sassanid province covering the Persian Gulf's southern shore plus the archipelago of Bahrain.&lt;ref name="Jamsheed"&gt;Conflict and Cooperation: Zoroastrian Subalterns and Muslim Elites in ... By Jamsheed K. Choksy, 1997, page 75&lt;/ref&gt; The southern province of the Sassanids was subdivided into three districts; Haggar (now al-Hafuf province, Saudi Arabia), Batan Ardashir (now [[al-Qatif]] province, Saudi Arabia), and [[Mishmahig]] (now Bahrain Island)&lt;ref name="Mojtahed-Zadeh"/&gt; (In  [[Middle-Persian]]/Pahlavi it means "ewe-fish").&lt;ref&gt;Yoma 77a and Rosh Hashbanah, 23a&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 130 BC, the Parthian dynasty brought the Persian Gulf under their control and extended their influence as far as Oman. Because they needed to control the Persian Gulf trade route, the Parthians established garrisons along the southern coast of the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref name="Federal Research Division page 7"&gt;''Bahrain'' by Federal Research Division, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of Iran was further undermined at the end of the 18th century when the ideological power struggle between the Akhbari-Usuli strands culminated in victory for the Usulis in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bahrain.wikia.com/wiki/Are_the_Shia_Rising%3F Are the Shia Rising?] Maximilian Terhalle, ''Middle East Policy'', Volume 14 Issue 2 Page 73, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An Afghan uprising led by Hotakis of Kandahar at the beginning of the 18th century resulted in the near collapse of the Safavid state.{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=7}} In the resultant power vacuum, [[1717 Omani invasion of Bahrain|Oman invaded Bahrain in 1717]], ending over one hundred years of Persian hegemony in Bahrain. The Omani invasion began a period of political instability and a quick succession of outside rulers took power with consequent destruction. According to a contemporary account by theologian, Sheikh Yusuf Al Bahrani, in an unsuccessful attempt by the Persians and their Bedouin allies to take back Bahrain from the [[Kharijite]] Omanis, much of the country was burnt to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft2c6004x0&amp;chunk.id=d0e7560&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e7560&amp;brand=ucpress&amp;query=Bahrain# Autobiography of Sheikh Yusuf Al Bahrani] published in ''Interpreting the Self, Autobiography in the Arabic Literary Tradition'', Edited by Dwight F.

In 1730, the new Shah of [[Persia]], [[Nadir Shah]], sought to re-assert Persian sovereignty in Bahrain. He ordered Latif Khan, the admiral of the Persian navy in the Persian Gulf, to prepare an invasion fleet in [[Bushehr]].{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=7}} The Persians invaded in March or early April 1736 when the ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Jubayr, was away on [[hajj]].{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=7}} The invasion brought the island back under central rule and to challenge Oman in the Persian Gulf.

During most of the second half of the eighteenth century, Bahrain was ruled by [[Nasr Al-Madhkur]], the ruler of [[Bushehr]]. The Bani Utibah tribe from Zubarah exceeded in taking over Bahrain after a war broke out in 1782. Persian attempts to reconquer the island in 1783 and in 1785 failed; the 1783 expedition was a joint Persian-[[Qawasim]] invasion force that never left Bushehr. The 1785 invasion fleet, composed of forces from Bushehr, Rig and [[Shiraz]] was called off after the death of the ruler of Shiraz, [[Ali Murad Khan]]. Due to internal difficulties, the Persians could not attempt another invasion.{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=46}} In 1799, Bahrain came under threat from the [[expansionist]] policies of [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman|Sayyid Sultan]], the [[Sultan of Oman]], when he invaded the island under the pretext that Bahrain did not pay taxes owed.{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=47}} The Bani Utbah solicited the aid of Bushire to expel the Omanis on the condition that Bahrain would become a [[tributary state]] of Persia. In 1800, Sayyid Sultan invaded Bahrain again in retaliation and deployed a garrison at [[Arad Fort]], in [[Muharraq]] island and had appointed his twelve-year-old son Salim, as Governor of the island.{{sfn|Bashir|1979|p=47}} &lt;ref&gt;James Onley, The Politics of Protection in the Gulf: The Arab Rulers and the British Resident in the Nineteenth Century, Exeter University, 2004 p44&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Nasser Hussain says that many Iranians fled their native country in the early 20th century due to a law king [[Reza Shah]] issued which banned women from wearing the [[hijab]], or because they feared for their lives after fighting the English, or to find jobs. They were coming to Bahrain from Bushehr and the [[Fars province]] between 1920 and 1940. In the 1920s, local Persian merchants were prominently involved in the consolidation of Bahrain's first powerful lobby with connections to the municipality in effort to contest the municipal legislation of British control.&lt;ref name=pol&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuccaro|first=Nelida|title=Histories of City and State in the Persian Gulf: Manama Since 1800|page=114|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wKU6jvKGicUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9780521514354|date=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahrain's local Persian community have heavily influenced the country's local food dishes. One of the most notable local delicacies of the people in Bahrain is [[mahyawa]], consumed in Southern Iran as well, is a watery earth brick coloured sauce made from sardines and consumed with bread or other food. Bahrain's Persians are also famous in Bahrain for bread-making. Another local delicacy is "pishoo" made from rose water (golab) and agar agar. Other food items consumed are similar to [[Persian cuisine]].

Throughout history, Iran always had strong cultural ties with the region of nowadays [[Iraq]]. Mesopotamia is considered as the cradle of civilization and the place where the first empires in history were established. These empires, namely the [[Sumer]]ian, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Babylonia]]n, and [[Assyria]]n, dominated the ancient middle east for millennia, which explains the great influence of the Mesopotamia on the Iranian culture and history, and it is also the reason why the later Iranian and Greek dynasties chose Mesopotamia to be the political centre of their rule. For a period of around 500 years, what is now Iraq formed the core of Iran, with the Iranian [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] empire having their capital in what is modern-day Iraq for the same centuries long time span. ([[Ctesiphon]])

Because the Achaemenid Empire or "First Persian Empire" was the successor state to the empires of [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyria]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Babylonia]] based in Iraq, and because [[Elam]] is part of Iran, the ancient people of Iran were ruled by ancient Mesopotamians, which explains the close proximity between the people of south western Iran and the Iraqis even in modern days, in fact, the people of that part of Iran speak Mesopotamian Arabic and were put under the rule of modern Iran by the British. The ancient Persians adopted the Babylonian [[Cuneiform|cuneiform script]] and [[Old Persian cuneiform|modified it]] to write their [[Old Persian language|language]], along with adopting many other facets of ancient Iraqi culture, including the [[Aramaic language]] which became the official language of the Persian Empire.

The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], written in Babylonian cuneiform in the name of the Achaemenid king [[Cyrus the Great]], describes the Persian takeover of Babylon (the ancient name of Iraq). An excerpt reads:{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Testimony to the close relationship shared by Iraq and western Iran during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]] and later centuries, is the fact that the two regions came to share the same name. The western region of [[Iran]] (ancient Media) was called [[Persian Iraq|'Irāq-e 'Ajamī]] ("Persian Iraq"), while central-southern [[Iraq]] (Babylonia) was called 'Irāq al-'Arabī ("Arabic Iraq") or Bābil ("Babylon"). And the name Iraq comes from the ancient Mesopotamian city Uruk, which suggests an even older relationship.

For centuries the two neighbouring regions were known as "[[The Two Iraqs]]" ("al-'Iraqain"). The 12th century Persian poet [[Khaqani|Khāqāni]] wrote a famous poem ''Tohfat-ul Iraqein'' ("The Gift of the Two Iraqs"). The city of [[Arak, Iran|Arāk]] in western Iran still bears the region's old name, and Iranians still traditionally call the region between [[Tehran]], [[Isfahan]] and [[Ilam, Iran|Īlām]] "ʿErāq".

During medieval ages, Mesopotamian and Iranian peoples knew each other's languages because of trade, and because Arabic was the language of religion and science at that time. The [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] historian [[Ḥāfeẓ-e Abru]] (d. 1430) wrote of Iraq:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Morony|first=Michael G|authorlink=Michael G. Morony|title=IRAQ AND ITS RELATIONS WITH IRAN|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iraq-i-late-sasanid-early-islamic|work=IRAQ i. IN THE LATE SASANID AND EARLY ISLAMIC ERAS|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]|accessdate=11 February 2012|quote=Persian remained the language of most of the sedentary people as well as that of the chancery until the 15th century and thereafter, as attested by Ḥāfeẓ-e Abru (d. 1430) who said, “The majority of inhabitants of Iraq know Persian and Arabic, and from the time of domination of Turkic people the Turkish language has also found currency: as the city people and those engaged in trade and crafts are Persophone, the Bedouins are Arabophone, and the governing classes are Turkophone. But, all three peoples (qawms) know each other’s languages due to the mixture and amalgamation.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The majority of inhabitants of Iraq know [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and from the time of domination of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]] the [[Turkish language]] has also found currency. | Ḥāfeẓ-e Abru}}

[[Iraqi people|Iraqis]] share religious and certain cultural ties [[Demographics of Iran|Iranians]]. The majority of Iranians are Twelver [[Shia]] (an Islamic sect established in Iraq), although the majority of Iranians were [[Sunni]] Muslims and did not convert to Shia until the [[Safavids]] forced [[Shi'ism]] in Iran.

Iraqi culture has commonalities with the [[culture of Iran]]. The spring festival of [[Nowruz]] that is celebrated in Iran and some parts of Iraq roots back to the Akitu spring festival (Babylonian new year). The [[Iraqi cuisine|Mesopotamian cuisine]] has also similarities to the [[Iranian cuisine|Persian cuisine]] and has common dishes and cooking techniques. The [[Iraqi Arabic|Iraqi dialect]] has absorbed many words from the [[Persian language]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Csató|first1=Éva Ágnes|last2=Isaksson|first2=Bo|last3=Jahani|first3=Carina|title=Linguistic Convergence and Areal Diffusion: Case Studies from Iranian, Semitic and Turkic|year=2005|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0-415-30804-5|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still cities and provinces in Iraq where the Persian names of the city are still retained. e.g. [[Anbar Province|’Anbār]] and [[Baghdad]]. Other cities of Iraq with originally Persian names include ''Nokard'' (نوكرد) --&gt; [[Hdatta|Haditha]],  ''[[Suristan]]'' (سورستان) --&gt; [[Kufa]], ''Shahrban'' (شهربان) --&gt; [[Muqdadiyah]], ''Arvandrud'' (اروندرود) --&gt; [[Shatt al-Arab]], and ''Asheb'' (آشب) --&gt; [[Amadiya]],&lt;ref&gt;See: محمدی ملایری، محمد: فرهنگ ایران در دوران انتقال از عصر ساسانی به عصر اسلامی، جلد دوم: دل ایرانشهر، تهران، انتشارات توس 1375.: Mohammadi Malayeri, M.: Del-e Iranshahr, vol. II, Tehran 1375 Hs.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Peroz-Shapur'' --&gt; [[Anbar (town)]]

In the modern era, the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran briefly reasserted their hegemony over Iraq in the periods of [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1532–1555)|1501–1533]] and [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–1639)|1622–1638]], losing Iraq to the [[Ottoman Empire]] on both occasions (via the [[Peace of Amasya|Treaty of Amasya]] in 1555 and the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] in 1639). Ottoman hegemony over Iraq was reconfirmed in the [[Treaty of Kerden]] in 1746.

Following the fall of the Ba'athist regime in 2003 and the empowerment of Iraq's majority Shī'i community, relations with Iran have flourished in all fields. Iraq is today Iran’s largest trading partner in regard to non-oil goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq plans to send 200-member trade delegation to Iran|url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/economy-and-business/104757-iraq-plans-to-send-200-member-trade-delegation-to-iran|accessdate=8 February 2013|newspaper=[[Tehran Times]]|date=9 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311105340/http://tehrantimes.com/economy-and-business/104757-iraq-plans-to-send-200-member-trade-delegation-to-iran|archivedate=11 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|History of Dagestan|History of Kabardino-Balkaria|Russo-Persian Wars|Treaty of Gulistan|Treaty of Turkmenchay|Tat people (Caucasus)}}
Dagestan remains the bastion of [[Persian culture]] in the [[North Caucasus]] with fine examples of Iranian architecture like the Sassanid citadel in [[Derbent]], strong influence of [[Persian cuisine]], and common Persian names amongst the ethnic peoples of Dagestan. The ethnic Persian population of the North Caucasus, the [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tats]], remain, despite strong assimilation over the years, still visible in several North Caucasian cities. Even today, after decades of partition, some of these regions retain Iranian influences, as seen in their old beliefs, traditions and customs (e.g. [[Nowruz|Norouz]]).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'': "Caucasus Iran" article, p.84-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Caucasus====

According to [[Tadeusz Swietochowski]], the territories of [[Iran]] and the republic of [[Azerbaijan]] usually shared the same history from the time of ancient Media (ninth to seventh centuries b.c.) and the Persian Empire (sixth to fourth centuries b.c.).&lt;ref&gt;Historical Background Vol. 3, Colliers Encyclopedia CD-ROM, 02-28-1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Intimately and inseparably intertwined histories for millennia, Iran irrevocably lost the territory that is nowadays Azerbaijan in the course of the 19th century. With the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] of 1813 following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]] Iran had to cede eastern [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], its possessions in the [[North Caucasus]] and many of those in what is today the [[Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan Republic]], which included [[Baku Khanate]], [[Shirvan Khanate]], [[Karabakh Khanate]], [[Ganja Khanate]], [[Shaki Khanate]], [[Quba Khanate]], and parts of the [[Talysh Khanate]]. [[Derbent]] (Darband) [[Derbent khanate|Khanate]] of [[Dagestan]] was also lost to Russia. These Khanates comprise most of what is today the Republic of Azerbaijan and Dagestan in Southern Russia. By the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]] of 1828 following the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]], the result was even more disastrous, and resulted in Iran being forced to cede the [[Nakhichevan Khanate]] and the Mughan regions to Russia, as well as [[Erivan Khanate]], and the remainder of the Talysh Khanate. All these territories together, lost in 1813 and 1828 combined, constitute all of the modern-day Republic of Azerbaijan, [[Armenia]], and southern [[Dagestan]]. The area to the North of the river [[Aras River|Aras]], among which the territory of the contemporary republic of Azerbaijan were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia in the course of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Swietochowski Borderland"&gt;{{cite book |last=Swietochowski|first=Tadeusz |authorlink= Tadeusz Swietochowski |year=1995|title=Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition|pages= 69, 133 |edition=  |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FfRYRwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Russia+and+Iran+in+the+great+game:+travelogues+and+orientalism|isbn=978-0-231-07068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=L.

Many localities in this region bear Persian names or names derived from Iranian languages and Azerbaijan remains by far Iran's closest cultural, religious, ethnic and historical neighbor. [[Azerbaijanis]] are by far the second largest ethnicity in Iran, and comprise the largest community of ethnic Azerbaijanis in the world, vastly outnumbering the number in the Republic of Azerbaijan. Both nations are the only officially Shia majority in the world, with adherents of the religion comprising an absolute majority in both nations. The people of nowadays Iran and Azerbaijan were [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|converted to Shiism]] during exactly the same time in history. Furthermore, the name of "Azerbaijan" is derived through the name of the Persian [[satrap]] which ruled the contemporary region of [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] and minor parts of the Republic of Azerbaijan in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Houtsma|first=M.

Early in antiquity, [[Narseh of Persia]] is known to have had fortifications built here. In later times, some of Persia's literary and intellectual figures from the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] period have hailed from this region. Under intermittent Iranian suzerainty since antiquity, it was also separated from Iran in the mid-19th century, by virtue of the Gulistan Treaty and Turkmenchay Treaty.

[[Khwarazm]] is one of the regions of ''Iran-zameen'', and is the home of the ancient Iranians, [[Airyanem Vaejah]], according to the ancient book of the [[Avesta]]. Modern scholars believe Khwarazm to be what ancient Avestic texts refer to as "Ariyaneh Waeje" or Iran vij. ''Iranovich''  These sources claim that [[Kunya Urgench|Urgandj]], which was the capital of ancient Khwarazm for many years, was actually "Ourva": the eighth land of [[Ahura Mazda]] mentioned in the [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] text of Vendidad. Others such as [[University of Hawaii]] historian [[Elton L. Daniel]] believe Khwarazm to be the "most likely locale" corresponding to the original home of the Avestan people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Elton L. Daniel|Daniel, E.]], ''The History of Iran''. 2001. {{ISBN|0-313-30731-8}}, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; while Dehkhoda calls Khwarazm "the cradle of the [[Arya]]n tribe" (مهد قوم آریا). Today Khwarazm is split between several central Asian republics.

Superimposed on and overlapping with Chorasmia was Khorasan which roughly covered nearly the same geographical areas in Central Asia (starting from [[Semnan (city)|Semnan]] eastward through northern Afghanistan roughly until the foothills of [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]], ancient [[Mount Imeon]]). Current day provinces such as [[Sanjan (Khorasan)|Sanjan]] in [[Turkmenistan|Turkmenia]], [[Razavi Khorasan Province]], [[North Khorasan Province]], and [[Southern Khorasan Province]] in Iran are all remnants of the old Khorasan. Until the 13th century and the devastating Mongol invasion of the region, Khorasan was considered the cultural capital of Greater Iran.&lt;ref&gt;

====Tajikistan====
The national anthem in Tajikistan, "[[Surudi Milli]]", attests to the Perso-Tajik identity, which has seen a large revival, after the breakup of the [[USSR]]. [[Tajik language|Their language]] is almost identical to that spoken in Afghanistan and Iran, and their cities have Persian names, e.g. [[Dushanbe]], [[Isfara]], [[Rasht Valley]], [[Garm, Tajikistan|Garm]], [[Murghab River (Tajikistan)|Murghab]], [[Vahdat]], [[Zeravshan|Zar-afshan river]], [[Shurab, Tajikistan|Shurab]], and [[Kulob]] ([http://www.iranicaonline.org/newsite/articles/ot_grp8/ot_kulab_20050727.html]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}). It is also important{{to whom|date=December 2015}} to note that [[Rudaki]], considered by many as the father of modern Persian poetry, was from the modern day region of Tajikistan.

====Turkmenistan====
Home of the [[Parthian Empire]] ([[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nysa]]). Merv is also where the half-Persian caliph [[al-Mamun]] moved his capital to. The city of [[Ashgabat|Eshgh Abad]] (some claim that the word is actually the transformed form of "Ashk Abad" literally meaning "built by Ashk", the head of Arsacid dynasty) is yet another Persian word meaning "city of love", and like Iran, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan, it was once part of [[Airyanem Vaejah]].

====Uzbekistan====
Uzbekistan has a local Tajik population. The famous Persian cities of [[Afrasiab]], [[Bukhara]], Samarkand, [[Shahrisabz]], [[Andijan]], [[Khiva|Khiveh]], [[Navoiy|Navā'i]], [[Shirin]], [[Termez]], and Zar-afshan are located here. These cities are the birthplace of the Islamic era Persian literature. The [[Samanid]]s, who claimed inheritance to the Sassanids, had their capital built here.

===South Asia===

====Afghanistan====
Modern state of Afghanistan was part of [[Sistan]] and [[Greater Khorasan]] regions, and hence was recognized with the name Khorasan (along with regions centered on Merv and Nishapur), which in Pahlavi means "The Eastern Land" (خاور زمین in Persian).&lt;ref&gt;[[Dehkhoda]], ''[[Dehkhoda dictionary]]'', Tehran University Press, p.8457&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays region of Afghanistan is where [[Balkh]] is located, home of [[Rumi]], [[Rabi'a Balkhi]], [[Sanai|Sanāī Ghaznawi]], [[Jami]], [[Khwaja Abdullah Ansari]] and where many other notables in [[Persian literature]] came from.

====Pakistan====
There is considerable influence of Iranian-speaking peoples in Pakistan. The region of Baluchistan is split between Pakistan and Iran and Baluchi, the majority languages of the Baluchistan province of Pakistan are also spoken in Southeastern Iran. In fact, the Chagai Hills and the western part of Makran district were part of Iran till the [[Durand Line]] was drawn in the late 1800s.

[[Pashto language|Pashto]] which is spoken in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas|FATA]] of Pakistan and Afghanistan is an Iranian language.

'''''Historiae Ecclesiasticae Tripartitae Epitome''''', the abridged history (in twelve books) of the early [[Christian Church]] known as the '''''Tripartite History,'''''  was the standard manual of Church history in [[Medieval Europe]]. 

The work was compiled, under the direction of [[Cassiodorus]], in about 510 CE, by his assistant [[Epiphanius Scholasticus]]. Epiphanius was assigned the translation into Latin of the Greek church histories of [[Socrates Scholasticus]], [[Sozomen]] and [[Theodoret]], written in the previous century. He would probably have used the library assembled by Cassiodorus at Monasterium Vivariense, the monastery of Vivarium on his family estates at the foot of Mount Moscius on the shores of the Ionian Sea. Cassiodorus revised and corrected the work and arranged it into one continuous history of the church. His [[scriptorium]] then published it for the use of the clergy. 

The book attained a high reputation. Only [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]]' ''History'', in a Latin translation by [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] competed with it as the official version of church history in the West, until original sources began to be rediscovered, edited and printed by [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars in the 15th century.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Historical anthropology''' is a [[historiographical]] movement which applies methodologies and objectives from [[Social Anthropology|Social]] and [[Cultural Anthropology]] to the study of historical societies.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; Like most such movements, it is understood in different ways by different scholars, and to some may be synonymous with the [[history of mentalities]], [[cultural history]], [[ethnohistory]], [[microhistory]], [[People's history|history from below]] or ''[[Alltagsgeschichte]]''. Anthropologists whose work has been particularly inspirational to historical anthropology include [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Clifford Geertz]], [[Arnold van Gennep]], [[Jack Goody]], [[Lucien Lévy-Bruhl]], [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Victor Turner]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"&gt;Elizabeth A. Ten Dyke, 'Anthropology, Historical' in Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, ed. by Kelly Boyd (Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn, 1999), pp. 37--40 (p. 38).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] has contrasted historical anthropology with [[Social History]], finding that historical anthropology tends to focus on qualitative rather than quantitative data, smaller communities, and symbolic aspects of culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; Thus it reflects a turn away, in the 1960s, in [[Marxist historiography]] from 'the orthodox Marxist approach to human behaviour in which actors are seen as motivated in the first instance by economics, and only secondarily by culture or ideology', in the work of historians such as [[E. P. Thompson]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt;

Historical anthropology was rooted in the [[Annales School]], associated with a succession of major historians such as [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie]] and [[Pierre Nora]], along with researchers from elsewhere on the Continent such as [[Carlo Ginzburg]]. The label ''historical anthropology'' has been actively promoted by some recent Annales School historians, such as [[Jean-Claude Schmitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Claude Schmitt |url=https://cem.revues.org/8862 |title=Anthropologie historique |publisher=Cem.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://acrh.revues.org/1926 |title=L’anthropologie historique de l’Occident médiéval. Un parcours |publisher=Acrh.revues.org |date= |accessdate=2015-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1929 by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]], the review [[Annales. Histoire, Sciences sociales]] is still among the most influential French publications for research in historical anthropology.

Historical anthropology has been open to similar criticisms to anthropology: 'as [[Bernard Cohn (anthropologist)|Bernard Cohn]] and [[John Comaroff|John]] and [[Jean Comaroff]] have observed, studies in which societies were represented in this way were often partial, biased, and unwitting handmaidens to the domination of non-Western peoples by Europeans and Americans'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated37"/&gt; But since the Second World War, increasingly reflexive approaches have led to sophisticated developments of the field, and the banner of 'historical anthropology' has often attracted Anglo-American historians in ways that the Annales School did not: key figures have been [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Jay O'Brien (anthropologist)|Jay O'Brien]], [[William Roseberry]], [[Marshall Sahlins]], [[Jane Schneider]], [[Peter Schneider (historian)|Peter Schneider]], [[Eric Wolf]], [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]], and people from elsewhere in the world such as [[Aaron Gurevich]].

The '''Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology''' was one of 24 Subject Centres funded within the [[Higher Education Academy]] to promote high quality learning and teaching in [[UK]] [[Higher Education]] (HE) by providing subject-based support for sharing innovations and good practices. Initially the only one of the 24 Subject Centres to be sited in Scotland, it was hosted originally by the [[University of Glasgow]] and later by the [[University of Liverpool]]. Its various Directors were Dr Andrew Roach, Dr Donald Spaeth, Colin Brooks and Dr Anthony Sinclair.

The Higher Education Academy itself came into being in 2004 through the amalgamation of the Learning and Teaching Support Network (LTSN), the Institute for the Learning and Teaching in Higher Education (ILTHE) and the Higher Education Staff Development Agency (HESDA) in order to enable comprehensive, knowledgeable support for practitioners and institutions with an aim to the greater professionalisation of HE teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hefce.ac.uk/news/hefce/2003/tqec.htm HEFCE : News : 2003 : 27 January 2003&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology supported teaching and learning in [[history]], [[archaeology]], and [[classics]] as broadly defined (the study of the languages and cultures of the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] Worlds, including [[Byzantine Studies]] and Classical Reception Studies). 

The key role of HCA was to be a "one stop shop" for the subject communities for matters relating to learning and teaching both at an individual subject level and with regard to common issues across these three [[Humanities]] disciplines. HCA did this by identifying, collecting and disseminating information and material on good practice in teaching and learning, enabling practitioners to share their experience with colleagues for mutual benefit. HCA both funded &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/hca/funding/tdg Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology - funding TDG&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and published disciplinary specific pedagogical research (Ped Res) and development (Ped Dev) and [[scholarship of teaching and learning]] (SOTL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heacademy.ac.uk/hca/themes/practice/pedr Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology - practice &amp; CPD, pedagogic research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Subject Centre for History, Classics and Archaeology worked in conjunction with its various subject associations and other relevant national organisations to influence the development of policy and practice within History, Classics and Archaeology in UK higher education. It held several well-attended 3-day Teaching &amp; Learning in History conferences annually at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford.

{{Humanism}}

'''Humanistic historiography''' is a method in [[historiography]]. This method is based on the principles of [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Humanistic_historiography Articles for Humanistic historiography].&lt;/ref&gt; The new style of (humanistic) historiography was established by the Florentine History of Bruni (published from 1416 to 1449), and certain characteristics of the model still determined the treatment of political history in [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[Florentine Histories|Istorie Firoentine]]'', as well as his delimitation of political subject matter at large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fritzwagner.com/ev/humanistic_historiography.html Humanistic Historiography as War and Personalities].&lt;/ref&gt;

Let us briefly enumerate these characteristics. The humanists used Livy as their model. This choice had certain consequences insofar as the treatment of history had to concentrate on such exciting events as wars and revolutions to the exclusion of the permanent factors and the long-range developments that determine the texture of history.

Moreover, in the interest of rhetorical and dramatic effectiveness, the individual had to become the center of action to such a degree that again the permanent determinants that in fact leave not so much room for heroic freedom were obscured.

The Roman model had, furthermore, the effect of a radical secularization of political problems. The humanistic concentration on the history of the republic in the Roman manner entailed the break with the Christian view of history. The rigidly closed stream of secular state history did not admit a divine Providence governing a universal history. Such problems as the translatio imperii and the speculation of the four world monarchies disappeared without a word of discussion.

In the eighteenth century, when [[Voltaire]] started his secularization of history, the polemic against the Christian position of Bossuet was of absorbing interest. The humanists of the fifteenth century ignored the Christian problem as if it did not exist.

'''''Life of Sethos, Taken from Private Memoirs of the Ancient Egyptians''''' ({{lang-fr|Séthos, histoire, ou Vie tirée des monumens, anecdotes de l'ancienne Égypte, traduite d'un manuscrit grec}}) is an influential [[fantasy novel]] originally published in six volumes at Paris in 1731 by the French ''[[abbé]]'' [[Jean Terrasson]]. An English translation by [[Thomas Lediard]] published at London by J. Walthoe appeared in 1732.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Lediard, Thomas|volume=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to classicist [[Mary Lefkowitz]], Sethos:
{{quotation|''purports to be a translation of an ancient manuscript found in the library of an unnamed foreign nation that is "extremely jealous of this sort of treasure." The author is said to have been an anonymous Greek in the second century A.D. Here Terrasson is following the conventions of ancient writers of historical fictions, such as the author of the Hermetica, who pretend that their works are translations of ancient writings that no one but themselves has seen. But Terrasson is careful not to deceive his readers completely: he assures them that the work he has "translated" for them is a fiction; .... He assures them that although fictional, the story keeps close to ancient sources, which, for the reader's convenience, he cites throughout the text. But he also says that "it is natural to suppose" that his author had access to original sources (now lost), such as memoirs available in the sacred archives of Egypt, written by unknown priests who accompanied Sethos on his travels. The sophisticated reader would be amused by the notion that the anonymous author had consulted these otherwise unknown documents, but Terrasson gives no warning to less well-educated readers that there is in fact no reason to "suppose" that these documents ever existed.''&lt;ref&gt;Lefkowitz, Mary, ''Not Out of Africa: How Afrocentrist Became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History,'' New York, BasicBooks, 1996, pp. 111-12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This eighteenth century work of fiction is a primary source of [[Afrocentrism]] and of the kind of black history found in such popular books as [[Martin Bernal]]'s ''[[Black Athena|Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization]]''&lt;ref&gt;Mary R. Lefkowitz, Guy MacLean Rogers (eds.), ''Black Athena Revisited'', UNC Press Books, 1996, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George James (writer)|George James]]'s ''Stolen Legacy: Greek Philosophy Is Stolen Egyptian Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,984143,00.html?iid=digg_share BOOKS ATTACKING AFROCENTRISM], [[John Elson]], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Feb. 19, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a key source of a popular web of conspiracy theories positing a secret pagan subculture of [[Freemasons]], devotees of Satan, and environmentalists dedicated to the overthrow of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/3122/ Great Awful Books], Charles Paul Freund,  Oct. 17, 1996, Slate&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' (book II, chapter 141) writes of a [[High Priest of Ptah]] named Sethos ({{lang-grc-gre|Σεθῶν}} ''Sethon'') who became pharaoh and defeated the Assyrians with divine intervention. This name is probably a corruption of [[Shebitku]] (or Shabataka), the actual pharaoh at the time, who was a [[Kushite]] of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Strassler (ed.), ''The Landmark Herodotus: The Histories'' (Anchor, 2007), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan B. Lloyd, Commentary on Book II, in ''A Commentary on Herodotus, Books I–IV'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herodotus:
{{quotation|''After him there came to the throne the priest of [[Hephaistos]], whose name was Sethos. This man, they said, neglected and held in no regard the warrior class of the Egyptians, considering that he would have no need of them; and besides other slights which he put upon them, he also took from them the yokes of corn-land 125 which had been given to them as a special gift in the reigns of the former kings, twelve yokes to each man. After this, Sanacharib king of the Arabians and of the Assyrians marched a great host against Egypt. Then the warriors of the Egyptians refused to come to the rescue, and the priest, being driven into a strait, entered into the sanctuary of the temple 126 and bewailed to the image of the god the danger which was impending over him; and as he was thus lamenting, sleep came upon him, and it seemed to him in his vision that the god came and stood by him and encouraged him, saying that he should suffer no evil if he went forth to meet the army of the Arabians; for he himself would send him helpers. Trusting in these things seen in sleep, he took with him, they said, those of the Egyptians who were willing to follow him, and encamped in Pelusion, for by this way the invasion came: and not one of the warrior class followed him, but shop-keepers and artisans and men of the market. Then after they came, there swarmed by night upon their enemies mice of the fields, and ate up their quivers and their bows, and moreover the handles of their shields, so that on the next day they fled, and being without defence of arms great numbers fell. And at the present time this king stands in the temple of Hephaistos in stone, holding upon his hand a mouse, and by letters inscribed he says these words: "Let him who looks upon me learn to fear the gods".''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2707/2707-8.txt ''The Histories of Herodotus], II:141 (Euterpe) by Herodotus (1890)&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3747">This is a '''list of [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] inscription''', which include remaining official inscriptions on rocks, as well as minor ones written on bricks, metal, wood, hide, [[papyri]], and gems. Their significance is in the areas of [[Iranian languages|linguistics]], [[history of Iran|history]], and study of [[religion in Persia]]. Some of the inscriptions are lost and are known only through tradition.

Early royal Sasanian inscriptions were trilingual: [[Middle Persian language|Middle Persian]] (in [[Inscriptional Pahlavi]]), [[Parthian language|Parthian]] (in [[Inscriptional Parthian]]) and [[Koine Greek|Greek]]. Since the rule of [[Narseh]], Greek was omitted. [[Book Pahlavi]] script replaced Inscriptional Pahlavi in late Middle Persian inscriptions.

The categorization of the past into discrete, quantified named blocks of time is called [[periodization]].&lt;ref name="Rabinowtz"&gt;Adam Rabinowitz. ''[https://www.academia.edu/6647852/Temporal_Divides_A_Critical_Review_of_the_Major_Schemes_of_Periodization_in_Indian_History It’s about time: historical periodization and Linked Ancient World Data]''. Study of the Ancient World Papers, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a list of such '''named time periods''' as defined in various fields of study. Major categorization systems include '''[[Chronology of the universe|cosmological]]''' (time periods in the [[Big bang|origin]] and mass evolution of the universe), '''[[Geological time scale|geological]]''' (time periods in the [[history of Earth|origin and evolution]] of the Earth), '''[[Biological anthropology|anthropological]]''' (time periods in the origin and [[human evolution|evolution]] of humans) and '''[[History|historical]]''' (written history).

== Human Time Periods ==
{{main|History by period}}

These can be divided broadly into prehistorical (before history began to be recorded) and historical periods (when written records began to be kept).
{{further|List of archaeological periods}}

In [[archaeology]] and [[anthropology]], [[prehistory]] is subdivided around the [[three-age system]]. This list includes the use of the three-age system as well as a number of various designation used in reference to sub-ages within the traditional three.

The dates for each age can vary by region. On the [[geologic time scale]], the [[Holocene]] epoch starts at the end of the [[last glacial period|last glacial period of the current ice age]] (c.10,000 BC) and continues to the present. The beginning of Mesolithic is usually considered to correspond to the beginning of the [[Holocene]] epoch.

=== General Periods ===
{{Further|Universal history}}
* '''[[Prehistory|Pre-History]]''' –  Period between the appearance of ''[[Homo]]'' ("humans"; [[Oldowan|first stone tools]] &lt;abbr&gt;c.&lt;/abbr&gt; three million years ago) and the invention of writing systems (for the [[Ancient Near East]]: &lt;abbr&gt;c.&lt;/abbr&gt; five thousand years ago).
** '''[[Stone Age]]''' 
*** [[Paleolithic]] – is the earliest period of the Stone Age 
****[[Lower Paleolithic]] &amp;mdash; time of [[archaic human]] species, predates ''[[Homo sapiens]]''
****[[Middle Paleolithic]] &amp;mdash; coexistence of archaic and [[anatomically modern human]] species
****[[Upper Paleolithic]] &amp;mdash; [[Early human migrations|worldwide expansion]] of anatomically modern humans, disappearance of archaic humans by extinction or [[Archaic human admixture with modern humans|admixture]] with modern humans; earliest [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|evidence for pictorial art]].
*** [[Mesolithic]] ([[Epipaleolithic]]) – was a period in the development of human technology between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic periods.
*** [[Neolithic]] – a period of primitive [[technological]] and [[social]] development, beginning about 10,200 BC in parts of the Middle East, and later in other parts of the world.
*** [[Chalcolithic]] (or "Eneolithic", "Copper Age") – this period was still largely Neolithic in character, where early [[copper]] metallurgy appeared alongside the use of stone tools.
** '''[[Bronze Age]]''' – is not part of prehistory for all regions and civilizations who had adopted or developed a writing system.
** '''[[Iron Age]]''' – is not part of prehistory for all civilizations who had introduced written records during the Bronze Age. 
*'''[[Protohistory]]''' – Period between prehistory and history, during which a culture or civilization has not yet developed writing but other cultures have already noted its existence in their own writings; the absolute time scale of "protohistory" varies widely depending on the region, from the late 4th millennium BCE in the Ancient Near East to the present in the case of [[uncontacted peoples]].
* '''[[Ancient history|Ancient History]]''' – Aggregate of past events from the beginning of recorded human history and extending as far as the Early Middle Ages or the Postclassical Era. The span of [[recorded history]] is roughly less than five thousand years, beginning with the earliest linguistic records in the third millennium BC in [[Sumer|Mesopotamia]] and [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Egypt]].
**'''[[Classical antiquity|Classical Antiquity]]''' –  Broad term for a long period of cultural history centered on the Mediterranean Sea, comprising the interlocking civilizations of [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]], collectively known as the [[Greco-Roman world]]. It is the period in which Greek and Roman society flourished and wielded great influence throughout Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
* '''[[Post-classical history|Post-Classical History]]''' – Period of time that immediately followed ancient history.  Depending on the continent, the era generally falls between the years CE 200–600 and CE 1200–1500. The major classical civilizations the era follows are [[Han dynasty|Han China]] (ending in 220), the [[Western Roman Empire]] (in 476), the [[Gupta Empire]] (in the 550s), and the [[Sasanian Empire]] (in 651). 
** '''[[Middle Ages]]''' (also called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]) – Lasted from the 5th to the 14th century. It began with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in 476 and is variously demarcated by historians as ending with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, merging into the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Age of Discovery]].
*** [[Early Middle Ages]]
*** [[High Middle Ages]]
*** [[Late Middle Ages]]
* '''[[Modern history|Modern History]]''' – After the post-classical era
**'''[[Early modern period|Early Modern Period]]''' – The chronological limits of this period are open to debate. It emerges from the [[Late Middle Ages]] (c. 1500), demarcated by historians as beginning with the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, in forms such as the [[Italian Renaissance]] in the West, the [[Ming Dynasty]] in the East, and the rise of the [[Aztec]] in the New World. The period ends with the beginning of the [[Age of Revolutions]].
** [[Modern history#Late modern period 2|'''Late Modern Period''']] – Began approximately in the mid-18th century; notable historical milestones included the [[French Revolution]], the [[American Revolution]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[Great Divergence]].
***[[Machine Age]] (1880–1945)
****[[Age of Oil]] (1901–present)

***** [[Roaring Twenties]] (1920–1929)
***** [[Great Depression]] (1929–1939)
**** [[World War II]] (1939–1945)
** '''[[Contemporary history|Contemporary History]]''' – History within living memory. It shifts forward with the generations, and today is the span of historic events from approximately 1945 that are immediately relevant to the present time. For example, the [[Post-Modern]] movement (Soviet Union and United States, 1973–present)

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primitive Communism===
'''The First Stage:''' is usually called [[primitive communism]]. It has the following characteristics.
* '''Shared Property:''' there is no concept of ownership beyond individual possessions. All is shared by the tribe to ensure its survival.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* '''[[Hunter-gatherer|Hunter / Gatherer]]:''' tribal societies have yet to develop large scale agriculture and so their survival is a daily struggle.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}
* '''Proto-Democracy:''' there is usually no concept of "leadership" yet. So tribes are led by the best warrior if there is war, the best diplomat if they have steady contact with other tribes and so forth.

===Slave Society===
'''The Second Stage:''' may be called [[Slavery|slave society]], considered to be the beginning of "class society" where private property appears. 
* '''[[Social class|Class]]:''' here the idea of class appears. There is always a slave-owning [[ruling class]] and the slaves themselves.
* '''[[Statism]]:''' the state develops during this stage as a tool for the slave-owners to use and control the slaves.
* '''[[Agriculture]]:''' people learn to cultivate plants and animals on a large enough scale to support large populations.
* '''[[Democracy]] &amp;''' '''[[Authoritarianism]]:''' these opposites develop at the same stage. Democracy arises first with the development of the republican city-state, followed by the totalitarian empire.
* '''[[Property|Private Property]]:''' citizens now own more than personal property. Land ownership is especially important during a time of agricultural development.

=== Feudalism ===
'''The Third Stage:''' may be called [[feudalism]]; it appears after slave society collapses. This was most obvious during the European [[Middle Ages]] when society went from slavery to feudalism.
* '''[[Aristocracy]]:''' the state is ruled by monarchs who inherit their positions, or at times marry or conquer their ways into leadership.
* '''[[Theocracy]]:''' this is a time of largely religious rule. When there is only one religion in the land and its organizations affect all parts of daily life.
* '''[[Hereditary title|Hereditary Classes]]:''' [[caste]]s can sometimes form and one's class is determined at birth with no form of advancement. This was the case with [[India]].
* '''[[Nation-state]]:''' nations are formed from the remnants of the fallen empires. Sometimes, they rebuild themselves into empires once more; this was the case with England's transition from a [[Roman province|province]] to an [[British Empire|empire]].

===Capitalism===
[[Capitalism]] may be considered '''The Fourth Stage''' in the sequence. Marx pays special attention to this stage in human development. The bulk of his work is devoted to analysing the mechanisms of capitalism, which in western society classically arose "red in tooth and claw" from feudal society in a revolutionary movement. In capitalism, the [[profit motive]] rules and people, freed from serfdom, work for the capitalists for wages. The capitalist class are free to spread their laissez faire practices around the world. In the capitalist-controlled parliament, laws are made to protect wealth.

Capitalism appears after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrow the feudal system, and it is categorized by the following:
* '''[[Market economy|Market Economy]]:''' In capitalism, the entire economy is guided by market forces. Supporters of [[laissez-faire]] economics argue that there should be little or no intervention from the government under capitalism. Marxists, however, such as Lenin in his ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'', argue that the capitalist government is a powerful instrument for the furtherance of capitalism and the capitalist nation-state, particularly in the conquest of markets abroad.
* '''[[Private property|Private Property]]:''' The [[means of production]] are no longer in the hands of the monarchy and its nobles, but rather they are controlled by the capitalists. The capitalists control the means of production through commercial enterprises (such as [[corporation]]s) which aim t/o maximise profit.
* '''[[Parliamentary democracy|Parliamentary Democracy]]:''' The capitalists tend to govern through an elected centralised parliament or congress, rather than under an autocracy. Capitalist (bourgeois) democracy, although it may be extended to the whole population, does not necessarily lead to [[universal suffrage]]. Historically it has excluded (by force, segregation, legislation or other means) sections of the population such as women, slaves, ex-slaves, people of colour or those on low income. The government acts on behalf of, and is controlled by, the capitalists through various methods.
* '''[[Wages]]:''' In capitalism, workers are rewarded according to their contract with their employer. Power elites propagate the illusion that market forces mean wages converge to an equilibrium at which workers are paid for precisely the value of their services.  In reality workers are paid less than the value of their productivity — the difference forming profit for the employer.  In this sense all paid employment is exploitation and the worker is "alienated" from their work.  Insofar as the profit-motive drives the market, it is impossible for workers to be paid for the full value of their labour, as all employers will act in the same manner.
* '''[[Imperialism]]:''' Wealthy countries seek to dominate poorer countries in order to gain access to raw materials and to provide captive markets for finished products. This is done directly through war, the threat of war, or the export of capital. The capitalist's control over the state can play an essential part in the development of capitalism, to the extent the state directs warfare and other foreign intervention.
* '''[[Financial institution|Financial Institution]]s:''' [[Bank]]s and capital markets such as [[stock exchange]]s direct unused capital to where it is needed.  They reduce barriers to entry in all markets, especially to the poor; it is in this way that banks dramatically improve class mobility.
* '''[[Monopoly|Monopolistic Tendencies]]:''' The natural, unrestrained market forces will create monopolies from the most successful commercial entities.

But according to Marx, capitalism, like slave society and feudalism, also has critical failings — inner contradictions which will lead to its downfall. The working class, to which the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits, is the "grave digger" of capitalism. The worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces. The rest is surplus value — the capitalist's profit, which Marx calls the "unpaid labour of the working class."  The capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the working class to increase their profits, and this creates conflict between the classes, and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the working class. The working class, through trade union and other struggles, becomes conscious of itself as an exploited class. In the view of classical Marxism, the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the working class to establish its own collective control over production

===Socialism===
After the working class gains class consciousness and mounts a revolution against the capitalists, [[socialism (Marxism)|socialism]], which may be considered '''The Fifth Stage''', will be attained, if the workers are successful. [[Marxism|Marxist Socialism]] may be characterised as follows:
* '''[[Commons|Common Property]]:''' the [[means of production]] are taken from the hands of a few capitalists and put in the hands of the workers. This translates into the democratic communes controlling the means of production.
* '''[[Council democracy|Council Democracy]]:''' Marx, basing himself on a thorough study of [[The Civil War in France|Paris Commune]], believed that the workers would govern themselves through system of communes. He called this the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], which, overthrowing the dictatorship (governance) of capital, would democratically plan production and the resources of the planet.

Marx explained that, since socialism, the first stage of communism, would be "in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges", each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor he contributes, despite the fact that each worker's ability and family circumstances would differ, so that the results would still be unequal at this stage, although fully supported by social provision.

== Geologic Time Periods ==
{{main|Geologic time scale|List of Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points}}
The [[geologic time scale]] covers the extent of the existence of Earth, from about 4600 million years ago to the present day. It is marked by [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points]]. Geologic time units are (in order of descending specificity) eons, eras, periods, epochs, and ages; and the corresponding [[Chronostratigraphy|chronostratigraphic]] units, which measure "rock-time", are eonothems, erathems, systems, series, and stages.

The second and third timelines are each subsections of their preceding timeline as indicated by asterisks. The Cenozoic is sometimes divided into the [[Quaternary]] and [[Tertiary]] periods, although the latter is no longer used officially.

An approximate dating would be about 1880 to 1945.

The 1940s saw the beginning of the [[Atomic Age]], where [[modern physics]] saw new applications such as the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.capitalcentury.com/1944.html&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[computer]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/Articles/First-computer.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519100021/http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/ABC/Articles/First-computer.html |archivedate=2011-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[transistor]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cedmagic.com/history/transistor-1947.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Digital Revolution]] ended the intellectual model of the machine age founded in the mechanical and heralding a new more complex model of [[high technology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4242">The '''Maria Rogers Oral History Program''', or '''MROHP''', collects and archives oral histories about [[Boulder County]]. Started in 1976, the program began with a handful of donated interviews, but now includes more than 1600 interviews, available both on the internet and at the [[Boulder Public Library]]'s Carnegie Branch Library for Local History.

== The Woman Behind the Collection ==

The Oral History Program is named for Maria M. Rogers, the woman who directed and developed the program for more than twelve years from 1985 to 1997. Maria gleaned information from hundreds of the program's oral history interviews for her book, ''In Other Words: Oral Histories of the Colorado Frontier'',&lt;ref&gt;p://nell.boulder.lib.co.us/search~S11?/aRogers%2C+Maria/arogers+maria/1%2C1%2C36%2CB/exact&amp;FF=arogers+maria+m+1938+1997&amp;1%2C36%2C/indexsort=r&lt;/ref&gt; which captures the personal and public history of the pioneers and early residents of Colorado.

==About the Collection==

The Maria Rogers Oral History Program Collection contained more than 1,650 interviews as of 2010, with 40 to 100 new interviews being added each year.  Many of the interviews have been recorded, transcribed and archived by volunteers for the program. Some interviews have been donated to the collection by other educational, governmental, and cultural organizations or individuals in the community.

The interviews are about all aspects of life in Boulder County, providing a detailed account of both daily life and major events. The lives of a wide range of people are recorded, including pioneers and other settlers, cattlemen, farmers, housewives, university professors, local government officials and political activists, attorneys, physicians, coal miners, teachers, artists, scientists, and more.  Although interviews are drawn from residents of Boulder County, they often cover topics that are of general interest, such as city planning and open space, political activism, mountaineering and issues involving the disposal of nuclear waste, among many others.

==Digital Archive - Access==

Donations from the Rogers family and from the Boulder Library Foundation have allowed the program to digitize all of its interviews and create a digital archive that is linked to the Boulder Public Library's catalog, making it easy to research the contents of the interviews by doing a search for names, places or keywords. [http://nell.boulderlibrary.org]

The collection is housed in the Carnegie Library for Local History, a branch of the Boulder Public Library, located at 1125 Pine Street in Boulder, Colorado. Patrons may listen to audio of all of the interviews or watch DVDs of the newer interviews at the library.  Access to files that often include supplementary information about the narrators is also available at the library. 

Full audio with summaries or transcripts of the oral histories are also available online at [http://boulderlibrary.org/oralhistory]

==Special Collections==

There are several special projects that have been conducted consisting of groups of interviews on specific topics related to the history of  the city of Boulder and Boulder County.  These special collections currently include the following:

*Activist Women in Boulder County
*Boulder City Government
*Boulder County Parks and Open Space Interviews
*City Planning in Boulder
*First United Methodist Church of Boulder
*Industrial Mine Camp
*Naropa and Buddhism in Boulder
*Post-WWII Housing in Boulder
*Rocky Flats Nuclear Weapons Plant

{{Marxism|Aspects}}

'''Marxist historiography''', or [[historical materialist]] historiography, is a school of [[historiography]] influenced by [[Marxism]].  The chief tenets of Marxist historiography are the centrality of [[social class]] and [[economic]] constraints in determining historical outcomes.

Marxist historiography has made contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]]. The chief problematic aspect of Marxist historiography has been an argument on the nature of history as ''determined'' or ''dialectical''; this can also be stated as the relative importance of [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] factors in creating outcomes.

Marxist history is generally [[Determinism|deterministic]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Elgar Companion to Marxist Economics|author1=Ben Fine|author2=Alfredo Saad-Filho|author3=Marco Boffo|publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing|page=212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xe0VQArHt8sC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=determinism#v=onepage&amp;q=determinism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A2WSBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=marxist+history+deterministic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRsLn61NfXAhUJK48KHXprAcg4ChDoAQgyMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=marxist%20history%20deterministic&amp;f=false|page=5|title=|first=J.J.|last= O'Rourke|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9pem7Ip_WUgC&amp;pg=PA247|first=Kenneth|last=Stunkel|page=247|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; it posits a direction of history, towards an end state of history as [[classless]] human society. Marxist historiography, that is, the writing of Marxist history in line with the given historiographical principles, is generally seen as a tool. Its aim is to bring those oppressed by history to [[Self-actualization#Self-actualization|self-consciousness]], and to arm them with tactics and strategies from history: it is both a historical and a liberatory project.

Historians who use Marxist methodology, but disagree with the mainstream of Marxism, often describe themselves as ''marxist'' historians (with a lowercase ''M'').  Methods from Marxist historiography, such as class analysis, can be divorced from the liberatory intent of Marxist historiography; such practitioners often refer to their work as ''marxian'' or ''Marxian''.

==Marx and Engels==

[[Friedrich Engels]]' most important historical contribution was ''Der deutsche Bauernkrieg'' (''The [[German Peasants' War]]''), which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. ''The German Peasants' War'' indicate the Marxist interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and attempts a dialectical analysis.

Marx's most important works on social and political history include ''[[The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon]]'', ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', ''[[The German Ideology]]'', and those chapters of ''[[Das Kapital]]'' dealing with the historical emergence of [[Capitalism|capitalists]] and [[Proletariat|proletarians]] from [[Pre-industrial society|pre-industrial]] English society.

Engels' short treatise ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' (1870s) was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics.

==Marx and labor==

Key to understanding Marxist historiography is his view of labor. For Marx "historical reality is none other than objectified labor, and all conditions of labor given by nature, including the organic bodies of people, are merely preconditions and 'disappearing moments' of the labor process."&lt;ref&gt;Andrey Maidansky. "The Logic of Marx's History," Russian Studies in Philosophy, vol. 51, no. 2 (Fall 2012): 45.&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on the physical as the determining factor in history represents a break from virtually all previous historians. Until Marx developed his theory of [[historical materialism]], the overarching determining factor in the direction of history was some sort of divine agency.  In Marx's view of history "God became a mere projection of human imagination" and more importantly "a tool of oppression".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Breisach. Historiography: Ancient, Medieval, and Modern, 3rd Ed. (Chicago, Il: University of Chicago Press, 2007), pg. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no more sense of divine direction to be seen. History moved by the sheer force of human labor, and all theories of divine nature were a concoction of the ruling powers to keep the working people in check. For Marx, "The first historical act is... the production of material life itself."&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern. The Varieties of History: From Voltaire to the Present. Vintage Books Edition (New York, NY: Random House: 1973), 150.&lt;/ref&gt; As one might expect, Marxist history not only begins with labor, it ends in production: "history does not end by being resolved into "self-consciousness" as "spirit of the spirit," but that in it at each stage there is found a material result: a sum of productive forces, a historically created relation of individuals to nature and to one another, which is handed down to each generation from its predecessor..."&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Stern. The Varieties of History: From Voltaire to the Present. Vintage Books Edition (New York, NY: Random House: 1973), 156-157.&lt;/ref&gt; For further, and much more comprehensive, information on this topic, see [[historical materialism]].

==In the Soviet Union==
{{details|Historiography in the Soviet Union}}

Marxist historiography suffered in the [[Soviet Union]], as the government requested overdetermined historical writing. Soviet historians tended to avoid contemporary history (history after 1905) where possible and effort was predominantly directed at premodern history.  As history was considered to be a politicised academic discipline, historians limited their creative output to avoid prosecution.

Notable histories include the ''Short Course History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union ([[Bolshevik]])'', published in the 1930s, which was written in order to justify the nature of Bolshevik party life under [[Joseph Stalin]].

==The Communist Party Historians Group in Britain==
{{Main|Communist Party Historians Group}}
A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946. They shared a common interest in "history from below" and class structure in early capitalist society. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history. E. P. Thompson famously engaged [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]] in ''[[The Poverty of Theory]]'', arguing that Althusser's theory overdetermined history, and left no space for historical revolt by the oppressed.

Thompson's ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' is one of the works commonly associated with this group. [[Eric Hobsbawm]]'s ''Bandits'' is another example of this group's work.

[[C. L. R. James]] was also a great pioneer of the 'history from below' approach. Living in Britain when he wrote his most notable work ''[[The Black Jacobins]]'' (1938), he was an [[anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] Marxist and so outside of the CPGB.

== In India ==
In India, [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] is considered the founding father of Marxist historiography. The senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]], [[Irfan Habib]], [[D. N. Jha]] and [[K. N. Panikkar]].&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, T. B. 1983. A Dictionary of Marxist thought. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

One debate in Indian history that relates to a [[historical materialist]] schema is on the nature of [[feudalism]] in India. [[Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi|D. D. Kosambi]] in the 1960s outlined the idea of "feudalism from below" and "feudalism from above". R. S. Sharma largely agrees with Kosambi in his various books.&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''[[Indian Feudalism (book)]], 2005''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''Early Medieval Indian Society: A Study in Feudalisation'', Orient Longman, Kolkata, 2001, pp. 177-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R S Sharma, ''India's Ancient Past'', Oxford University Press, New Delhi, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D N Jha, ''The Feudal Order: State Society and Ideology in Early Medieval India'', Manohar Publishers, New Delhi, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Most Indian Marxists argue that the economic origins of communalism are feudal remnants and the economic insecurities caused by slow development under a "world capitalist system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dalit women in India: issues and perspective|page=138|first=Prahlad|last=Jogdand|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B. R. Ambedkar]] criticized Marxists, as he deemed them to be unaware or ignorant of the specifics of [[caste]] issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7ffDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA167|title=Development-Induced Displacement in India and China: A Comparative Look at the Burdens of Growth|last=Padovani|first=Florence|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|quote=Bhimrao Ambedkar himself, who criticized Indian Marxists}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of historians have also debated Marxist historians and critically examined their analysis of [[history of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Muslim Rule in India|quote=Marxists who always try to cover up the black spots of Muslim rule with thick coats of whitewash|first=Kishori Saran|last=Lal|publisher=Aditya Prakashan|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Politics, Then and Now: Essays in Historical Perspective|first=K|last=Seshadri|publisher=Pragatee Prakashan|page=5|quote=certain attempts made by some ultra-Marxist historians to justify and even whitewash tyrannical emperors of the medieval India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in World Affairs, Volume 1|first=KR|last=Gupta|publisher=Atlantic Publisher|page=249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hw9uf7sRKtIC&amp;pg=PA249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-Hind the Making of the Indo-Islamic World: The Slave Kings and the Islamic Conquest : 11Th-13th Centuries|last=Wink|first=André|publisher=BRILL|page=309|quote="apologists for Islam, as well as some marxist scholars in India have sometimes attempted to reduce Islamic iconoclasm.."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1990s, [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] scholars especially have polemicized against the Marxist tradition in India for neglecting what they believe to be the country's 'illustrious past.' Marxists are held responsible for aiding or defending [[Islam in India|Muslims]], who figure in Hindu nationalist discourse as the enemy within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0RZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=|title=The Construction of History and Nationalism in India: Textbooks, Controversies and Politics|last=Guichard|first=Sylvie|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a critique is [[Arun Shourie]]'s ''[[Eminent Historians]]'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, E. E. (2014). Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate. Cary, USA: Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Nanjing Massacre}}
'''Nanking Massacre denial''' is the denial that [[Imperial Japan]]ese forces [[Nanking massacre|murdered hundreds of thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], a highly controversial episode in [[Sino-Japanese relations]]. Some historians accept the findings of the [[Tokyo tribunal]] with respect to the scope and nature of the atrocities committed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] after the [[Battle of Nanking]], others do not accept. In Japan, however, there has been a debate over the extent and nature of the [[Rape of Nanking|massacre]]. Relations between Japan and China have been complicated as a result, as denial of the massacre is seen in China as part of an overall unwillingness on Japan's part to admit and apologize for its aggression, or a perceived insensitivity regarding the killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=I'm Sorry?|series=NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|airdate=1998-12-01|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/asia/july-dec98/china_12-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the death toll vary widely, ranging from 40,000 to 200,000.&lt;ref name="Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi 2008 p. 362"&gt;Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, ed.

"Picking at the Wound: Nanjing, 1937-38". Electronic Journal of Contemporary Japanese Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars, notably the revisionists in Japan,  have contended that the actual death toll is far lower, or even that the event was entirely fabricated and never occurred at all.&lt;ref name="Fogel, Joshua A. 2000, page 46-8"&gt;Fogel, Joshua A. ''The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography''. 2000, page 46-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dillon, Dana R. 2007, pp. 9"&gt;Dillon, Dana R. ''The China Challenge''. 2007, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; These revisionist accounts of the killings have become a staple of [[Japanese nationalist]] discourse.&lt;ref name="Yoshida157-158"&gt;Yoshida, pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Japanese journalists and social scientists, such as [[Tomio Hora]] and [[Katsuichi Honda]], have played prominent roles in countering such historiography, in the decades since the killings. Nonetheless, denialist accounts, such as those of [[Shūdō Higashinakano]], have often created controversy in the global media, particularly in China and other East Asian nations.&lt;ref name="Yoshida157-158" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gall"&gt;Gallicchio, Marc S. ''The Unpredictability of the Past''. 2007, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of the massacre [[Japanese history textbook controversies|in Japanese school textbooks]] also troubles [[Sino-Japanese relations]], as in some textbooks, the massacre is only briefly mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/kasahara.pdf |title=Reconciling Narratives of the Nanjing Massacre in Japanese and Chinese Textbooks |publisher=Tsuru Bunka University |first=Tokushi |last=Kasahara}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National identity==
Takashi Yoshida asserts that, "Nanjing has figured in the attempts of all three nations [China, Japan and the United States] to preserve and redefine national and ethnic pride and identity, assuming different kinds of significance based on each country's changing internal and external enemies."&lt;ref name="Yoshida"&gt;Yoshida, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In Japan, interpretation of the Nanking Massacre is a reflection upon the Japanese national identity and notions of "pride, honor and shame." Takashi Yoshida describes the Japanese debate over the Nanjing Incident as "crystalliz[ing] a much larger conflict over what should constitute the ideal perception of the nation: Japan, as a nation, acknowledges its past and apologizes for its wartime wrongdoings; or... stands firm against foreign pressures and teaches Japanese youth about the benevolent and courageous martyrs who fought a just war to save Asia from Western aggression."&lt;ref&gt;Yoshida&lt;/ref&gt; In some nationalist circles in Japan, speaking of a large-scale massacre at Nanjing is regarded as {{" '}}[[Japan bashing]]' (in the case of foreigners) or 'self-flagellation' (in the case of Japanese)."&lt;ref name="Askew"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Electronic journal of contemporary Japanese studies |date=2002-04-04 |title=The Nanjing Incident – Recent Research and Trends |first=David |last=Askew |accessdate=2009-03-24 |url=http://www.japanesestudies.org.uk/articles/Askew.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
David Askew characterizes the Nanjing Incident as having "emerged as a fundamental keystone in the construction of the modern Chinese national identity." According to Askew, "a refusal to accept the "orthodox" position on Nanjing can be construed as an attempt to deny the Chinese nation a legitimate voice in international society".&lt;ref name=Askew /&gt;

==Issues of definition==

The precise definition of the geographical area, duration of the massacre, as well as the definition of who was a victim to be considered for counting deaths in the massacre forms a major part of both the definition of the massacre and in the arguments of denialists.  Among the most extreme denialists, such as Tanaka Masaaki, revisionist claims of several dozen or several hundred are claimed,&lt;ref&gt;Masaaki Tanaka claims that very few civilians were killed, and that the massacre is in fact a fabrication in his book ''[http://www.ne.jp/asahi/unko/tamezou/nankin/whatreally/ "Nankin gyakusatsu" no kyokÙ] (The "Nanking Massacre" as Fabrication)''.&lt;/ref&gt; while figures within the range of 50,000-300,000 is typically articulated among mainstream historians.&lt;ref name="Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi 2008 p. 362"/&gt;&lt;ref name="James Leibold 2008"/&gt;

The common revisionist viewpoint, made by denialists such as Higashinakano Shudo is that the geographical area of the incident should be limited to the few square kilometers of the city, and they typically estimate the population to be about 200,000-250,000.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, Masaaki. What Really Happened in Nanking: The Refutation of a Common Myth. Tokyo: Sekai Shuppan, 2000. Print. p.16-17&lt;/ref&gt; However, this geographic definition is almost universally unheard of outside of revisionist circles. Their use of 200,000-250,000 civilians is also only includes those in the Nanking safety zone, which does not include everyone inside of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001115084700/http://www.japanecho.co.jp/docs/html/250413.html|title=The Nanking Atrocities: Fact and Fable|last=Hata|first=Ikuhiko|date=1998|website=japanecho.co.jp|archive-url=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians include a much larger area around the city, including the Xiaguan district (the [[suburb]]s north of Nanjing city, about 31&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in size) and other areas on the outskirts of the city. Zhang Lianhong estimated the population of greater Nanjing was between 535,000 and 635,000 civilians and soldiers just prior to the Japanese occupation back in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Data Challenges Japanese Theory on Nanjing Population Size |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2003/Dec/83437.htm |accessdate=2006-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he revised his estimate to 468,000-568,000.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20151222192905/http://www.sjhistory.org/site/newxh/yjzt1-3mb_a2008022321792.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians also include six counties around Nanjing, known as the Nanjing Special Municipality.  With the six surrounding counties included, the population of Nanjing is estimated to be more than 1 million.&lt;ref name="TokushiKasahara"&gt;Historian [[Tokushi Kasahara]] states "more than 100,000 and close to 200,000, or maybe more", referring to his own book ''Nankin jiken'' Iwanami shinsho (FUJIWARA Akira (editor) ''Nankin jiken o dou miruka'' 1998 Aoki shoten, {{ISBN|4-250-98016-2}}, p. 18). This estimation includes the surrounding area outside of the city of Nanking, which is objected by a Chinese researcher (the same book, p. 146). Hiroshi Yoshida concludes "more than 200,000" in his book (''Nankin jiken o dou miruka'' p. 123, YOSHIDA Hiroshi ''Tennou no guntai to Nankin jiken'' 1998 Aoki shoten, {{ISBN|4-250-98019-7}}, p. 160). Professor Tomio Hora at Waseda University in Tokyo writes 50,000–100,000 (TANAKA Masaaki [http://www.sdh-fact.com/ ''What Really Happened in Nanking''] 2000 Sekai Shuppan, Inc. {{ISBN|4-916079-07-8}}, p. 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

The duration of the incident is naturally defined by its geography: the earlier the Japanese entered the area, the longer the duration. The [[Battle of Nanjing|Battle of Nanking]] ended on December 13, when the divisions of the Japanese Army entered the walled city of Nanking. The Tokyo War Crime Tribunal defined the period of the massacre to the ensuing six weeks. More conservative estimates say the massacre started on December 14, when the troops entered the Safety Zone, and that it lasted for six weeks.

Most scholars have accepted figures between 50,000-300,000 dead as an approximate total.&lt;ref name="Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi 2008 p. 362"/&gt;&lt;ref name="James Leibold 2008"/&gt; Revisionists in Japan, however have contended at times that the actual death toll is far lower, or even that the event was entirely fabricated and never occurred at all.&lt;ref name="Fogel, Joshua A. 2000, page 46-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dillon, Dana R. 2007, pp. 9"/&gt;

==History and censorship during the War==

{{See also|Censorship in the Empire of Japan}}

During the war, Japanese media and newspapers typically portrayed a positive view of the war in China.  Reports on the massacre were generally muted, and newspaper reports and photos typically emphasized cooperation between Chinese civilians and Japanese soldiers.  Massacre denialists claim that the news published in the Japanese media and newspapers were "true" and "reliable" stories.  However, most mainstream historians counter that it is well known that the '' Naikaku Jōhōkyoku'' (''Cabinet Information Bureau''), a consortium of military, politicians and professionals created in 1936 as a "committee" and upgraded to a "division" in 1937, applied censorship of all the media of the Shōwa regime and that this office held a policing authoring over the realm of publishing.&lt;ref name=Earhart&gt;David C. Earhart, ''Certain Victory : Images of World War II in the Japanese Media'', M.E. Sharpe, 2007, p.89, 108, 143&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the '' Naikaku Jōhōkyoku'''s activities were proscriptive as well as prescriptive. Besides issuing detailed guidelines to publishers, it made suggestions that were all but commands.&lt;ref name=Earhart /&gt; From 1938, printed medias "would come to realize that their survival depended upon taking cues from the Cabinet Information Bureau and its flagship publication, ''Shashin shūhō'', designers of the "look" of the soldier, and the "look" of the war."&lt;ref&gt;David C. Earhart, ''Certain Victory : Images of World War II in the Japanese Media'', M.E. Sharpe, 2007, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 12 of the censorship guideline for newspapers issued on September 1937 stated that any news article or photograph "unfavorable" to the Imperial Army was subject to a gag. Article 14 prohibited any "photographs of atrocities" but endorsed reports about the "cruelty of the Chinese" soldiers and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Shinichi Kusamori, ''Fukyoka Shashi Ron: Hūkoku no Shashi 2'' (An Essay on Disapproved Photographs: Journalistic Photos on Japan 2), Mainichi Shinbun Hizū Fukyoka Shashin 2, Mainichi Shinbun 1999, p.177-178&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the censorship, none of the hundred Japanese reporters in Nanking when the city was captured wrote anything unfavorable to their countrymen. In 1956, however, Masatake Imai, correspondent for the ''Tokyo Asahi'' who reported only about the "majestic and soul-stirring ceremony" of the triumphal entry of the Imperial Army, revealed he witnessed a mass execution of 400 to 500 Chinese men near ''Tokyo Asahi''{{'}}s office. "I wish I could write about it", he told his colleague Nakamura. "Someday, we will, but not for the time being. But we sure saw it", Nakamure answered.&lt;ref&gt;Masatake Imai, ''Nankin Shinai no Tairyo Satsujin'' (Mass Murders in the City of Nanking), ''Mokugekisha ga Kataru Showashi 5: Nichi Chu Senso'' (Showa History told by Witnesses), Shin Jinbutsu Orai, 1989, p. 49-58.&lt;/ref&gt;
Shigeharu Matsumoto, the Shanghai bureau Chief of ''Domei'' News Agency, wrote that the Japanese reporters he interviewed all told him they saw between 2,000 and 3,000 corpses around the Xiaguan area and a reporter, Yuji Maeda, saw recruits executing Chinese prisoners-of-war with bayonets.&lt;ref&gt;Shigeharu Matsumoto, ''Shanghai Jidai: Journalist no Kaiso'' (The Shanghai Age: A Journalist's Memoirs), Cho Koron 1975, p.251-252.&lt;/ref&gt;
Jiro Suzuki, a correspondent for the ''Tokyo Nichi Nichi'', wrote, "When I went back to the Zhongshan Gate, I saw for the first time an unearthly, brutal massacre. On the top of the wall, about 25 meters high, the prisoners of war were rounded up in a line. They were being stabbed by bayonets and shoved away off the wall. A number of Japanese soldiers polished their bayonets, shouted to themselves once and thrust their bayonets in the chest or back of POWs."&lt;ref&gt;Yutaka Yoshida, ''Tenno no Guntai to Nankin Jiken'' (The Emperor's Military and the Nankin Incident), Aoki Shoten, 1986, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Tokushi Kasahara notes, "Some deniers argue that Nanjing was much more peaceful than we generally think. They always show some photographs with Nanjing refugees selling some food in the streets or Chinese people smiling in the camps. They are forgetting about Japanese propaganda. The Imperial Army imposed strict censorship. Any photographs with dead bodies couldn't get through. So photographers had to remove all the bodies before taking pictures of streets and buildings in the city (...) Even if the photos were not staged, the refugees had no choice but to fawn on the Japanese soldiers. Acting otherwise meant their deaths..."&lt;ref name="at1"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Nanjing Massacre, Psychological Warfare: I Chinese Propaganda|url=http://thenanjingmassacre.org/2015/07/04/chinese-propaganda/ |work=www.thenanjingmassacre.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revived international interest in the Nanking Massacre===

[[Iris Chang]]'s 1997 book, ''[[The Rape of Nanking (book)|The Rape of Nanking]]'', renewed global interest in the Nanking Massacre. The book sold more than half a million copies when it was first published in the US, and according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', received general critical acclaim.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischang.net/press_article.cfm?n=1|title=History's Shadow Foils Nanking Chronicle|publisher=The New York Times (article hosted by IrisChang.net)|date=1999-05-20|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that it was the "first comprehensive examination of the destruction of this Chinese imperial city", and that Chang "skillfully excavated from oblivion the terrible events that took place". ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' wrote that it was a "compelling account of a horrendous episode that, until recently, has been largely forgotten."&lt;ref name="MediaPraise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irischang.net/press_article.cfm?n=14|title=Media Praise For The Rape of Nanking|publisher=IrisChang.net|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text, however, was not without controversy. Chang's account drew on new sources to break new ground in the study of the period. Japanese ultra-nationalists maintained that the Nanking Massacre was a fabrication which sought "to demonize the Japanese race, culture, history, and nation."&lt;ref name="yosh"&gt;Takashi Yoshida. ''The making of the "Rape of Nanking"''. 2006, page 146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massacre affirmation vs. massacre denial===

Takashi Hoshiyama characterizes opinion in Japan about the Nanking Massacre as "broadly divided into two schools of thought: the massacre affirmation school, which asserts that a large-scale massacre took place, and the massacre denial school, which asserts that, a certain number of isolated aberrations aside, no massacre took place."&lt;ref name=Hoshiyama&gt;{{cite web |last=Hoshiyama |first=Takashi |title=The Split Personality of the Nanking Massacre |url=http://www.iips.org/bp330e.pdf |date=November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101104617/http://www.iips.org/bp330e.pdf |archivedate=2013-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hijacking of the debate by layperson activists===

David Askew asserts that the debate over the Nanking Massacre has been hijacked by "two large groups of layperson activists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Ritsumeikan International Affairs |volume=2 |pages=63–78 |year=2004 |title=The Contested Past: History and Semantics in the Nanjing Debate |first=David |last=Askew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Chinese" are turned into a single, homogenised voice and portrayed as sinister and manipulative twisters of the truth, while the similarly homogenized "Japanese" are portrayed as uniquely evil, as cruel and blood-thirsty beyond redemption, and as deniers of widely accepted historical truths.

Both positions are victimisation narratives. One depicts the Chinese as helpless victims of brutal Japanese imperialism in the winter of 1937–38, while the other depicts the gullible Japanese, innocent in the ways of the world, as victims of Chinese machinations and propaganda in the post-war era.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Japanese perspectives on the massacre===

Japanese affirmationists not only accept the validity of these tribunals and their findings, but also assert that Japan must stop denying the past and come to terms with Japan's responsibility for the war of aggression against its Asian neighbors. Affirmationists have drawn the attention of the Japanese public to atrocities committed by the Japanese Army during World War II in general and the Nanking Massacre in particular in support of an anti-war agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/hgs/dcn003 |first=Matthew |last=Penney |title=Far from Oblivion: The Nanking Massacre in Japanese Historical Writing for Children and Young Adults |journal=Holocaust and Genocide Studies |year=2008 |volume=22 |pages=25–48 | issue=1 |pmid=20681109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extreme denialists, by and large, reject the findings of the tribunals as a kind of "[[victor's justice]]" in which only the winning side's version of events are accepted.  Described within Japan as the Illusion School (''maboroshi-ha''), they deny the massacre and argue that only a few POWs and civilians were killed by the Japanese military in Nanjing.  More moderate denialists argue that between several thousand and 38,000–42,000 were massacred.&lt;ref name=Askew /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hata Ikuhiko 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prominent Japanese denialists==

[[File:Chinese to be beheaded in Nanking Massacre.jpg| thumb | left | upright | A Chinese POW about to be beheaded by a Japanese officer with a [[shin gunto]] during the Nanking Massacre.]]

===Shudo Higashinakano===
Massacre denialists such as Higashinakano argue that the "Nanking Massacre" was a fabrication and war-time propaganda spread by the Chinese Nationalists and Communists. He argues that the activities of the Japanese military in Nanking were in accordance with international law and were humane.&lt;ref name=Hev&gt;Higashinakano (2005) pp. 219–223&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other claims, he has denied that there was execution of POWs in uniform,&lt;ref name=Hev/&gt; and cited anecdotes claiming that Chinese POWs were treated humanely by Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Higashinakano (2003) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Higashinakano has also claimed at times that the executed POWs were illegitimate combatants, and so their execution was legitimate under international law.  Higashinakano believes some several thousand 'illegitimate combatants' may have been executed in such a fashion.&lt;ref name="Hev"/&gt;

What Higashinakano believed is against the articles of [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], which was ratified by Japan and China. Japan violated the spirits and the statements of [[laws of war]].
For examples, according to historian Akira Fujiwara, on August 6, 1937, deputy minister of Military of Japan  notified of Japanese Troops in Shanghai that the army's proposition to remove the constraints of international law on the treatment of Chinese prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Fujiwara, ''Nitchû Sensô ni Okeru Horyo Gyakusatsu, Kikan Sensô Sekinin Kenkyû'' 9, 1995, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; This directive also advised staff officers to stop using the term "[[prisoner of war]]".  During the massacre, Japanese troops in fact embarked on a determined search for former soldiers, in which thousands of young men were captured, most of whom were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fujiwara | first = Akira | year = 1995 | title = Nitchû Sensô ni Okeru Horyotoshido Gyakusatsu | journal = Kikan Sensô Sekinin Kenkyû | volume = 9 |issue= | page = 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another case, Japanese troops gathered 1,300 Chinese soldiers and civilians at the Taiping Gate and killed them. The victims were blown up with landmines, then doused with petrol before being set on fire.  Those that were left alive afterward were killed with bayonets.&lt;ref name="Taiping"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7140357.stm | title = Nanjing remembers massacre victims | publisher = BBC News | date = 2007-12-13 | accessdate=2007-12-13 | first = Michael | last = Bristow}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[F. Tillman Durdin]] and [[Archibald Steele]], American news correspondents, reported that they had seen bodies of killed Chinese soldiers forming mounds six feet high at the Nanking Yijiang gate in the north. Durdin, who was working for the [[New York Times]], made a tour of Nanking before his departure from the city. He heard waves of machine-gun fire and witnessed the Japanese soldiers gun down some two hundred Chinese within ten minutes. Two days later, in his report to the ''New York Times'', he stated that the alleys and street were filled with civilian bodies, including women and children.

A claim that [[Harold Timperley]], whose report formed the basis of the Tribunal's findings, was reporting only hearsay, and that thus, the figure of 300,000 dead was "unreal" drew a response from Bob Tadashi Wakabayashi, who suggested that Higashinakano's assertions and conclusion were not "sensible":

&lt;blockquote&gt;Higashinakano jumps to this conclusion in all earnestness because he clings to a hypothetical fixation that the Atrocity never happened. This forces him to seize any shred of evidence, whether sound or not, to sustain and systematize that delusion.&lt;ref&gt;Wakabayashi, Bob Tadashi. ''The Nanking atrocity, 1937-38: complicating the picture''. 2007, page 327&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Higashinakano has also at times denied the occurrence of mass rape on the part of Japanese troops, at times ascribing it to Chinese soldiers, and at other times simply denying its occurrence.  The occurrence of rape during the massacre is testified to by John Rabe, elected leader of the Nanjing Safety Zone, who writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Two Japanese soldiers have climbed over the garden wall and are about to break into our house. When I appear they give the excuse that they saw two Chinese soldiers climb over the wall. When I show them my party badge, they return the same way. In one of the houses in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital. (...) Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College Girls alone. You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they're shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John E. |last=Woods |title=The Good man of Nanking, the Diaries of John Rabe |year=1998 |page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Minnie Vautrin]], a professor at Ginling College, wrote in her diary on that day, "Oh God, control the cruel beastliness of the Japanese soldiers in Nanking tonight..," and on the 19th, "In my wrath, I wished I had the power to smite them for their dastardly work. How ashamed women of Japan would be if they knew these tales of horror."&lt;ref&gt;Hua-ling Hu, ''[[American Goddess at the Rape of Nanking: The Courage of Minnie Vautrin]]'', 2000, p.90, 95 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Vautrin also wrote in her diary that she had to go to the Japanese embassy repeatedly from December 18 to January 13 to get proclamations to prohibit Japanese soldiers from committing crimes at Ginling because the soldiers tore the documents up before taking women away.

Xia Shuqin, a woman testifying that she had been a massacre victim sued Higashinakano for defamation, for a claim made in a book written in 1998 that the murder of her family had been performed by Chinese, rather than Japanese soldiers.  On 5 February 2009, the Japanese Supreme Court ordered Higashinakano and the publisher, ''Tendensha'', to pay 4 million yen in damages to Mrs. Xia.  According to the court, Higashinakano failed to prove that she and the girl were different persons, and that she was not a witness of the Nanking massacre, as Higashinakano had claimed in his book.&lt;ref&gt;''Chinese hail Nanjing massacre witness' libel suite victory'', [http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90883/6587967.html], ''Author on Nanjing loses libel appeal'', [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090207b2.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masaaki Tanaka===
In his book "The Fabrication of the 'Nanjing Massacre', Masaaki Tanaka argues that there was no indiscriminate killing at all in Nanjing and that the massacre was a fabrication manufactured by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] (IMTFE) and the Chinese government for the purpose of propaganda.  He has in addition argued that the Tokyo Tribunal was 'victor's justice' and not a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Nanjing Massacre in History and Historiography |editor=Joshua A. Fogel |publisher=University of California Press |year=2002|isbn=0-520-22007-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8z6c6rTk0WUC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He provides a figure of roughly 2000 deaths for the entirety of the massacre.  Tanaka has also argued the claim that many civilians were killed by the Chinese military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.history.gr.jp/~nanking/rabe.html |author= Tanaka, Masaaki |title= Kodansha-kan "Nankin no Shinjitsu" wa Shinjitsu dehanai ("The Truth of Nanking" is not true) |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924030505/http://www.history.gr.jp/~nanking/rabe.html |archivedate= 2015-09-24 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These claims have come under heavy fire both within and outside Japan.

[[File:Atelier de Nicolas de Largillière, portrait de Voltaire, détail (musée Carnavalet) -002.jpg|thumb|[[Voltaire]] was the first in the [[modern period]] who attempted to write a history of the world, without use of religious and nationalistic interpretations of the past.]]
[[Universal history]], the result of a universal, cosmopolitan interpretation of historical events and mankind as a whole, coherent unit, preceded the nationalization of history. In the [[Western world]], this motivation to imagine a universal history became influential in the 18th century when numerous philosophers promoted new cosmopolitan ideologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Colonial experience (many [[Europe]]an countries had colonies) exposed society in Europe to numerous different cultures and civilizations. It is also very important to take in consideration that the 18th century was in the [[Age of Enlightenment]] when people's activities, both on individual and social level, were determined with desire to follow rational scientific judgment while changing the society, which released them from restraints of customs and arbitrary authorities based on [[faith]], [[superstition]], or [[revelation]] and backed up by [[religion]] or [[tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| quote       = Enlightenment was a desire for human affairs to be guided by rationality rather than by faith, superstition, or revelation; a belief in the power of human reason to change society and liberate the individual from the restraints of custom or arbitrary authority; all backed up by a world view increasingly validated by science rather than by religion or tradition.}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these circumstances provided suitable surroundings for development of universalistic, liberal and rational global perspectives in studies of society and its past and writing historical texts.

In his ''Essay on customs (1756)'' [[Voltaire]] studied development of civilization in the world with universal perspective, rejecting tradition, Christian and national frames. He was significantly influenced by [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet]] and his work ''Discourse on the Universal history (1682)'' when he was first who seriously attempted to write a history of the world, without limits imposed by nation or religion, emphasizing economical, cultural and political history. [[Imanuel Kant]] developed ideas about universally applicable moral imperatives in his work ''Perpetual Peace (1795)'' and designed a plan for establishing a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] liberal order which would result in perpetual [[peace]]. Universalism of the 18th century created an ideology which today could be identified as [[Civil society|modern civil society]].

The emerging of modern historiography is connected with German universities in the 19th century and the significant influence of [[Leopold von Ranke]] who insisted on objectivity and systematic use of historical documents in the form of authentic primary sources; his credo was to perform reconstruction of the past "as it was".&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p.2 "Leopold von Ranke founded historical research on the systematic use of documentary evidence, on reconstructing the past `as it was', and on the ideal of objectivity."&lt;/ref&gt; Ranke's universal precepts in virtually all his works were, however, applied almost exclusively to the history of states and nations.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p.2 " These were
universal precepts. In practice, however, they were applied almost exclusively to the history of states and nation states in Europe,.... Virtually all of Ranke's own work,... was devoted to these themes."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of nationalization of history ==
Though nationalization of history could probably be traced from the earliest phases of creating historical works, it was in the period after the [[French revolution]] that creating of historical works started to be strongly influenced by national perspectives, and that perspective gradually became globally dominant with its culmination during the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century. Nationalism was estimated as the proper perspective to such an extent that nationalization of history remained unnoticed till recently (1980s and 1990s) and was not studied in historiography in a scale that would correspond to its significance.

Many various reasons, depending on the circumstances, caused nationalization of history. Probably the most important is [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]], the important element of which was nationalized history,&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr; p. 7, "In some countries nationalization of history was part of "invention of tradition", while in others it was an element of so called "national renaissance" or "national awakening" .."&lt;/ref&gt; that resulted in the emerging of modern [[nations]] and [[Nation state|nation-states]], mostly during the 19th century. With the emerging of national states, a global universal approach to writing history lost ground to the nation-state and was very much captured by it even in a significant part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p. 2 "Nevertheless, the cosmopolitan ideal lost ground to the nation state in the nineteenth century and for the greater part of the twentieth century too, and was to a large degree captured by it."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Professionalization and institutionalization of history|The professionalization and institutionalization of history]] that took part in nation-states' institutions during the 19th and first half of the 20th century was closely connected with the process of history's increasing nationalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url        =http://www.uni-leipzig.de/zhsesf/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=29| title        =Writing the Nation - A Global Perspective (Stefan Berger)| first        =| last        =| author        =Stefan Berger| authorlink        =Stefan Berger| date        =January 16, 2008| work        =| publisher        =European Science Foundation| location        =| page        =| pages        =| at        =| language        =| trans-title        =| format        =| doi        =| archiveurl        =https://web.archive.org/web/20131213141742/http://www.uni-leipzig.de/zhsesf/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=29| archivedate        =2013-12-13| accessdate        =October 29, 2010| quote        =The institutionalization and professionalisation of history writing is analysed in the context of history's increasing nationalization in the course of the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century.| ref        =| separator        =| postscript        =| deadurl        =yes| df        =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nationalization of history was additionally entrenched by the development of national curricula in schools based on "monumental and prestigious" series of "authoritative" national stories, often written in insular style and justificatory manner.&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p. 2, "The tradition of writing national histories was further entrenched in the twentieth century through the development of national curricula in schools and the production of prestigious series, typically described as being `monumental' and `authoritative', that told the `national story' in an insular style and often in a justificatory manner."&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[First World War]] was finished, in some cases during establishment of new frontiers, the principle of national self-determination was taken in consideration during frontier [[Demarcation line|demarcation]]. Therefore, it was necessary to establish the national historical character of certain territories and settlements, like in case between Germany and Poland and the Versailles treaty when numerous historians prepared short studies in an attempt to support territory demands based on Germany or Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

After the [[Second World War]] and the process of [[decolonization]], the process of establishing new countries led to additionally stimulated nationalization of history because "new [[flags]] requested new histories".&lt;ref&gt;A. G. Hopkins, p.2 "This approach was adopted enthusiastically by the new states that came into being following the upheavals brought about by two world wars and decolonization. New flags required new histories."&lt;/ref&gt; Even when citizens of newly-established countries already had their national identity built, the nationalization of history was aimed to create of new national identity based on citizenship. [[Canada]] is an example of an attempt at nationalization of history to create a shared, historically-rooted identity for English and French Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Renationalization of history ==
If the first phase of nationalization of history was forcibly suppressed by a national ideology ([[communism]]) or traumatic losing of wars ([[Japan]], [[Germany]], ...) there can be a second phase, [[renationalization of history]], on usually changed basis and perspective of nationalism.

=== Renationalization of history in Ukraine ===
The nationalization of history in [[Ukraine]] had two separate phases:&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr, p. 7, "Ukraine experienced nationalization of history in two stages. The first began in mid-nineteenth century and reached its heights in the creation of grand narrative, Mykhailo Hrushevsky's „History of Ukraine - Rus“. The tradition of historical writings that emerged at this stage persisted in Ukrainian Marxist historiography until the end of Second World War.... In diasporas historiography it turned it into canon, a true credo. The second stage began in 1980s and still continuing. .... It is taking place under state sponsorship and is integral part of nationalization of the state."&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''First phase'' began in the middle of the 19th century and reached its culmination in [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]'s “History of Ukraine - Rus'”. This phase lasted till the end of the [[Second World War]] when it was stopped because of political changes in the Soviet Union, while in [[diasporas]] Hrushevsky's text had [[cult]] status.
* ''Second phase'' started in the 1980s and still lasts as of 2010, as a consequence of direct state sponsorship becoming an integral part of nationalization of the state. At the beginning, it was not so intensive, but after its turning point on August 24, 1991, it achieved special purposes: to legitimize the newly established [[state (polity)|state]] and its governing elites, establishing territorial and chronological conceptions of the [[Ukrainian nation]], and to confirm the appropriateness of its existence as legal successor in the consciousness of its citizens and neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr, p. 11, "Nationalized history began to fulfil important instrumental functions: legitimize newly established state and its attendant elite, establishing territorial and chronological conceptions of Ukrainian nation, and to confirm nations appropriateness of that nations existence as legal successor in the consciousness of its citizens and neighbours alike."&lt;/ref&gt;

The irst phase chronologically coincided with the process of "rediscovery of tradition" and [[Romantic nationalism|national revival]] that captured all of Europe, while the second phase takes place in a period of globalization, vanishing cultural frontiers and aggressive international forms of [[mass culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Kasianov, Terr, p. 7,"... unlike the previous stage, that coincided with general European phenomenon of "invention of tradition" and the development of the nations, the present stage is unfolding in the era of globalization, fading the cultural boundaries and large-scale aggression of the international forms of mass culture."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy of nationalization of history ==
=== Nation mythologies, histories and states ===
[[File:Crawfordkalevalahero1.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An ancient Finnish Hero – Illustration from [[Kalevala]]]]
One of the most important consequences of [[publishing|printed]] [[literature|texts]] of nationalized  history was that it provided a basis for [[Romantic nationalism|national revivals]] in the process of creating modern nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The nationalization of history, which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious [[Public speaking|oratory]] than in [[philosophy]], sometimes grew the idea of an ''esprit des peuples'' or ''national spirit'', and, later still, the idea that each nation had a 'mission'. Such ideas did not evolve into groups of associated individuals, but into universal spirits that is said to be able to destroy [[individuals]] and nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Nationalization of history was an important element of national revival and creating new [[nation states]] in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. New nation states and their institutions had the most important role in social process of [[Professionalization and institutionalization of history|the professionalization and institutionalization of history]] that was additionally supporting the process of nationalization of history. The final consequence was that national history regarded the nation-state as the primary unit of historical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Nationalization of history affects all aspects of life, from relationships with other nationalities to [[architecture]]. This is a result of the fact that nationalization of history corresponds with nationalization of nature, and the fact that reservations and hostilities toward other nations accompanied [[nationalism]] from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url        =http://www.doaks.org/publications/doaks_online_publications/Nature/natur010.pdf| title        =Nature and Ideology - Natural Garden Design in the Twentieth Century - The Nationalization of Nature and the Naturalization of the German Nation: "Teutonic" Trends in Early Twentieth-Century, Landscape Design| accessdate        =18 October 2010| author        =Joachim Wolschke-Bulmahn| last        =| first        =| authorlink        =| format        =| work        =| publisher        =Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection, Trustees for Harvard University| location        =| pages        =| doi        =| archiveurl        =https://web.archive.org/web/20101123234924/http://doaks.org/publications/doaks_online_publications/Nature/natur010.pdf| archivedate        =2010-11-23| quote        =The nationalization of history corresponded with a nationalization of nature.

[[Image:Alpine valley.jpg|thumb|right|Alpine valley, like Oldest Dryas]]
The '''Oldest Dryas''' was a climatic period, which occurred during the coldest [[stadial]] after the [[Weichselian]] glaciation in north Europe. In the [[Alps]], the Oldest Dryas corresponds to the [[Gschnitz]] stadial of the [[Würm glaciation]]. The three “Dryas” periods (younger, older, oldest) are named for a marker species, ''[[Dryas octopetala]]'', detected in [[core sample]]s of glacial ice and [[peat bog]]s. The Oldest Dryas corresponds to [[pollen zone]] Ia.

==Dating==
[[Image:Greenland Kangerlussuaq icesheet.jpg|thumb|right|The edge of the ice in Greenland]]
The period was between 16,050-13,050 [[Before Christ|BC]], from Roberts, 1998. A date from [[Kilkeel]], [[Northern Ireland]], extends the start of the period to as early as 17,050 BC. A strong sequence of carbon-14 dates derived from layered material in the Hauterive/Rouges-Terres excavations on the northwest shore of [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]], 1992–1993, places the end of the Oldest Dryas at about 12,700 BC, calibrated. The same date from [[Antarctica]] and the south China sea is 14,600 and 14,700, respectively, and a [[Greenland]] ice core indicates 14,500. David Miles refers to the Oldest Dryas as the last [[Heinrich event]] (H1) and dates it to between 16,500 and 14,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David  |last=Miles  |title=The Tale of the Axe: How the Neolithic Revolution Transformed Britain |authorlink= |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|location = London, UK |year=2016 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-500-05186-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate standard to which all these dates are to be compared is the graph of the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]s, which gives change in isotope concentration on the y-axis, with time on the x-axis. The graph plots many events that are sharply defined, but others are not. The selection of a terminal point is sometimes partially arbitrary.

The end of the Oldest Dryas is sharply defined. The beginning is a long, gently sloping band, probably no earlier than 17,050 BC, but the date might be set later by approximately 1000 years. Data derived from isotope variation of [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]] trapped in [[Greenland]] ice gives a high-resolution date for the end of the oldest Dryas at the sharp temperature rise of 14.67 ky BP.

[[Image:Lac de Neuchatel depuis la Neuchatel (ville suisse) dscn0660.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Neuchatel]]
The complete sequence of late [[Pleistocene]] climatic periods, defined for [[Northern Europe]], are the Oldest Dryas (stadial), the [[Bølling Oscillation|Bölling]] (interstadial), the [[Older Dryas]] (stadial), the [[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] (interstadial), and the [[Younger Dryas]] (stadial). The [[Holocene]] begins immediately afterward. The last three are also [[Blytt-Sernander]] periods.

Sometimes, the Older Dryas is missing, as in the [[Jura Mountains]] of [[France]], or it is negligible in the evidence. In that case, the initial part of the sequence appears to be Oldest Dryas (cold), Bølling-Allerød (warm), Younger Dryas (cold). The Bølling-Allerød corresponds to the [[Windermere]] interstadial in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

Often, however, the apparently-missing Older Dryas is a problem of resolution in the evidence. Some scientists have undertaken high-resolution studies, which combine a variety of climatological methods. They, like the ones conducted on [[Owens Lake|Owens]] and [[Mono Lake|Mono]] Lakes, in [[California]], usually detect the Older Dryas. Even when it is detected, it appears to be no more than a few centuries of slightly-cooler weather on the oxygen isotope ratio graph.

==Flora==
During the Oldest Dryas, Europe was treeless and similar to the Arctic [[tundra]], but much drier and grassier than the modern tundra. It contained shrubs and herbaceous plants such as the following:
:*[[Poaceae]], grasses
:*''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]''
:*''[[Dwarf Birch|Betula nana]]'', dwarf birch
:*''[[Dwarf Willow|Salix retusa]]'', dwarf willow
:*''[[Dryas octopetala]]''
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Grasslands-menggu.jpg|Grassland ([[Inner Mongolia]])
Image:Artemisia_vulgaris_-_Köhler–s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-016.jpg|''Artemisia vulgaris''
Image:Betula nana0.jpg|''Betula nana''
Image:Mountainavens2.jpg|''Dryas octopetala''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fauna==
Species were mainly Arctic but during the Glacial Maximum, the warmer weather species had withdrawn into refugia and began to repopulate Europe in the Oldest Dryas.

The brown bear, ''[[Brown bear|Ursos arctos]]'', was among the first to arrive in the north. Genetic studies indicate North European brown bears came from a refugium in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] of [[Moldavia]]. Other refugia were in [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Greece]].

The bears would not have returned north except in pursuit of food. The tundra must already have been well populated. It is likely that the species hunted by humans at [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]] by the end of the period were present during it. Here are other animals present:

[[Aves]]
:*''[[Black-throated diver|Gavia arctica]]'', black-throated diver
:*''[[Black-necked grebe|Podiceps nigricollis]]'', black-necked grebe
:*''[[Whooper swan|Cygnus cygnus]]'', whooper swan
:*''[[Golden eagle|Aquila chrysaetos]]'', golden eagle
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Gavia arctica1.jpg|''Gavia arctica''
Image:Podiceps nigricollis naumann.jpg|''Podiceps nigricollis''
Image:Cygnus cygnus from zh.JPG|''Cygnus cygnus''
Image:Aquila chrysaetos large drawing.jpg|''Aquila chrysaetos''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The above birds are primarily maritime. They must have fed in the copious glacial waters of the north that were just beginning to be released.

[[Fish]]
:*''[[Burbot|Lota lota]]'', burbot
:*''[[Grayling (species)|Thymallus thymallus]]'', grayling
:*''[[Common Roach|Rutilus rutilus]]'', roach
:*''[[Trout|Salmo trutta]]'', trout
:*''[[Salvelinus]] alpinus'', char
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Tarfala.jpg|Glacial stream
Image:Trüsche Walchensee.jpg|''Lota lota''
Image:Bachforelle Zeichnung.jpg|''Salmo trutta''
Image:Röding, Iduns kokbok.jpg|''Salvelinus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The smaller mammals of the food chain inhabited the herbaceous blanket of the tundra:

[[Cricetidae]]
:*''[[Lemming|Discrotonyx torquatus]]'', collared lemming
:*''[[Vole|Microtus oeconomus]]'', root vole
:*''[[Vole|Microtus arvalis]]'', common vole
:*''[[Vole|Chionmys nivalis]]'', snowy vole

[[Leporidae]]
:*''[[Mountain hare|Lepus timidus]]'', Arctic hare

[[Sciuridae]]
:*''[[Marmot|Marmota marmota]]'', marmot

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:TundraVole23.jpg|''Microtus oeconomus''
Image:Feldmaus Microtus arvalis.jpg|''Microtus arvalis''
Image:Arctic Hare.jpg|''Lepus timidus''
Image:Marmota marmota Alpes1.jpg|''Marmota marmota''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In addition to bears and birds were other predators of the following small animals:

[[Carnivora]]
:*''[[Lynx|Felis lynx]]'', lynx
:*''[[Arctic fox|Alopex lagopus]]'', Arctic fox
:*''[[Wolf|Canis lupus]]'', wolf

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Lynx lynx poing.jpg|Lynx (or Felis) lynx
Image:Alopex lagopus standing on Nizke Island.jpg|''Alopex lagopus''
Image:Canis lupus portrait.jpg|''Canis lupus''
Image:IcelandicHorseInWinter.jpg|Icelandic horse, perhaps like ''Equus ferus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Humans were interested in the large mammals, which included:
:*''[[Reindeer|Rangifer tarandus]]'', reindeer
:*''[[Horse|Equus ferus]]'', wild horse
:*''[[Ibex|Capra ibex]]'', ibex

At some point, the larger mammals arrived: [[hyena]], [[woolly rhinoceros]], [[cave bear]] and [[mammoth]].
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Albino raindeer.jpg|Rangifer tarandus
Image:CapraIbex-1.jpg|Capra ibex
Image:Wooly rhinoceros.jpg|Woolly rhinoceros
Image:Mammouth.png|Mammoth
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Human prehistory==
[[Image:JomonPottery.JPG|thumb|right|Jōmon pottery]]
Human cultures in Europe were Upper [[Palaeolithic]] and belonged to [[Cro-Magnon]] man. [[Neanderthal]]s had long since disappeared by replacement or amalgamation with ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. The [[Magdalenian]] culture of reindeer hunters prevailed in Western Europe. From the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] eastward, the Epigravettian continued the prior [[Gravettian]]. In Japan, the [[Jōmon]] culture had already become sedentary and was producing some food, and possibly grew rice, but it was not at all urban. It was manufacturing the first known pottery.

One of the most remarkable discoveries of the period was the domestic wolf, a distinct breed of ''[[Canis lupus]]'', with smaller teeth. The domestic dog, ''[[Canis familiaris]]'', also has been found. It is thought that the animals helped with the hunting, but they would, by the nature of the hunt, have gradually become adept at herding.

The '''Oral History Society''' promotes the collection, preservation and use of recorded memories of the past.

As well as offering practical advice and support, the Society aims to raise standards in [[oral history]] practices across a range of activities and disciplines.

Through an annual conference, other meetings, a web site and the ''Oral History'' journal the Society encourages individuals to share ideas, experience and good practice.

The Society also provides a voice for oral historians advising and collaborating with national organisations and research councils on oral history

==Origins and history==
The British-based organisation was founded in 1973, with its origins in an informal day conference at the British Institute of Recorded Sound (BIRS) in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;George Ewart Evans, Thea Thompson, Tony Green, Theo Barker and Patrick Saul, ‘The Leicester Conference on the problems of Oral History',  ''Oral History'', Vol. 1, No. 3 (1972), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years support for the Society was drawn from amongst labour and social historians as well as archivists, folklorists, ethnographers and researchers in oral tradition (including the [[School of Scottish Studies]]). By the second half of the 1970s the Society also included feminist historians and others interested in women's history. The ''Oral History'' journal, founded by [[Paul Thompson (oral historian)|Paul Thompson]], has echoed these interests and many more in the articles it has published. Often featuring oral histories of individuals or groups who have been under-represented in historical accounts, from the first edition ''Oral History'' has also provided a forum for oral historians to discuss the methods and challenges involved in the collection, interpretation and dissemination of oral testimonies.

The journal has long maintained a news section that includes reports from community projects as well as a reviews section. This reflects the Society's policy of representing oral historians no matter where they work whether it is in education, community organisations or the media.

==Current activities==
Current activities include providing more than 300 training places each year; supporting over 40 experienced oral historians as locally based Regional Networkers - a point of contact for anyone interested in oral history; offering technical, legal and ethical advice; providing information on the funding of oral history work; and publishing two editions of ''Oral History'' each year. Members also receive a free e-newsletter several times a year with briefings and news items.

==Governance and structures==
A Committee of Trustees meets four times a year. Trustees are responsible for the governance of the Society and are elected at the Society's Annual General Meeting which is held at the Society's annual conference. Officers' positions of the Society include a Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary and Treasurer who are also elected annually.

A key structure of the Society is the Regional Network consisting of oral historians who offer a first point of contact in localities throughout Britain and Northern Ireland. The Trustees' sub-committees reflect the priority areas and include a Nominations Committee, Higher Education Group, Trainers Group and an Archives Sub-Committee. The journal has its own Editorial Committee.

The '''Ottoman decline thesis''' or '''Ottoman decline paradigm''' ({{lang-tr|Osmanlı Gerileme Tezi}}) refers to a now-obsolete&lt;ref name=nodecline&gt;{{cite book |last=Hathaway |first=Jane |title=The Arab Lands under Ottoman Rule, 1516–1800 |publisher=Pearson Education Ltd. |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-582-41899-8 |pages=7–8 |quote=One of the most momentous changes to have occurred in Ottoman studies since the publication of Egypt and the Fertile Crescent [1966] is the deconstruction of the so-called 'Ottoman decline thesis' – that is, the notion that toward the end of the sixteenth century, following the reign of Sultan Suleyman I (1520–66), the empire entered a lengthy decline from which it never truly recovered, despite heroic attempts at westernizing reforms in the nineteenth century.

Despite this dramatic paradigm shift among professional historians, the decline thesis continues to maintain a strong presence in [[popular history]], as well as academic history written by scholars who are not specialists on the Ottoman Empire. In some cases this is due to the continued reliance by non-specialists on outdated and debunked works,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Christine |editor-last=Woodhead |title=The Ottoman World |date=2011 |author=Ehud Toledano |chapter=The Arabic-speaking world in the Ottoman period: A socio-political analysis |pages=457 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-44492-7 |quote=In the scholarly literature produced by Ottomanists since the mid-1970s, the hitherto prevailing view of Ottoman decline has been effectively debunked.

Historians in adjacent fields have tended to rely on earlier classics and later uninformed surveys which perpetuate older, now deconstructed, views.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in others to certain political interests benefiting from the continued perpetuation of the decline narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Sajdi refers on the one hand to nationalists in post-Ottoman regions of the world, and on the other, to the supporters of imperialistic intervention in the Middle East among some politicians in the West. {{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=38-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the Decline Thesis ==
[[File:Semailname 47b.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleiman I]], whose reign was seen as constituting a golden age.]]

=== In the Ottoman Empire ===
The idea of decline first emerged among the Ottomans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning much earlier, but greatly expanding during the seventeenth century, was the literary genre of [[Nasîhat|nasihatname]], or "Advice for Kings."&lt;ref&gt;Howard, "Genre and Myth," pp. 137–139.&lt;/ref&gt; This genre had a long history, appearing in earlier Muslim empires such as those of the [[Seljuks]] and [[Abbasids]]. Nasihatname literature was primarily concerned with order and disorder in state and society; it conceptualized the ruler as the embodiment of justice, whose duty it was to ensure that his subjects would receive that justice. This was often expressed through the concept of the Circle of Justice ({{lang-ota|dāʾire-i ʿadlīye|script=Latn}}). In this conception, the provision of justice by the ruler to his subjects would allow those subjects to prosper, strengthening the ruler in turn.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 283–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Should this break down, society would cease to properly function. Thus many Ottomans writing in this genre, such as [[Mustafa Âlî]],&lt;ref&gt;Cornell Fleischer. ''Bureaucrat and Intellectual in the Ottoman Empire: The Historian Mustafa Âli, 1541–1600'', (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; described the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]] as the most perfect manifestation of this system of justice, and put forth the idea that the empire had since declined from that golden standard. These writers viewed the changes which the empire had undergone as an inherently negative corruption of an idealized Suleimanic past. However, it is now recognized that rather than simply describing objective reality, they were often utilizing the genre of decline to voice their own personal complaints. For instance, Mustafa Âli's belief that the empire was declining was in large part motivated by frustration at his own failure to achieve promotions and court patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischer, ''Bureaucrat and Intellectual'', 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary goal of the nasihatname writers, then, may have simply been to protect their own personal or class status in a rapidly changing world.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Howard, "Ottoman Historiography and the Literature of 'Decline' of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Century," ''Journal of Asian History'' 22 (1988), pp. 52–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abou-El-Haj, ''Formation of the Modern State'', pp. 20–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Western Europe ===
The notion of an all-encompassing Ottoman decline did not enter Western historiography until the early nineteenth century, with the works of historians such as [[Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall]],&lt;ref&gt;Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, ''Geschichte des Osmanisches Reiches'', (in German) 10 vols. (Budapest: Ca. H. Hartleben, 1827–35).&lt;/ref&gt; who knew [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] and adopted the idea directly from Ottoman nasihatname writers. Internal decline was thus thought of as an appropriate means of explaining the Ottomans' external military defeats, and acted also as a justification for European [[imperialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of a declining Ottoman/Islamic civilization was thus used as a foil for [[Western Civilization]], in which the "decadent" Ottomans were contrasted with the "dynamic" West. Islam (as an all-encompassing civilizational category) often came to be portrayed as the polar opposite of the West, whereby Western societies valued freedom, rationality, and progress while Islam valued servility, superstition, and stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=62-3 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions were perpetuated in the mid-twentieth century above all by the works of [[H.A.R. Gibb]] and Harold Bowen, and [[Bernard Lewis]], who adhered to a civilizational conception of Islamic decline while modifying it with the new sociological paradigm of [[Modernization Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=104-12, 130-3 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These views came under increasing criticism as historians began to reexamine their own fundamental assumptions about Ottoman and Islamic history, particularly after the publication of [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, "Ottoman Advice for Kings," pp. 143–44; Edward Said, ''Orientalism'', (New York: Pantheon, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The thesis' tenets ==
[[File:Bernard Lewis in 2012 (1).JPG|thumb|[[Bernard Lewis]], one of the decline thesis' most famous proponents.]]

The most prominent writer on Ottoman decline was the historian [[Bernard Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that the Ottoman Empire experienced all-encompassing decline affecting government, society and civilization. He laid out his views in the 1958 article, "Some Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire,"&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, "Some Reflections on the Decline of the Ottoman Empire," ''Studia Islamica'' 1 (1958) 111–127.&lt;/ref&gt; which developed into the mainstream opinion of [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] scholars of the mid-twentieth century. However, the article is now highly criticized and no longer considered accurate by modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire'', 242n.
* Hathaway, "Problems of Periodization."
* Darling, "Another Look at Periodization."
* Quataert, "Ottoman History Writing."
* Suraiya Faroqhi, ''Approaching Ottoman History: An Introduction to the Sources'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999) 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis' views were as follows:

The first ten sultans of the Ottoman Empire (from [[Osman I]] to [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]) were of excellent personal quality, while those who came after Suleiman were without exception "incompetents, degenerates, and misfits," a result of the [[Kafes]] system of succession, whereby dynastic princes no longer gained experience in provincial government before coming to the throne. Faulty leadership at the top led to decay in all branches of government: the bureaucracy ceased to function effectively, and the quality of their records worsened. The Ottoman military lost its strength and began to experience defeats on the battlefield. They ceased to keep up with the advances of European military science, and consequently suffered territorial losses. As the Ottoman state and society was geared towards constant expansion, their sudden failure to achieve new conquests left the empire unable to adapt to its new relationship with Europe.

Economically, the empire was undermined by the discovery of the [[New World]] and the subsequent shift in the economic balance between the Mediterranean and Atlantic Europe, as well as the voyages of discovery which brought Europeans to India, and led to a decline in the volume of trade passing through Ottoman ports. In addition, the [[Price Revolution]] led to the destabilization of Ottoman coinage and a severe fiscal crisis, which proved disastrous when paired with the rapidly rising costs of warfare. As the cavalry army of the Ottomans became obsolete, the [[Timar]] System of land tenure which had sustained it fell into obsolescence, while the corrupt bureaucracy was unable to replace it with a functional alternative. Instead, tax-farming was introduced, leading to corruption and oppression of the peasantry, and agricultural decline. Ottoman economic and military backwardness was extenuated by their closed-mindedness and unwillingness to adopt European innovations, as well as an increasing disdain for practical science. Ultimately, the Ottoman Empire "reverted to a medieval state, with a medieval mentality and a medieval economy – but with the added burden of a bureaucracy and a standing army which no medieval state had ever had to bear."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, "Some Reflections," pp. 112–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Significantly, explanations of Ottoman decline were not limited to the empire's geopolitical position among world empires or to its military strength. The decline thesis was rooted in the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century conception of distinct "civilizations" as units of historical analysis, and thus explained Ottoman weakness with reference not only to its geopolitics but also defined it in social, economic, cultural, and moral terms. This all-encompassing notion of the decline of Ottoman (and more widely, Islamic) civilization became the framework within which Ottoman history from the sixteenth century onward was understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=4-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the Decline Thesis ==
===Conceptual issues===
Dana Sajdi, in an article summarizing the critiques of the decline thesis written since the 1970s, identifies the following as the main points that scholars have demonstrated: "1. The changing nature and adaptability of Ottoman state and society; 2. indigenous or internal social, economic, and/or intellectual processes displaying signs of modernity prior to the advent of the West; 3. the comparability of Ottoman state and society with their counterparts in the world in the same period; and 4. a logic, or a framework, alternative to decline and the Eurocentrism implied therein, that takes into account the phenomena of the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two points pertain to the decline thesis' depiction of Ottoman state and society as being backward-looking, static, and essentially incapable of innovation prior to the 'impact of the West'; the third concerns the degree to which the Ottoman Empire was taken to be totally unique, operating according to its own rules and internal logic, rather than being integrated into a wider comparative framework of world history; while the fourth addresses the degree to which the decline thesis overlooked the local processes actually occurring in the Ottoman Empire during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in favor of emphasis on the grand narrative of Ottoman decay and European superiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with these points, a common criticism of the decline thesis is that it is teleological: that is to say that it presents all of Ottoman history as the story of the rise and fall of the empire, causing earlier historians to over-emphasize the empire's troubles and under-emphasize its strengths. According to Linda Darling, "because we know that eventually the Ottomans became a weaker power and finally disappeared, every earlier difficulty they experienced becomes a "seed of decline," and Ottoman successes and sources of strength vanish from the record."&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; The corollary of decline is the notion that the empire had earlier reached a peak, and this too has been problematized. The reign of Suleiman the Magnificent had been seen as a golden age to which all of the rest of the empire's history was to be compared. Such comparisons caused earlier researchers to see transformation and change as inherently negative, as the empire shifted away from the established norms of Suleiman's romanticized and idealized age. According to Jane Hathaway, this focus on the "golden age" had a distorting effect on its history: "a massive empire that lasted for over six centuries cannot have had an ideal moment and an ideal permutation by which the entire chronological and geographical span of the empire can be judged."&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, "Problems of Periodization," 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, modern scholars take change to be a natural result of the empire's adaptation to the world around it, a sign of innovativeness and flexibility rather than decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Christine |editor-last=Woodhead |title=The Ottoman World |date=2011 |author=Ehud Toledano |chapter=The Arabic-speaking world in the Ottoman period: A socio-political analysis |pages=457 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-44492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political ===
In reexamining the notion of political decline in the Ottoman Empire, historians first examined the [[Nasîhat|nasihatname]] texts which had formed the backbone of the decline thesis. Many scholars, among them most notably Douglas Howard&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Howard, "Ottoman Historiography," pp. 52–77.&lt;/ref&gt; and Rifa'at Ali Abou-El-Haj,&lt;ref&gt;Abou-El-Haj, ''Formation of the Modern State'', pp. 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that these Ottoman writers' critiques of contemporary society were not uninfluenced by their own biases, and criticized earlier historians for taking them at face value without any critical analysis. Furthermore, "complaint about the times" was in fact a literary trope in Ottoman society, and also existed during the period of the so-called "golden age" of Suleiman the Magnificent.&lt;ref&gt;Cemal Kafadar, "The Myth of the Golden Age: Ottoman Historical Consciousness in the post-Süleymanic Era," in ''Süleyman the Second [sic] and His Time'', eds. Halil İnalcık and Cemal Kafadar (Istanbul: ISIS Press, 1993), pp. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; For Ottoman writers, "decline" was a trope which allowed them to pass judgement on the contemporary state and society, rather than a description of objective reality. Thus, these works should not be taken as evidence of actual Ottoman decline.&lt;ref&gt;Rhoads Murphey, "The Veliyüddin Telhis: Notes on the Sources and Interrelations between Koçu Bey and Contemporary Writers of Advice to Kings," ''Belleten'' 43 (1979), pp. 547–571.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pál Fodor, "State and Society, Crisis and Reform, in a 15th–17th Century Ottoman Mirror for Princes," ''Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae'' 40 (1986), pp. 217–240.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tropes of political decline, such as the notion that the sultans ruling after the time of Suleiman I were less competent rulers, have also been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Metin Kunt, "Introduction to Part I," 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The reigns of such figures as [[Ahmed I]],&lt;ref&gt;Börekçi, "Factions and Favorites."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Osman II]],&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire.''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mehmed IV]]&lt;ref&gt;Marc Baer, ''Honored by the Glory of Islam: Conversion and Conquest in Ottoman Europe'', (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; (among others) have been re-examined in the context of the conditions of their own respective eras, rather than by inappropriately comparing them with a mythical Suleimanic ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, "Problems of Periodization," 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the very notion of whether Suleiman's reign constituted a golden age in the first place has come into question.&lt;ref name=mythgoldenage&gt;Kafadar, "The Myth of the Golden Age", 37–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaya Şahin, ''Empire and Power in the Reign of Süleyman: Narrating the Sixteenth-Century Ottoman World'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that sultans no longer personally accompanied the army on military campaigns is no longer criticized, but seen as a positive and necessary change resulting from the empire's transformation into a sedentary imperial polity.&lt;ref&gt;Hakan T. Karateke, "On the Tranquility and Repose of the Sultan," in Christine Woodhead eds. ''The Ottoman World'', (Routledge, 2011), 116.
* Leslie Peirce, ''The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire'', (Oxford University Press: 1993), 185.&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie Peirce's research on the political role of women in the Ottoman dynasty has demonstrated the inaccuracy of the assumption that the so-called [[Sultanate of Women]], in which female members of the dynasty exercised an unusually high degree of power, was in some way either a cause or a symptom of imperial weakness. On the contrary, Ottoman [[Valide Sultan]]s, princesses, and concubines were successfully able to fortify dynastic rule during periods of instability, and played an important role in dynastic legitimization.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, ''The Imperial Harem'', pp. 267–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the importance of the rapidly expanding bureaucracy is now particularly emphasized as a source of stability and strength for the empire during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, drawing particularly upon the work of Linda Darling.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 200–306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, ''The Arab Lands'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; Based largely on the work of Ariel Salzmann, the empowerment of regional notables in the eighteenth century has been reinterpreted as an effective form of government, rather than a sign of decline.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Quataert, "Ottoman History Writing", 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salzmann |first=Ariel |title=An Ancien Régime Revisited: "Privatization" and Political Economy in the Eighteenth-Century Ottoman Empire |journal=Politics &amp; Society |date=1993 |volume=21 |pages=393–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
One of the most enduring claims of the decline thesis was that of the weakness of the Ottoman military in the post-Suleimanic period. Supposedly, the once-feared [[Janissary]] Corps became corrupted as they increasingly earned privileges for themselves, gaining the right to marry, sire children, and enroll those children into the corps. Rather than maintaining strict military discipline, they began to take up professions as merchants and shopkeepers in order to supplement their income, thus losing their military edge. However, it is now understood that janissary participation in the economy was not limited to the post-Suleimanic period. Janissaries were engaging in commerce as early as the fifteenth century, without any apparent impact on their military discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Cemal Kafadar, "On the Purity and Corruption of the Janissaries," ''Turkish Studies Association Bulletin'' 15 (1991): 273–280.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, far from becoming militarily ineffective, the Janissaries continued to remain one of the most innovative forces in Europe, introducing the tactic of [[volley fire]] alongside and perhaps even earlier than most European armies.&lt;ref&gt;Günhan Börekçi, "A Contribution to the Military Revolution Debate: The Janissaries' Use of Volley Fire During the Long Ottoman-Habsburg War of 1593–1606 and the Problem of Origins." ''Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae'' 59 (2006): 407–438.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even greater attention has been given to the changes experienced by the [[Timar]] System during this era. The breakdown of the Timar System is now seen not as a result of incompetent administration, but as a conscious policy meant to help the empire adapt to the increasingly monetized economy of the late sixteenth century. Thus, far from being a symptom of decline, this was part of a process of military and fiscal modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire'', pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metin Kunt, ''The Sultan's Servants: The Transformation of Ottoman Provincial Government, 1550–1650'', (New York: Columbia University Press, 1983) 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ariel Salzmann, "The Old Regime and the Ottoman Middle East," in Christine Woodhead eds. ''The Ottoman World'', (Routledge, 2011), 412.&lt;/ref&gt; The army of cavalry which the Timar System had produced was becoming increasingly obsolete by the seventeenth century, and this transformation allowed the Ottomans to instead raise large armies of musket-wielding infantry, thereby maintaining their military competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Halil İnalcık, "Military and Fiscal Transformation in the Ottoman Empire, 1600–1700," ''Archivum Ottomanicum'' 6 (1980): 283–337.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1690s, the proportion of infantry in the Ottoman army had increased to 50–60 percent, equivalent to their Habsburg rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Ágoston, "Firearms and Military Adaptation: The Ottomans and the European Military Revolution, 1450–1800". ''Journal of World History.' 25 (2014): 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of armament production and weapons technology, the Ottomans remained roughly equivalent with their European rivals throughout most of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Grant, "Rethinking the Ottoman "Decline": Military Technology Diffusion in the Ottoman Empire, Fifteenth to Eighteenth Centuries." ''Journal of World History'' 10 (1999): 179–201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Ágoston, "Ottoman Artillery and European Military Technology in the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Centuries," ''Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae'' 47/1–2 (1994): 15–48.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory that Ottoman cannon foundries neglected mobile field guns by producing oversized siege cannon at a disproportionate rate has been debunked by the military historian Gábor Ágoston.&lt;ref&gt;Gábor Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan: Military Power and the Weapons Industry in the Ottoman Empire'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005) pp. 195–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[Orientalism|Orientalistic]] claim that an inherent conservatism in [[Islam]] prevented the Ottomans from adopting European military innovations, it is now known that the Ottomans were receptive to foreign techniques and inventions, and continued to employ European renegades and technical experts throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, "Military Transformation," pp. 286–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan'', pp. 192–195.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of productive capacity, the Ottomans were even able to surpass their European rivals during the seventeenth century. They maintained full self-sufficiency in [[gunpowder]] production until the late eighteenth century, and with rare and brief exceptions were continually able to produce enough [[cannon]] and [[muskets]] to supply their whole armed forces as well as surplus stockpiles.&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan'', pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gábor Ágoston and Rhoads Murphey, Ottoman defeats in the [[Great Turkish War|1683–99]] and [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–74)|1768–74]] wars with the [[Habsburg Austria|Habsburgs]] and [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] are best explained by the strain on logistics and communications caused by multi-front warfare rather than Ottoman inferiority in technology and armaments, as such inferiority, insofar as it existed at all, was far less significant than had formerly been believed.&lt;ref&gt;Ágoston, ''Guns for the Sultan'', pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhoads Murphey, ''Ottoman Warfare: 1500–1700'', (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1999), 10.&lt;/ref&gt; It is now believed that the Ottoman military was able to maintain rough parity with its rivals until the 1760s, falling behind as a consequence of a long period of peace on its western front between 1740 and 1768, when the Ottomans missed out on the advances associated with the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aksan |first=Virginia |title=Ottoman Wars, 1700–1860: An Empire Besieged |publisher=Pearson Education Ltd. |date=2007 |pages=130–5 |isbn=978-0-582-30807-7}}

=== Economic and fiscal ===
Early critiques of the decline thesis from an economic standpoint were heavily influenced by new sociological perspectives of [[dependency theory]] and [[world-systems analysis]] as articulated by scholars such as [[Andre Gunder Frank]] and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] in the 1960s and 1970s. These theories provided an influential critique of the prevailing theory of [[modernization theory|modernization]] which was then popular among economists and political analysts, and had been the framework within which Ottoman economic history had been understood, exemplified above all by [[Bernard Lewis]]' 1961 ''The Emergence of Modern Turkey''. Modernization theory held that the underdeveloped world was impoverished because its failure to follow Europe in advancing along a series of distinct stages of development (based on the model provided above all by France and Britain), which were assumed to be uniformly applicable to all societies. Historians seeking to identify the factors which prevented the Ottomans from achieving "modernization" turned to the stereotypes which formed the basis of the decline thesis: an Ottoman penchant for despotism and lethargy which inhibited their entry into the modern world and brought about economic stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=Ottoman History Writing and Changing Attitudes towards the Notion of 'Decline' |journal=History Compass |volume=1 |date=2003 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theory, in contrast, viewed modern-day underdevelopment as the product of the unequal global economic system gradually established by Europeans beginning in the early modern period, and thus saw it as the outcome of a historical process rather than a simple inability to adapt on the part of the non-Western world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=155-9, 169-70 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theory, introduced into Ottoman history by Huri İslamoğlu-İnan and Çağlar Keyder, thus allowed historians to move beyond the concepts which had previously dominated Ottoman economic history, above all the notion of an "Oriental despotism"{{refn|group=n|"Oriental despotism" was a term deployed in [[Marxist]] historical analyses. It was postulated on a vision of Middle Eastern state and society as one in which all power was concentrated in the hands of an absolute ruler, who by controlling all of the land in the empire, prevented the independent emergence of a native bourgeoisie, and thus made capitalism impossible. This concept, or others like it, long served as a foundational principle in the study of the economic history of the Ottoman Empire and of Asian societies more generally, though it was, as noted by Zachary Lockman, "in reality based on crude generalizations and a very faulty understanding of their [Asian societies'] (quite diverse) histories and social structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism |author-last=Lockman |author-first=Zachary |page=83-5 |edition=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |place=Cambridge |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} which supposedly inhibited economic development, and instead to examine the empire in terms of its gradual integration into the periphery of a newly emerging Europe-centered world system. Subsequent provincial studies highlighted the degree to which the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire was undergoing its own capitalist transformation independent of European economic penetration, which in turn facilitated the empire's integration into the world economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=12-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even following the empire's peripheralization, Ottoman manufacturing, long assumed to have collapsed in the face of European competition, is now understood to have grown and even flourished during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, benefiting from the strength of the Ottoman domestic market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=Ottoman History Writing and Changing Attitudes towards the Notion of 'Decline' |journal=History Compass |volume=1 |date=2003 |pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In earlier periods, Ottoman economic and fiscal downturn was associated above all with the catastrophic effects of the [[price revolution]] of the late sixteenth century. However, this economic downturn was not unique to the Ottomans, but was shared by European states as all struggled with the diverse pressures of inflation, demographic shifts, and the escalating costs of warfare. By placing the Ottomans in comparative context with their neighbors, scholars have demonstrated that the multiple crises experienced by the Ottomans in the late sixteenth and early-to-mid seventeenth centuries can be seen as part of a wider European context characterized as the '[[The General Crisis|general crisis of the seventeenth century]]', rather than a sign of uniquely Ottoman decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption that the Ottoman economy was unable to recover from these crises was rooted both in the poor state of the field's knowledge of the Ottoman economy in the later seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and also in how easily it seemed to fit with pre-existing ideas about Ottoman decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=Ottoman History Writing and Changing Attitudes towards the Notion of 'Decline' |journal=History Compass |volume=1 |date=2003 |pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent research demonstrated that, in the words of Şevket Pamuk, the eighteenth century "was in fact a period of recovery for the Ottoman monetary system," indicating that "the old thesis of continuous decline cannot be sustained."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pamuk |first=Şevket |title=A Monetary History of the Ottoman Empire |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |page=xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far from declining, the first half of the eighteenth century was a period of significant expansion and growth for the Ottoman economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Salzmann |first=Ariel |title=An Ancien Régime Revisited: "Privatization" and Political Economy in the Eighteenth-Century Ottoman Empire |journal=Politics &amp; Society |date=1993 |volume=21 |pages=402 }}

Other supposed manifestations of Ottoman economic decline have also been challenged. The establishment by European merchants of new maritime trade routes to India around the [[Cape of Good Hope]], bypassing Ottoman territories, had a far less significant impact on the Ottoman economy than had once been assumed. While earlier scholarship depicted the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] as having established a near-monopoly on the movement of luxury goods, particularly spices, to Europe, in fact the Portuguese were only one of many actors competing in the Indian Ocean commercial arena. Even in the late sixteenth century, Asian merchants utilizing the traditional Red Sea trade routes through Ottoman territory transported four times as many spices as those of Portuguese merchants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Levi |author-first= Scott C. |chapter=Objects in Motion |page=331 |title=A Companion to World History |editor=Douglas Northrop |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and until the early eighteenth century more silver specie continued to be imported into India via the traditional Middle Eastern routes than through the European-dominated Cape route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-last=Prakash |author-first=Om |chapter=Precious-metal Flows into India in the Early Modern Period |editors=Dennis O. Flynn, Arturo Giráldez and Richard von Glahn |title=Global Connections and Monetary History, 1470-1800 |place=Aldershot |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate |page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of revenue which did occur was made up for by the rise in the coffee trade from [[Yemen]] during the seventeenth century which, along with strong commercial ties with India, ensured the continued prosperity of Red Sea trade and of Cairo as a commercial center.&lt;ref&gt;Faroqhi, "Crisis and Change," 507; Jane Hathaway, "The Ottomans and the Yemeni Coffee Trade," ''Oriente Moderno'' 25 (2006): 161–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians such as the above-mentioned [[Bernard Lewis]] once referred to the supposed fall in the quality of the empire's bureaucratic records as an indication of stagnation in the Ottoman administrative apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, "Some Reflections," 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Historians now recognize that no such decline ever occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 299–306.&lt;/ref&gt; This change in record-keeping was attributable not to loss in quality, but to a change in the nature of land assessment, as the empire adjusted to the increasingly monetized economy characteristic of the seventeenth century. The assessment methods in use under [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleiman]] were well-suited to ensuring proper distribution of revenues to the army of [[timariots|feudal cavalry]] that then made up the bulk of Ottoman forces. However, by the turn of the century, the need for cash to raise armies of [[musketeers|musket-wielding infantry]] led the central government to reform its system of land tenure, and to expand the practice of [[tax farming]], which was also a common method of revenue-raising in contemporary Europe. In fact, the seventeenth century was a period of significant expansion in the Ottoman bureaucracy, not contraction or decline.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 81–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ursinus, "The Transformation of the Ottoman Fiscal Regime, c. 1600–1850," in Christine Woodhead eds. ''The Ottoman World'', (Routledge, 2011) 423–434.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tezcan, ''Second Ottoman Empire'', pp. 19–23.&lt;/ref&gt; These changes, contrary to the claims of earlier historians, do not seem to have led to widespread corruption or oppression to a degree greater than that observable among the Ottoman Empire's European contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 246–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans, like other European states, struggled throughout the seventeenth century to meet rapidly rising expenses, but by its end were able to institute reforms which allowed them to enter the eighteenth century with a budget surplus. In the words of Linda Darling, "Ascribing seventeenth-century Ottoman budgetary deficits to the decline of the empire leaves unexplained the cessation of these deficits in the eighteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 21st-century scholarly consensus ==
{{main|Transformation of the Ottoman Empire}}
Having dispensed with the notion of decline, today's historians of the Ottoman Empire most commonly refer to the post-Suleimanic Period, or more widely the period from 1550 to 1700, as one of transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Faroqhi, ''Crisis and Change'', 553.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter Vaughn Findley, "Political culture and the great households", in Suraiya Faroqhi eds., ''The Later Ottoman Empire, 1603–1839'', volume 3 of ''The Cambridge History of Turkey''. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of economic and political crises in defining this period is crucial, but so too is their temporary nature, as the Ottoman state was ultimately able to survive and adapt to a changing world.&lt;ref&gt;Hathaway, ''Arab Lands'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faroqhi, "Crisis and Change," 411–414.&lt;/ref&gt; Also of increasing emphasis is the place of the Ottoman Empire in comparative perspective, particularly with the states of Europe. While the Ottomans struggled with a severe economic and fiscal downturn, so too did their European contemporaries. This period is frequently referred to as that of [[the General Crisis|The General Crisis of the Seventeenth Century]],&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Parker, ''Global Crisis: War, Climate Change &amp; Catastrophe in the Seventeenth Century'', (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the difficulties faced by the Ottoman Empire have been reframed not as unique to them, but as part of a general trend impacting the entire European and Mediterranean region.&lt;ref&gt;Darling, ''Revenue-Raising and Legitimacy'', pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ursinus, "The Transformation of the Ottoman Fiscal Regime," 423.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of [[Ehud R. Toledano|Ehud Toledano]], "In both Europe and the Ottoman empire, these changes transformed states and the ways in which military-administrative elites waged and funded wars. Coping with these enormous challenges and finding the appropriate responses through a sea of socio-economic and political changes is, in fact, the story of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Ottoman history. A remarkable adaptation to new realities, rather than decline and disintegration, was its main feature; it reflects the resourcefulness, pragmatism and flexibility in thought and action of the Ottoman military-administrative elite, rather than their ineptitude or incompetence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Christine |editor-last=Woodhead |title=The Ottoman World |date=2011 |author=Ehud Toledano |chapter=The Arabic-speaking world in the Ottoman period: A socio-political analysis |pages=459 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-44492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, per Dana Sajdi: "Regardless of what one may think of an individual revisionist work, or a particular method or framework, the cumulative effect of the scholarship has demonstrated the empirical and theoretical invalidity of the decline thesis, and offered a portrayal of an internally dynamic Ottoman state and society. It has also established the comparability of the Ottoman empire to other - mainly European - societies and polities, and concomitantly revised the existing scheme of periodization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sajdi|first=Dana |chapter=Decline, its Discontents, and Ottoman Cultural History: By Way of Introduction |title=Ottoman Tulips, Ottoman Coffee: Leisure and Lifestyle in the Eighteenth Century |year=2007 |editor-last=Sajdi |editor-first=Dana |place=London |publisher=I.B. Taurus |pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 21st-century scholarly consensus on the post-Suleimanic period can thus be summarized as follows:

{{Quote|text=Historians of the Ottoman Empire have rejected the narrative of decline in favor of one of crisis and adaptation: after weathering a wretched economic and demographic crisis in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, the Ottoman Empire adjusted its character from that of a military conquest state to that of a territorially more stable, bureaucratic state whose chief concern was no longer conquering new territories but extracting revenue from the territories it already controlled while shoring up its image as the bastion of Sunni Islam. |author=Jane Hathaway, with contributions by Karl K.

'''The Samuel Proctor Oral History Program''' ('''SPOHP''') is the official [[oral history]] program at the [[University of Florida]]. With over 6,500 interviews and more than 150,000 pages of transcribed material, it is one of the premier oral history programs in the United States. SPOHP's mission is "to gather, preserve, and promote living histories of individuals from all walks of life." The program involves staff, undergraduate and graduate students, and community volunteers in its operation.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, [http://oral.history.ufl.edu/about.html "About"], University of Florida, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oral History Association, [http://www.oralhistory.org/2014/09/04/featured-member-spotlight-the-samuel-proctor-oral-history-program-at-the-university-of-florida/ "Featured Member Spotlight: The Samuel Proctor Oral History Program"], November 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==


The program was founded by Dr. [[Samuel Proctor]] in 1967 as the University of Florida Oral History Program. Its original projects were collections centered around [[Florida history]] with the purpose of preserving eyewitness accounts of economic, social, political, religious and intellectual life in [[Florida]] and the [[South]]. Major projects focused on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[African American]], [[military]], and Florida county-specific history. Much of SPOHP's early work was initiated by grants and support from the [[Doris Duke Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/40170355  | year = |author=Kathryn L.

[[File:Dr. Samuel Proctor, with student at the University of Florida Oral History Program in 1980.jpg|thumb|Dr. Samuel Proctor, with a student at the University of Florida Oral History Program in 1980.]]

Dr. Samuel Proctor, the UF Oral History Program's original founder, was a prominent scholar of Florida history and a pioneer in the field of oral history in the United States. Dr. Proctor taught in the History Department at the University of Florida for fifty years, serving as the first official University of Florida Historian and Archivist and holding chairs as Distinguished Service Professor of History and [[Julian C. Yonge]] Professor of History. He was also the Director of the Center for Florida Studies and the History Curator at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, [http://clasnews.clas.ufl.edu/_styles/images/portfolio/newsletters/2005proctormemorial.pdf "Remembering Dr. Samuel Proctor"], University of Florida, October 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Arndorfer, [http://www.gainesville.com/article/20050711/LOCAL/207110320 "'Dean of state history' dies at Gainesville Home"], ''The Gainesville Sun'', July 11, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Dr. Proctor's tenure, the directorship of the program was taken up by Dr. Julian Pleasants, who renamed the program in Proctor's honor and lead the program from 1996 to 2007. The program's current director is Dr. Paul Ortíz. Dr. Ortíz is an associate professor in the History Department and affiliated faculty with the [http://www.latam.ufl.edu/ Center For Latin American Studies] and [http://afam.clas.ufl.edu/ African American Studies Program] who has also served as the President of the [[Oral History Association]].

==Mission==


The Samuel Proctor Oral History Program strives to promote the thousands of oral narratives entrusted in its care, making existing and emerging collections accessible to a wide audience by uploading transcripts of interviews, maintaining digital archives, creating educational podcasts, and organizing public programs and events. SPOHP also produces a newsletter, featuring new research and student work, that is published each semester.

== Recent Grants and Awards ==


Dr. Paul Ortiz and SPOHP will take part in developing UF undergrad courses on '''Intersections of Global Blackness and Latinx Identity''' through an '''2018 Intersections Research-Into-Teaching Grant''' awarded from the Center for the Humanities and the Public Sphere &amp; Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. This Intersections group will emphasize how popular culture, visual arts, and performance reverberate globally through media consumption to (re)produce Black &amp; Latinx cultures.

== Fieldwork Research Trips ==




'''Remembering Refugees in Jacksonville: Oral Histories of Resettled Refugees:''' Our program has been collecting oral histories of resettled refugees in Jacksonville, Florida, in partnership with World Relief Jacksonville. Our project director Seyeon Hwang has spearheaded the project by documenting and recording the personal stories of refugees who have resettled in Jacksonville both recently and over the past decades. Our team is committed to listening to these stories and having them heard by a broader audience through this project. Every story that has been recorded will be permanently stored in the University of Florida archives.


'''The Latino Diaspora in the Americas Project''' seeks to understand the movements of Latinx peoples and their struggles in Gainesville, the United States, and abroad. LDAP covers a wide range of subject matter, including projects on undocumented students, Hispanic alumni, and Christian communities.
This year, the LDAP team worked with the University to create training programs for administration on undocumented students and built a research platform on La Casita and safe spaces for Latinx students on campus. We presented at several conferences including the Southwest Oral History Association and UF's Social Justice Summit. LDAP also expanded its research into the lives of agricultural workers, Hispanic alumni at UF, and Latinx religious communities in Gainesville.


'''The Seahorse Key Marine Lab Oral History Project''' is preserving the faculty, staff, student, and community memory of UF's history on the island. In 1952, the University of Florida established its marine laboratory on Seahorse Key, part of the Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuge.  It was convened by a generous grant by the UF Center for the Humanities and the Public Sphere. Join us at the island's open houses or check out our videos on our YouTube channel to view the work products of this grant in person: an informational display banner and video-recorded oral histories.


'''The Poarch Creek Project''' is in its fourth year of working with the Poarch Band of Creek Indians Office of Archives and Records Management to process archival audio materials in an effort to document their tribal history and federal recognition effort. This collaboration, originating from an oral history project conducted in the 1970s by Dr. Anthony Paredes, focuses on the audiocassette recordings of Judge Hugh Rozelle, an attorney involved in the tribe's federal recognition efforts. Students participate in conducting archival research, transcribing audio materials, and preservation. In addition, this summer will mark the second consecutive trip to Alabama in which students will conduct oral histories with tribal elders in the community to supplement the archival records of the tribe. This project has produced multiple presentations at the Oral History Association's Annual Meeting and hopes to encourage further student research and projects through podcasts and video presentations.

Eddie Tullis is the Treasurer and former Tribal Chairman of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Atmore, Alabama. Tullis has served as Vice President of the National Congress of American Indians, President of United South and Eastern Tribes (USET), and Chairman of the National Advisory Council on Indian Education. Mr. Tullis' interview during our 2017 fieldwork trip to Alabama renews an oral history collaboration that started with the Poarch Band in the 1970s, and supports our collaboration with Dr. Deidra Dees and the Poarch Creek Office of Archives and Records Management on the Hugh Rozelle Collection.


'''Ottoman Greeks in the United States Project:''' In March 2018, the UF Asian Alumni Association (AAA) hosted a weekend of events for both alumni and current students to attend. SPOHP staff collaborated with the AAA to interview alumni and record their presidential panel event. The Asian American History Project will continue to work with the Association of Asian Alumni to fill gaps in the history of Asian students and student organizations at the University of Florida. These stories shed light on immigration experiences, the creation and growth of student groups, various forms of student activism, the creation of multicultural spaces and supports for students, the struggle to keep Asian language programs, and the development of the Asian American Studies minor at UF.


'''The Tidewater Main Street Project''' is dedicated to documenting the traditions, folklore, and history of the rural communities in the tidewater region of Virginia via student fieldwork and community engagement. This year marks the fifth year SPOHP plans on traveling to Virginia to build upon its 200+ oral history collection, which are available online at ufdc.ufl.edu/tmp. In addition, project coordinators Patrick Daglaris and Dr. Jessica Taylor collaborated with the Southern Foodways Alliance in May to conduct interviews focusing on how local foodways define and affect rural communities throughout the tidewater region. This project has produced student video productions and podcasts, presentations for the Oral History Association's Annual Meeting, photo essays, and would not be successful without extensive support and collaboration with several public history organizations in Virginia. Students of the Virginia Tidewater Project brought together the stories of men who fish, crab, oyster, clam, and conch for a livelihood and as a calling in Mathews and Middlesex Counties, Virginia. 


'''The Mississippi Freedom Project (MFP)''' was established in 2008 to give students the opportunity to engage in oral history research that centers on activism and the civil rights movement. The project archive contains more than 200 interviews that tell the stories of activists and organizers in the Mississippi Delta and other parts of the South. In 2014, SPOHP published "I Will Never Forget," an edited volume that was compiled by MFP coordinator Sarah Blanc, to commemorate the project. Each year, SPOHP organizes an MFP panel to share stories and fieldwork experiences from each year's MFP trip. This year's MFP trip is scheduled to begin on July 15th and end on July 22nd. Students on this year's trip will have the opportunity to visit the newly opened Equal Justice Initiative Legacy Museum and Lynching Memorial in Montgomery Alabama. As with all MFP trips, this year's trip will give students the opportunity to meet numerous social activists that have done tremendous work to advance racial equity in this nation.

Ms. Margaret Block was a lifelong civil rights activist, teacher, and friend. Her efforts to organize, agitate, and educate for social justice inspired men and women across the country to work together for freedom in America, including students of the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program's Mississippi Freedom Project, whom she led for many years.

In Summer 2013, UF's [[George A. Smathers Libraries]] approved a mini-grant proposal to transcribe the SPOHP's Mississippi Freedom Project collection. The completion of this project was timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Freedom Summer during the summer of 2014, when SPOHP presented the completed transcripts to veterans of the Mississippi Freedom Summer at their 50th anniversary reunion. This processing project leveraged existing knowledge, resources, and partnerships to promote online access to the Mississippi Freedom Project collection, including the development of a Freedom Summer LibGuide, two new podcasts, and a second phase which involves continuing transcription, Google Optimization of transcripts, and expanded Mississippi Freedom Project content on SPOHP's website.&lt;ref&gt;Bess de Farber, Dr. Paul Ortíz, Jana Ronan, Barbara Hood, [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00019512/00001 Mississippi Freedom Project Interviews to be Available on University of Florida Digital Collections for MLK Celebration, Freedom Summer Anniversary], University of Florida Digital Collections, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collections ==


SPOHP is continuously engaged in active research projects designed to broaden the scope and scale of its collections, using contributions from undergraduate and graduate students as well as trained volunteers. SPOHP's collections house more than 6,500 oral history interviews on hundreds of different topics. The program also transcribes a portion of its interviews, which are available at the [[University of Florida Digital Collections]] online [http://ufdc.ufl.edu/oral Samuel Proctor Oral History Program Digital Collection] archive.&lt;ref&gt;University of Florida Digital Collections, {{cite web|url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/ |title=UFDC Home - All Collection Groups |publisher=Ufdc.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Veterans History Project'''

In 2000, SPOHP was approached by the [[Library of Congress]] to assist in efforts with collecting oral history interviews of World War II veterans. Since that time, SPOHP has been conducting interviews for the Library's [https://www.loc.gov/vets/ Veterans History Project], which is a project of its [[American Folklife Center]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Florida News, {{cite web |url=http://news.ufl.edu/2010/11/08/vet-history/ |title=UF to collaborate with Library of Congress on veterans' oral histories &amp;#124; University of Florida News |publisher=News.ufl.edu |date=2010-11-08 |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205130857/http://news.ufl.edu/2010/11/08/vet-history/ |archivedate=2010-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, {{cite web |url=http://oral.history.ufl.edu/projects/vhp/vhp-mission-and-staff/ |title=SPOHP's Veterans History Project |publisher=Oral.history.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414115331/http://oral.history.ufl.edu/projects/vhp/vhp-mission-and-staff/ |archivedate=2014-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Smith, a longtime SPOHP volunteer, is the project director.

The Veterans History Project obtained 45 new oral histories since June 2017. The highest number continues to be from the WWII era with continued interest from students, volunteers, and the public. Additional interviews came from the Vietnam War, Korean Conflict, and Iraq. In February 2018, a public program was presented in the Ocora of Pugh Hall to commemorate the fifty-year anniversary of the Tet Offensive. A panel of speakers presented to a generous crowd with active discussion following the initial remarks.

Transcription and the finalization of oral histories continues on the entire collection by volunteers and students. Our collaboration with the Library of Congress and Matheson Museum continues.
In September 2016, the UF Oral History Program conducted an interview with the late Marine Veteran Mr. Ernest Sneed in Monticello, Florida. His story is preserved in the SPOHP archives and available in the video below.

SPOHP's [https://web.archive.org/web/20140413162904/http://oral.history.ufl.edu/projects/aahp/aahp-mission/ African American History Project] (AAHP) began in January 2010 with the mission of collecting 400 interviews on local [[African American history]], giving particular attention to narratives on segregation under [[Jim Crow]], as well as [[Racial integration|integration]] and [[Civil Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;University of Florida News, {{cite web |url=http://news.ufl.edu/2010/01/14/provost-grant/ |title=UF awards $150,000 grant to preserve oral histories of local African-Americans &amp;#124; University of Florida News |publisher=News.ufl.edu |date=2010-01-14 |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813170839/http://news.ufl.edu/2010/01/14/provost-grant/ |archivedate=2011-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally conceived as the [[Alachua County]] African American History Project, AAHP quickly expanded into other parts of North and Central Florida, and now contains over 300 interviews with elders, leaders, activists, and other community members. A list of themes in the collection include: pre-integration [[black high schools]] and their contemporary legacies and significance; previously silenced narratives of racially motivated violence and repression; the quotidian socio-economics of providing for families and maintaining communities under Jim Crow; and the conflicted history of the University of Florida's interactions with and influence on local African American communities.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, [http://oral.history.ufl.edu/projects/aahp/aahp-mission/ African American History Project Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413162904/http://oral.history.ufl.edu/projects/aahp/aahp-mission/ |date=2014-04-13 }}, University of Florida, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Ensley, [http://www.tallahassee.com/story/opinion/columnists/ensley/2014/10/28/gerald-ensley-still-making-world-better/18052187/ John Due, still making the world a better place], ''Tallahassee Democrat'', October 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;


'''The Art of Aging Project''' was co-founded by SPOHP and partners in the College of Medicine in September 2017 to advance good communication skills in medical education. As part of the Geriatrics Clerkship rotation for fourth-year MD students, a core goal of the collaboration is to help future clinicians see older adults in their full personhood. Each month, students receive training in the methods of oral history from SPOHP staff and volunteers; interview a narrator who has been recruited through community partners like the Oak Hammock retirement community and the Community Coalition for Older Adults; and present to colleagues a vignette of their interview along with their impressions of the process. Since the project began, 101 students have interviewed 52 narrators. A clip featuring AOAP interview highlights was shared with 2018 College of Medicine graduates. Initial findings from the collaboration were presented at the 2018 International Health Humanities Consortium Conference at Stanford University.


'''The Florida Queer History Project''' presented a symposia session titled, "Queer in the Capitals," joined by South African Fulbrightscholar Mandisa Haarhoff, at the UF Social Justice Summit in January 2018. The presentation shared the panelists' intersectional research from Pride weekend in Washington, D.C. as well as the politics of Pride in South Africa. In March 2018, FQH led a fieldwork trip with UF students to document the March for Our Lives in Orlando, Florida. SPOHP coordinator Robert Baez interviewed organizers with Gays Against Guns, in addition to Pulse shooting survivors Kate Maini, Brian Wood, and Tommy Connelly. FQH coordinator Holland Hall performed in the play, Voices from the March, at several conferences both at UF and at the Southwest Oral History Association Annual Conference at California State, Fullerton. Holland incorporated contemporary queer issues through sharing her personal narrative regarding queer identity in the play. In June 2017 student researchers from the Florida Queer History Project attended Capital Pride, an annual LGBT pride festival held in early June each year in Washington, D.C., as well as the No Justice No Pride protest of Capital Pride and the Equality March for Unity and Pride (EMUP),


'''The Latino Diaspora in the Americas Project''' seeks to understand the movements of Latinx peoples and their struggles in Gainesville, the United States, and abroad. LDAP covers a wide range of subject matter, including projects on undocumented students, Hispanic alumni, and Christian communities.
This year, the LDAP team worked with the University to create training programs for administration on undocumented students and built a research platform on La Casita and safe spaces for Latinx students on campus. We presented at several conferences including the Southwest Oral History Association and UF's Social Justice Summit. LDAP also expanded its research into the lives of agricultural workers, Hispanic alumni at UF, and Latinx religious communities in Gainesville.


'''The History of the Jewish Community in El Salvador''' documents the community-building efforts of Jewish immigrants to El Salvador, some arriving in the 1920s and starting coffee plantations, and many more after fleeing the Nazi occupation during WWII. Many members of the community then left El Salvador in the late 1970s and early 1980s due to the civil war. The collection began in 1981 when Lea Freund, a member of the community, interviewed some of her family members and friends in the parts of South Florida that they had immigrated to. It was then substantially expanded when Jessica Alpert, whose grandmother had lived in the community, received a Fulbright grant to interview community members who were now geographically scattered; she traveled to San Salvador, Miami, Maryland, Israel, and parts of Europe to conduct the interviews and trace out the interconnections of family and heritage in this small and tight-knit community, as well as being able to record voices from the Jewish community's efforts in San Salvador to convert new members so that it is able to carry on into the future. The interviews are primarily in English or Spanish, but variously also contain phrases and statements in French, German, and Hebrew. This year, SPOHP expects to finally complete the transcription of the History of the Jewish Community in El Salvador project, through a collaboration with Dr. Rebecca Jefferson of the UF Judaica Library. 

== Events and Public Programs ==


Since 2018, SPOHP has transcribed and processed a substantial number of oral history interviews within the African American History Project (AAHP). This summer, we are finalizing the transcriptions to be ready for their public unveiling at the inaugural symposium on March 21-23rd, 2019. The symposium, entitled, '''From Segregation to Black Lives Matter''' will feature this collection, which holds over six hundred oral history interviews.

In January, our original play '''Voices from the March''' headlined the 2018 UF Social Justice Summit. We were joined by actors from the UF College of the Arts to present the play, which was collaboratively written by SPOHP staff and Fall 2017 interns and directed by SPOHP visiting scholar, Jeffrey Pufahl. The play combines the experiences of the SPOHP staff who traveled to the presidential inauguration and Women's March on Washington in January 2017, and the perspectives of SPOHP interns who not only shared their personal narratives, but also incorporated archival research to feature interviews the research team collected in D.C. 

SPOHP regularly develops documentaries, podcasts, and other audio selections to highlight interviews in its collections.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, {{cite web|url=http://oral.history.ufl.edu/podcast.html |title=SPOHP Proctor Podcasts |publisher=Oral.history.ufl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wuft.org/news/topics/samuel-proctor-oral-history-program/ |title=Samuel Proctor Oral History Program &amp;#124; WUFT News |publisher=Wuft.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140314183347/http://www.wuft.org/news/topics/samuel-proctor-oral-history-program/ |archivedate=2014-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; SPOHP's archives also contains a variety of different sound files, including University of Florida speeches, videotapes of television interviews, Native American slides and photos, and recordings of music.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Proctor Oral History Program, [http://oral.history.ufl.edu/about.html About], University of Florida, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oral History and Academic Study at UF==


SPOHP promotes the craft and intellectual traditions of oral history through university seminars, classes, and community-based workshops. SPOHP offers an internship class for 12-16 undergraduate students each semester, involving training in oral history practices and fieldwork experience, and also operates a program for volunteers on a rotating semester basis. The program consults on an ongoing basis with local historians, civic leaders, and educators across the country interested in initiating oral history projects in their towns and municipalities.

'''Intro to Oral History:''' This Summer B Semester Ph.D. Candidate Matt Simmons is teaching the Introduction to Oral History seminar. This course explores Florida's unique agricultural history, focusing on the experiences of farmworkers in Florida's fields. The class will interview current and former Latinx and African American Florida farmworkers through a partnership with the Farmworkers’ Association of Florida (FWAF), an organization which advocates on behalf of agricultural workers in central Florida. Conducting these oral history interviews will give students the opportunity to interrogate the lived experiences of these men and women and to better understand what it means to be a worker in the agricultural industry and to understand the intersection of class, race/ethnicity, and gender in this work environment. Through these interviews students will have the opportunity to also explore issues of environmental sustainability and the impact of pesticides and genetically modified crops on humans and the environment.

'''Trinidad Study Abroad Program:''' In the summer of 2017, SPOHP staff members traveled to the University of the West Indies St. Augustine in Trinidad to lay the groundwork for a study abroad program that incorporates guest lectures, oral history interviews, collaboration with local institutions, and excursions to heritage sites around the country. They met with professors, archivists, and other stakeholders to build the network of contacts necessary for successful oral history fieldwork. Students in the UF in Trinidad and Tobago 2019 program will have the opportunity to participate in Emancipation Day celebrations and interview the leaders who helped Emancipation Day become an official holiday in Trinidad. These interviews will not only become part of archives at UF, but will also be shared with the libraries at the University of the West Indies St. Augustine and the National Archives of Trinidad and Tobago. In addition to planning immersive student experiences, SPOHP staff are committed to finding ways to make the program accessible to as many students as possible.

'''Oral History Internship:''' SPOHP started recording interviews with people involved in the punk scene, prioritizing the voices of women, people of color, and queer punks who have always been part of the scene but are not always visible in popular representations of it. We are also making an effort not only to interview band members, but also general show-goers, zine makers, venue operators, and anyone else willing to share some of their experiences. This fall, our internship will add to and further process this collection, and also start creating things like podcasts and zines to share these stories and shed more light on how people can successfully create spaces of creative resistance, and what kinds of potential they offer for inclusivity and empowerment.

'''BA/MA 4+1 Combined Degree Program:''' In October 2013, the UF [http://history.ufl.edu/ History Department] announced a new [http://history.ufl.edu/undergraduate-studies/41-program/oral-history/ combined Bachelor's and Master's Degree Program] in oral history. The program, open to students working in any field of modern history, is designed to train students in oral history practice to make history accessible to a broad audience and connect scholars and departments to their local communities. The track opened to students in Spring 2014.&lt;ref&gt;History Department, [http://history.ufl.edu/undergraduate-studies/41-program/oral-history/ 4+1 Program in Oral History], University of Florida, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach the Elder - The Close of the Silver Age (?) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''The Close of the Silver Age'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], c. 1527-35]]
A '''silver age''' is a name often given to a particular period within a history coming after a historical [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] whereby the Silver Age is a replication, being similarly prestigious and eventful but less so than the prior Golden Age. In many cultures the metal [[silver]] is generally valuable but less so than [[gold]].

==Greek myth==
The original silver age (Αργυρόν Γένος) was the second of the five "[[Ages of Man]]" described by the ancient poet [[Hesiod]] in his poem ''[[Works and Days]]'', following the [[Golden age]] and preceding the Bronze Age. These people lived for one hundred years as children without growing up, then suddenly aged and died. [[Zeus]] destroyed these people because of their impiety, in the [[Ogygian Deluge]].

After [[Cronus|Kronos]] was exiled, the world was ruled by Zeus. As a result of Pandora releasing the evils upon the world, a second generation of men and the age was called silver because the race of man was less noble than the race of the Golden Age.

In the silver age Zeus reduced the spring, and reconstructed the year into four seasons, so that men for the first time sought the shelter of houses and had to labor to supply their food.

The first seeds of grain were placed in the ground since now man had to gather their own food. A child grew up at his mother's side a hundred years, but adulthood lasted a short time. Being less noble than the Golden Age, humanity could not keep from fighting with one another, nor would they properly honor and or serve the immortals. The actions of the second generation infuriated Zeus, so in punishment he destroyed them.

==Other silver ages==
The term has been applied to a number of other periods following a "Golden Age", including:

* The [[Silver Age of Latin literature]]
* The [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the 2000 DC Comics series ''[[Silver Age (DC Comics)|Silver Age]]'' was named after the period
* The [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry]]
* The [[Silver age of alpinism|Silver Age of Alpinism]]
* The [[Treta Yuga]] of Vedic philosophy of the ages.

{{More citations needed|date=May 2011}}
The ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[science fiction]] [[media franchise]] is acknowledged to have been inspired by many sources. These include southern and eastern Asian religions, [[Qigong]], [[philosophy]], [[classical mythology]], [[History of Rome|Roman history]], [[Zoroastrianism]], parts of the [[Abrahamic religions]], [[Confucianism]], [[Shintō]] and [[Taoism]], and countless cinematic precursors. Creator [[George Lucas]] stated "Most of the spiritual reality in the movie[s] is based on a synthesis of all religions. A synthesis through history; the way man has perceived the unknown and the great mystery and tried to deal with that or dealing with it".&lt;ref&gt;[[Science of Star Wars (miniseries)|Science of Star Wars]] (2005 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also speculated that ''Star Wars'' also takes inspirations from pre-Roman [[Celtic mythology|Celtic folklore]] ([[Arthurian legends]] are post-Roman, set around the third century AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/weird-and-wonderful/celtic-myths-tales-might-have-inspired-star-wars-and-harry-potter|title=Celtic myths: the tales that might have inspired ''Star Wars'' and ''Harry Potter''|work=History Extra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucas has also said that [[chivalry]], [[knighthood]], [[paladin]]ism and related institutions in [[Feudalism|feudal societies]] inspired some concepts in the ''Star Wars'' movies, most notably the [[Jedi|Jedi Knights]]. The work of the mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]], especially his book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', directly influenced Lucas,&lt;ref name="Dreams"&gt;{{cite AV media |title=Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy |date=2004 |medium=documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is what drove him to create the "modern myth" of ''Star Wars''. The natural flow of energy known as [[the Force]] is believed to have originated from the concept of ''[[qi|qi/chi/ki]]'', "the all-pervading vital energy of the universe".

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of ''Star Wars'', [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] premiered a two-hour event covering the entire ''Star Wars'' saga entitled ''[[Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed]].'' Featuring interviews from the likes of [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Nancy Pelosi]], [[Tom Brokaw]], [[Dan Rather]], [[Peter Jackson]], acclaimed [[scholar]]s and others, the program delved further into the [[Hero]]ic Epic concept and the influences of mythology and other motifs that were important in making ''Star Wars''. Subjects include [[Ancestral sin|sins of the father]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redeeming the father]], [[coming of age]], [[Interstellar travel in fiction|exiting the ordinary world]] and others.

==Similarities and inspirations==
&lt;!--Additional examples without references/citations may be removed. --&gt;

===Film and television===
[[File:Poster - Flash Gordon (Chapter 13, Rocketing to Earth) 03.jpg|thumb|The classic science fiction film serial ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]'' served as an inspiration for ''Star Wars''.]]
* ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]'' includes many elements derived from the 1936 Universal serial ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]''—the original property which George Lucas had sought to license before making the first ''Star Wars'' film—and its sequel, ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]''. The basic plot involving the infiltration of a megalomaniacal outer-space Emperor's fortress by two heroes disguised in uniforms of soldiers of his army is drawn from ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]'', with Luke Skywalker and Han Solo filling the roles of [[Flash Gordon]] and [[Prince Barin]], respectively, and [[Ming the Merciless]] the Emperor. The Emperor's deadly, hostile planet (the [[Death Star]]/[[Mongo (planet)|Mongo]]), a sometimes scantily-clad brunette space Princess whom the hero defends ([[Princess Leia]]/[[Princess Aura]]), a big, strong, hairy, animal-like ally ([[Chewbacca]]/[[Prince Thun]] of the Lion Men), a fearsome monster found underground and/or fought in an arena by the hero (the Rancor/the Gocko or Orangopoid), a city in the sky ruled by someone who originally works with the villains but later joins the heroes ([[Lando Calrissian]] of Cloud City), ray-guns, and dogfighting spaceships were all elements retained from the first Universal Flash Gordon serial. The opening text crawl of Star Wars is in the same style as the text openings of each chapter of the ''Flash Gordon Conquers The Universe'' serial.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
* ''Star Wars'' was also influenced by the [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] created for [[Buck Rogers]], a character appearing in late 1920s pulp magazines, comic strips (1929–67) and later a [[Buck Rogers (serial)|1939 film serial]] and a 1950–51 TV series.&lt;ref name="Dreams"/&gt;
* In an interview, Lucas has specifically cited the fact that he became acquainted with the term ''[[jidaigeki]]'' ("period drama", the Japanese genre of samurai films) while in Japan, and it is widely assumed that he took inspiration for the term [[Jedi]] from this.&lt;ref name="sanctuary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jedisanctuary.org/history.php |title=History of the Jedi &amp; The Jedi Religion |publisher=Jedi Sanctuary |first=Jedi M. |last=Duggan |accessdate=2007-07-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630190015/http://www.jedisanctuary.org/history.php |archivedate=2007-06-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb-trivia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/trivia|title=Trivia for Star Wars (1977)|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="docu"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed |network= [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] |airdate=2007-05-28 |minutes=about 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Akira Kurosawa]] films:
** ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' (1958) {{ndash}} ''A New Hope'' features the exploits of [[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]], whereas the plot of ''The Hidden Fortress'' is told from the point of view of two bickering peasants.  The two peasants, Tahei and Matashichi, are first shown escaping a battle, while C-3PO and R2-D2 are first shown fleeing an attack in ''A New Hope''. Additionally, both films feature a battle-tested General – Rokurota Makabe in ''The Hidden Fortress'' and [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] in ''A New Hope'' – who assist a rebellion led by a princess and engage in a duel with a former rival whom they fought years earlier.  Lucas also features many horizontal [[Wipe (transition)|wipe]] scene transitions in ''Star Wars'', a technique used thoroughly by Kurosawa in his films. Similarly, the Princess trades places with a slave girl in ''The Hidden Fortress'', with the slave girl acting as a decoy for the real Princess. In ''The Phantom Menace'', [[Queen Amidala]] trades places with one of her handmaidens who acts as a decoy.
** ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961) inspired the brawl scene in the Cantina. Its sequel ''[[Sanjuro]]'' (1962) inspired the hiding-under-the-floor trick.&lt;ref name="InspirationsLucas"&gt;{{cite web|last=Robey|first=Tim|title=10 films that influenced Star Wars|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/star-wars/10817059/10-films-that-influenced-Star-Wars.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=May 10, 2014|date=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''[[Dersu Uzala (1975 film)|Dersu Uzala]]'' (1975), just two years before the first ''Star Wars'' movie, there are two scenes that bear a striking resemblance to scenes in ''Star Wars''. The first is the Captain and Dersu looking out over the horizon, seeing both the setting sun and the rising moon at the same time. This is much like when Luke Skywalker stares out on the sky with binary suns in ''A New Hope''. The other scene is when Dersu and the Captain are suddenly caught in a blizzard, and they have to quickly build a shelter to spend the night, to survive the cold. The Captain collapses from the cold and Dersu has to drag and stuff him into the shelter. This is similar to the scene in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' where Han Solo cuts a tauntaun open with Luke's [[lightsaber]] and stuffs the unconscious Luke into it, when they get caught in a blizzard on the snow planet [[Hoth]].
* The costume for Darth Vader was visually inspired by the character "The Lightning" in the [[Republic Pictures]] [[Serial (film)|serial]] ''[[The Fighting Devil Dogs]]''. The Lightning also had an army of white-armored stormtroopers and flew through the sky in a large triangular airship (the "flying wing").
* Darth Vader's need to wear his helmet to breathe recalls the oxygen helmets of the underground-dwelling Muranians in the 1935 Mascot serial ''[[The Phantom Empire]]'', which are required by the caped Thunder Riders to be able to breathe on the surface.
* ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'' features a pod racing action sequence. This entire sequence is inspired by the famous Chariot Race of ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]''. The climactic moment when Sebulba's Pod attaches itself to Anakin's Pod mimicks, almost shot for shot, the climactic moment of the scene in ''Ben Hur'' when Messala accidentally locks wheels with Ben Hur.
* Lucas has also cited [[John Ford]]'s ''[[The Searchers (film)|The Searchers]]'' and [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'' as references for the style—if not the story—used in the films. A more direct homage to ''Lawrence of Arabia'' occurs in ''[[Attack of the Clones]]'', as Padme and Anakin talk while walking around the Theed palace on [[Naboo]]. It was filmed at the Plaza de España in [[Seville, Spain]], which in ''Lawrence of Arabia'' was the site of the British Army headquarters in Cairo, and was shot in the exact manner as the scene in ''Lawrence of Arabia'' where Allenby ([[Jack Hawkins]]) and Dryden ([[Claude Rains]]) discuss whether to give artillery to Lawrence's Arab troops. In the same film, Padme and Anakin also retreat to an estate called Varykino – the name of the Gromeko family estate in ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]''.  (Some{{who|date=May 2011}} also have considered [[Tom Courtenay]]'s Pasha/Strelnikov character from ''Zhivago'' as an inspiration for Anakin/Darth Vader, but the similarities are likely coincidental.) Similarly, the chase sequence with Zam Wesell on Coruscant likely references ''[[Blade Runner]]''; Lucas based many of the Coruscant cityscapes on Los Angeles in 2019. A reference to ''The Searchers'' occurs in ''Star Wars'', when Luke discovers the burning moisture farm, while the Tusken Raiders sequence in ''Attack of the Clones'' recalls the climax of ''The Searchers''. Han's showdown with Greedo in ''Star Wars'' resembles a scene in another John Ford movie, ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''.
* Lucas is also a fan of [[Sergio Leone]]'s film ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', and according to Leone's biographer, [[Christopher Frayling]], he listened to the score from Leone's film while editing ''The Empire Strikes Back''. Many{{who|date=May 2011}} have considered Vader's first appearance in ''A New Hope'' as being an "homage" to the introduction of [[Henry Fonda]]'s villainous Frank in the Leone film.
* The death scene of [[Yoda]] in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' is taken almost shot-for-shot from the death scene of the similarly mystical High Lama in [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (Yoda and the High Lama also both share a diminutive form and odd cadence of speech).
* The attack on the [[Death Star]] in the climax of the film ''A New Hope'' is similar in many respects to the strategy of [[Operation Chastise]] from the 1954 British film, ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]''.  Rebel pilots have to fly through a trench while evading enemy fire and drop a single special weapon at a precise distance from the target to destroy the entire base with a single explosion; if one run fails another run must be made by a different pilot. Some scenes from the ''A New Hope'' climax are similar to those in ''The Dam Busters'' and some of the dialogue is nearly identical in the two films. These scenes are also heavily influenced by the action scenes from the fictional wartime film ''[[633 Squadron]]''. That film's finale shows the squadron's planes flying down a deep [[fjord]] while being fired at along the way by anti-aircraft guns lining its sides. George Lucas has stated in interviews that this sequence inspired the 'trench run' sequence in ''Star Wars''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
* The march on the Jedi Temple sequence in ''Revenge of the Sith'' potentially derives from [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s "[[Potemkin Stairs]]" montage in ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''.&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|title=Movies Star Wars: Episode 3 – Revenge of the Sith|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/reviews/starwars3.html|accessdate=2008-05-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080508031043/http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/reviews/starwars3.html |archivedate = May 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the execution of Order 66, the slaughter of the Jedi and the declaration of the Galactic Empire are reminiscent of the montage of massacres during the christening scene of ''[[The Godfather]]'', a film directed by his friend and mentor [[Francis Ford Coppola]]. They are similar in the christening of one (the baby and the Empire) with the death of a group of others (the other dons and the Separatists).&lt;ref name="Christian"/&gt;
* The [[Maschinenmensch]] – the robot in [[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' – inspired the look of C-3PO, although the Maschinenmensch is a [[gynoid]] whereas C-3PO has masculine programming.
* [[Ray Harryhausen]] used [[stop motion|stop motion animation]] to create a mechanical owl, Bubo, in ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' (1981). Despite Bubo's similarities (Bubo is metallic and expresses by whistling and rotating its head) to the [[droid (Star Wars)|droid]] [[R2-D2]] of the 1977 film ''Star Wars'', Harryhausen claimed Bubo was created before ''Star Wars'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Harryhausen]] and [[Tony Dalton]], ''Ray Harryhausen: An Animated Life'', page 270 (London: [[Aurum Press]] Ltd, 2003) {{ISBN|1-85410-940-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Lucas]] claims he became a fan of ''Star Trek'' when [[Star Trek: The Original Series|the original series]] broadcast in the late 1960s which played an influence on the development of ''Star Wars''.{{clarify|date=December 2015}} He claimed he also visited ''Star Trek'' conventions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trek Nation]] (2010 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lucas used the term ''[[the Force]] '' to "echo" its use by cinematographer [[Roman Kroitor]] in ''[[21-87]]'' (1963), in which Kroitor says, "Many people feel that in the contemplation of nature and in communication with other living things, they become aware of some kind of force, or something, behind this apparent mask which we see in front of us, and they call it God".&lt;ref name="mythologyofsw"&gt;''[[The Mythology of Star Wars]]'' (2000 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lucas had Kroitor's line in mind specifically, Lucas said the underlying sentiment is universal and that "similar phrases have been used extensively by many different people for the last 13,000 years".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2005/05/lucas-2/|title=Life After Darth|last=Silberman|first=Steve|date=May 1, 2005|website=[[Wired (website)|Wired]]|access-date=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

** Spherical, moon-size spaceships. 
** Smaller, spherical, jet-less fighters with accumulators for beamed power.
** [[Spacehounds of IPC]] includes light swords of slicing "blade of flame" and "planes of force" wielded by spherical ships, also attested in melee combat. 
** Smith's [[Lensman series|Lensmen]] have the telepathic powers of the Jedi derived from crystalline lenses mirroring [[Kyber crystals]] in ''Star Wars''.
** In ''[[Triplanetary (novel)|Triplanetary]]'', a "tractor beam" from an artificial planetoid captures another vessel and a damsel in distress adventure ensues.
** Space armor with a general focus on melee combat using space axes.
** Norlaminian worship of "the All-Controlling Force" along with general use of "force" powers throughout.
** A ''Golden Meteor'' is the emblem and insignia of the galactic protectors.
** A galactic trade in drugs which are used as currency: Thionite in Smith, Spice in ''Star Wars''.
** A galactic corps of heroes with telepathic powers. (Note: ''Lensman'' was written 10 years before [[Green Lantern]])
** Benevolent guardians seeking to fight evil.  (Called ''Arisians'' in ''Lensman''; ''Aquillian'' in the second draft script for ''Star Wars''.)
** A dark, unseen enemy seeking galactic domination.  (Called ''Boskone'' in ''Lensman''; ''Bogan'' in the second draft script for ''Star Wars''.)
** Special powers running down through family lines, with twins playing a significant role.
** Epic space battles involving fleets of ships.
** Large-scale weapons including a free-roaming planet-sized fortress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=E.E.|title=Gray Lensman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''sunbeam''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=E.E.|title=Second Stage Lensman}}&lt;/ref&gt; (capable of focusing the sun's rays, similar to Starkiller Base in ''[[The Force Awakens]]'').

* The [[science fiction]] writer [[Isaac Asimov]] stated on several occasions that George Lucas's galaxy-wide [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]] bore a close resemblance to the galaxy depicted in Asimov's [[Foundation Series]]. The greatest differences are that Asimov's Galaxy contains almost no robots and no non-human aliens. Asimov addressed both issues directly in the saga's later volumes, most notably ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' and ''[[Foundation and Earth]]''. Since Asimov's death in 1992, the ''Star Wars'' cinematic universe has gained new Asimov-esque elements: ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'' introduced the planet [[Coruscant]], which bears a close resemblance to Asimov's [[Trantor]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
* The section of ''A New Hope'' in which the heroes are trapped in the belly of the Death Star and must make a daring escape has similarities to ''[[Fellowship of The Ring]]''. The group is unwillingly drawn down an alternative path when they discover the traditional safe route is destroyed by the enemy. The group is attacked by a tentacled monster and pursued by a resident army (Orcs in Tolkien's novel, Stormtroopers in the film). Looking for an exit, the group only manages to escape after the old wizard sacrifices his life to an evil monster (the Balrog in Fellowship, and Darth Vader in ''Star Wars'') to buy the rest time to escape. With his last words he yells at his friends to "fly" ("Run" in modern English) instead of trying to rescue him. There are other similarities between [[The Lord of the Rings]] and the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, including the second entry of each franchise, [[The Two Towers]] and ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' portraying the military advancement of the antagonists. ''[[Return of the King]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' share a similar title, and also similar finale in which the heroes are assisted to victory by an Army they initially did not know existed (The Ewok Army in ''Jedi'', The Army of the Dead in ''King''). The real climactic battle is occurring elsewhere with Luke confronting the Emperor in the Death Star throne room, and in King, Frodo is inside Mount Doom fighting Gollum for the ring.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}
* ''Star Wars'' borrows significantly from [[Arthurian mythology]]; especially with respect to plot and main character development. The life and character development of [[Luke Skywalker]] resembles that of the legendary [[King Arthur]]. Both are orphans who later become heroes in their early adulthood. Both also have mentors who are much older and provide them guidance and/or training. Arthur was mentored by [[Merlin]]; whereas Luke was mentored and trained by [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] prior to continuing his training and mentor-ship with [[Yoda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exampleessays.com/viewpaper/4407.html|title=FREE Luke Skywalker vs. King Arthur Essay|work=exampleessays.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/vi/knight_1192/SW/SW_theories/SWAL.html|title=Star Wars/Arthurian Legend Comparison Tale|work=angelfire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LupackLupack2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alan Lupack|author2=Barbara Tepa Lupack|title=King Arthur in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-k6mg3zM24QC&amp;pg=PA324|year=2001|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-0-85991-630-1|pages=324–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of [[Anakin Skywalker]] as the father of the hero, Luke Skywalker, mirrors that of [[Uther Pendragon]] who is King Arthur's father.

* ''Star Wars'' shares many similarities with [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Dune (franchise)|Dune]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/frank-herberts-epic-dune-series/|title=Frank Herbert's Epic Dune Series|work=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[desert planet]] setting with a moisture-based economy, spice smugglers, obese interstellar antagonists, and a mystical [[mind control]]-using sect with great influence over galactic politics — Herbert himself once enumerated 37 similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/07853-dune-david-lynch-bfi-season|title=The Quietus - Opinion - In Defence Of... - Wild Sting: In Defence Of Dune|work=The Quietus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence was even more distinct in early ''Star Wars'' versions, with Princess Leia guarding a shipment of "aura spice" instead of the Death Star plans. The script for ''[[Jodorowsky's Dune]]'' was circulating in Hollywood at the time of Lucas' early work on ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moongadget.com/origins/dune.html|title=Star Wars Origins - Frank Herbert's Dune|work=moongadget.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/05/20/how-dune-almost-prevented-star-wars-from-ever-being/|title=How ‘Dune’ almost prevented ‘Star Wars’ from ever being|first=Chris|last=Kensler|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/q-a-jodorowskys-dune-explores-690348|title=Q&amp;A: 'Jodorowsky's Dune' Explores the Unmade Space Epic That Paved the Way for 'Star Wars'|first=Chris|last=O'Falt|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There has been a long debate among fans about the influence that [[comic book]] writer [[Jack Kirby]] had on the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kirbymuseum.org/blogs/dynamics/2010/12/18/kirby-lucas-and-campbell/|title=Kirby, Lucas, and Campbell|work=Kirby Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirby's time at [[DC Comics]] between [[Jack Kirby#DC Comics and the Fourth World saga|1971 and 1975]] was defined by his creation of the [[New Gods]] saga. This [[Intergalactic space|intergalactic]] story involved the New God, [[Orion (comics)|Orion]] of the planet [[New Genesis]], being prophesied by the [[Source (comics)|Source]] as the warrior to defeat [[Darkseid]] - the tyrannical ruler of the planet [[Apokolips]], and, by doing so, bring peace to the universe and end the conflict between the two planets. Unknown to Orion was that he was the son of the evil Darkseid. Parallels can thus be drawn between the nature of the relationships between Orion and Darkseid to Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, as well as between the mythical Source and [[the Force]] . According to some accounts, Lucas met comic book writer and editor [[Roy Thomas]] at a dinner in 1972, during which Lucas described the plot of ''Star Wars'', to which Thomas noticed the similarity between this and Kirby's New Gods, which was then already a published series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ro|first=Ronin|title=Tales To Astonish : Jack Kirby, Stan Lee, and the American Comic Book Revolution|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=2004|isbn=1-58234-345-4|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many Chinese fans{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} of the franchise believe the characters and plot of the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy to be directly analogous to [[Jin Yong]]'s [[wuxia]] novel ''[[The Return of the Condor Heroes]]''. Supporting this theory, the mythical concept of the Force bears striking resemblance to the concepts of internal energy and qi, which form a primary element in traditional wuxia literature. Other arguments may include the clothing style in the Star Wars movies being similar to that in early adaptations of Jin Yong's novels, as well as the similarity in the main leads' motivation and relationship.
* Lucas mentioned that he read the American translation of ''[[Perry Rhodan]]'', a [[German science-fiction]] [[pulp novel]] series in the late 1960s and early 1970s and considers the series to be an "inspiration, less strong than Flash Gordon, but it influenced the design of many starships of ''Star Wars''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cKLlUnyG4IQC&amp;pg=PA342 |title=Der deutsche Zukunftsroman 1918-1945: Gattungstypologie und ... - Dina Brandt - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/panorama/aus-aller-welt/science-fiction-serie-aus-rastatt-soll-verfilmt-werden-perry-rhodan-fordert-darth-vader-zum-duell-seite-2/2504942-2.html |title=Science-Fiction-Serie aus Rastatt soll verfilmt werden: Perry Rhodan fordert Darth Vader zum Duell - Seite 2 - Aus aller Welt - Panorama |language=de |publisher=Handelsblatt |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern and early modern history====
The [[Imperial stormtrooper|stormtroopers]] from the movies share a name with the [[Germany|German]] [[stormtrooper]]s. Imperial officers' uniforms also resemble some historical German Army uniforms (see [[Wehrmacht]]) and the political and security officers of the Empire resemble the black clad SS down to the imitation silver death's head insignia on their officer's caps (although the uniforms technically had more basis with the German [[Uhlans]] within the Prussian Empire&lt;ref&gt;http://www.starwars.com/news/from-world-war-to-star-wars-stormtroopers&lt;br /&gt;"The exact cut of the uniforms was certainly familiar, but didn’t rely precisely on the dress of the Second World War. The overall color palette and feel for the Empire was intended to be fascist, but earlier Prussian military uniforms inspired the actual cut of the uniforms designed by John Mollo.  The tunic and pants worn by Imperial officers were based on the uniform of German Uhlans, a division of mounted lancers that predated Nazi Germany. This style of uniform was used through the end of World War I, but was not a hallmark of the Third Reich."&lt;/ref&gt;). World War II terms were used for names in ''Star Wars''; examples include the planets Kessel (a group of [[Kessel (cauldron)|encircled forces]]), Hoth ([[Hermann Hoth]] was a German general who served on the snow laden Eastern Front), and Tatooine ([[Tataouine]] - a province south of Tunis in Tunisia, roughly where Lucas filmed for the planet; Libya was a WWII arena of war).&lt;ref name="christopherklein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/the-real-history-that-inspired-star-wars|title=The Real History That Inspired "Star Wars"|first=Christopher|last=Klein|work=HISTORY.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palpatine being Chancellor before becoming Emperor mirrors [[Adolf Hitler]]'s role as Chancellor before appointing himself Dictator. The [[Great Jedi Purge]] alludes to the events of [[The Holocaust]], the [[Great Purge]], the [[Cultural Revolution]], and the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. In addition, Lucas himself has drawn parallels between Palpatine and his rise to power to historical dictators such as [[Julius Caesar]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and Adolf Hitler. The final medal awarding scene in ''A New Hope'', however, references Leni Riefenstahl's ''Triumph of the Will''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title=Star Wars: Attack of the Clones |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020429/story2.html |publisher=[[TIME Magazine]] |date=2002-04-21 |accessdate=2009-12-13|quote=The people give their democracy to a dictator, whether it's [[Julius Caesar]] or [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] or [[Adolf Hitler]].

Continuing the use of Nazi inspiration for the Empire, [[J. J. Abrams]], the director of ''[[The Force Awakens]]'', has said that the First Order, an Imperial offshoot which serves as the main antagonist of the [[Star Wars sequel trilogy|sequel trilogy]], is also inspired by another aspect of the Nazi regime. Abrams spoke of how several Nazis fled to [[Argentina]] after the war and he claims that the concept for the First Order came from conversations between the scriptwriters about what would have happened if they had started working together again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=45203|title=JJ Abrams Spills Details On Kylo Ren|first=James|last=Dyer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 interview, George Lucas was asked the origins of the name "Darth Vader", and replied: "Darth is a variation of dark. And Vader is a variation of father. So it's basically Dark Father." (Rolling Stone, June 2, 2005). ''Vader'' is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "father" (the Dutch word is instead pronounced "fah-der"), and the [[German language|German]] word for "father" (''Vater'') is similar. However, in the earliest scripts for ''Star Wars'', the name "Darth Vader" was given to a human Imperial general with no apparent relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/george-lucas-and-the-cult-of-darth-vader-20050602|title=George Lucas and the Cult of Darth Vader|work=Rolling Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have noted the strong political analogies in the ''Star Wars'' universe to contemporary American politics. Major analogies include Lucas's opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] being seen in the original trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=O'Connor | first1=Michael | title=What are the Politics of 'Star Wars'? | url=http://www.newsweek.com/does-star-wars-endorse-political-republican-democrat-498365 | date=September 14, 2016 | publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' | accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas even said in 2005 that ''Star Wars'' "was really about the Vietnam War, and that was the period where [[Richard Nixon]] was trying to run for a [second] term, which got me to thinking historically about how do democracies get turned into dictatorships. Because the democracies aren't overthrown; they're given away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-05-18/features/0505180309_1_star-wars-sith-palpatine | title='Star Wars' inadvertently hits too close to U.S.'s role | newspaper=Chicago Tribune | first=Mark | last=Caro | date=May 18, 2005 | accessdate=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim was likewise backed up by the 1973 draft for the first movie, then-called ''The Star Wars'', where Lucas specifically mentioned that the theme involved an independent planet named Aquillae that was compared to North Vietnam, and that the Empire was "America 10 years from now",&lt;ref&gt;Rinzler, J.W., ''The Making of Star Wars'', page 7-8, 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Chris.

Ondaatje, Michael; Knopf (2005). p.70.&lt;br /&gt;"Originally George Lucas was going to direct ('Apocalypse Now'), so it was a project that George and John [Milius] developed for [American] Zoetrope. That was back in 1969. Then when Warner Brothers cancelled the funding for Zoetrope, the project was abandoned for a while. After the success of 'American Graffiti' in 1973, George wanted to revive it, but it was still too hot a topic, the [Vietnam] war was still on, and nobody wanted to finance something like that. So George considered his options: What did he really want to say in 'Apocalypse Now?' The message boiled down to the ability of a small group of people to defeat a gigantic power simply by the force of their convictions. And he decided, All right, if it's politically too hot as a contemporary subject, I'll put the essence of the story in outer space and make it happen in a galaxy long ago and far away. The rebel group were the North Vietnamese, and the Empire was the United States. And if you have 'the force,' no matter how small you are, you can defeat the overwhelmingly big power. 'Star Wars' is George's transubstantiated version of 'Apocalypse Now.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Ian McDiarmid, when recalling something Lucas told him during filming of ''Return of the Jedi'', also implied that the Oval Office, and in particular, Nixon's presidency, played a role in the design of the Emperor's throne room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/nov/07/theatre1|title=Lindesay Irvine talks to Ian McDiarmid|first=Lindesay|last=Irvine|date=7 November 2005|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political themes in ''[[Rogue One]]'' have also been noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Somin | first1=Ilya | title=Rogue One and the Politics of Star Wars | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/12/29/rogue-one-and-the-politics-of-star-wars/ | date=December 29, 2016 | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Doescher | first1=Ian | title=The Empire Is Us: The Politics of ‘Rogue One’ | url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/politics-of-rogue-one-214549 | date=December 26, 2016 | publisher=''[[Politico Magazine]]'' | accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1=Khachatrian | first1=Harry | title=REVIEW: 'Rogue One' Is Far More Conservative Than Liberal | url=http://www.dailywire.com/news/11725/review-star-wars-rogue-one-harry-khachatrian# | date=December 19, 2016 | publisher=''[[The Daily Wire]]'' | accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient and medieval history====
[[File:User-Deevad.png|thumb|330px|A depiction of a science fictional civilization living a [[medieval]] Earth-like existence; a concept that ''Star Wars'' is a major example of.&lt;ref name="Classen2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Albrecht Classen|title=Handbook of Medieval Studies: Terms – Methods – Trends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ez_edSWAQGAC&amp;pg=PA862|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-021558-8|page=862}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
* Ancient and medieval history play amongst the strongest and significant influences on ''Star Wars'' which reflects ancient Earth history in its settings, including [[Architecture of Star Wars|architectural]], social and hierarchical structures (i.e. the existence of monarchies and empires) as well as story lines which reflect ancient and medieval history. The transformation of the [[Old Republic (Star Wars)|Old Republic]] into the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] parallels that of the [[Roman Republic]] which transformed into the [[Roman Empire]] in the same manner of conspiracy and manipulation. Lucas was quoted as saying: "I love history, so while the psychological basis of ''Star Wars'' is mythological, the political and social bases are historical".&lt;ref name="christopherklein"/&gt;
* Author Nick Jamilla explains that unlike mainstream futuristic stories, with ''Star Wars'', George Lucas ties in science fiction with ancient history, comparing the Jedi to the [[Samurai]] and historical European swordsmanship. He also parallels the spiritual aspects of the Jedi to eastern [[monks]] and philosophy.&lt;ref name="Jamilla2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Jamilla|title=Sword Fighting in the Star Wars Universe: Historical Origins, Style and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g23D4YMmdb0C|date=25 June 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5179-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamilla2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nick Jamilla|title=Shimmering Sword: Samurai, Western, and Star Wars Sword Fighting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmNBAAAACAAJ|year=2002|publisher=NBK Pub.|isbn=978-0-9718796-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Star Wars'' reflects ancient history in its planetary settings. For example, the planet [[Coruscant]] imitates [[Ancient Rome]] as the capital of the Old Republic and later the Galactic Empire; whereas [[Tatooine]] imitates the ancient [[Middle East]] (specifically the [[Arabian Peninsula]]) and [[North Africa]] in ancient times as being barren desert and sparsely populated (which it still is today to a certain degree).&lt;ref&gt;The Mythology of Star Wars (2000 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt; Coruscant and [[Naboo]] are also two of many planets in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy exhibit architecture inspired by those of ancient Greece, Rome and other ancient southern/southeastern European societies.&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1997 special edition, 2004 DVD edition)&lt;/ref&gt;
* In his book ''The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy'', author Tom Henthorne argues that 1970s science fiction movies such as the ''Star Wars'' films and ''[[E.T.]]'' bring back neo-medieval themes at young boys with a masculine tone in his view. He argues the knighthood-type plots give a sense of encouragement to young boys and give girls the image of being their prizes or captives waiting to be rescued.&lt;ref&gt;Henthorne, Tom. ''Boys to Men: Medievalism and Masculinity in Star Wars and ET: The Extra-Terrestrial''. The Medieval Hero on Screen: Representations from Beowulf to Buffy (2004): 73-90.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Samurai]] warriors of [[Japan]] are somewhat parallel to the concept of the Jedi as an elite warrior class specialized in combat and swordsmanship techniques charged with protecting their respective societies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Star Wars: Evolution of the Lightsaber Duel]] (2015 documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''term''' is a period of [[wikt:duration|duration]], [[time]] or [[wikt:occurrence|occurrence]], in relation to an [[Phenomenon|event]]. To differentiate an [[Interval (time)|interval]] or duration, common phrases are used to distinguish the observance of [[length]] are near-term or short-term, medium-term or mid-term and long-term.

It is also used as part of a [[calendar]] [[year]], especially one of the three parts of an [[academic term]] and [[employment|working]] year in the [[United Kingdom]]: [[Michaelmas term]], [[Hilary term]] / [[Lent term]] or [[Trinity term]] / [[Easter term]], the equivalent to the [[Academic term#United States|American semester]]. In [[United States|America]] there is a [[United States midterm election|midterm election]] held in the middle of the four-year presidential term, there are also academic [[midterm exam]]s.

In '''[[economics]]''', it is the period required for economic agents to reallocate resources, and generally reestablish [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The actual length of this period, usually numbered in years or decades, varies widely depending on circumstantial context. During the long term, all factors are variable.

In '''[[finance]]''' or financial operations of borrowing and investing, what is considered ''long-term'' is usually above 3 years, with ''medium-term'' usually between 1 and 3 years and ''short-term'' usually under 1 year.  It is also used in some countries to indicate a fixed term investment such as a [[term deposit]].

In law, the term of a [[contract]] is the duration for which it is to remain in effect (not to be confused with the meaning of "term" that denotes any [[contractual term|provision of a contract]]). A [[fixed-term contract]] is one concluded for a pre-defined time.

==Other terms==

'''''The Lost Tomb of Jesus''''' is a [[Documentary film|documentary]] co-produced and first broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Vision TV]] in [[Canada]] on March 4, 2007, covering the discovery of the [[Talpiot Tomb]]. It was directed by Canadian documentary and film maker [[Simcha Jacobovici]] and produced by Felix Golubev and [[Ric Esther Bienstock]], while [[James Cameron]] served as executive producer. (Jacobovici and Cameron had previously created ''[[The Exodus Decoded]]''.)  The film was released in conjunction with a book about the same subject, ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]'', issued in late February 2007 and co-authored by Jacobovici and [[Charles R. Pellegrino]]. The documentary and book's claims are the subject of controversy within the [[archaeologists|archaeological]] and [[theologians|theological]] fields, as well as among linguistic and biblical scholars.

==Content==
The film describes the finding of the Talpiot Tomb during a housing construction project, and posits that it was the family tomb of [[Jesus]]. The film states that ten [[Ossuary|ossuaries]] were found in the cave, of which six are the subject of the film. Further, it claims that one of the ten ossuaries went missing years ago, presumably stolen.

The excavation report for the predecessor of the Israel Antiquities Authority was written by Amos Kloner, now professor of archaeology at Israel's [[Bar-Ilan University]]. Kloner dissociated himself from the claims made in the documentary. He said it was incorrect to call it "never before reported information" and that he had published all the details in the journal ''Antiqot'' in 1996. He had not said it was the tomb of Jesus' family.&lt;ref  name=cnsnews&gt;[http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/jesus-tomb-filmmakers-should-be-ashamed-archeologist-says "'Jesus Tomb' Filmmakers Should Be Ashamed, Archeologist Says"]&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it is very unserious [sic] work. I do scholarly work…," Kloner said. "[This film] is all nonsense."&lt;ref  name=cnsnews/&gt;

Six of the nine remaining ossuaries bear inscriptions. ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' posits that three of those carry the names of figures from the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name="Discovery News"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/02/25/tomb_arc.html?category=archaeology&amp;guid=20070225073000 |title=Jesus Family Tomb Believed Found |last=Viegas |first=Jennifer |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |date=2007-02-25 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307120414/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/02/25/tomb_arc.html?category=archaeology&amp;guid=20070225073000 |archivedate=2007-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meanings of the [[epigraphy|epigraphs]] are disputed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://aramaicdesigns.blogspot.com/search?q=Jesus+son+of+Joseph The Aramaic Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; The makers of the documentary claim that four leading [[epigrapher]]s have corroborated their interpretation of the inscriptions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070228135009.htm The Lost Tomb Of Jesus?

* ''Yeshua bar Yehosef' -- [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] for "Jesus son of Joseph"
* ''Maria''—written in [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic script]], but a [[Latin]] form of the Hebrew name "Miriam" ("Mary")&lt;ref name=goodstein&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/us/27jesus.html?em&amp;ex=1172725200&amp;en=cf806e5e644ad636&amp;ei=5087%0A |title=Crypt Held Bodies of Jesus and Family, Film Says |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Yose''—a diminutive of "Joseph" mentioned (in its Greek form ιωσης "Joses") as the name of one of Jesus's brothers in the New Testament ({{bibleverse||Mark|6:3}})
* ''Yehuda bar Yeshua''—possibly Aramaic for "Judah son of Jesus"
* ''Mariamene e Mara''—according to the filmmakers this is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "Mary known as the master." The similar name "[[Mariamne (name)|Mariamne]]" is found in the [[Acts of Philip]]. Francois Bovon, professor of the history of religion at [[Harvard University]] has said, based on his study of that work, "I do not believe that Mariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene. Mariamne is, besides Maria or Mariam, a possible Greek equivalent, attested by Josephus, Origen, and the Acts of Philip, for the Semitic Myriam."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=656 Letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Matya''—Hebrew for 'Matthew'—''not'' claimed to be [[Matthew the Evangelist]] but "possibly a husband of one of the women in an unmarked ossuary."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; The filmmakers claim that there is evidence that Mary mother of Jesus had many relatives named Matthew.&lt;ref name="goodstein"/&gt;

The film further claims that the tenth ossuary, which went missing years ago, is the [[James Ossuary]] purported to contain the body of [[James the Just|James, the brother of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tomb/explore/explore.html |title=The Lost Tomb of Jesus: Explore the Evidence |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227110330/http://dsc.discovery.com/convergence/tomb/explore/explore.html |archivedate=2007-02-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Jesus Family Tomb]]'', [[Simcha Jacobovici]] claims the [[James Ossuary]] would have been a part of this tomb, but was removed by artifact dealers, and thus discovered separately (citation needed). The James Ossuary's authenticity has been called into question, and [[Oded Golan]], one of its past owners, was charged with fraud in connection to the artifact, but exonerated on all counts of forgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Antiquities collector acquitted of forgery charges in 'James ossuary' case|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/antiquities-collector-acquitted-of-forgery-charges-in-james-ossuary-case/article2368752/|website = The Globe and Mail|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Witherington III]], who worked with Jacobovici on a Discovery Channel documentary on the James Ossuary, denies this connection on two grounds:
*"The James Ossuary, according to the report of the antiquities dealer that [[Oded Golan]] got the ossuary from, said that the ossuary came from [[Silwan]], not Talpiot, and had dirt in it that matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem."
*"Furthermore, [[Eusebius]] reports that the tomb marker for James's burial was close to where James was martyred near the temple mount, indeed near the famous tombs in the [[Kidron Valley]] such as the so-called [[Yad Avshalom|Tomb of Absalom]]. Talpiot is nowhere near this locale."&lt;ref name=witherington&gt;{{cite web |url=http://benwitherington.blogspot.com/2007/02/jesus-tomb-titanic-talpiot-tomb-theory.html |title= The Jesus Tomb? 'Titanic' Talpiot Tomb Theory Sunk from the Start |last=Witherington |first=Ben |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another consideration was that the measurements of the James Ossuary did not match the measurements listed for the tenth ossuary, which is no longer stored with the rest of the collection. The James Ossuary was listed as being approximately 50 centimeters (19.6 inches) long by 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) wide on one end, and 25.5 centimeters (10 inches) on the other end (citation needed). The tenth ossuary in the Talpiot collection is listed as 60 centimeters (23.6 inches) long by 26 centimeters (10.2 inches) by 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) (citation needed). Furthermore, Amos Kloner has stated that the tenth ossuary had no inscription.&lt;ref name=cnsnews/&gt; Also, Joe Zias, former curator of the [[Rockefeller Museum]] who received and catalogued the ossuaries, refuted this claim on his personal site (citation needed).

New information has now shown that the discrepancy in the measurements had to do with measuring the base of the ossuary, which is indeed 50 centimeters (19.6 inches), rather than the length. The top length of the James Ossuary, not the base, which is trapezoidal in shape, according to the latest re-measurement carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority, is 57.5 centimeters (22.6 inches.) (citation needed). While compelling, this does not prove that the James Ossuary is the missing tenth Talpiot ossuary.

==DNA tests==
Analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] performed by [[Lakehead University]] on the remains found in the ossuary marked "Jesus son of Joseph" and the one marked "Mariamne" or "Mary" (who some claim to be Mary Magdalene) found that the two occupants were not blood relations on their mothers' side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/03/arts/television/03stan.html | work=New York Times | title=The Lost Tomb of Jesus | date=2007-03-03 | accessdate=2011-12-07 | first1=Alessandra | last1=Stanley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these tests, the makers of the documentary suggest that "Jesus" and "Mariamne" were probably married "because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb,"&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0301/p13s02-lire.html?page=2 |title=Documentary examines supposed remains of Jesus |last=Goodstein |first=Laurie |publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the remains were not dated using [[Carbon 14|radiocarbon]] to further sustain this supposition, neither was any announced DNA testing done on the others ossuaries to see if any familial relation existed there. Additionally, scholars argue the DNA tests only prove that they did not have the same mother and they could easily have been father/daughter, cousins, half brother/sister, or any number of possibilities that do not include a matrilineage line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=649 Society of Biblical Literature&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The claim that Jesus was married also undermines the theological metaphor of the Church being the [[Bride of Christ (theology)|"Bride of Christ"]] (found in the writings of the New Testament). [[Jimmy Akin]], director of Apologetics and Evangelization at [[Catholic Answers]], wrote: "This image would never have arisen if there was a Mrs. Jesus living right there in Jerusalem…. We know about [the wives of religion founders] because they were honored figures as wives of The Founder, and if Jesus had a wife then (a) we would know about it and (b) the whole Church-as-the-Bride-of-Christ metaphor would never have come into existence." As for a possible "son of Jesus," he noted: "We tend to know about even the daughters of religious founders. Muhammad's daughter Fatima comes to mind. It would be much harder to sneak a forgotten son by the eyes of history…. It's not just hard to sneak sons past because patriarchal cultures focus more on sons; it's also because of this: In traditional societies, the son is looked on as the father's natural successor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jimmyakin.typepad.com/defensor_fidei/2007/03/tomb_of_jesus_n.html |first=Jimmy |last=Akin |title=The Tomb of Jesus Nonsense}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmakers denied that the claims made in the film contradicted key teachings of [[Christianity]], such as the [[Death and resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|ascension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6397373.stm?ls|title=Jesus tomb found, says film-maker|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-03-05 | date=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/theological_considerations/resurrection.html|title=Theological Considerations—The Resurrection|publisher=JesusFamilyTomb.com|accessdate=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's religious consultant [[James Tabor]] stated that the fact that Jesus' tomb was discovered does not put in doubt biblical accounts of his resurrection, which he said could have been spiritual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the ascension, the documentary's website suggests that while the tomb's discovery does not render impossible the notion of a spiritual ascension, it does contradict the belief that Jesus physically ascended to heaven.&lt;ref name="jesusfamilitomb.com-proviso"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/movie_overview/disclaimer.html |title=Proviso |publisher=JesusFamilyTomb.com |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic views===

Finding someone's remains in Jesus' tomb conforms to the Muslim belief that a substitute for him was crucified, while he was raised bodily to heaven. The [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|Islamic view of his disappearance]], as mentioned in the Qur'an, states: ''That they said (in boast), "We killed Al-Masih 'Isa the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah"; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quran.al-islam.com/Targama/dispTargam.asp?l=arb&amp;t=eng&amp;nType=1&amp;nSora=4&amp;nAya=157 Quran 4:157]&lt;/ref&gt; The general Muslim interpretation of the verse is that God, to revenge from Judas' betrayal to Jesus (the fatherless prophet), made his face similar to that of Jesus, while Jesus ascended into heaven and is to return near the end of time and kill the anti-Christ. Accordingly, the discovered remains in his tomb would then actually belong to Judas, a Roman guard, or a volunteering disciple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Reception==

Following the March 4, 2007, airing of ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'' on the Discovery Channel, American journalist [[Ted Koppel]] aired a program entitled ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—A Critical Look'', whose guests included the director [[Simcha Jacobovici]], [[James Tabor]], Chair of the Department of [[Religious Studies]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Charlotte]] who served as a consultant and advisor on the documentary, [[Jonathan Reed]], Professor of Religion at the [[University of LaVerne]] and co-author of ''Excavating Jesus Beneath the Stones, Behind the Text,'' and [[William G. Dever|William Dever]], an archaeologist with over 50 years experience in Middle Eastern archaeological digs.

Alan Cooperman, writer of ''The Washington Post'' article also states this: "Similar assessments came yesterday from two Israeli scholars, [[Amos Kloner]], who originally excavated the tomb, and [[Joe Zias]], former curator of archaeology at the [[Israeli Antiquities Authority]]. Kloner told the [[Jerusalem Post]] that the documentary is "nonsense." Zias described it in an e-mail to ''The Washington Post'' as a "hyped up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest."

Israeli archaeologist Amos Kloner, who was among the first to examine the tomb when it was first discovered, said the names marked on the coffins were very common at the time.
"I don't accept the news that it was used by Jesus or his family," and "The documentary filmmakers are using it to sell their film." he told the BBC News website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6397373.stm ''Jesus tomb found, says film-maker'']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the documentary ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus'', various professionals had claimed:

# concerning the ossuaries marked Yeshua` ("Jesus") and the one believed to be that of Mary Magdalene: because "the DNA did not match, the forensic archaeologist concluded that they must be husband and wife";
# that testing showed that there was a match between the patina on the James and Yeshua` ossuaries and referred to the James ossuary as the "missing link" from the tomb of Yeshua` (Jesus);
# and that an ossuary that became missing from the tomb of Yeshua` had actually been the infamous James ossuary believed to contain the remains of the brother of Yeshua`.

During Ted Koppel's critique, ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—a Critical Look'', Koppel revealed he had denials from these three people that Simcha Jacobovici had misquoted in the documentary.

# Koppel had a written denial from the forensic archaeologist asserting that he had NOT concluded that the remains of Yeshua` and Miriamne showed they were husband and wife. In fact, he had logically stated, "you cannot genetically test for marriage."
# Koppel had a written denial from the [[Suffolk Crime Lab]] Director (Robert Genna) asserting that he had NOT stated the James ossuary patina matched that of the Yeshua` ossuary. He denied ever saying they were a match, and said he'd have to do much more comparison testing of other tombs before he could draw any conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, Charles ''Buried Hope or Risen Savior'' B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4717-0}} p17 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OGwrSciQGvsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22argument+goes+far+beyond+any+reasonable+interpretation%22++dever&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vD_dknXouO&amp;sig=vsVMwz7mWPk8ZMdyz-miq8ldbpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Koppel had a verbal denial from Professor Amos Kloner, the archaeologist who had supervised the initial 1980 dig of the tomb of Yeshua`, with whom he spoke on 3/4/07, asserting that the ossuary that later turned up missing from the alleged Tomb of 'Jesus' could not have been what is now known as the James ossuary. In fact he indicated there was evidence that it was not the same by saying that the now missing ossuary he had seen and photographed and catalogued in 1980 had been totally unmarked, whereas the James ossuary is marked with the name of James and a rosette.

The archaeologist William Dever summed it up when he stated on Koppel's critical analysis, ''The Lost Tomb of Jesus—A Critical Look'', that Jacobovici's and Cameron's "conclusions were already drawn in the beginning" of the inquiry and that their "argument goes far beyond any reasonable interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;Quarles, Charles ''Buried Hope or Risen Savior'' B&amp;H Publishing Group, 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4717-0}} p.16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OGwrSciQGvsC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22argument+goes+far+beyond+any+reasonable+interpretation%22++dever&amp;source=web&amp;ots=vD_dknXouO&amp;sig=vsVMwz7mWPk8ZMdyz-miq8ldbpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological Questions==

===The Three Skulls===

Three skulls were found on the floor of the tomb in 1980 which the film makers assert was usual but others disagree: "This too was decidedly not typical. In ancient Jerusalem, the dead were placed inside tombs; in tombs, the dead were placed inside ossuaries. If anything was left behind, it was a lamp or a bottle of perfume, not skulls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official site quotation about the skulls.''|url=http://www.jesusfamilytomb.com/new_discoveries/the_chevron.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= ''Inside, they found 10 ossuaries and three skulls.''|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/185708 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | first=Stuart | last=Laidlaw | date=2007-02-26 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the documentary==
Early Christianity scholar [[R. Joseph Hoffmann]], chair of the Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, says the film alerts the public to the fact that there are no secure conclusions when it comes to the foundational history of a religious tradition. But he charges that the film "is all about bad assumptions," beginning with the assumption that the boxes contain Jesus of Nazareth and his family. From his view as a historian specializing in the social history of earliest Christianity, he found it "amazing how evidence falls into place when you begin with the conclusion—and a hammer."&lt;ref&gt;"Who is Entombed in the 'Jesus Tomb'?" ''U.S. News,'' March 12, 2007, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed about the upcoming documentary, [[Amos Kloner]], who oversaw the original archaeological dig of this tomb in 1980 said:
:"It makes a great story for a TV film, but it's completely impossible. It's nonsense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/BrentBozellIII/2007/02/28/what_bones_of_jesus |last=Bozell |first=Brent |title=What Bones of Jesus? |publisher=Townhall.com |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302074621/http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BrentBozellIII/2007/02/28/what_bones_of_jesus |archive-date=2007-03-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Newsweek'' reports that the archaeologist who personally numbered the ossuaries dismissed any potential connection:
:"Simcha has no credibility whatsoever," says Joe Zias, who was the curator for anthropology and archeology at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem from 1972 to 1997 and personally numbered the Talpiot ossuaries. "He's pimping off the Bible … He got this guy [[James Cameron|Cameron]], who made ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' or something like that—what does this guy know about archeology? I am an archeologist, but if I were to write a book about brain surgery, you would say, 'Who is this guy?' People want signs and wonders. Projects like these make a mockery of the archeological profession."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17328478/site/newsweek/ Have Researchers Found Jesus Christ's Tomb? - Newsweek Beliefs - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227105907/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17328478/site/newsweek/ |date=2007-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aforementioned Joe Zias has published in his own site a "viewers' guide" to the Talpiot Tomb documentary, in which he systematically rebuts the film's argumentation and gives much background information about the people involved in it.&lt;ref name=zias&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.joezias.com/tomb.html | title=Viewers Guide to Understanding the Talpiot Tomb 'documentary' | work=personal website | author = Joe Zias | date=2007-03-05 | accessdate=2007-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pfann also thinks the inscription read as "Jesus" has been misread and suggests that the name "Hanun" might be a more accurate rendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/story/3894198p-4503665c.html |last=Matthews |first=Karen |title=Jesus tomb claim derided

''The Washington Post'' reports that [[William G. Dever]] (mentioned above as excavating ancient sites in Israel for 50 years) offered the following:
:"I've known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story, because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction."&lt;ref name=cooperman&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/26/AR2007022600442.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025143235/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/26/AR2007022600442.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-10-25 |title='Lost Tomb of Jesus' Claim Called a Stunt |last=Cooperman |first=Alan |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asbury Theological Seminary]]'s [[Ben Witherington III]] points out some other circumstantial problems with linking this tomb to Jesus' family:&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt;
* "So far as we can tell, the earliest followers of Jesus never called Jesus 'son of Joseph'. It was outsiders who mistakenly called him that."
* "The ancestral home of Joseph was Bethlehem, and his adult home was Nazareth. The family was still in Nazareth after he [Joseph] was apparently dead and gone. Why in the world would he be buried (alone at this point) in Jerusalem?"
* "One of the ossuaries has the name Jude son of Jesus. We have no historical evidence of such a son of Jesus, indeed we have no historical evidence he was ever married."
* "The Mary ossuaries (there are two) do not mention anyone from Migdal. It simply has the name Mary—and that's about the most common of all ancient Jewish female names."
* "We have names like Matthew on another ossuary, which don't match up with the list of [Jesus's] brothers' names."

The [[Archaeological Institute of America]], self-described on their website as "North America's oldest and largest organization devoted to the world of archeology," has published online their own criticism of the "Jesus tomb" claim: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"The identification of the Talpiyot tomb as the tomb of Jesus and his family is based on a string of problematic and unsubstantiated claims [...] [It] contradicts the canonical Gospel accounts of the death and burial of Jesus and the earliest Christian traditions about Jesus. This claim is also inconsistent with all of the available information—historical and archaeological—about how Jews in the time of Jesus buried their dead, and specifically the evidence we have about poor, non-Judean families like that of Jesus. It is a sensationalistic claim without any scientific basis or support."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeological.org/webinfo.php?page=10408 AIA News - Has the Tomb of Jesus Been Discovered?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307084558/http://www.archaeological.org/webinfo.php?page=10408 |date=2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===DNA and family evidence===

[[Darrell Bock]], a New Testament scholar and research professor of New Testament studies at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] points out some of the inconsistencies, including: "If Jesus' family came from [[Galilee]], why would they have a family tomb in Jerusalem?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/107 |title=No Need to Yell, Only a Challenge for Some who Need to Step Up and Could (expanded) |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304220146/http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/107 |archivedate=2007-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ben Witherington]] points out an inconsistency related to the [[James Ossuary]]. He points out that the James Ossuary came from [[Silwan]], not [[Talpiot]]. In addition, the James Ossuary had dirt on it that "matched up with the soil in that particular spot in Jerusalem." In his opinion, this is problematic, because "the ossuaries that came out of Talpiot came out of a rock cave from a different place, and without such soil in it." Therefore, he believes that it is difficult to believe that the one known family member of Jesus was buried separately and far away from Jesus' family.&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt;

In addition, during the trial of antiquities dealer Oded Golan there has been testimony from former [[FBI]] agent Gerald Richard that a photo of the James ossuary, showing it in Golan's home, was taken in the 1970s, based on tests done by the FBI photo lab. This would make it impossible for the James Ossuary to have been discovered with the rest of the Talpiot ossuaries in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="laidlaw"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/article/185708 |title=Jesus tomb claim sparks furor |last=Laidlaw |first=Stuart |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date=2007-02-26 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With reference to the DNA tests, Witherington wrote in his blog: "[T]he most the DNA evidence can show is that several of these folks are interrelated…. We would need an independent control sample from some member of Jesus' family to confirm that these were members of Jesus' family. We do not have that at all."&lt;ref name=witherington /&gt; This quote clarifies the fact that the documentarians do not believe they have tested the DNA and have proven it to be Jesus. They simply used DNA testing to prove that the "Jesus son of Joseph" and the "Mariamne" in this tomb were not maternally related (i.e. that they did not have the same mother or grandmother). The film asserted that this DNA evidence suggests they were probably spouses. Critics contend they could have been paternally related (e.g. father and daughter, or grandfather and granddaughter), or related by someone else's marriage. Mariamne could just as well have been the wife of one of the other two males in the ossuary.

''[[The New York Times]]'' article of February 27, 2007, ([http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/ZNYT02/702270730/-1/ZNYT reprinted in full on many websites)] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The documentary's director and its driving force, Simcha Jacobovici…, said there was enough mitochondrial DNA for a laboratory in Ontario to conclude that the bodies in the "Jesus" and "Mary Magdalene" ossuaries were not related on their mothers' side. From this, Mr. Jacobovici deduced that they were a couple, because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb. In an interview, Mr. Jacobovici was asked why the filmmakers did not conduct DNA testing on the other ossuaries to determine whether the one inscribed Judah, son of Jesus was genetically related to either the Jesus or Mary Magdalene boxes; or whether the Jesus remains were actually the offspring of Mary. "We're not scientists. At the end of the day we can't wait till every ossuary is tested for DNA," he said. "We took the story that far. At some point you have to say, I've done my job as a journalist."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the televised debate following the airing of the film, Ted Koppel pressed Jacobovici on the same question and received the same response. According to the authors of one [http://jesus-crypt-fraud.blogspot.com/ blog], "the response is manifestly disingenuous. The question, in fact, necessarily arises whether the team or one of its members decided not to proceed with any further DNA tests. Such tests may have revealed that none of the ossuaries are related—hence defeating the underlying presupposition that the crypt was in fact a family tomb, and thereby eliminating any valid basis at all for producing and showing the film."

[[William G. Dever]] said that some of the inscriptions on the ossuaries are unclear, but that all of the names are common. "I've known about these ossuaries for many years and so have many other archaeologists, and none of us thought it was much of a story because these are rather common Jewish names from that period. It's a publicity stunt, and it will make these guys very rich, and it will upset millions of innocent people because they don't know enough to separate fact from fiction."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Jodi Magness, an archaeologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, notes that at the time of Jesus, wealthy families buried their dead in tombs cut by hand from solid rock, putting the bones in niches in the walls and then, later, transferring them to ossuaries. "If Jesus' family had been wealthy enough to afford a rock-cut tomb, it would have been in Nazareth, not Jerusalem," Magness writes.

According to Magness, the names on the Talpiot ossuaries indicate that the tomb belonged to a family from Judea, the area around Jerusalem, where people were known by their first name and father's name. As Galileans, Jesus and his family members would have used their first name and hometown. "This whole case (for the tomb of Jesus) is flawed from beginning to end."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

There is no information on analyzing relation of "Mary" and "Jesus son of Joseph" or any other tomb occupants. In Jewish tradition of the time, after one year, when bodies in rock-cut tombs were decomposed, bones were collected, cleaned and then finally placed in an [[ossuary]]. Due to this conduct there is no real assurance that what scientists have really examined are remnants of "Mariamne e Mara" and "Jesus son of Joseph."

===Interpretation of the inscriptions===

David Mavorah, a curator of the [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem, points out that the names on the ossuaries were extremely common. "We know that Joseph, Jesus and Mariamne were all among the most common names of the period. To start with all these names being together in a single tomb and leap from there to say this is the tomb of Jesus is a little far-fetched, to put it politely."&lt;ref name=pilkington&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,,2022252,00.html |title=Is this really the last resting place of Jesus, Mary Magdalene—and their son? |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |author2=McCarthy, Rory  |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-28 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Mavorah is an expert of Israeli Antiquity, and (presumably) not an expert of statistics. However, Andrey Feuerverger, the statistician cited by the makers of the documentary, has said that determination of the identity of those in the tomb was the purview of biblical historians, and not statisticians. For another interpretation of the statistics see the [[The Lost Tomb of Jesus#Statistical report|statistics section above]].

Professor Amos Kloner, former Jerusalem district archaeologist of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and the first archaeologist to examine the tomb in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/FEATURES/302270010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526032109/http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070227/FEATURES/302270010 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-05-26 |title=Clergy, scholars assail tomb of Jesus film |publisher=The Courier-Journal |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2007-02-27}} &lt;/ref&gt; told the ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' newspaper that the name Jesus had been found 71 times in burial caves at around that time.&lt;ref name=pilkington /&gt; Furthermore, he said that the inscription on the ossuary is not clear enough to ascertain, and although the idea fails to hold up by archaeological standards it makes for profitable television. Quote: "The new evidence is not serious, and I do not accept that it is connected to the family of Jesus…. They just want to get money for it."&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt;

[[Richard Bauckham]], professor at the [[University of St Andrews]], catalogued ossuary names from that region since 1980. He records that based on the catalogue, "Jesus" was the 6th most popular name of Jewish men, and "Mary/Mariamne" was the single most popular name of Jewish women at that time. Therefore, finding two ossuaries containing the names "Jesus" and "Mary/Mariamne" is not significant at all, and the chances of it being the ossuaries of Jesus and Mary Magdalene are "very small indeed."&lt;ref name=hollywood&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.bible.org/bock/node/106 |title=Hollywood Hype: The Oscars and Jesus' Family Tomb, What Do They Share?

Concerning the inscription attributed to Jesus son of Joseph, Steve Caruso, a professional Aramaic translator using a computer to visualize different interpretations, claims that although it is ''possible'' to read it as "Yeshua" that "overall it is a very strong possibility that this inscription is not &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Yeshua` bar Yehosef''.'"&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The name "Mary" and its derivatives may have been used by up to 25% of Jewish women at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garyhabermas.com/articles/The_Lost_Tomb_of_Jesus/losttombofjesus_response.htm "The Lost Tomb of Jesus: A Response to the Discovery-Channel Documentary Directed by James Cameron"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publicity===
[[Lawrence Stager|Lawrence E. Stager]], the Dorot professor of archaeology of Israel at [[Harvard]], said the documentary was "exploiting the whole trend that caught on with ''[[The Da Vinci Code]].'' One of the problems is there are so many biblically illiterate people around the world that they don't know what is real judicious assessment and what is what some of us in the field call 'fantastic archaeology.'"&lt;ref name=goodstein /&gt;

[[William G. Dever]] said, "I'm not a Christian. I'm not a believer. I don't have a dog in this fight. I just think it's a shame the way this story is being hyped and manipulated."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Jodi Magness criticized the decision of the documentary makers to make their claims at a news conference rather than in a peer-reviewed scientific article. By going directly to the media, she said, the filmmakers "have set it up as if it's a legitimate academic debate, when the vast majority of scholars who specialize in archeology of this period have flatly rejected this."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt;

Joe Zias, former curator of archeology at the Israeli Antiquities Authority, described it in an e-mail to ''The Washington Post'' as a "hyped-up film which is intellectually and scientifically dishonest."&lt;ref name=cooperman /&gt; He also wrote an extended Viewers Guide to Understanding the Talpiot Tomb documentary, published on his web site.&lt;ref name=zias /&gt;
[[François Bovon]] has also written to say that his comments were misused. In a letter to the Society of Biblical Literature, he wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=656 |title=Society of Biblical Literature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As I was interviewed for the Discovery Channel's program The Lost Tomb of Jesus, I would like to express my opinion here.

First, I have now seen the program and am not convinced of its main thesis. When I was questioned by Simcha Jacobovici and his team the questions were directed toward the Acts of Philip and the role of Mariamne in this text. I was not informed of the whole program and the orientation of the script.

Second, having watched the film, in listening to it, I hear two voices, a kind of double discourse. On one hand there is the wish to open a scholarly discussion; on the other there is the wish to push a personal agenda. I must say that the reconstructions of Jesus' marriage with Mary Magdalene and the birth of a child belong for me to science fiction.

Third, to be more credible, the program should deal with the very ancient tradition of the Holy Sepulcher, since the emperor Constantine in the fourth century C.E. built this monument on the spot at which the emperor Hadrian in the second century C.E. erected the forum of Aelia Capitolina and built on it a temple to Aphrodite at the place where Jesus' tomb was venerated.

Fourth, I do not believe that Mariamne is the real name of Mary of Magdalene. Mariamne is, besides Maria or Mariam, a possible Greek equivalent, attested by Josephus, Origen, and the Acts of Philip, for the Semitic Myriam.

Fifth, the Mariamne of the Acts of Philip is part of the apostolic team with Philip and Bartholomew; she teaches and baptizes. In the beginning, her faith is stronger than Philip's faith. This portrayal of Mariamne fits very well with the portrayal of Mary of Magdala in the Manichean Psalms, the Gospel of Mary, and Pistis Sophia. My interest is not historical, but on the level of literary traditions. I have suggested this identification in 1984 already in an article of New Testament Studies.

====Symposium and media coverage====

Following a symposium at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in January 2008 media interest in the Talpiot tomb was reignited. ''[[Time magazine|Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1704299,00.html | work=Time | title=Jesus 'Tomb' Controversy Reopened | date=2008-01-16 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[CNN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2008/01/18/wedeman.revisiting.jesus.tomb.cnn | work=CNN | title= Video | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; devoted extensive coverage, implying that the case had been re-opened.

Scholars who had been present at the symposium then accused Jacobovici and Cameron of misleading the media in claiming the symposium reopened their theory as viable. Several scholars, including all the archaeologists and epigraphers, who delivered papers at the symposium issued an open letter of complaint claiming misrepresentation, saying that Jacobovici and Cameron's claims of support from the symposium are "nothing further from the truth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dukereligion.blogspot.com/2008/01/talpiot-tomb-controversy-revisited.html Duke University Religion Department: The Talpiot Tomb Controversy Revisited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
