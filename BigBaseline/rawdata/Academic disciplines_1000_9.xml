__NOTOC__
[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|270px|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], with an [[empty throne]], 2nd century, [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, pp. 1 and 5, fig 4a caption&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Since the beginning of the serious study of the history of [[Buddhist art]] in the 1890s, the earliest phase, lasting until the 1st century CE, has been described as [[aniconic]]; the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was only represented through symbols such as an [[Hetoimasia|empty throne]],  [[Bodhi]] tree, a riderless horse with a parasol floating above an empty space (at [[Sanchi]]), [[Buddha footprint|Buddha's footprints]], and the [[dharma wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, opening pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is still some debate, the first [[anthropomorphic]] representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist]] interaction, in particular in [[Gandhara]], a theory first fully expounded by [[Alfred A. Foucher]], but  criticised from the start by [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]].  Foucher also accounted for the origins of the aniconic symbols themselves in small souvenirs carried away from the main pilgrimage sites and so becoming recognised and popularized as symbolic of the events associated with the site.  Other explanations were that it was inappropriate to represent one who had attained [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1990, the notion of aniconism in Buddhism was challenged by [[Susan Huntington]], initiating a vigorous debate among specialists that still continues.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZCl3DRN3vsC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false note 7 here] for an update on the controversy as of 2007, and [https://books.google.com/books?id=FHxsDV1GDOIC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Riderless+horse+Buddha&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Riderless%20horse%20Buddha&amp;f=false here] for another from 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  She sees many early scenes claimed to be aniconic as in fact not depicting scenes from the life of the Buddha, but worship of [[cetiya]] (relics) or re-enactments by devotees at the places where these scenes occurred.  Thus the image of the [[empty throne]] shows an actual relic-throne at [[Bodh Gaya]] or elsewhere.  She points out that there is only one indirect reference for a specific aniconic doctrine in Buddhism to be found, and that pertaining to only one sect.&lt;ref&gt;(Huntington 1990) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the archeological evidence, it shows some anthropomorphic sculptures of the Buddha actually existing during the supposedly aniconic period, which ended during the 1st century CE.  Huntington also rejects the association of "aniconic" and "iconic" art with an emerging division between [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] Buddhism.  Huntington's views have been challenged by Vidya Dehejia and others.&lt;ref&gt;(Huntington 1990) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some earlier examples have been found in recent years, it is common ground that the large free-standing iconic images of the Buddha so prominent in later Buddhist art are not found in the earliest period; discussion is focused on smaller figures in [[relief]] panels, conventionally considered to represent scenes from the life of the Buddha, and now re-interpreted by Huntington and her supporters.

== Later periods ==
In later periods both the major schools of Buddhism have made great use of representational art, though [[Theravada]] temples and other sites typically concentrate on a single large sculpture of the Buddha, whereas [[Mahayana]] temples have larger numbers of images of a greater variety of figures with varying degrees of spiritual significance.  However some schools, such as [[Zen Buddhism]] in [[Japan]], have also shown a general tendency towards aniconism, though without specific prohibition of figurative images.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4439">The '''Applied Research in Patacriticism''' ('''ARP''') was a [[digital humanities]] lab based at the [[University of Virginia]] founded and run by [[Jerome McGann]] and [[Johanna Drucker]].  ARP's [[open-source]] tools include Juxta, IVANHOE, and Collex.  Collex is the [[social software]] and [[faceted classification|faceted browsing]] backbone of the NINES federation.  ARP was funded by the [[Mellon Foundation]].

==Projects==
===IVANHOE===

IVANHOE is an [[open source]] electronic [[role-playing game]] for educational use.  It was developed by ARP at the [[University of Virginia]].  It is so named because [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s novel, ''[[Ivanhoe]]'', was used as the source text for the very first IVANHOE game.  IVANHOE is notable as an example of the use of [[ludic interface|ludic]] or game-related techniques in higher education in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol12_2_06.pdf Geoffrey Rockwell, Serious Play at Hand: Is Gaming Serious Research in the Humanities? in: ''TEXT Technology'' 2 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===NINES===

NINES is the '''Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-century Electronic Scholarship''', a scholarly organization in British and American nineteenth-century studies supported by ARP, a software development group assembling a suite of critical and editorial tools for digital scholarship.  It was founded in 2003 by [[Jerome McGann]] at the [[University of Virginia]].  

NINES serves as a clearinghouse for [[peer-reviewed]] digital resources, which can be collected, annotated, and re-used in online "exhibits."  It is powered by [[open-source]] [[Collex]] software.

In 2011, the NINES model was expanded to include a sister site in eighteenth-century studies, called 18thConnect.

===Collex===

Collex is an [[open source]] [[social software]] and [[faceted classification|faceted browsing]] tool designed for [[digital humanities]].  It includes [[folksonomy]] features and is under construction at ARP.  The first release of Collex is used in the [[NINES (initiative)|NINES initiative]], but it is a [http://collex.org generalizable tool] that can be applied to other subject domains.  Collex is an early example of a scholar-driven [[Library 2.0]] initiative and, like NINES, was conceived as a response to economic problems in [[tenure]] and [[academic publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nines.org/about/Nowviskie-Collex.pdf Bethany Nowviskie, Collex: Semantic Collections and Exhibits for the Remixable Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juxta===

Juxta is an [[open-source]] tool for performing [[bibliography|bibliographical]] collations for scholarly use in [[textual criticism]].  It was developed by ARP at the [[University of Virginia]] under the direction of textual theorist [[Jerome McGann]]. The original application was a Java-based client [http://www.juxtasoftware.org available for free download].

In October 2012, the Research and Development team at NINES released [http://juxtacommons.org Juxta Commons], a fully online version of the software.

'''Biblical languages''' are any of the [[language]]s employed in the original writings of the [[Bible]]. Partially owing to the significance of the Bible in society, Biblical languages are studied more widely than many other [[dead language]]s. Furthermore, some debates exist as to which language is the original language of a particular passage, and about whether a term has been properly translated from an ancient language into modern editions of the Bible. Scholars generally recognize three languages as original biblical languages: [[Hebrew]], [[Aramaic]], and [[Koine Greek]].

==Language of the Hebrew Bible==
The [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{hebrew|תנ"ך}}), also known as the [[Tanakh]], consists of 39 books. "Hebrew" in "[[Hebrew Bible]]" may refer to either the [[Hebrew language]] or to the [[Hebrew people]] who historically used Hebrew as a spoken language, and have continuously used the language in prayer and study, or both. The texts were mainly written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some portions (notably in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]]) in [[Biblical Aramaic]]. Biblical Hebrew, sometimes called ''Classical Hebrew'', is an archaic form of the Hebrew language.

The very first translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] was into [[Greek language|Greek]]. This is known as the [[Septuagint]] (LXX), which later became the received text of the [[Old Testament]] in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]] and the basis of its [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|canon]]. This began sometime in the 2nd or 3rd century BC, with the first portion of the Hebrew Bible, the [[Torah]], being translated into [[Koine Greek]]. Over the next century, other books were translated (or composed) as well. This translation became known as the [[Septuagint]] and was widely used by [[Hellenistic Judaism|Greek-speaking Jews]], and later by Christians. It differs somewhat from the later standardized Hebrew ([[Masoretic Text]]). This translation was promoted by way of a [[Letter of Aristeas|legend]] that seventy separate translators all produced identical texts.

The Latin [[Vulgate]] by [[Jerome]] was based upon the Hebrew for those books of the Bible preserved in the Jewish canon (as reflected in the [[Masoretic Text]]), and on the Greek text for the rest. Other ancient Jewish translations, such as the Aramaic [[Targum]]s, conform closely to the [[Masoretic Text]], and all medieval and modern Jewish translations are based upon the same. Christian translations also tend to be based upon the Hebrew, though some denominations prefer the Septuagint (or may cite variant readings from both). Bible translations incorporating modern textual criticism usually begin with the Masoretic Text, but also take into account possible variants from all available ancient versions.

==Languages of the New Testament==
{{main|Language of the New Testament}}
The books of the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]] are widely agreed to have originally been written in Greek, specifically [[Koine Greek]], even though some authors often included translations from Hebrew and Aramaic texts. Certainly the Pauline Epistles were written in Greek for Greek-speaking audiences. See [[Greek primacy]] for further details. Koine Greek was the popular form of Greek which emerged in post-classical antiquity (c.300 [[Before Christ|BC]] – [[Anno Domini|AD]] 300), and marks the third period in the history of the [[Greek language]].&lt;ref name=andriotes&gt;Andriotis, Nikolaos P. History of the Greek language&lt;/ref&gt; It is also called ''Alexandrian'', ''Hellenistic'', ''Common'', or ''New Testament'' Greek. 

Some scholars believe that some books of the Greek New Testament (in particular, the [[Gospel of Matthew]]) are actually translations of a Hebrew or Aramaic original. A famous example of this is [[Logos|the opening]] to the [[Gospel of John]], which some scholars argue to be a Greek translation of an Aramaic hymn. Of these, a small number accept the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Peshitta]] as representative of the original. See [[Aramaic primacy]].

Likewise, some traditional Roman Catholic scholars believed the [[Gospel of Mark]] was originally written in Latin.

However, the received text of the New Testament is Greek and nearly all translations are based upon the Greek text.

A '''biosand filter''' (BSF) is a point-of-use water treatment system adapted from traditional [[slow sand filter]]s. Biosand filters remove pathogens and suspended solids from water using biological and physical processes that take place in a sand column covered with a [[biofilm]]. BSFs have been shown to remove heavy metals, turbidity, bacteria, viruses and protozoa.&lt;ref name="Elliot"&gt;Elliott, M., Stauber, C., Koksal, F., DiGiano, F., and M. Sobsey (2008). Reduction of E. coli, echovirus type 12 and bacteriophages in an intermittently operated 2 household-scale slow sand filter.Water Research, Volume 42, Issues 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2008|url=http://itacanet.org/eng/water/Section%206%20Water%20treatment/Biosand_filter_CAWST.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; BSFs also reduce discoloration, odor and unpleasant taste. Studies have shown a correlation between use of BSFs and a decrease in the occurrence of [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST Biosand Filter|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their effectiveness, ease of use, and lack of recurring costs, biosand filters are often considered [[appropriate technology]] in developing countries. It is estimated that over 200,000 BSFs are in use worldwide.&lt;ref name="Elliot" /&gt;

==History==

The household biosand filter was proposed by Dr. David Manz in the late 1980s at the [[University of Calgary]], Canada.&lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=CAWST History|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/about-us/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was developed from the [[slow sand filter]], a technology that has been used for drinking water purification since the 1800s.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; Initial lab and field tests were conducted in 1991; the system was patented in 1993 &lt;ref name="CAWSTHistory"/&gt; and was implemented in the field in [[Nicaragua]]. The Canadian non-profit company [[Center for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology]] ([[CAWST]]) was co-founded in 2001 by David Manz and [[Camille Dow Baker]] to promote education and training in water purification and sanitation including using this technology, and to continue developing it.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt; A privately owned company, Hydraid Biosand Water Filter  produces and distributes plans for filters.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydraid Biosand Technology|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/biosand-filter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biosand filter components==

[[File:Ohorizons Concrete BioSand Filter.png|thumb|Basic Diagram of a Concrete BioSand Filter]]

Biosand filters are typically constructed from concrete or plastic.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; At the top of the filter, a tightly fitted lid prevents contamination and unwanted pests from entering the filter. Below this, the diffuser plate prevents disturbance of the [[biofilm]] when water is poured into the filter. Water then travels through the sand column, which removes pathogens and suspended solids. Below the sand column, a layer of gravel prevents sand from entering the drainage layer and clogging the outlet tube. Below the separating layer is the drainage layer consisting of coarser gravel that prevents clogging near the base of the outlet tube.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Resources"/&gt;

== Filtration process ==
Pathogens and suspended solids are removed by biological and physical processes that take place in the biolayer and the sand layer. These processes include:
*'''Mechanical trapping:''' Suspended solids and pathogens are trapped in the spaces between the sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Predation:''' Pathogens are consumed by microorganisms in the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Adsorption:''' Pathogens are absorbed into each other and to suspended solids in the water and sand grains.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;
*'''Natural death:''' Pathogens finish their life cycles or die because there is not enough food or oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===During the run===
The high water level (hydraulic head) in the inlet reservoir zone pushes the water through the diffuser and filter, then decreases as water flows evenly through the sand. The flow rate slows because there is less pressure to force the water through the filter. The inlet water contains dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and contaminants. It provides the oxygen required by the microorganisms in the biofilm. Large suspended particles and pathogens are trapped in the top of the sand and partially plug the pore spaces between the sand grains. This causes the flow rate to decrease.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Pause period (idle time)===

Idle time typically comprises greater than 80% of the daily cycle; during this time, microbial attenuation processes are likely to be significant. Most removal occurs where water is in contact with the biofilm. The processes that occur in the biofilm have not been identified.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; When the standing water layer reaches the level of the outlet tube, the flow stops.  Ideally, this should be high enough to keep the biofilm in the sand layer wet and allow oxygen to diffuse through the standing water to the biolayer.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; The pause period allows microorganisms in the biolayer to consume the pathogens and nutrients in the water. The rate of flow through the filter is restored as they are consumed. If the pause period is too long, the biolayer will consume all of the pathogens and nutrients and will die, reducing the efficiency of the filter when it is used again. The pause period should be between 1 and 48 hours.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Pathogens in the non-biological zone die from a lack of nutrients and oxygen.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

==Maintenance==
Over time, particles accumulate between the filter's sand grains. As more water is poured, a biofilm forms along the top of the diffuser plate. Both of these occurrences cause a decrease in flow rate (clogging and [[bioclogging]]). Although slower flow rates generally improve water filtration due to idle time [APS1], it may become too slow for the users’ convenience. If flow rates fall below 0.1 litres/minute, it is recommended by CAWST to perform maintenance.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt; The "swirl and dump", or wet harrowing cleaning technique, is used to restore flow rate.

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit in Haiti implements an education and follow-up program post-installation of the biosand filter. The program includes visits to the beneficiary homes after one, three and twelve months and another at 5 years from installation date. During each visit, beneficiaries receive repeated instruction about safe water practices and how to take care of the filter. Based on data collected since 2010, between 94% and 99% of filters are still being used regularly 12 months after installation. &lt;ref&gt;cleanwaterforhaiti.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Removal of contaminants==

===Turbidity===
Results for turbidity reductions vary depending on the turbidity of the influent water. Turbid water contains sand, silt and clay.&lt;ref name="CAWST Biosand Filter Manual"/&gt;  Feed turbidity in one study ranged from 1.86 to 3.9 NTU.  In a study water was obtained from sample taps of water treatment plants from three local reservoirs. It poured through a slow sand filter and results showed that turbidity decreased to a mean of 1.45 NTU.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; In another study using surface water a 93% reduction in turbidity was observed.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; As the biofilm above the sand ripens, turbidity removal increases.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Although biosand filters remove much turbidity, slow sand filters, which have a slower filtration rate, remove more.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt;

===Heavy metals===
There is limited research on the removal of heavy metals by biosand filters.  In a study conducted in South Africa, the filter removed about 64% of iron and 5% of magnesium.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"&gt;Mwabi, J.K., F.E. Adeyemo and T.O. Mamba. "Household Water Treatment Systems: A Solution to the Production of Safe Drinking." SAO/NASA ADS: ADS Home Page. Web. 22 Dec. 2011. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PCE....36.1120M&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
In laboratory studies, the biosand filter has been found to remove about 98-99% of bacteria.&lt;ref name="Household Water Treatment Systems"/&gt; In removal of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' it was found that the biosand filter may increase due to biofilm formation over about two months. The removal after this time ranged from 97-99.99% depending on the daily water volume and percent primary effluent added. The addition of primary effluent or waste water facilitates growth of the biofilm which aids bacterial die-off.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; Research shows that biosand filters in use in the field remove fewer bacteria than ones in a controlled environment.  In research conducted in 55 households of [[Bonao]], Dominican Republic, the average E. coli reduction was about 93 percent.&lt;ref name="Stauber"/&gt;

===Viruses===
Lab tests have shown that while the filters reduce significant quantities of  E. coli, they remove significantly fewer viruses because viruses are smaller.  In a study using bacteriophages, virus removal ranged between 85% and 95% after 45 days of usage.&lt;ref name="Elliot"/&gt; A recent study has suggested that virus removal increases significantly over time, reaching 99.99% after approximately 150 days.&lt;ref name="Virus Removal"&gt;Bradley, I., Straub, A., Maraccini, P., Markazi, Nguyen, T., (2011).  Iron Oxide Amended Biosand Filters for Virus Removal.  Water Research&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protozoa===
In one lab test the biosand filter removed more than 99.9% of [[protozoa]].  In tests for one type of protozoa, ''[[Giardia lamblia]]'', the filter removed 100% over 29 days of use. It removed 99.98% of the oocysts of another protozoa, ''Cryptosporidium sp.'', possibly due to their smaller size.  This removal was comparable with that of the slow sand filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/point-use-water-treatment/bio-sand-filtrat|title=Biosand Filter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health benefits ==

Studies in the Dominican Republic and Cambodia conducted by the [[University of North Carolina]] and the University of Nevada show that BSF use the reduced occurrence of diarrheal diseases by 47% in all age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stauber|first=Christine|author2=Gloria M. Ortiz |author3=Dana P. Loomis |author4=Mark D.

Such health perceptions on the use of biosand filter has shown to be more positive in long-term users.&lt;ref name="Stauber"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sobsey|first=Mark|author2=Christine Stauber |author3=Lisa Casanova |author4=Joseph Brown |author5=Mark Elliott |title=Point of Use Household Drinking Water Filtration: A Practical, Effective Solution for Providing Sustained Access to Safe Drinking Water in the Developing World|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|year=2008|doi=10.1021/es8026133 |volume=43 |pages=970–971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of biosand filters==

===Concrete===

[[Concrete]] filters, of concrete, are the most widespread type of biosand filter.  Concrete is generally preferable to other materials because of the low cost, wide availability and the ability to be constructed on-site. The plans for the concrete filter are distributed openly by CAWST. Several versions have been developed. The CAWST Version 9 biosand filter is constructed with a higher maximum loading rate. Although the filtered water passes EPA water quality standards, it is not optimal.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"&gt;{{cite journal|title=CAWST Biosand Filter Manual 2010|url=http://www.cawst.org/en/resources/pubs/file/43-pi-for-bsf-manual-complete-english}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research establishes that contact time between the water and the granular material is the leading determinant in purifying water. The CAWST Version 10 biosand filter takes this into account; the volume of the water reservoir is equal to the pore space volume of the sand layer. The maximum loading rate was decreased by 33% to ensure stagnant water is in constant contact with granular material.&lt;ref name="CAWSTManual2010"/&gt;

Concrete BioSand filters are typically manufactured using steel molds. The plans for a steel mold are openly distributed by CAWST.

Clean Water for Haiti, a non-profit organization based in Camp Marie, Haiti manufactures the biosand filters using an adaptation of the steel mold.  &lt;ref&gt;http://cleanwaterforhaiti.org/programs/how-does-the-filter-work/&lt;/ref&gt;

The non-profit organization OHorizons has designed a Wood Mold, based on CAWST’s Version 10 filter, which can function as low-cost alternative. The plans for a Wood Mold are openly available on the OHorizons website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohorizons.org/resources/ OHorizons Wood Mold Construction Manual and Appendix]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plastic===

Plastic filters are constructed from plastic barrels, usually formed offsite. Hydraid biosand filters are constructed from medical grade plastic with [[ultraviolet]] resistance.&lt;ref name="HydraidBSFTech"/&gt; TivaWater is the newest version of the plastic biosand filter and has several important improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tivawater.com tivawater.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stainless steel===

A stainless steel biosand filter developed by engineers at [[S M Sehgal Foundation]], an NGO based in Gurugram (formerly Gurgaon), India, has been found to perform better than its concrete counterparts and with a wider opportunity for application and adoption in different geographical conditions. The high cost of plastic prevents its use in rural India. The stainless steel filter, called JalKalp, offers increased filtration rate and better portability (than concrete models) and better production quality control. Concrete filters are prone to breakage and can be difficult to transport due to weight (65&amp;nbsp;kg), make it unsuitable especially in remote rural or hilly locations. Common quality issues are variations in construction material and manufacturing flaws. Further, the efflorescence due to salts in water reduces the life of the concrete filter. The newly developed lightweight (4.5&amp;nbsp;kg) stainless steel biosand filter has an edge over concrete filters, overcoming each of those shortcomings and providing better quality control. Besides improving its appearance, stainless steel adds to the strength, reliability, durability, and portability of the filter. Water quality tests demonstrate JalKalp's effectiveness against E coli, total coliforms, turbidity, and iron contamination. This filter integrates the germicidal properties of copper with the conventional filtration. Introduction of copper foil in the drainage zone of JalKalp filter has increased the removal of total coliform and E coli to 100% from contaminated water. S M Sehgal Foundation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/&lt;/ref&gt; promotes the model, which required no electricity, across India through partnerships with like-minded organizations to benefit as many rural families as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Lalit Mohan Sharma and Saurabh Sood, "Reinventing the Biosand Filter: An Easy Solution for Safe Drinking Water," ''IOSR Journals'', International Organization of Scientific Research, Vol 10. Issue 1, pp43-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smsfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Reinventing-the-biosand-filter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/jalkalp-water-sands-impurities /|title=JalKalp: Water sands impurities|last=Bhaduri|first=Amita|publisher= “India Water Portal” 13, November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are challenges to creating biosand water filters in developing countries.  Many lack the professional capability of constructing the metal forms to pour the concrete into. Finding proper mesh sizes to sift the sand layers may also be absent.  In Nicaragua you may find metal workers capable of welding rebar for home construction, however, you will not find sheet metal bending equipment to create the metal molds.  Sand is not sold in hardware stores like in the United States. It is most likely purchased by the pickup load from streambeds or pits and the only mesh available is 1/4 inch which is too large. When traveling to a third world country it might be best to take with you the proper mesh screens.

Another problem facing the use of the filters is adoption. Many projects may provide assistance in building the water filters and some may even distribute them but getting the host country nationals to use the filters requires much more dedication.  People need to be connected to water filter owners to insist they use the devices and get them into the habit of using them.  Otherwise several of the filters are abandoned and left unattended in the roads. Simply handing the filters out is insufficient for adoption.

{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist art''' is the [[art|artistic practices]] that are influenced by [[Buddhism]]. It includes art media which depict [[Buddha]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; [[mandala]]s and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as [[vajra]]s, bells, [[stupa]]s and [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist temple architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Buddhist Art? |url=http://buddhistartnews.wordpress.com/what-is-buddhist-art/ |publisher=Buddhist Art News |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BCE, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and co-developed with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] art, with cave temple complexes built together, each likely influencing the other.&lt;ref name=blurton113&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 113-116, 160-162, 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-iconic phase (5th century – 1st century BCE)==
{{See also|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Footprint of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. 1st century BCE, [[Gandhara]].]]
During the 2nd to 1st century BCE, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha’s life and teachings. These took the form of votive tablets or [[frieze]]s, usually in relation to the decoration of stupas.
Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form, but only through [[Buddhist symbolism]]. This period may have been [[aniconism in Buddhism|aniconic]].

Artists were reluctant to depict the Buddha anthropomorphically, and developed sophisticated aniconic symbols to avoid doing so (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear). This tendency remained as late as the 2nd century CE in the southern parts of India, in the art of the [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district#Amaravati School|Amaravati School]] (see: [[Mara (demon)|Mara's assault on the Buddha]]).
It has been argued that earlier anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha may have been made of wood and may have perished since then. However, no related archaeological evidence has been found.

The earliest works of Buddhist art in India date back to the 1st century BCE The
[[Mahabodhi Temple]] at Bodh Gaya became a model for similar structures in Burma
and Indonesia. The frescoes at [[Sigiriya]] are said to be even older than the
[[Ajanta Caves]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art ]  Frontline Magazine 13–26 May 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconic phase (1st century CE – present)==
{{see also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Padmapani, cave 1, Ajanta, India.jpg|thumb|left|Over life-size figure of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Padmapani]], cave 1, [[Ajanta Caves]], 5th century]]
Anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha started to emerge from the 1st century CE in [[Northern India]]. The two main centers of creation have been identified as [[Gandhara]] in today’s [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]], in [[Pakistan]], and the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern India.

Hellenistic culture was introduced in Gandhara during the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign: 321–298 BCE), founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]], conquered the Macedonian satraps during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]] of 305–303 BCE. Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]] (reign: 268-232 BCE), who formed the largest Empire in the Indian subcontinent, converted to Buddhism following the [[Kalinga War]]. Abandoning an expansionist ideology, Ashoka worked to spread the religion and philosophy throughout his empire as described in the [[edicts of Ashoka]]. Ashoka claims to have converted the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

After the overthrow of the Mauryan Empire by the [[Shunga Empire]], the  [[Greco-Bactrian]] and subsequently the [[Indo-Greek]] Kingdoms invaded north-western India. They facilitated the spread of Greco-Buddhist art style to other parts of the subcontinent. The Indo-Greek King [[Menander I]] was renown as a great patron of Buddhism, attaining the title of an [[arhat]].&lt;ref&gt;"(In the Milindapanha) Menander is declared an arhat", McEvilley, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] persecuted Buddhism, presumably to further erase the legacy of the Mauryan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Caleb; Sarao, K. T. S. (2010). "Pushyamitra Sunga, a Hindu ruler in the second century BCE, was a great persecutor of Buddhists". In Danver, Steven L. Popular Controversies in World History. ABC-CLIO. p. 89. {{ISBN|9781598840780}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the decline of Buddhist art east of Mathura.

Gandharan Buddhist sculpture displays [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Hellenistic artistic influence]] in the forms of human figures and ornament. Figures were much larger than any known from India previously, and also more naturalistic, and new details included wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, and [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf ornament.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Inscribed Seated Buddha Image in Abhaya Mudra - Kushan Period - Katra Keshav Dev - ACCN A-1 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5972.JPG|thumb|Mathura school Buddha, [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]]]]

The art of Mathura tends to be based on an Indian tradition, exemplified by the anthropomorphic representation of divinities such as the [[Yaksha|Yaksas]], although in a style rather archaic compared to the later representations of the Buddha. The Mathuran school contributed clothes covering the left shoulder of thin [[muslin]], the wheel on the palm, the lotus seat.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Mathura and Gandhara also influenced each other. During their artistic florescence, the two regions were even united politically under the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], both being capitals of the empire. It is still a matter of debate whether the anthropomorphic representations of Buddha was essentially a result of a local evolution of Buddhist art at Mathura, or a consequence of Greek cultural influence in Gandhara through the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] [[syncretism]].

This iconic art was characterized from the start by a realistic idealism, combining realistic human features, proportions, attitudes and attributes, together with a sense of perfection and serenity reaching to the divine. This expression of the Buddha as both man and God became the iconographic canon for subsequent Buddhist art.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Remains of early Buddhist painting in India are vanishingly rare, with the later phases of the [[Ajanta Caves]] giving the great majority of surviving work, created over a relatively short up to about 480 CE.  These are highly sophisticated works, evidently produced in a well-developed tradition, probably painting secular work in palaces as much as religious subjects.

Buddhist art continued to develop in India for a few more centuries. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of Mathura evolved during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (4th to 6th century CE) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. The art of the Gupta school was extremely influential almost everywhere in the rest of Asia. At the end of the 12th century CE, Buddhism in its full glory came to be preserved only in the Himalayan regions in India. These areas, helped by their location, were in greater contact with Tibet and China - for example the art and traditions of [[Ladakh]] bear the stamp of Tibetan and Chinese influence.
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|240px|Buddhist expansion throughout Asia.]]
As Buddhism expanded outside of India from the 1st century CE, its original artistic package blended with other artistic influences, leading to a progressive differentiation among the countries adopting the faith.
* A '''Northern route''' was established from the 1st century CE through [[Central Asia]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], in which [[Mahayana]] Buddhism prevailed.
* A '''Southern route''', where [[Theravada]] Buddhism dominated, went through [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]].

==Northern Buddhist art==
[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|left|thumb|A Chinese wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE)]]

The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] to Central Asia, China and ultimately Korea and Japan started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Ming]] (58-75&amp;nbsp;AD). However, extensive contacts started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]], with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]], were either [[Parthia]]n, [[Kushan]], [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] or [[Kuchean]].

Central Asian missionary efforts along the [[Silk Road]] were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of [[Serindian art]] from the 2nd through the 11th century in the Tarim Basin, modern [[Xinjiang]]. Serindian art often derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Pakistan]], combining Indian, Greek and [[Roman art|Roman]] influences. Silk Road Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs, Buddhist imagery, and a select few representations of [[Kami|Japanese gods]].

The art of the northern route was also highly influenced by the development of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, an inclusive branch of Buddhism characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]], and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. Mahāyāna goes beyond the traditional [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist]] ideal of the release from suffering ([[dukkha|duḥkha]]) of [[arhat]]s, and emphasizes the [[bodhisattva]] path. The Mahāyāna sutras elevate the Buddha to a transcendent and infinite being, and feature a pantheon of bodhisattvas devoting themselves to the [[Paramita|Six Perfections]], ultimate knowledge ([[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]]), enlightenment, and the liberation of all sentient beings. Northern Buddhist art thus tends to be characterized by a very rich and syncretic Buddhist pantheon, with a multitude of images of the various [[Buddhahood|buddhas]], bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings ([[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]).

===Afghanistan===
[[File:GBA1(trimmed).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue from a Buddhist monastery, 700&amp;nbsp;AD, Afghanistan]]
Buddhist art in [[Afghanistan]] (old [[Bactria]]) persisted for several centuries until the spread of Islam in the 7th century. It is exemplified by the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Other sculptures, in [[stucco]], [[schist]] or [[clay]], display very strong blending of Indian post-[[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] mannerism and Classical influence, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]].

Although Islamic rule was somewhat tolerant of other religions "[[People of the Book|of the Book]]", it showed little tolerance for Buddhism, which was perceived as a religion depending on "[[idolatry]]". Human figurative art forms also being prohibited under Islam, Buddhist art suffered numerous attacks, which culminated with the systematic destructions by the [[Taliban]] regime. The Buddhas of Bamyan, the sculptures of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], and many of the remaining artifacts at the Afghanistan museum have been destroyed.

The multiple conflicts since the 1980s also have led to a systematic pillage of archaeological sites apparently in the hope of reselling in the international market what artifacts could be found.

===Central Asia===
{{See also|Dunhuang|Mogao Caves|Kingdom of Khotan|Silk Road|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
[[File:SerindianGroup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Serindian art]], 6th-7th century [[Terra cotta|terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang).]]
[[Central Asia]] long played the role of a meeting place between China, India and [[Iran|Persia]]. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] to the West led to increased contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

Thereafter, the expansion of Buddhism to the North led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oasis of Central Asia. Some [[Silk Road]] cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between East and West.

The eastern part of Central Asia  ([[Chinese Turkestan]] ([[Tarim Basin]], [[Xinjiang]]) in particular has revealed an extremely rich [[Serindian art]] ([[cave painting|wall paintings]] and [[relief]]s in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. Works of art reminiscent of the Gandharan style, as well as scriptures in the Gandhari script [[Kharoshti]] have been found. These influences were rapidly absorbed however by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.

===China===
{{see also|Chinese Buddhist sculpture}}
Buddhism arrived in [[China]] around the 1st century CE, and introduced new types of art into China, particularly in the area of [[statue|statuary]]. Receiving this distant religion, strong Chinese traits were incorporated into Buddhist art.

====Northern Dynasties====
In the 5th to 6th centuries, the [[Northern Dynasties]] developed rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible and realistic manner, progressively led to a change towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

Sites preserving Northern Wei Dynasty Buddhist sculpture:
*[[Yungang Grottoes]], [[Shanxi]]
*[[Longmen Grottoes]], [[Henan]]
*[[Bingling Temple]], [[Gansu]]

====Tang Dynasty====

Following a transition under the [[Sui Dynasty]], Buddhist sculpture of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. Because of the dynasty's openness to foreign influences, and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India, Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Indian art of the Gupta period. During that time, the Tang capital of [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) became an important center for Buddhism. From there Buddhism spread to [[Korea]], and [[Japanese missions to Tang China]] helped it gain a foothold in Japan.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang China|Wuzong]] outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) in order to support the indigenous religion, [[Taoism]]. He confiscated Buddhist possessions, and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the development of the religion and its arts in China.

[[Chán]] Buddhism however, as the origin of Japanese [[Zen]], continued to prosper for some centuries, especially under the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), when Chan monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.

[[File:Chinesischer Maler von 1238 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of the Chinese [[Zen]] Buddhist [[Wuzhun Shifan]], painted in 1238&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Song Dynasty]].]]

Early paintings by Chán monks tended to eschew the meticulous realism of [[Gongbi]] painting in favour of vigorous, monochrome paintings, attempting to express the impact of enlightenment through their brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, A; ''The imperial capitals of China: an inside view of the celestial empire'', Random House 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84595-010-1}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Neo-Confucianism]] under [[Zhu Xi]] in the twelfth century resulted in considerable criticism of the monk-painters. Connected as they were with the then-unpopular school of Chan Buddhism, their paintings were discarded and ignored. Some paintings survived after being transported to Japan by visiting Zen monks, but the school of Chan painting gradually diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Valérie Malenfer; ''Dreaming the southern song landscape: the power of illusion in Chinese painting'', BRILL 1999, {{ISBN|978-90-04-11011-3}} p161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qing Dynasty====
During the Qing Dynasty, Manchu emperors supported Buddhist practices for a range of political and personal reasons. The [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was a devotee of Chan Buddhism, while his successor, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] promoted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], claiming to be the human embodiment of the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref&gt;Weidner, Marsha Smith, and Patricia Ann Berger. Latter Days of the Law : Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850-1850. Lawrence, KS: Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was under the rule of the third Qing ruler, the [[Qianlong Emperor]], that imperial patronage of the Buddhist arts reached its height in this period. He commissioned a vast number of religious works in the Tibetan style, many of which depicted him in various sacred guises.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.113&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art produced during this period are characterized by a unique fusion of Tibetan and Chinese artistic approaches. They combine a characteristically Tibetan attention to iconographic detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements. Inscriptions are often written in Chinese, Manchu, Tibetan, Mongolian and Sanskrit, while paintings are frequently rendered in vibrant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p.webm|thumb|Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p]]
Additionally, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] initiated a number of large-scale construction projects; in 1744 he rededicated the [[Yonghe Temple]] as Beijing's main Tibetan Buddhist monastery, donating a number of valuable religious paintings, sculptures, textiles and inscriptions to the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xumi Fushou Temple]], and the works housed within, is another project commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] that embodies the unique blend of Tibetan and Manchu artistic styles that characterized Buddhist art produced in China under Qianlong's reign.

After the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s abdication in 1795, the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism at the Qing court declined. The motives behind the Qing emperors' promotion of Tibetan Buddhism have been interpreted as a calculated act of political manipulation, and a means of forging ties between Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan communities, though this has been challenged by recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Patricia Ann. Empire of Emptiness : Buddhist Art and Political Authority In Qing China. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legacy====
[[File:Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p.webm|thumb|Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p]]
The popularization of Buddhism in China has made the country home to one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts in the world. The [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] and the [[Bingling Temple]] caves near [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] province, the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province, and the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] near [[Chongqing]] municipality are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.

===Korea===
{{see also|Buddhism in Korea|Korean Buddhist sculpture|Korean art}}
[[Korea]]n Buddhist art generally reflects an interaction between other Buddhist influences and a strongly original Korean culture. Additionally, the art of the steppes, particularly Siberian and [[Scythia]]n influences, are evident in early Korean Buddhist art based on the excavation of artifacts and burial goods such as [[Silla]] [[Crown of Silla|royal crowns]], belt buckles, daggers, and comma-shaped [[gogok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/crown.htm |title=Crown |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Arts of Korea |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this indigenous art was geometric, abstract and richly adorned with a {{clarify span|characteristic "barbarian" luxury|date=November 2012}}. Although many other influences were strong, Korean Buddhist art, "bespeaks a sobriety, taste for the right tone, a sense of abstraction but also of colours that curiously enough are in line with contemporary taste" (Pierre Cambon, ''Arts asiatiques- Guimet''').

====Three Kingdoms of Korea====
[[File:Pensive Bodhisattva 02.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], semi-seated contemplative Maitreya probably from Silla circa early 7th century.]]
The first of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] to officially receive Buddhism was [[Goguryeo]] in 372.&lt;ref name=graysonp25&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chinese records and the use of Buddhist motifs in Goguryeo murals indicate the introduction of Buddhism earlier than the official date.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baekje]] Kingdom officially recognized Buddhism in 384.&lt;ref name=graysonp25/&gt; The [[Silla]] Kingdom, isolated and with no easy sea or land access to China, officially adopted Buddhism in 535 although the foreign religion was known in the kingdom due to the work of Goguryeo monks since the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Encyclopedia of World History: ancient, medieval, and modern, chronologically arranged |author1=Peter N.

Particularly important in the transmission of sophisticated art styles to the Korean kingdoms was the art of the "barbarian" Tuoba, a clan of non-Han Chinese Xianbei people who established the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty in China in 386. The Northern Wei style was particularly influential in the art of the Goguryeo and Baekje. Baekje artisans later transmitted this style along with Southern Dynasty elements and distinct Korean elements to Japan. Korean artisans were highly selective of the styles they incorporated and combined different regional styles together to create a specific Korean Buddhist art style.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), pp. 27 &amp; 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture, 5th&amp;ndash;9th Century |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Timeline of Arts History |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seokguram Buddha.JPG|upright|thumb|left|[[Seokguram Grotto]] is a [[World Heritage Site]] and dates to the [[Unified Silla]] era.]]
While Goguryeo Buddhist art exhibited vitality and mobility akin with Northern Wei prototypes, the Baekje Kingdom was also in close contact with the [[Southern Dynasties]] of China and this close diplomatic contact is exemplified in the gentle and proportional sculpture of the Baekje, epitomized by Baekje sculpture exhibiting the fathomless smile known to art historians as the [[Baekje smile]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture (5th–9th century) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=metmuseum.org |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silla Kingdom also developed a distinctive Buddhist art tradition epitomized by the [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], a half-seated contemplative maitreya whose Korean-made twin, the Miroku Bosatsu, was sent to Japan as a proselytizing gift and now resides in the Koryu-ji Temple in Japan.&lt;ref name="kenyon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln275/Jap-Kor-art.htm |title=Japanese Art and Its Korean Secret |publisher=www2.kenyon.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms period stimulated massive temple-building projects, such as the [[Mireuksa]] Temple in the Baekje Kingdom and the [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple in Silla. Baekje architects were famed for their skill and were instrumental in building the massive nine-story pagoda at Hwangnyongsa and early Buddhist temples in Yamato Japan such as [[Asuka-dera|Hōkō-ji]] (Asuka-dera) and [[Hōryū-ji]].&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sir Banister Fletcher's a History of Architecture |author1=Fletcher, B. |author2=Cruickshank, D. |date=1996 |publisher=Architectural Press |isbn=9780750622677 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gt1jTpXAThwC |page=716 |accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 6th century Korean Buddhist art exhibited the cultural influences of China and India but began to show distinctive indigenous characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/06/eak/ht06eak.htm metmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; These indigenous characteristics can be seen in early Buddhist art in Japan and some early Japanese Buddhist sculpture is now believed to have originated in Korea, particularly from Baekje, or Korean artisans who immigrated to Yamato Japan. Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Korean style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the Koryu-ji Miroku Bosatsu and the Chugu-ji Siddhartha statues. Although many historians portray Korea as a mere transmitter of Buddhism, the Three Kingdoms, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Korea: A Religious History |author=Grayson, J.H. |date=2002 |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |isbn=9780700716050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1BzL2lwPqEC |page=33 |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unified Silla====
[[File:Goryeo Pagoda.jpg|thumb|160px|The Goryeo era [[Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda]] sits on the first floor of the [[National Museum of Korea]].]]
During the [[Unified Silla]] period, [[East Asia]] was particularly stable with China and Korea both enjoying unified governments. Early Unified Silla art combined Silla styles and Baekje styles. Korean Buddhist art was also influenced by new [[Tang Dynasty]] styles as evidenced by a new popular Buddhist motif with full-faced Buddha sculptures. Tang China was the cross roads of East, Central, and South Asia and so the Buddhist art of this time period exhibit the so-called international style. State-sponsored Buddhist art flourished during this period, the epitome of which is the [[Seokguram]] Grotto.

====Goryeo Dynasty====
The fall of the Unified Silla Dynasty and the establishment of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty in 918 indicates a new period of Korean Buddhist art. The Goryeo kings also lavishly sponsored Buddhism and Buddhist art flourished, especially Buddhist paintings and illuminated sutras written in gold and silver ink. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/eak/ht07eak.htm]. The crowning achievement of this period is the carving of approximately 80,000 woodblocks of the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] which was done twice.

====Joseon Dynasty====
The [[Joseon Dynasty]] actively suppressed Buddhism beginning in 1406 and Buddhist temples and art production subsequently decline in quality in quantity although beginning in 1549, Buddhist art does continue to be produced.

[[File:ASURA detail Kohfukuji.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The ASURA in [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (734)]]
Before the introduction of Buddhism, [[Japan]] had already been the seat of various cultural (and artistic) influences, from the abstract linear decorative art of the indigenous Neolithic [[Jōmon]] from around 10500&amp;nbsp;BC to 300&amp;nbsp;BC, to the art during the [[Yayoi]] and [[Kofun]] periods, with developments such as [[Haniwa]] art.

The cultural exchange between India and Japan was not direct, as Japan received Buddhism through Korea, China, Central Asia and eventually India. The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled to the islands together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The cultural contact between Indian Dharmic civilization and Japan through the adoption of Buddhist ideas and aesthetic has contributed to the development of a national cultural order in the subsequent century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Indian Influence on the Art of Japan | author = Sampa Biswas | publisher = Northern Book Centre | year = 2010 | isbn = 9788172112691 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=fLjcMfMGP10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Japan&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisg5jQrPrVAhWKMo8KHXxoBpEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Japan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century. Being geographically at the end of the [[Silk Road]], Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.

From 711, numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], including a five-story [[pagoda]], the Golden Hall of the Horyuji, and the [[Kōfuku-ji]] temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. Indian, Hellenistic, Chinese and Korean artistic influences blended into an original style characterized by realism and gracefulness. The creation of Japanese Buddhist art was especially rich between the 8th and 13th centuries during the periods of [[Nara period|Nara]], [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]].
Japan developed an extremely rich figurative art for the pantheon of Buddhist deities, sometimes combined with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Shinto]] influences. This art can be very varied, creative and bold.

From the 12th and 13th, a further development was [[Zen]] art, and it faces golden days in [[Muromachi Period]], following the introduction of the faith by [[Dogen]] and [[Eisai]] upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as [[sumi-e]]) and poetry (especially [[haiku]]s), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned "non-dualistic" representations. The search for enlightenment "in the moment" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the [[Chanoyu]] tea ceremony or the [[Ikebana]] art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques ([[martial art]]s).

Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Still around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved. Many of them are in wood and are regularly restored.

===Tibet and Bhutan===
{{See also|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}
[[File:Yama tibet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]] 18th century, Tibet]]
[[Tantric Buddhism]] started as a movement in eastern India around the 5th or the 6th century. Many of the practices of Tantric Buddhism are derived from [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] (the usage of [[mantra]]s, [[yoga]], or the burning of sacrificial offerings). Tantrism became the dominant form of Buddhism in [[Tibet]] from the 8th century. Due to its geographical centrality in Asia, Tibetan Buddhist art received influence from Indian, [[Nepal]]i, Greco-Buddhist and Chinese art.

One of the most characteristic creations of Tibetan Buddhist art are the [[mandala]]s, diagrams of a "divine temple" made of a circle enclosing a square, the purpose of which is to help Buddhist devotees focus their attention through meditation and follow the path to the central image of the Buddha.
Artistically, Buddhist [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art and Hindu art tend to be the two strongest inspirations of Tibetan art.

In 10th to 11th centuries, [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], Northern India (at that time part of Western Tibet Kingdom) serves an important role as an intermediary between India and Tibet cultural exchange, especially Buddhist art and philosophy. Notable example of Tibetan Buddhist art in Tabo is its exquisite frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tabo: a lamp for the kingdom : early Indo Tibetan Buddhist art in the western Himalaya, Archeologia, arte primitiva e orientale | author1 =Deborah E.

===Vietnam===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The boy Buddha rising up from lotus. Crimson and gilded wood, Trần-Hồ dynasty, Vietnam, 14th-15th century]]
Chinese influence was predominant in the north of [[Vietnam]] (Tonkin) between the 1st and 9th centuries, and [[Confucianism]] and Mahayana Buddhism were prevalent. Overall, the art of Vietnam has been strongly influenced by Chinese Buddhist art.

In the south thrived the former kingdom of [[Champa]] (before it was later overtaken by the Vietnamese from the north). [[Champa]] had a strongly Indianized art, just as neighboring [[Cambodia]]. Many of its statues were characterized by rich body adornments. The capital of the kingdom of Champa was annexed by Vietnam in 1471, and it totally collapsed in the 1720s, while [[Cham (Asia)|Cham people]] remain an abundant minority across [[Southeast Asia]].

==Southern Buddhist art==
The orthodox forms of Buddhism, also known as Southern Buddhism are still practised in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. During the 1st century CE, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise of the [[Parthia]]n empire in the [[Middle East]], an unvanquished enemy of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connections, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Trade routes linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Thailand|Siam]], lower [[Cambodia]] and southern [[Vietnam]], and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.

[[File:CambodianBuddha.JPG|thumb|upright|A Cambodian Buddha, 14th century]]
For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[Pāli|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and the Indian script, together with [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhism, [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. This expansion provided the artistic context for the development of Buddhist art in these countries, which then developed characteristics of their own.

Between the 1st and 8th centuries, several kingdoms competed for influence in the region (particularly the Cambodian [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] then the Burmese [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdoms) contributing various artistic characteristics, mainly derived from the Indian [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] style. Combined with a pervading Hindu influence, Buddhist images, votive tablets and Sanskrit inscriptions are found throughout the area. Between 8th- and 12th-century, under the patronage of [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]], arts and ideas of Buddhism and Hinduism co-developed and became increasingly intermeshed.&lt;ref name=richardblurton202/&gt; However, with Muslim invasion and sacking of monasteries in India, states Richard Blurton,  "Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India".&lt;ref name=richardblurton202&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 202-204, Quote: "Buddhism flourished in this part of India throughout the first millennium AD, especially under the patronage of Pala kings of the eighth and twelfth centuries. Towards the end of this period, popular Buddhism and Hinduism became increasingly intermeshed. However, when Muslim invaders from further west sacked the monasteries in the twelfth century, Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple.]]

By the 8th to 9th century, [[Sailendra]]n Buddhist art were developed and flourished in [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] kingdom of [[Central Java]], Indonesia. This period marked the renaissance of Buddhist art in Java, as numerous exquisite monuments were built, including [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Mendut]] and [[Borobudur]] stone mandala. The traditions would continue to the 13th century [[Singhasari]] Buddhist art of East Java.

From the 9th to the 13th centuries, Southeast Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The [[Sri Vijaya]] Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence, but both were adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, and their art expressed the rich Mahayana pantheon of the [[Bodhisattva]]s.
The [[Theravada]] Buddhism of the Pali canon was introduced to the region around the 13th century from [[Sri Lanka]], and was adopted by the newly founded [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]]. Since in Theravada Buddhism of the period, Monasteries typically were the central places for the laity of the towns to receive instruction and have disputes arbitrated by the monks, the construction of temple complexes plays a particularly important role in the artistic expression of Southeast Asia from that time.

From the 14th century, the main factor was the spread of [[Islam]] to the maritime areas of Southeast Asia, overrunning [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and most of the islands as far as the [[Southern Philippines]]. In the continental areas, Theravada Buddhism continued to expand into Burma, [[Laos]] and Cambodia.

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddha statue in Sri Lanka.]]
According to tradition, Buddhism was introduced in Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE by Indian missionaries under the guidance of Thera [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], the son of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]]. Prior to the expansion of Buddhism, the indigenous population of Sri Lanka lived in an animistic world full of superstition. The assimilation and conversion of the various pre-Buddhist beliefs was a slow process. In order to gain a foothold among the rural population, Buddhism needed to assimilate the various categories of spirits and other supernatural beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The earliest monastic complex was the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahāvihāra]] at [[Anuradhapura|Anurādhapura]] founded by [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Devānampiyatissa]] and presented to Mahinda Thera. The Mahāvihāra became the centre of the orthodox Theravāda doctrine and its supreme position remained unchallenged until the foundation of the [[Abhayagiri Vihāra]] around BC 89 by [[Valagamba of Anuradhapura|Vaţţagāmaņĩ]].

The Abhayagiri Vihāra became the seat of the reformed Mahāyāna doctrines. The rivalry between the monks of the Mahāvihāra and the Abhayagiri led to a further split and the foundation of the [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavanarama]] near the Mahāvihāra. The main feature of Sinhala Buddhism was its division into three major groups, or ''nikāyas'', named after the three main monastic complexes at Anurādhapura; the Mahāvihāra, the Abhayagiri, and the Jetavanārāma. This was the result in the deviations in the disciplinary rules ''(vinaya)'' and doctrinal disputes. All the other monasteries of Sri Lanka owed ecclesiastical allegiance to one of the three. Sri Lanka is famous for its creations of Buddhist sculptures made of stone and cast in bronze alloy.&lt;ref&gt;von Schroeder, Ulrich. 1990. ''Buddhist Sculptures of Sri Lanka''.

===Myanmar===
[[File:Buddha 00004.JPG|thumb|upright|A Mandalay-style statue of Buddha]]
A neighbor of India, [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was naturally strongly influenced by the eastern part of Indian territory. The [[Mon people|Mon]] of southern Burma are said to have been converted to Buddhism around 200&amp;nbsp;BC under the proselytizing of the Indian king [[Ashoka]], before the schism between [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

Early Buddhist temples are found, such as Beikthano in central Myanmar, with dates between the 1st and the 5th centuries. The Buddhist art of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in Southeast Asia following the expansion of the Mon Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries.

Later, thousands of Buddhist temples were built at [[Bagan]], the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries, and around 2,000 of them are still standing. Beautiful jeweled statues of the Buddha are remaining from that period. Creation managed to continue despite the seizure of the city by the [[Mongols]] in 1287.
[[File:Bodleian MS. Burm. a. 12 Life of the Buddha 15-18.jpg|thumbnail|left|Scenes from the life of the Buddha in an 18th-century Burmese watercolour]]
During the [[Ava Kingdom|Ava period]], from the 14th to 16th centuries, the Ava (Innwa) style of the Buddha image was popular. In this style, the Buddha has large protruding ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, thin lips and a hair bun that is pointed at the top, usually depicted in the bhumisparsa [[mudra]].&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part1/post_pagan_period__part_1.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 1 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Konbaung dynasty]], at the end of the 18th century, the Mandalay style of the Buddha image emerged, a style that remains popular to this day.&lt;ref name="niu2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part3/post_pagan_period__part_3.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 3 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a marked departure from the Innwa style, and the Buddha's face is much more natural, fleshy, with naturally-slanted eyebrows, slightly slanted eyes, thicker lips, and a round hair bun at the top. Buddha images in this style can be found reclining, standing or sitting.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/mandalay_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalay-style Buddhas wear flowing, draped robes.

Another common style of Buddha images is the Shan style, from the [[Shan people]], who inhabit the highlands of Myanmar. In this style, the Buddha is depicted with angular features, a large and prominently pointed nose, a hair bun tied similar to Thai styles, and a small, thin mouth.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/shan_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cambodia]] was the center of the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] kingdom, which expanded into Burma and as far south as Malaysia between the 3rd and 6th centuries. Its influence seems to have been essentially political, most of the cultural influence coming directly from India.

Later, from the 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu [[Khmer Empire]] dominated vast parts of the Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was foremost in the development of Buddhist art in the region. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of [[Jayavarman VII]], a Buddhist king that built [[Angkor Thom]] walled city, adorned with the smiling face of [[Lokeshvara]] in Angkor Thom ''dvaras'' (gates) and ''prasat'' towers [[Bayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Monuments and Temples of Cambodia and Laos | author = W.

A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.

Often, Khmer art manages to express intense spirituality through divinely beaming expressions, in spite of spare features and slender lines.

[[File:Wat Si Chum in Sukhothai.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Phra Atchana [[Wat Si Chum]], [[Sukhothai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]
The Thai Buddhist art encompasses period for more than a millennia, from pre Thai culture of Dvaravati and Srivijaya, to the first Thai capital of Thai 13th century Sukhothai, all the way to  succeeding Thai kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"&gt;{{cite book | title = Thai Buddhist Art: Discover Thai Art | author = Dawn F.

From the 1st to the 7th centuries, Buddhist art in [[Thailand]] was first influenced by direct contact with Indian traders and the expansion of the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdom, leading to the creation of Hindu and Buddhist art inspired from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] tradition, with numerous monumental statues of great virtuosity.

From the 9th century, the various schools of Thai art then became strongly influenced by Cambodian [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] art in the north and [[Sri Vijaya]] art in the south, both of Mahayana faith. Up to the end of that period, Buddhist art is characterized by a clear fluidness in the expression, and the subject matter is characteristic of the [[Mahayana]] pantheon with multiple creations of [[Bodhisattva]]s.

From the 13th century, [[Theravada]] Buddhism was introduced from Sri Lanka around the same time as the [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] was established.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; The new faith inspired highly stylized images in Thai Buddhism, with sometimes very geometrical and almost abstract figures.

During the [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period (14th-18th centuries), the Buddha came to be represented in a more stylistic manner with sumptuous garments and jeweled ornamentations. Many Thai sculptures or temples tended to be [[gilding|gilded]], and on occasion enriched with inlays.

The ensuing period of [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] saw the further development of Thai Buddhist art.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; By the 18th century, [[Bangkok]] was established as the royal center of the kingdom of [[Siam]]. Subsequently, the Thai rulers filled the city with imposing Buddhist monuments to demonstrate their Buddhist piety as well as to showcase their authority. Among others are the celebrated [[Wat Phra Kaew]] which hosts the [[Emerald Buddha]]. Other Buddhist temples in Bangkok includes [[Wat Arun]] with ''prang'' style towers, and [[Wat Pho]] with its famous image of [[Reclining Buddha]].

===Indonesia===

[[File:Borobudur-perfect-buddha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Buddha in [[Borobudur]].]]
Like the rest of Southeast Asia, [[Indonesia]] seems to have been most strongly influenced by India from the 1st century CE. The islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java (island)|Java]] in western Indonesia were the seat of the empire of [[Sri Vijaya]] (8th-13th century), which came to dominate most of the area around the Southeast Asian peninsula through maritime power. The Sri Vijayan Empire had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, under a line of rulers named the [[Sailendra]]. The Sailendras was the ardent temple builder and the devoted patron of Buddhism in Java.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java | author1 = Jean Philippe Vogel | author2 = Adriaan Jacob Barnouw | publisher = Asian Educational Services | year = 1936 | isbn = 9788120612259 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=wQ2x0cbZkn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Java&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLm_6o6PfVAhXKo48KHUc_DuEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Java&amp;f=false| pages = 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sri Vijaya spread Mahayana Buddhist art during its expansion into the Southeast Asian peninsula. Numerous statues of Mahayana [[Bodhisattva]]s from this period are characterized by a very strong refinement and technical sophistication, and are found throughout the region. One of the earliest Buddhist inscription in Java, the [[Kalasan inscription]] dated 778, mentioned about the construction of a [[Kalasan|temple]] for the goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt;

[[File:Prajnaparamita Java Side Detail.JPG|thumb|upright|The statue of [[Prajnaparamita of Java|Prajñāpāramitā from Singhasari]], East Java.]]
Extremely rich and refined architectural remains are found in Java and Sumatra. The most magnificent is the temple of [[Borobudur]] (the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built  around 780-850&amp;nbsp;AD), built by Sailendras.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt; This temple is modelled after the Buddhist concept of universe, the [[Mandala]] which counts 505 images of the seated Buddha and unique bell-shaped stupa that contains the statue of Buddha. Borobudur is adorned with long series of bas-reliefs narrated the holy Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas | author = John Miksic | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781462909100 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=borobudur+golden+tales+of+the+buddhas&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP45O7r_rVAhWJtY8KHcpuAfYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20art&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Buddhist structure in Indonesia probably is the [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] stupas at Karawang, West Java, dated from around the 4th century. This temple is some plastered brick stupas. However, Buddhist art in Indonesia reach the golden era during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty rule in Java. The bas-reliefs and statues of [[Boddhisatva]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], and [[Kinnara]] found in [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sewu|Sewu]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], and [[Candi Plaosan|Plaosan]] temple is very graceful with serene expression, While [[Mendut]] temple near Borobudur, houses the giant statue of [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]].

In [[Sumatra]] Sri Vijaya probably built the temple of Muara Takus, and [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]]. The most beautiful example of classical Javanese Buddhist art is the serene and delicate statue of [[Prajnaparamita]] (the collection of National Museum Jakarta) the goddess of transcendental wisdom from [[Singhasari]] kingdom.&lt;ref name ="VCM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prajnaparamita | publisher =Virtual Collections of Asian Masterpieces| url  =http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=12147| accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian Buddhist Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the [[Chola]] rulers of India, then followed by [[Majapahit]] empire.

==Contemporary Buddhist art==
[[File:Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism (1916) (14779469804).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration from the book "Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism" (1916).]]
Many contemporary artists have made use of Buddhist themes. Notable examples are [[Bill Viola]], in his video installations,&lt;ref&gt;Buddha Mind in Contemporary Art, University of California Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Connell]], in sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;ARTlines, April 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allan Graham]] in his multi-media "Time is Memory".&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Rail, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK [[The Network of Buddhist Organisations]] has interested itself in identifying Buddhist practitioners across all the arts. In 2005 it co-ordinated the UK-wide Buddhist arts festival, "A Lotus in Flower";&lt;ref&gt;a poster advertising one of the events is archived here - http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824213345/http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf# |date=24 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 it helped organise the two-day arts conference, "Buddha Mind, Creative Mind".&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwbo-news.blogspot.com/2009/07/report-from-buddha-mind-creative-mind.html |title=Triratna Buddhist Community News: Report from ‘Buddha Mind - Creative Mind?’ conference |author=Lokabandhu |publisher=fwbo-news.blogspot.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the latter an association of Buddhist artists was formed.&lt;ref name="ning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dharmaarts.ning.com/ |title=Dharma Arts Network - Launched at Buddha Mind - Creative Mind ? |publisher=dharmaarts.ning.com |accessdate=2014-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010000408/http://dharmaarts.ning.com/# |archive-date=10 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Byzantine text-type''' (also called '''Majority Text''', '''Traditional Text''', '''Ecclesiastical Text''', '''Constantinopolitan Text''', '''Antiocheian Text''', or '''Syrian Text''') is one of several [[Textual criticism#New Testament|text-types]] used in [[textual criticism]] to describe the textual character of [[Koine Greek|Greek]] [[New Testament]] [[biblical manuscript|manuscripts]]. It is the form found in the largest number of surviving [[manuscript]]s, though not in the oldest. The New Testament text of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]], the [[Patriarchal Text]], as well as those utilized in the [[lectionaries]], is based on this text-type. While considerably varying, it also underlies the [[Textus Receptus]] Greek text used for most Reformation-era translations of the New Testament into vernacular languages. Modern translations mainly use [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|Eclectic]] editions that conform more often to the [[Alexandrian text-type]].

The Byzantine text is also found in a few modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] editions, as the Byzantine textual tradition has continued in the Eastern Orthodox Church into the present time. The text used by the Orthodox Church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts. It is commonly accepted as standard Byzantine text.

The Byzantine textform is often marked with the abbreviations &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{M}&lt;/math&gt; or '''Byz'''.

== Manuscripts of the Byzantine text ==

[[File:Codex alexandrinus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Codex Alexandrinus''', the oldest Greek witness of the Byzantine text in the Gospels, close to the Family Π (''Luke 12:54-13:4'')]]

For some time following the fourth century different types of text were current in the East, but at the end the Byzantine text "almost wholly displaced the rest."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort. ''[[The New Testament in the Original Greek]]'', 1925. p. 552&lt;/ref&gt; The Byzantine text-type has by far the largest number of surviving manuscripts, many of them written in the newer [[Lower case|minuscule]] (lower case) style and in [[Polytonic orthography]] handwriting, which had been invented in the 3rd century BC by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] but which took many centuries to catch on outside scholarly circles. For example, of 522 complete or nearly complete manuscripts of the [[General epistles|General Epistles]] collated by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]] in [[Münster]], [[Germany]], 372 of them attest the Byzantine reading in at least 90% of 98 test places. Amongst the earliest surviving manuscripts, the position is reversed. There are six manuscripts earlier than the 9th century which conform to the Byzantine text-type; of which the 5th century [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (the oldest), is Byzantine only in the Gospels with the rest of the New Testament being Alexandrian. By comparison, the [[Alexandrian text-type]] is witnessed by nine surviving [[uncials]] earlier than the ninth century (including the Codex Alexandrinus outside the Gospels); and is also usually considered to be demonstrated in three earlier [[papyrus|papyri]]. Modern critical editions of the New Testament tend to conform most often to Alexandrian witnesses — especially [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]].

The earliest [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] to witness to a Byzantine text-type in substantial New Testament quotations is [[John Chrysostom]] (c. 349 — 407); although the fragmentary surviving works of [[Asterius the Sophist]] († 341) have also been considered to conform to the Byzantine text,&lt;ref&gt;Gordon D. Fee, "The Use of Greek Patristic Citations in New Testament Textual Criticism: The State of the Question," pp. 344-359 in ''Studies in the Theory and Method of New Testament Textual Criticism'' (ed. Eldon J. Epp and Gordon D. Fee; Studies &amp; Documents 45; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1993), p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; and the incomplete surviving translation of [[Ulfilas|Wulfila]] (d. 383) into [[Gothic language|Gothic]] is often thought to derive from the Byzantine text type or an intermediary between the Byzantine and Western text types.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, William, 1980, ''An Introduction to the Gothic Language'', pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysostom and Asterius used text only in 75% agreed with the standard Byzantine text. The second earliest translation to witness to a Greek base conforming generally to the Byzantine text in the Gospels is the Syriac [[Peshitta]] (though it has many Alexandrian and Western readings);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |authorlink=Bruce M. Metzger |title=The Early Versions of the New Testament: Their Origin, Transmission and Limitations |year=1977 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=New York – Oxford|url= |isbn=0-19-826170-5 |pages= 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually dated to the beginning of the 5th century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |authorlink1=Bruce M. Metzger |last2=Ehrman |first2=Bart D. |authorlink2=Bart D.

Dating from the fourth century, and hence possibly earlier than the Peshitta, is the [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]] version of the Gospels; best represented by the surviving fifth and sixth century manuscripts of the [[Garima Gospels]] and classified by Rochus Zuurmond as "early Byzantine". Zuurmond notes that, especially in the Gospel of John, the form of the early Byzantine text found in the Ethiopic Gospels is quite different from the later Greek Majority Text, and agrees in a number of places with [[Papyrus 66]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Zuurmond |first1=Rochus |last2=Niccum |first2=Curt |title="The Ethiopic Version of the New Testament" in Bart D. Ehrman and Michael W. Holmes eds "The Text of the New Testament in Contemporary Research" 2nd edn|year=2013|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-23604-2|pages= 231–252}}"One would say that the Ethiopian ''Versio Antiqua'' is basically a Byzantine text, with some Western elements and some remnants of the early Egyptian text.  For lack of a better term one could coin this "early Byzantine".&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of the Byzantine text found in the earliest witnesses is not a monolithic whole, and sometimes differs from a Byzantine sub-group of manuscripts that proliferated after the 11th century. Amongst the bulk of later manuscripts however, it is generally possible to demonstrate a clear Byzantine majority reading for each variant; and a Greek New Testament text based on these majority readings — "The Majority Text" — has been produced by [[Zane C. Hodges]] and Arthur L. Farstad, although this text does not correspond to any one particular manuscript.

== Characteristics of the Byzantine text ==
{{see also|List of major textual variants in the New Testament}}

Compared to [[Alexandrian text-type]] manuscripts, the distinct Byzantine readings tend to show a greater tendency toward smooth and well-formed Greek, they display fewer instances of textual variation between parallel [[Synoptic Gospel]] passages, and they are less likely to present contradictory or "[[Lectio difficilior potior|difficult]]" issues of [[exegesis]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Syrian text has all the appearance of being a careful attempt to supersede the chaos of rival texts by a judicious selection from them all." [[Brooke Foss Westcott]], [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]]. ''The New Testament In The Original Greek'', 1925. p. 551&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 1:2 reads "As it is written in the prophets..." in the Byzantine text; whereas the same verse reads, "As it is written in [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] the prophet..." in all other early textual witnesses. Since the quotation introduced is partly from [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]], the Byzantine form of the verse avoids the difficulty that might be adduced were it to be concluded that Mark was presenting a factual inaccuracy.

Another characteristic is the grammar (e.g., οι δε ειπον; in Alexandrian text: οι δε ειπαν) and the different order of words. For example:

John 6:49

: εν τη ερημω το μαννα – codices [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|B]], [[Codex Ephraemi|C]], [[Codex Bezae|D]], T, [[Codex Washingtonianus|W]], [[Codex Koridethi|Θ]]
: το μαννα εν τη ερημω – codices [[Codex Sinaiticus|ﬡ]], [[Codex Alexandrinus|A]], [[Codex Regius (New Testament)|L]], [[Codex Athous Lavrentis|Ψ]], [[Family 1|''f''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[Family 13|''f''&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;]], mss. of the Byzantine text-type

Mark 1:9

: εις τον Ιορδανην υπο Ιωανου – codices ﬡ, B, D
: υπο Ιωανου εις τον Ιορδανην – codices A, W, and manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type

Also, the Byzantine text does not contain verses included by Textus Receptus: Luke 17:36; Acts 8:37; 15:34.

There are no consistent Byzantine witnesses amongst the early New Testament [[papyri (chronology)|papyri]]. Nevertheless, instances of distinctive Byzantine readings are not unusual in the earliest texts — even though they otherwise conform more to other text-types or none. Hence, many (and possibly most) distinctive Byzantine readings are likely to be early in date. Two broad explanations have been offered for this observation:

* that the Byzantine text-type transmits a text closest to the primary form of the New Testament books; whose early manuscript witnesses have not survived, as this text-type predominated in regions where the climate did not favour the preservation of papyrus;
* that the Byzantine text represents a consistent exercise in textual compilation and correction from around the 4th century, the editors having eclectically selected those readings from a range of early manuscripts, that best conformed to their presupposed standards of the characteristics to be expected in the New Testament text.

=== Special cases ===

In Mark 6:33 and Luke 24:53 the Byzantine text-type looks like a combination of the Alexandrian and the Western text. In other cases the situation is more complicated. Mark 1:13 looks like a combination of the Alexandrian and the Caesarean text.

== Origin of the Byzantine text ==

In order to displace the [[Textus Receptus]] (see the following section) from its initially prominent position among printed editions of the Greek New Testament, later textual scholars of the critical text persuasion saw the need for a thoroughgoing theory of the transmission of the text that could effectively disregard the overwhelmingly numerical superiority of the Byzantine text which formed its base. This [[Westcott-Hort|Wescott and Hort]]'s Introduction accomplished in masterful detail (over the course of 600 pages) as the culmination of 28 years of laborious effort on their part.

They summarize the problem early on in their work (p.&amp;nbsp;45) as follows:
"A theoretical presumption indeed remains that a majority of extant documents is more likely to represent a majority of ancestral documents at each stage of transmission than vice versa." In the discussion that follows, they reason that the "incalculable and fortuitous complexity of the causes here at work" in the transmission of the text leads them to the conclusion that "every ground for expecting 'a priori' any sort of correspondence of numerical proportion between existing documents and their less numerous ancestors in any one age falls to the ground."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westcotthort.com/books/Westcott_Hort_-_Introduction_to_the_New_Testament_in_the_Original_Greek_(2nd_1896).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those modern scholars who believe that the Byzantine text is only a secondary witness to the original text of the autographs, there is some debate concerning the origin of the Byzantine text and the reasons for its widespread existence and use. The suggestions that have been put forward are:

* That [[Lucian of Antioch]] used his [[Textual criticism|text critical]] skills to produce a [[recension]]. ([[Jerome]] makes reference to Lucian's recension of the Old Testament only. Wescott and Hort favored this theory.)
* That [[Constantine I]] paid for the wide distribution of manuscripts which came from a common source. (There are several references by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] to Constantine paying for [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|manuscript production]]).
* That after the [[Western Roman Empire]] stopped using Greek, and because of [[Barbarian]] and [[Muslim]] invasions, eliminating the possibility for either [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] or [[Early centers of Christianity#Caesarea|Caesarea]] to exercise any further influence on the text of the Greek New Testament,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

(See also [[State church of the Roman Empire]].)

The standard Byzantine text used by the Eastern, Greek-speaking Greek Orthodox Church is supported by late minuscule manuscripts dating after the 4th century. However, some are earlier and a few papyri are also classified here. The early Byzantine text is near to the Alexandrian text in that it differs from the late Byzantine text in roughly 3000 places. Kurt Aland did not consider early Byzantine families such as E and Π to be classified as Byzantine manuscripts. He placed some of them into Category III of the Greek New Testament manuscripts. Aland placed all manuscripts with standard Byzantine text into Category V.

== The Textus Receptus ==

The first printed edition of the Greek New Testament was completed by [[Erasmus]] and published by [[Johann Froben]] of Basel on March 1, 1516 ([[Novum Instrumentum omne]]). Due to the pressure of his publisher to bring their edition to market before the competing [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible|Complutensian Polyglot]], Erasmus based his work on around a half-dozen manuscripts, all of which dated from the twelfth century or later; and all but one were of the Byzantine text-type. Six verses that were not witnessed in any of these sources, he back-translated from the Latin [[Vulgate]], and Erasmus also introduced many readings from the Vulgate and [[Church Fathers]]. This text came to be known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' or ''received text'' after being thus termed by [[Bonaventura Elzevir]], an enterprising publisher from the Netherlands, in his 1633 edition of Erasmus' text. The New Testament of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible was translated from editions of what was to become the ''Textus Receptus''. The different Byzantine "Majority Text" of Hodges &amp; Farstad  as well as [[Maurice A. Robinson|Robinson]] &amp; Pierpont is called "Majority" because it is considered to be the Greek text established on the basis of the reading found in the vast majority of the Greek manuscripts. The Textus Receptus differs from the Majority Text in 1,838 Greek readings, of which 1,005 represent "translatable" differences.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Marlowe states:[http://www.bible-researcher.com/majority.html] ''yet it differs from the Received Text in about a thousand places, most of them being trivial.'' while [[Daniel B. Wallace]] [http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=673] ''has counted 1,838 differences between it and the Textus Receptus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern critical texts ==

[[Karl Konrad Friedrich Wilhelm Lachmann|Karl Lachmann]] (1850) was the first New Testament textual critic to produce an edition that broke with the ''Textus Receptus'', relying mainly instead on manuscripts from the [[Alexandrian text-type]]. Although the majority of New Testament textual critics now favor a text that is [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] in complexion, especially after the publication of [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]]'s [[Westcott-Hort|edition]], there remain some proponents of the Byzantine text-type as the type of text most similar to the autographs. These critics include the editors of the Hodges and Farstad text (cited below), and the [[Maurice A. Robinson|Robinson]] and Pierpont text. Depending on which modern critical text is taken as an exemplar of the Alexandrian text-type, then this will differ from the Hodges and Farstad text in around 6,500 readings (Wallace 1989).

To give a feel for the difference between the Byzantine form of text and the [[Textual criticism#Eclecticism|Eclectic]] text, which is mainly Alexandrian in character, of 800 variation units in the [[Epistle of James]] collected by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research]], the Byzantine and Eclectic texts are in agreement in 731 of the places (a rate of 92.3%). Many of the 69 disagreements involve differences in word order and other variants that do not appear as translatable differences in English versions. According to the preface to the [[New King James Version]] of the Bible, the [[Textus Receptus]], the [[Alexandrian text-type]] and the Byzantine text-type are 85% identical (that is, of the variations that occur in any manuscript, only 15% actually differ between these three).

The Byzantine type is also found in modern [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] editions. A new scholarly edition of the Byzantine Text of John's gospel, (funded by the [[United Bible Societies]] in response to a request from Eastern Orthodox Scholars), was begun in [[Birmingham]], UK. and in 2007, as a result of these efforts, ''The Gospel According to John in the Byzantine Tradition'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Gospel-According-John-Byzantine-Tradition/dp/1598563076|title=The Gospel According to John in The Byzantine Tradition|author=|editor-first1=Roderic L.|editor-last1=Mullen|editor-first2=Simon|editor-last2=Crisp|editor-first3=D. C.|editor-last3=Parker|date=14 July 2008|publisher=Hendrickson Pub|accessdate=19 March 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Soden divided manuscripts of the Byzantine text into five groups:

* K&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt; — no uncials, hundreds of minuscules, among them codex [[Minuscule 2|2]], [[Minuscule 3|3]], [[Minuscule 8|8]], 14, 45, 47, 49, 51, 54, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 73, 75, 76, 78, etc.
* K&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; — no uncials, no early minuscules, hundreds of minuscules: 18, 35, 55, 66, 83, 128, 141, 147, 155, 167, 170, 189, 201
* K&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (subfamily of K&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;) — S V Ω 461
* K&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; (Family E) — [[Codex Basilensis A. N. III. 12|E]] [[Codex Boreelianus|F]] [[Codex Seidelianus I|G]] [[Codex Seidelianus II|H]]
* I&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; (also K&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;), now Family Π — (A) K Y Π; this subgroup is the oldest, but only 5% of manuscripts belong to it. Majority of them have text mixed with other Byzantine subfamilies.

Since the discovery of the [[Papyrus 45]], [[Papyrus 46]], and [[Papyrus 66]], proof is available that occasionally the Byzantine text preserves a reading that dates from early witness. Examples:

Luke 10:39

Other examples of Byzantine readings were found in p&lt;sup&gt;66&lt;/sup&gt; in John 1:32; 3:24; 4:14.51; 5:8; 6:10.57; 7:3.39; 8:41.51.55; 9:23; 10:38; 12:36; 14:17. This supports the views of scholars such as Harry Sturz (1984) and [[Maurice A. Robinson|Maurice Robinson]] (2005) that the roots of the Byzantine text may go back to a very early date. (In 1963 Bruce Metzger had argued that early support for Byzantine readings could not be taken to demonstrate that they were in the original text.)&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''Chapters in the History of New Testament Textual Criticism'', Wm. B. Eerdmans, Grand Rapids 1963, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have interpreted this as a rehabilitation of Textus Receptus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward F. Hills]], ''Dean Burgon in the Light of Recent Research''; D. A. Waite, ''Defending the King James Bible'', Bible For Today, Collingswood, New Jersey 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these readings have substantial support from other text-types and they are not distinctively Byzantine. Daniel Wallace found only two agreements distinctively between papyrus and Byzantine readings.&lt;ref&gt;D. Wallace, ''The Majority Text Theory: History, Methods, and Critique'', in Studies &amp; Documents 1995, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concept testing''' (to be distinguished from '''pre-test markets''' and '''test markets''' which may be used at a later stage of product development research)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of using surveys (and sometimes [[qualitative marketing research|qualitative methods]]) to evaluate consumer acceptance of a new product idea prior to the introduction of a product to the [[Market (economics)|market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=David|title=Concept Testing: How to Test New Product Ideas Before You Go to Market|date=1987|publisher=American Management Association|isbn=978-0814459058|edition=1st|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is '''important not to confuse''' concept testing with advertising testing, brand testing and packaging testing; as is sometimes done. Concept testing focuses on the basic product idea, without the embellishments and puffery inherent in advertising.

It is important that the instruments (questionnaires) to test the product have a high quality themselves. Otherwise, results from data gathered surveys may be biased by measurement error. That makes the design of the testing procedure more complex. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire. This can be done by:
* conducting [[cognitive pretesting|cognitive interviewing]]. By asking a faction of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can verify the viability of the cognitive interviewing.
* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.
* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest,&lt;ref&gt;Lord, F. and Novick, M. R.(1968). Statistical theories of mental test scores. Addison – Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; quasi-simplex,&lt;ref&gt;Heise, D. R.(1969). Separating reliability and stability in test-retest correlation. American Sociological Review, 34, 93-101.&lt;/ref&gt; or mutlitrait-multimethod models.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, F. M. (1984). Construct validity and error components of survey measures: a structural modelling approach. Public Opinion Quarterly, 48, 409-442.&lt;/ref&gt;
* predicting the measurement quality of the question. This can be done using the software Survey Quality Predictor (SQP).&lt;ref&gt;Saris, W. E. and Gallhofer, I. N. (2014). Design, evaluation and analysis of questionnaires for survey research. Second Edition. Hoboken, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept testing in the new product development (NPD) process is the concept generation stage. The concept generation stage of concept testing can take on many forms. Sometimes concepts are generated incidentally, as the result of technological advances. At other times concept generation is deliberate: examples include brain-storming sessions, problem detection surveys and qualitative research. While qualitative research can provide insights into the range of reactions consumers may have, it cannot provide an indication of the likely success of the new concept; this is better left to quantitative concept-test surveys.

In the early stages of concept testing, a large field of alternative concepts might exist, requiring concept-screening surveys. Concept-screening surveys provide a quick means to narrow the field of options; however they provide little depth of insight and cannot be compared to a normative database due to interactions between concepts. For greater insight and to reach decisions on whether or not pursue further product development, monadic concept-testing surveys must be conducted.

Frequently concept testing surveys are described as either monadic, sequential monadic or comparative. The terms mainly refer to how the concepts are displayed:

1.) Monadic. The concept is evaluated in isolation.
2.) Sequential monadic. Multiple concepts are evaluated in sequence (often randomized order).
3.) Comparative. Concepts are shown next to each other. 
4.) Proto-monadic. Concepts are first shown in sequence, and then next to each other.

"Monadic testing is the recommended method for most concept testing. Interaction effects and biases are avoided. Results from one test can be compared to results from previous monadic tests. A normative database can be constructed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each has its specific uses and it depends on the research objectives. The decision as to which method to use is best left to experience research professionals to decide, as there are numerous implications in terms of how the results are interpreted.

==Evaluating concept-test scores==

Traditionally concept-test survey results are compared to 'norms databases'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are databases of previous new-product concept tests. These must be 'monadic' concept tests, to prevent interaction effects. To be fair, it is important that these databases contain 'new' concept test results, not ratings of old products that consumers are already familiar with; since once consumers become familiar with a product the ratings often drop. Comparing new concept ratings to the ratings for an existing product already on the market would result in an invalid comparison, unless special precautions are taken by researchers to reduce or adjust for this effect quantitatively. Additionally, the concept is usually only compared to norms from the same product category, and the same country.

Companies that specialize in this area, tend to have developed their own unique systems, each with its own standards. Keeping to these standards consistently is important to preventing contamination of the results.

Perhaps one of the famous concept-test systems is the Nielsen Bases system, which comes in different versions. Other well-known products include Decision Analyst's 'Concept Check', Acupoll's 'Concept Optimizer', Ipsos Innoquest and GFK. Examples of smaller players include Skuuber and Acentric Express Test.

==Determining the importance of concept attributes as purchase drivers==

The simplest approach to determining attribute importance is to ask direct open-ended questions. Alternatively checklists or ratings of the importance of each product attribute may be used.

However, various debates have existed over whether or not consumers could be trusted to directly indicate the level of importance of each product attribute. As a result, correlation analysis and various forms of multiple regression have often been used for identifying importance - as an alternative to direct questions.

A complementary technique to concept testing, is conjoint analysis (also referred to as discrete choice modelling). Various forms of conjoint analysis and discrete choice modelling exist. While academics stress the differences between the two, in practice there is often little difference. 
These techniques estimate the importance of product attributes indirectly, by creating alternative products according to an experimental design, and then using consumer responses to these alternatives (usually ratings of purchase likelihood or choices made between alternatives) to estimate importance. The results are often expressed in the form of a 'simulator' tool which allows clients to test alternative product configurations and pricing.

'''Volumetric concept testing'''

Volumetric concept testing falls somewhere between traditional concept testing and pre-test market models (simulated test market models are similar but emphasize greater realism) in terms of the level of complexity. The aim is to provide 'approximate' sales volume forecasts for the new concept prior to launch. They incorporate other variables beyond just input from the concept test survey itself, such as the distribution strategy.

Examples of volumetric forecasting methodologies include 'Acupoll Foresight'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ForeSIGHT™ Going-Year Volume Estimates|url=http://www.acupoll.com/volume-forecasts|website=Acupoll|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Decision Analyst's 'Conceptor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptor® Volumetric Forecasting|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/analytics/volumetric/|website=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=3|date=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models (more properly referred to as 'pre-test market models' or 'simulated test markets')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; gather additional data from a follow-up product testing survey (especially in the case of consumer packaged goods as repeat purchase rates need to be estimated). They may also include advertisement testing component that aims to assess advertising quality. Some such as Decision Analyst, include discrete choice models / conjoint analysis.

'''Conservation and restoration of objects made from plastics'''  is an activity dedicated to the [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of objects of historical and personal value made from [[plastics]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]. Within museum collections there are a variety of artworks and artifacts that are composed of [[plastic]] material whether they are [[Synthetic plastic|synthetic]] or semi-synthetic; these were created for a range of uses from artistic, to technical, to domestic use. Plastics have become an integral component of life and many plastic objects have become staple icons or objects worth preserving for the future.  Although relatively new material for museum collections, plastics having originated in the 19th century, they are deteriorating at an alarming rate, risking the loss not only of the objects themselves, but through their deterioration processes they place objects within their vicinity at risk too.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plastics are made of synthetic, semi-synthetic and organic material, all of which are susceptible to degradation, with their respective off-gassing being harmful to the objects nearby in museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|pmc=2874019|title=Our Plastic Age|last=Thompson|first=Richard|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent changes in plastic manufacturing, as a result of environmental concerns, towards [[biodegradable plastics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about/media/what-you-can-do-keep-plastic-out-ocean.html|title=What You Can Do to Keep Plastic out of the Ocean {{!}} response.restoration.noaa.gov|website=response.restoration.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a potentially negative effect upon the long term stability of such objects within museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madden|first=Odile|date=Spring 2014|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material, a Maturing Profession spring 2014. Conservation of plastics|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/pdf/v29n1.pdf|journal=Conservation Perspectives the GCI Newsletter|volume=|pages=4–9|via=The Getty Conservation Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Identification and composition of plastics  ==
All plastics vary by the type of polymer used to create it, these polymers are what conservators look to in order to divide plastics into groupings that could best help create a preservation or restoration plan. Groupings are important as some plastics can be dangerous or even flammable thus it is key to identify these plastics in order to best understand how to store and care for them.

== Identifying plastics ==
Identification of plastic in a collection is extremely important because all plastics release a harmful toxin or gas that can damage nearby objects and by being able to identity the most harmful plastics a preservation plan can be set into place to slow down the effects and protect other objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Plastics are identified in three ways including looking for its trade name, trademark or patent number. Identifying plastic is done in order to  check what the plastic is composed of as different makers and depending on the year are different material could have been used to make the plastic.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2010|title=Care and Identification of Objects Made from Plastic|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/08-04.pdf|journal=Conserve O Gram|volume=|pages=|via=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is no marker to identify the type of plastic used then it can be identified by using various types of data analyzed using [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] technology like, [[Optical spectrometer|Optical Spectroscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] and [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infared spectroscopy]] along with [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other forms of identification include [[elemental analysis]], thermal analysis to decipher the composition of plastics.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Once the composition is found it is best to determine if the plastic in the collection will be considered Malignant or not.

[http://www.modip.ac.uk/ MoDiP], the Museum of Design in plastics,  has created a guide to plastic objects that includes the objects  manufacturing date,  manufacturing process along with its typical characteristics such as feel and smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modip.ac.uk/resources/curators_guide/A-Z_plastics|title=A - Z of plastics materials {{!}} Museum of Design in Plastics, MoDiP|website=www.modip.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because if an object in the collection that is listed here differs from smell or touch then it could be the object has begun to deteriorate. It is also encouraged that if one has an object not listed then they should contact MoDiP to include it to the list.

== Common plastics ==
These are plastics that are still capable of degradation but its effects are not as harmful to nearby objects.The list below is of chemical compositions that make up common plastics found in museum collections:
* Cellulose Esters&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/preserving.html|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material a Maturing Profession (Feature)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plasticized PVC,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ([[Polyvinyl chloride|Polyvinyl Chloride]], PVC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-pvc-plastic|title=Everything You Need To Know About PVC Plastic|last=Staff|first=Creative Mechanisms|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are plastics that will age faster if left untreated and have a higher potential or off-gassing or release a toxin that can damage surrounding objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To determine if objects are considered malignant proper identification of the object will be necessary.  
* [[Polyvinyl chloride|Poly(Vinyl Chloride)]]
* [[Cellulose nitrate|Cellulose Nitrate]]
* [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]]
* [[Vulcanization|Vulcanized Rubber]] 
* [[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]]

[[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]] have become an issue because as plastic is used in many everyday objects the push to create biodegradable plastics has been on the rise. This causes an issue for conservators because these object will ultimately degrade as their composition is designed to as there is an increase in plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is these biodegradable plastics that can be prove to be difficult and museums will need to provide research for these items quickly to slow done their deterioration.

== Deterioration ==
Perhaps the most difficult part about plastic deterioration is that one cannot visibly see what types of chemical reactions are occurring inside the polymer or even identity the type of plastic until it is too late. Typically all plastics will give off a distinct odor, leak toxins, or will begin to shrink or crack in some way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/network/identification-of-plastics-by-looking-touching-and-smelling|title=Identification of plastics by looking, touching and smelling|work=Blog|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although deterioration will inevitably happen it is important to know  the causes of it and be able to mitigate it.

=== Causes of deterioration  ===
The cause of deterioration regarding plastics can be linked to age, chemical composition, storage, and improper handling of the objects. Conservators are in place to slow down the processes of deterioration by considering the 4 leading caused of deterioration:

# '''Age'''-  when plastics were first manufactured in the 19th century they were composed of semi-organic material, thus these over the years these objects have deteriorated due to lack of research and improper handling of these plastics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Without enough time to care for objects the older objects have deteriorated. 
# '''Chemical''' - Depending on the objects' chemical composition, conservators can understand how it will react overtime. Other chemical reactions come from heat, oxygen, light, liquids, additives and biological attacks as these can cause a reaction in the polymer to speed up deterioration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Chemical reactions are also caused by objects coming into contact with water and oxygen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
# '''Storage-'''  When objects are improperly stored is when contamination and deterioration can occur. This often occurs when temperature or relative humidity fluctuate in the storage area as this causes the polymers to react to the environment and will begin to deteriorate and possible contaminate surrounding objects. Storage should also be thought of as when an object is on exhibit as this is when the object is on display with lights and its temperature and humidity can fluctuate, being able to create a plan to adjust the exhibit case while on display can help prevent any damage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# '''Improper handling''' - This is due in part to improper cleaning techniques when using water or solvents on material that do not support those cleaning methods.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Also when handling the objects human error can occur that can cause abrasions or scratches.

=== Types of deterioration  ===
Understanding the different types of plastic chemical degradation as this helps determine what not to expose plastics to  As the polymers that are composed of the plastics can deteriorate easily by changes in temperature, water or light it is important to understand how these affect the polymers. Listed below are the chemical reactions that occur with the deterioration of the polymer's structure.

* '''Photo-oxidative degradation''' refers to plastic object degrading by being exposed to UV and Visible Light although the type of wavelength that will damage the plastic depends on the composition of the polymer.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Balijit|date=2007|title=Mechanistic Implications of Plastic Degradation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391007003539|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume=93|pages=561–584|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; In General however, plastic will be affected by light and it is best practice to keep plastic away from light sources as much as possible. 
* '''[[Thermal degradation of polymers|Thermal degradation]]''' affects the whole unit of the polymer that the object is composed of and is affected by the temperature and amount of light the object is exposed to.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
* '''Ozone-Induced degradation''' will deteriorate saturated and  unsaturated polymers when the polymer is exposed to "ozone in the air" will speed the process of deterioration.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A test is conducted to see if the objects has been exposed by taking small samples and analyzed using an [[FTIR]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''[[Catalysis|Catalytic Degradation]]''' Mainly focuses on plastic waste polymers as they are transformed into hydrocarbons
* '''[[Biodegradation]]''' is when the surface or the strength of the plastic changes, these properties allow it to decompose or mineralize by carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''Decomposition of Hydroperoxides''' is when metal and metal ions are found on the plastic material as this can also lead to the deterioration of the object&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2012|title=Physical and Chemical processes leading to deterioration  of original properties of plastic|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/4_Degradation/2_Physical_and_chemical_processes/4_2_PhysicalAndChemicalProcessesLeadingToDeterioration.pdf|journal=Processes Leading to the Deterioration of Plastics|volume=|pages=|via=POPART}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For plastics composed of [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]] the  most common sign of  deterioration condition is when it this type is exposed to water, it will give off a smell of vinegar ([[Vinegar syndrome]]),  its surface will have  a white powder residue  and it will begin to shrink.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Cellulose Acetate butyrate and Cellulose butyrate will produce [[butyric acid]] which has a "vomit odor".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Polyvinyl chloride|Poly(Vinyl Chloride]]) will most likely cause a blooming effect, white spores, on the surface that if it comes into contact with other surrounding material it will contaminate it.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Preventative care  ==
=== Handling ===
Safety gloves such as those made of Nitrile can help prevent toxins entering the skin when handling plastic objects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As plastics can ooze or off-gas material that may or may not be visible to the naked eye wearing gloves other than cotton is recommended.

=== Storage environment ===
Proper storage of plastics can help slow down the degrading process of plastics. Plastics are currently stored with a RH Level of 50% with the storage temperature at 18 degrees Celsius with no light coming into contact with the objects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|date=2014|title=A Safe Space Storage Strategies for Plastics|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/storage.html|journal=Conservation Perspectives|volume=29|pages=|via=http://getty.edu/conservation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the composition of each plastic material can be different it is difficult to determine one unifying storage care plan ,thus  understanding the composition of the plastic can help determine their preferred climate levels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Keeping plastics at a stable low temperature or considering placing these objects either in cold storage or in oxygen impermeable bags helps slow degradation.

Monitoring plastics in their storage environment is done by keeping track of their status and condition by using log entries on Excel spreadsheets or another format. To monitoring their temperature environment this is done using data loggers which track hourly changes in temperature. These methods can help strengthen a plan of preventative care as monitoring their status along with temperature can help connect any changes that occur.

=== Long-term storage equipment ===
Adsorbents such as "activated carbon, silica gel and zeolites"  are used as they can help with the gasses that are released from plastics as this material can help slow down the degrading process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These absorbents can also be used when the object is on display to prevent and off-gassing that could occur, so these can be used on exhibit and long-term storage. Absorbents along with acid-free boxes and silica gel can help slow down the process of degradation and [[Cellulose acetate film|vinegar syndrome]] which is common in film, Lego and artwork. A yearly check up of plastic objects can help monitor the condition of plastic objects as well as the condition of the surrounding objects to ensure they have not been contaminated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Objects composed of Cellulose Nitrate  benefit from cold storage as they are sensitive to increases in temperature.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''[http://www.gaylord.com/Preservation/Conservation-Supplies/Wrapping%2C-Lining-%26-Support-Materials/Marvelseal%26%23174%3B-360-Barrier-Film-%2850-ft-%29/p/M3650 Oxygen Impermeable bags]''' are used as they absorb all the oxygen in the bag.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With no oxygen to trigger the event of deterioration that is used for some plastics the process may be slowed down.

== Conservation   ==
The process of conservation and restoration of plastics requires an understanding of composition of the plastic and an appreciation for the possible methods of restoring plastics and their limitations, as well as an appreciation for the post-treatment preventive care of the object.

=== Cleaning ===
The process of cleaning plastics is done through the use of solvents or using modern technology after identifying the polymers that make up the composition of the plastic. Cleaning can still be done using water or solvents however,  solvents run the risk of physically damaging the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/5_Active_conservation/1_Conservation_of_plastics_in_collections/5_1_Introduction.pdf|title=Studies in Active Conservation of Plastic Artefacts in Museums|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|publisher=POPART|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spot test can be performed if uncertain how the object will react to water or solvents.

Light cleaning on the object is possible, but if cleaning requires a heavy hand then the use of  an Erbium: YAG Laser could assist in cleaning tougher scratches or abrasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/eryag-laser|title=Er:YAG laser - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Scratch removal ===
Within the field of contemporary art, where the finish is part of the artists intent the removal of scratches plays a far greater role than it would with social-historical artifacts, as such conservators have undertaken, and scientifically investigated, a variety of methods of scratch removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laganà|first=Ana|date=2014|title=Looking through Plastics: Investigating options for the treatment of scratches, abrasions, and losses in cast unsaturated polyester works of art|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/cons_plastics/related_mats.html|journal=COM-CC 17th Triennial Conference Preprints,|volume=|pages=|via=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/art_LA/paper_2014_icom_cc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filling ===
Fillings are used if the object has suffered considerable damage. The process of filling depends on the objects chemical composition consisting  of- refractive indexes, transparency, low viscosity, and its compatibility with the rest of the object.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/conservation-journal/the-use-of-lasers-in-the-conservation-of-museum-objects-made-from-plastics|title=The use of lasers in the conservation of museum objects made from plastics|work=Blog|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Greetham''' (born October 21, 1941) is an Anglo-American literary critic and the founder of the [[Society for Textual Scholarship]].

==Career==

Greetham received his undergraduate degree from the [[University of Oxford]] in 1963 and completed his Ph.D. in English at the [[City University of New York]].

[[Marta Werner]] of [[D'Youville College]] describes Greetham as "drawn to texts that spill over the boundaries of genre, that exist in multiple versions, that explore intertextuality, and that complicate in various other ways the notion of text as fixed or stable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warner|first1=Marta|title=Post-Everything|journal=Text|date=2003|volume=15|pages=337–349|ref=post_everything|jstor=30227799}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his works, Greetham has sought to co-opt "the terminology
and practice of literary theory in re-designating textual operations in
the guise of ... literature, anthropology, sociology,
gender studies, history, political science, linguistics, psychology, [and]
philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greetham|first1=David C.|title=Theories of the Text|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67Yg06eUaDkC|accessdate=15 April 2015|ref=theories_text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a theorist of scholarly editing, Greetham has taken up a middle ground between [[intentionalist]] positions like that of [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] and the [[social textual criticism]] of [[Jerome McGann]], maintaining the goal of establishing an authoritative text while allowing the possibility that multiple authorized versions can exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathijsen|first1=Marita|title=The Concept of Authorisation|journal=Text|date=2002|volume=14|pages=85–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his later work, Greetham has moved away from the idea that an editor can establish a "psychic" connection with the author through which he or she can determine the author's true intentions, instead seeing editing as an occasion for reflections on the ideology underlying scholarly practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Werner|first1=Marta|title=Signals from a Distance: Editing, Telepathy, Elegy|journal=Textual Cultures|date=2008|volume=3|issue=1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society for Textual Scholarship==

Greetham was one of the founders of the Society for Textual Scholarship and served as the Society's President from 1999 to 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Society for Textual Scholarship|journal=Textual Cultures|date=Spring 2011|volume=6|issue=1|pages=166–169|jstor=10.2979/textcult.6.1.166|ref=soc_text|doi=10.2979/textcult.6.1.166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1979, the Society provides an interdisciplinary forum for presentation of research in a number of textual disciplines. Notable past members have included [[G. Thomas Tanselle]], [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], [[Fredson Bowers]], and [[Jerome McGann]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2292">'''Democratic rationalization''' is term used by [[Andrew Feenberg]] in his article "Subversive Rationalization: Technology, Power and Democracy with technology."  Feenberg argues against the idea of ''[[technological determinism]]'' citing flaws in its two fundamental theses.

The first is the ''thesis of unilinear progress''.  This is the belief that technological progress follows a direct and predictable path from lower to higher levels of complexity and that each stage along this path is necessary for progress to occur ([[Feenberg]] 211).

The second is the ''thesis of determination by the base''.  This is the concept that  in a society where a technology had been introduced, that society must organize itself or adapt to the technology ([[Feenberg]] 211).

In his argument against the former thesis [[Feenberg]] says that [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] studies of technology will lead us to realize that there is not a set path by which development of technologies occur but rather an emerging of similar technologies at the same time leading to a multiplicity of choices.  These choices are made based upon certain social factors and upon examining them we will see that they are not deterministic in nature ([[Feenberg]] 212).

Arguing against the latter thesis, [[Feenberg]] calls to our attention social reforms that have been mandated by governments mainly in regards to the protection of its citizens and laborers.  Most of the time these mandates are widely accepted after being passed through the governing body. At which point technology and industry will reform and re-evolve to meet the new standards in a way that has greater efficiency than it did so previously ([[Feenberg]] 214)

Despite purported and intended benefits, systematic studies have not shown benefits to diversity training and instead show that they backfire and lead to reductions in diversity and to discrimination complaints being taken less seriously.&lt;ref name="ethics.harvard.edu"&gt;{{Cite web | last1 = Dobbin | first1 = Frank | last2 = Kalev | first2 = Alexandra | url = http://ethics.harvard.edu/blog/why-diversity-management-backfires-and-how-firms-can-make-it-work|title=Why Diversity Management Backfires (And How Firms Can Make it Work)|website=ethics.harvard.edu | publisher = [[Edmond J.

==Controversial issues==
According to Hans Bader, its opponents consider it an oppressive [[ideology]] and reeducation tactic that actually reduces the ability of organizations to attain their goals. It has been suggested that diversity training reinforces differences between individuals instead of fostering their commonalities, thus helping to further racialize the workplace, creating situations where people "tiptoe" around issues such as how to relate to people of different cultures as opposed to people learning to [[communicate]] with and truly understand each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bader | first = Hans | url = https://cei.org/blog/diversity-training-backfires | title = Diversity training backfires | publisher = [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] | website = cei.org| date = 26 December 2007 | access-date = 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs which established specific responsibility for diversity, such as [[equal opportunity]] staff positions or diversity task forces, have proven most effective in general. However, the results also indicate that [[White people|White]] females benefit significantly more from diversity training. The benefits for [[African American]] females and males were appreciably lower than European American females. [[Social network|Networking]] and [[mentor]]ing, which were considered bias mitigating approaches, served [[African Americans|African American]] females the most. African American males were the least likely to benefit from any of the methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kalev | first1 = Alexandra | last2 = Dobbin | first2 = Frank | last3 = Kelly | first3 = Erin | title = Best practices or best guesses? Assessing the efficacy of corporate affirmative action and diversity policies | journal = [[American Sociological Review]] | volume = 71 | issue = 4 | pages = 589&amp;ndash;617 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/000312240607100404 | date = August 2006 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/000312240607100404 | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sue Steiner and collaborators have advocated that controversy be used as a cooperative learning style. They argue that attempting to see both sides of a controversial issue builds empathy and allows working environments to function better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = Sue | last2 = Brzuzy | first2 = Stephanie | last3 = Gerdes | first3 = Karen | last4 = Hurdle | first4 = Donna | title = Using structured controversy to teach diversity content and cultural competence | journal = Journal of Teaching in Social Work | volume = 23 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 55&amp;ndash;71 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | date = 2003 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J067v23n01_05 | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexandra Kalev conducted a comprehensive review of cultural diversity training conducted in 830 midsize to large U.S. workplaces over a thirty one year period&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/19/AR2008011901899.html|title=Most Diversity Training Ineffective, Study Finds|last=Vedantam|first=Shankar|date=2008-01-20|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The results showed that diversity training was followed by a 7.5 percent drop in the number of women in management. The percentage of black men in top positions fell by 12 percent. Black, female managers fell by 10 percent. Similar effects were shown for Latinos and Asians. The study did not find that all diversity training is ineffective. Mandatory training programs offered to protect against discrimination lawsuits were called into question. Voluntary diversity training participation to advance organization’s business goals was associated with increased diversity at the management level.

== Purported benefits ==
An analysis of data from over 800 firms over 30 years shows that diversity training and grievance procedures backfires and leads to reductions in the diversity of the firms workforce.&lt;ref name="ethics.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt; Other research shows that people "were less likely to take discrimination complaints seriously against companies who had diversity programs".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news| last = McElroy | first = Molly | url = http://www.washington.edu/news/2013/04/03/diversity-programs-give-illusion-of-corporate-fairness-study-shows/ | title = Diversity programs give illusion of corporate fairness, study shows | work = UW Today | publisher = [[University of Washington]] | date = 3 April 2013 |access-date=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As organizations and communities are becoming more [[Globalization|globalized]], there is a need for an expansion in relation to communication among individuals from all over the world, operating within a diverse environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240550|title=The Myriad Benefits of Diversity in the Workplace|last=Abreu|first=Kim|work=[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]|access-date= 13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe it is beneficial for companies to train a diverse staff, as a reflection of the market in which you wish to serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Armache | first = Jalal | title = Diversity in the workplace: benefits and challenges | journal = Journal of International Diversity | volume = 2012 | issue = 1 | pages = 59&amp;ndash;75 | publisher = | date = March 2012 | url = http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/75172682/diversity-workplace-benefits-challenges | ref = harv | postscript = . }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jalai Armache, in a heterogeneous workplace environment filled with people knowledgeable of those with different backgrounds and nationalities, there is ability to easily expand an organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17541">'''Drug education''' is the planned provision of information, resources, and skills relevant to living in a world where [[drugs|psychoactive substances]] are widely available and commonly used for a variety of both medical and non-medical purposes, some of which may lead to harms such as [[drug overdose|overdose]], [[injury]], infectious [[disease]] (such as [[HIV]] or [[hepatitis C]]), or [[substance dependence|addiction]].

==Benefits==
Planning includes developing strategies for helping children and young people engage with relevant drug-related issues during opportunistic and brief contacts with them as well as during more structured sessions.  Drug education enables children, youth and adults to develop the knowledge, skills and attitudes to appreciate the benefits of living healthily (which may or may not include the use of psychoactive substances), promote responsibility towards the use of drugs and relate these to their own actions and those of others, both now and in their future lives. It also provides opportunities for people to reflect on their own and others' attitudes to various psychoactive substances, their use and the people who use them.

==Drug education campaigns &amp; programs==
Drug education can be given in numerous forms, some more effective than others. Examples include [[advertising]] and awareness raising campaigns such as the UK Government’s [[FRANK (drugs)|FRANK]] campaign or the US "media campaign".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediacampaign.org/ Media campaign]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there are school based drug education programs like [[Drug Abuse Resistance Education|DARE]] or that currently being evaluated by the UK Blueprint Programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.gov.uk/young-people/blueprint Blueprint], ''Home office.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; In efforts to prevent problematic substance use, drug education may perpetuate myths and stereotypes about psychoactive substances and people who use them.&lt;ref name=Tupper&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Drugs, discourses and education: A critical discourse analysis of a high school drug education text|journal=Discourse: Studies in the Cultural Politics of Education|year=2008|volume=29|issue=2|pages=223–238|doi=10.1080/01596300801966864}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Drug education can also take less explicit forms; an example of this is the Positive Futures Programme, funded by the UK government as part of its drug strategy. This programme uses [[sport]] and the [[arts]] as catalysts to engage young people on their own turf, putting them in contact with positive role models (coaches/trained youth workers). After building a trusting relationship with a young person, these role models can gradually change attitudes towards drug use and steer the young person back into education, [[training]] and [[employment]]. This approach reaches young people who have dropped out of mainstream education. It also has additional benefits for the community in reduced [[crime]] and [[anti-social behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugs.gov.uk/publication-search/young-people/0607_YPSMPG11 Positive Futures Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

==School-based drug education ==
School-based drug education began with the anti-alcohol "[[temperance (virtue)|temperance]] education" programmes of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in the United States and Canada in the late 19th century.&lt;ref name=Beck&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beck|first=Jerome|title=100 years of 'just say no' versus 'just say know': Reevaluating drug education goals for the coming century|journal=Evaluation Review|year=1998|volume=22|issue=1|pages=15–45|doi=10.1177/0193841x9802200102}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In many respects, the WCTU's [[progressive education]] agenda set the template for much of what has been done since in the name of drug education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Sex, Drugs and the Honour Roll: The Perennial Challenges of Addressing Moral Purity Issues in Schools|journal=Critical Public Health|year=2013|volume=24|issue=2|pages=115–131|doi=10.1080/09581596.2013.862517}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Past research into drug education has indicated that to be effective it must involve engaging, interactive learning strategies that stimulate higher-order thinking, promote learning and be transferable to real life circumstances. Current challenges from this approach exist in adopting evidence-based school drug education programmes.&lt;ref name=Cahil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cahil|first=H. W.|title=Challenges in adopting evidence-based school drug education programmes|journal=Drug &amp; Alcohol Review|year=2007|volume=26|issue=6|pages=673–679|doi=10.1080/09595230701613593}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 June 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, in the majority of countries where preventive drug education programs and courses exist, they are established and funded by the Government. These education programs aim to educate adolescents about [[Recreational drug use|illicit drug use]] in an effort to prevent illegal drug use while highlighting the dangers of [[substance abuse|problematic substance use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Midford|first=R|title=Is Australia ‘fair dinkum’ about drug education in schools?|journal=Drug &amp; Alcohol Review|year=2007|volume=26|issue=4|pages=421–427|doi=10.1080/09595230701373842}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 June 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Government]] has implemented a range of drug education programs through the [[National Drug Education Strategy (NDES)]] by providing schools with effective drug education programmes. The program aims  to manage drug related issues and incidents within schools .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Schools Drug Education Strategy 2009|url=http://www.education.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2203/NationalDrugEducationStrategy.pdf|work=Northern Territory Government|publisher=Department of Education and Children Services|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421035758/http://www.education.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2203/NationalDrugEducationStrategy.pdf|archivedate=21 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December 2015 the [http://www.health.gov.au/ Australian Government Department of Health] launched the [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] portal as part of its response to the findings from the National Ice Taskforce report.&lt;ref&gt;Grass roots a key to tackling ice https://www.health.gov.au/internet/ministers/publishing.nsf/Content/health-mediarel-yr2015-nash053.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prime Minister of Australia, JOINT DOORSTOP INTERVIEW, SYDNEY https://www.pm.gov.au/media/2015-12-06/joint-doorstop-interview-sydney&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] is an online portal that facilitates access to interactive evidence-based drug education resources and prevention programs for school communities. [http://www.positivechoices.org.au Positive Choices] builds on existing drug education resources developed by researchers at the [https://ndarc.med.unsw.edu.au/ National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC)] such as the [https://www.climateschools.com.au/ Climate Schools programs] that have been proven to reduce alcohol and drug related harms and increase student well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Champion|title=A cross-validation trial of an Internet-based prevention program for alcohol and cannabis: Preliminary results from a cluster randomised controlled trial|journal=Aust NZ J Psychiatry|date=2015|volume=50|pages=64–73|doi=10.1177/0004867415577435|url=http://anp.sagepub.com/content/50/1/64|accessdate=2 February 2016|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newton, N.|title=Internet-based prevention for alcohol and cannabis use: final results of the Climate Schools course|journal=Addiction|date=2010|volume=105|issue=4|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02853.x/full|accessdate=2 February 2016|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02853.x|pages=749–759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Newton, N.|title=Delivering prevention for alcohol and cannabis using the internet: A cluster randomised controlled trial|journal=Preventive Medicine|date=2009|volume=48|issue=6|pages=579–584|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743509002072|accessdate=2 February 2016|ref=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743509002072|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Department of Health and Aging]] identified that analgesics (90%), alcohol (80-90%) and tobacco (30-60%) were the most widely utilised substances among adolescents. In addition to this, cannabis was another commonly used illicit substance that accounted for 33% usage among adolescents aged 14–17 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton|first=B|title=School drug education in New South Wales: Moral panic and the individualisation youth drug use|journal=Social Alternatives|year=2005|volume=24|issue=4|pages=50–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to government funded programs, a number of not-for-profit organisations (such as [[Life Education Australia]] also provide drug education programs to adolescents. These preventative programs aim to deliver a progressive approach that will motivate and encourage young people to make positive decisions in life. Emphasis within these programs is also placed in focusing on deterring [[peer pressure]] as a means of empowering adolescents and promoting autonomy. This approach reaches 750,000 primary and secondary students in Australia each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joyce|first=R|author2=O’Connor, L.|title=Life Education: Research and Evaluation.|journal=Life Education|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== D.A.R.E, Drug Abuse Resistance Education ==
D.A.R.E stands for Drug Abuse Resistance Education. In the United States, D.A.R.E is implemented in elementary school classrooms, 5th grade to educate students on drugs effects and temptations they may encounter. The program implemented in public and private school systems to prepare 5th graders for middle school, as well as all further education.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukes|first=Richard L.|last2=Stein|first2=Judith A.|date=August 1997|title=Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)|url=|journal=Evaluation Review|volume=21.4|pages=483|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;Although D.A.R.E is implemented to prevent students from doing drugs in the future, there is little evidence to suggest it actually prevents students from doing drugs. In the article, “Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education” by Dukes and Stein, a [[chi-squared test]] was performed to see if there was a significant difference between high school students that received D.A.R.E training and those who did not receive D.A.R.E and its relation to drug use. The study found that there is no significant difference between the drug use of students that received D.A.R.E and students that did not. One of the main reasons the authors mentioned D.A.R.E had little correlation with Drug use is that there are other external causes that only affect some students, which can lead them into the direction of drug use. Additionally, the time that students received D.A.R.E (5th grade), and the time that the students encounter drugs may be many years after, so students may have little remembrance of the program. However, the United States schools continue to implement the program in classrooms because the police officers that come into classrooms can serve as community role models to students, and all students are different so it may steer them away from drugs in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dukes|first=Richard L.|last2=Stein|first2=Judith A.|date=August 1997|title=Long-Term Impact of Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE)|url=|journal=Evaluation Review|volume=21.4|pages=483|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Steroid use in high schools ==
Steroid use is a common form of drug use in high schools across the United States. Many students, specifically males, use steroids to increase their performance in athletic events. Many professional athletes, for example professional cyclist, Lance Armstrong, and former professional MLB player, Alex Rodriguez both were nationally recognized as steroid users. Additionally in an article in the ''Journal of Molecular &amp; Cellular Endocrinology,'' it states that in a survey of  212 Canadian national track athletes, over 10% of them would take an illegal drug if it was undetectable, if it could help them win an Olympic gold medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anawalt|first=Bradley D.|date=March 2018|title=Detection of Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Use by Elite Athletes and by Members of the General Public|url=|journal=Molecular &amp; Cellular Endocrinology|volume=464|pages=21-27|via=EBSCOhost, doi:10.1016/j.mce.2017.09.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many adolescents idolize athletes, so when they find out there is a way to enhance their performance, and that elite athletes are using them, steroids may be used by students. 

An article in the ''Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Substance Abuse'' ran a study on two southern California high schools in middle class suburbs, and the high school students use of Anabolic Androgenic Steroids. It surveyed students on if they use steroids, knew the side effects of steroids, and additionally their use of other prevalent drugs. The article specifically found that male students that were athletes were more likely to use steroids than students that are female or non- athlete students in general. Most students that participated in steroids played the sports, football or soccer, and were most likely to do steroids if they participated in both sports. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorang|first=Melissa|date=September 2011|title=Anabolic Androgenic Steroid Use in Teens: Prevalence, Demographics, and Perception of Effects|url=|journal=Journal of Child &amp; Adolescent Substance Abuse|volume=20|pages=358–369|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;Professional sports, influence young athletes, and when pro- athletes participate in drugs, it can lead young adults to use drugs without realizing the side effects and consequences that come along with drug use.

Also, a study in the ''journal of Drugs: Education, Prevention &amp; Policy'' discusses alcohol and drug prevention programs in Australia for students in grades 8 and 9. It goes into detail about the student's between 13 and 15 years old, to see if alcohol and drug prevention programs have an actual effect on preventing substance abuse. The study comes to conclusion that when the students went through a drug and alcohol prevention program, they were less likely to develop a drug or alcohol problem. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Midford|first=Richard|last2=et al.|date=April 2012|title=Alcohol Prevention: What Can Be Expected of a Harm Reduction? Focused School Drug Education Program?|url=|journal=Drugs: Education, Prevention &amp; Policy|volume=19, no. 2|pages=102-110|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology and Drug Education ==
The University of North Carolina Greensboro has researched the drug prevention program, All Stars, Sr.,. The program is developing education through technology (videos), so that health education programs could reach schools in rural communities. The technology programs would provide drug/ health education in general with qualified instructors, in areas that do not have programs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wyrick|first=David L|last2=et. al|date=July 2010|title=Going the Distance: Delivery of High School Drug Prevention via Distance Education|url=|journal=American Journal of Distance Education|volume=24.3|pages=151-162|via=EBSCOhost,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation ==
Recent studies have identified that a gap between the theory of education programmes and the implementation exists.&lt;ref name=Cahil/&gt; This is regards to the collaborative learning approach and difficulties with teachers adopting these interactive drug education programmes. The practical implications of these findings are that professional training and support are required to increase the effectiveness of teaching staff, and the uniform implementation of drug curriculum.&lt;ref name=Cahil/&gt; Additional drug education research in the future should acknowledge the complexities of implementing these programmes in a school environment. Furthermore, additional support for teachers, counselors, school administrators and other education professionals should be integrated as a means of being realistic about what constitutes effective drug education and maintaining a high quality standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|title=Teaching teachers to just say 'know': Reflections on drug education|journal=Teaching and Teacher Education|year=2008|volume=24|issue=2|pages=356–367|doi=10.1016/j.tate.2007.08.007}}&lt;!--|accessdate=December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4734">'''[[Ecological]] [[goods and services]]''' ('''EG&amp;S''') are the benefits arising from the ecological functions of [[ecosystems]]. Such benefits accrue to all [[Organism|living organisms]], including animals and plants, rather than to humans alone. However, there is a growing recognition of the importance to society that ecological goods and services provide for health, social, cultural, and economic needs. 

==Introduction==
Examples of ecological goods include [[Air pollution|clean air]], and abundant [[fresh water]]. Examples of ecological services include purification of air and water, maintenance of biodiversity, decomposition of wastes, soil and vegetation generation and renewal, pollination of crops and natural vegetation, groundwater recharge through wetlands, [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], [[greenhouse gas]] mitigation, and aesthetically pleasing landscapes. The products and processes of ecological goods and services are complex and occur over long periods of time. They are a sub-category of [[public goods]].

The concern over ecological goods and services arises because we are losing them at an unsustainable rate, and therefore [[land use]] managers must devise a host of tools to encourage the provision of more ecological goods and services. Rural and suburban settings are especially important, as lands that are developed and converted from their natural state lose their ecological functions. Therefore, ecological goods and services provided by privately held lands become increasingly important.

==Markets==
A market may be created wherein ecological goods and services are demanded by society and supplied by public and private landowners.  Some believe that [[public land]]s alone are not adequate to supply this market, and that privately held lands are needed to close this gap. What has emerged is the notion that rural landowners who provide ecological goods and services to society through good stewardship practices on their land should be duly compensated. The main tool to accomplish this to date has been to pay farmers directly to set-aside portions of their land that would otherwise be in production. This exemplifies a shift in thinking from the "polluter pays" to the "beneficiary pays". 

Financial incentives to landowners is one approach, but provision of EG&amp;S can also be achieved through regulation, stewardship incentives under existing programs such Environmental Farm Plans, [[market-based instruments]], and tax rebates.

==Biodiversity and EGS==
According to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110423003943/http://www.maweb.org/en/index.aspx Millennium Ecosystem Assessment] project, [[biodiversity]] is a necessary underlying component of ecological goods and services.  Biodiversity supports ecological goods and services such as [[biological control]] and [[Genetics|genetic]] resources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Costanza|Costanza, R.]], d'Arge, R., de Groot, R., Farber, S., Grasso, M., Hannon, B., Limburg, K., Naeem, S., O'Neill, R., Paruelo, J., Raskin, R.G., Sutton, P. &amp; van den Belt, M. (1997). The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' '''387''':253-260&lt;/ref&gt;  However, biodiversity is also sometimes referred to as an actual ecological good or service which can be confusing.  

==Policy tools==
The following policy tools can be used to ensure production of ecological goods and services:&lt;ref&gt;[[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Quebec)|Agriculture, Pêcheries et Alimentation]], Quebec. (2005). Remuneration for ecological goods and services produced by agriculture: Elements for a Quebec analysis.{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in French)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13071">The '''economics of science''' aims to understand the impact of [[science]] on the advance of 
[[technology]], to explain the behavior of scientists, and to understand the efficiency or 
inefficiency of scientific institutions and markets.

The importance of the [[economics]] as science is substantially due to the importance of science as a driver of technology and technology as a driver of productivity and growth.  Believing that science matters, economists have attempted to understand the behavior of scientists and the 
operation of scientific institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur M. Diamond, Jr. (2008). "science, economics of," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, Basingstoke and New York: [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. Pre-publication [https://archive.is/20120927155248/http://cba.unomaha.edu/faculty/adiamond/web/diamondpdfs/palgraveeconsci07.pdf cached ccpy.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science as a Public Good==
Economists consider “science” as the search and production of knowledge using known starting conditions.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audretsch|first1=David|last2=Bozeman|first2=Barry|last3=Combs|first3=Kathryn|last4=Feldman|first4=Maryann|last5=Link|first5=Albert|last6=Siegel|first6=Donald|last7=Stephan|first7=Paula|last8=Tassey|first8=Gregory|last9=Wessner|first9=Charles|title=The Economics of Science and Technology|journal=The Journal of Technology Transfer|date=April 2002|volume=27|issue=2|pages=155–203|doi=10.1023/A:1014382532639|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1014382532639|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge can be considered a [[public good]], due to the fact that its utility to society is not diminished with additional consumption (non-[[rivalry (economics)|rivalry]]), and once the knowledge is shared with the public it becomes very hard to restrict access to it or use of it (non-[[excludable]]). Traditional public economic theory asserts that competitive markets provide poor incentives for production of a public good because the producers cannot reap the benefits of use of their product, and thus costs will be higher than benefits. Economists have identified several possible reasons as to why producers of science might determine that the private costs they incur in the production process are larger than the benefits that they intend to reap, even though the benefits to society are greater than these costs.&lt;ref name="Callon, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callon|first1=Michel|title=Is Science a Public Good?|journal=Science, Technology, and Human Values|date=October 1, 1994|volume=19|issue=4|pages=395–424|doi=10.1177/016224399401900401|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/016224399401900401|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the technological barriers to production are extremely high, which makes the market very risky. Technological barriers refer to the cost of [[research and development]] of new scientific knowledge, which becomes increasingly expensive as technology continues to play a more prominent role in this type of development.&lt;ref name="von Zedtwitz et al. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Von Zedtwitz|first1=Maximilian|last2=Gassmann|first2=Oliver|title=Market versus Technology Drive in R&amp;D Internationalization: Four different patterns of managing research and development|journal=Research Policy|date=2002|volume=31|issue=4|pages=569–588|doi=10.1016/S0048-7333(01)00125-1|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0048733301001251/1-s2.0-S0048733301001251-main.pdf?_tid=3d0f6865-63dc-4427-96c7-296d591248cc&amp;acdnat=1520395953_6c5dc57bf27dfd45501ef8493ca719f7|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, due to the non-excludable nature of scientific knowledge, producers worry that they will be unable to enforce property rights on their produced goods. This will result in others being able to benefit from the scientific knowledge without having to bear the cost of the research and development, which would in turn make the potential return on investment too small to incentivize participation in the market.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; Therefore, science can be understood as the production of a public good, and can be studied within the framework of [[public economics]].&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

However, certain economists argue that a non-market mechanism has developed to correct the problem of indefinable property rights, such that scientists are incentivized to produce knowledge in a socially responsible way. Economist Paula Stephen refers to this mechanism as a reward system based primarily on a concept that she calls “priority of discovery.”&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephens|first1=Paula|title=The Economics of Science|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|date=September 1996|volume=34|issue=3|pages=1199–1235|jstor=2729500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Merton argues that to goal of scientists is to establish “priority of discovery” by being the first to report a new discovery, which then results in the reward of recognition. The scientific community only bestows this reward on the person who discovers the new piece of knowledge first, and thus this sets up a winner-takes-all type of system that incentivizes producers to participate in the market of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Merton 1957"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merton|first1=Robert|title=Priorities in Scientific Discover: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science|journal=American Sociological Review|date=December 1957|volume=22|issue=6|pages=635–659|doi=10.2307/2089193|jstor=2089193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen particularly notes that “Compensation in science is generally composed of two parts: one portion is paid regardless of the individual's success in races, the other is priority-based and reflects the value of the winner's contribution to science.”&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996" /&gt; The first part that Stephens identifies corresponds to the salary that a professor in academia would expect to make over the course of his or her career; these salaries are notoriously flat, with one study noting that a full professor can expect to make only 70% more than a newly hired assistant professor.&lt;ref name="Ehrenberg 1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ehrenberg|first1=Ronald|title=Academic Labor Supply|journal=Economic Challenges in Higher Education|date=1991|pages=141–258|url=https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1650&amp;context=articles|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stephen argues that the second part of compensation, that which is reaped when a scientist establishes priority of discovery, then the earnings profile becomes much less flat as the scientist gains prestige, journalistic citations, paid speaking invitations, and other such rewards. However, she notes that this theory had yet to be empirically tested at the time of writing.&lt;ref name="Stephens et al. 1996" /&gt; Furthermore, her analysis only applies to the world of academia, whereas industry is also a major source of scientific knowledge production.

==Government Interventions==

The field of [[public economics]] posits that should [[market failures]] occur, the government might be able to intervene to correct these market failures. When speaking about the production of scientific knowledge, the government has several options for intervening in the market to attempt to correct the failure. In the United States, two of the most historically popular and most extensively studied options are the [[patent]] system and [[tax incentives]].&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

===The Patent System===
[[File:Patent System - Economics of Science.png|thumb|Graphical representation of the effect of patents on production of scientific knowledge]]In the United States, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|Patent and Trademark Office]] issues patents that give the holder of the patent exclusive, defined property rights to their product for 20 years. From an economic perspective, the value of the patent is that it increases the marginal benefit of the firm that is producing the scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; To graphically display this concept, the accompanying figure depicts the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves of a firm in the market for science. The vertical axis displays the [[marginal cost]] and [[marginal benefit]] of each additional dollar spent on research and development. The horizontal access displays the amount of money spent on research and development in total. Research and development is assumed to have [[diminishing returns]]. For simplicity’s sake, all curves are assumed to be linear, and the marginal cost curve is assumed to be constant. A firm will maximize their profits by producing where marginal cost intersects marginal benefit. In the absence of any [[government intervention]], the firm will produce where at RD&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, where private marginal benefit (MB&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) intersects MC. However, if scientific knowledge is assumed to be a public good, then RD&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is too low a quantity to satisfy the social need. The optimal amount of R&amp;D is at RD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. The value of the introduction of the patent system is that it allows the marginal benefit curve for the firm to shift upward to MB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; so that the private benefit to the firm now produces the socially optimal quantity. The additional revenue is collected from society, as society now pays higher prices for the knowledge given the monopoly power of the producing firm.

In practice, patent law has been correlated with increased R&amp;D expenditure, indicating that this form of government intervention is in fact incentivizing production.&lt;ref name="Acs et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acs|first1=Zoltan|last2=Audretsch|first2=David|title=Patents as a Measure of Innovative Activity|journal=Kyklos|date=August 1989|volume=42|issue=2|pages=171–180|doi=10.1111/j.1467-435.1989.tb00186.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-6435.1989.tb00186.x/abstract|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this type of government intervention does not allow particularly precise targeting of the optimal level of R&amp;D production, and several economists argue that the benefit of 20 years of monopoly power is too high.&lt;ref name="Acs et al" /&gt; This argument has particular relevance to current debates regarding the production of life-saving pharmaceuticals.

===Tax Incentives===
[[File:Tax Incentive - Economics of Science.png|thumb|Graphical representation of the effect of tax incentives on production of scientific knowledge]]In 1954, the Internal Revenue Service incorporated an exemption for research costs such that firms could have research costs deducted from their yearly taxes.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; From an economic perspective, the value of the tax incentive is that it decreases the marginal cost of the firm that is producing the scientific knowledge. To graphically display this concept, the accompanying figure depicts the marginal benefit and marginal cost curves of a firm in the market for science. The vertical axis displays the marginal cost and benefit of each additional dollar spent on research and development. The horizontal access displays the amount of money spent on research and development in total. Research and development is assumed to have diminishing rate of return. For simplicity’s sake, all curves are assumed to be linear, and the marginal cost curve is assumed to be constant. A firm will maximize their profits by producing where marginal cost intersects marginal benefit. In the absence of any government intervention, the firm will produce where at RD0, where private marginal benefit (PMB0) intersects MC. However, if scientific knowledge is assumed to be a public good, then RD0 is too low a quantity to satisfy the social need. The optimal amount of R&amp;D is at RD1, which is where the marginal cost curve intersects the social marginal benefit (not depicted on this graph). The value of the tax incentive is that it allows the marginal cost curve for the firm to shift downward so that the private cost to the firm now produces the socially optimal quantity. The rest of the cost is now borne by society, in the form of the lost tax revenue.

Tax incentives allow slightly more precise targeting than the patent system. However, the concern still remains that tax incentives exacerbate inequality by producing financial windfalls for firms that might already be very prosperous.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt; Furthermore, empirical studies have been limited, although a 1996 report from the Congressional Office of Technological Assessment found that for every dollar lost in tax revenue, there was a dollar increasing in private R&amp;D spending.&lt;ref name="Audretch et al. 2005" /&gt;

An '''emissions budget''', '''carbon budget''', '''emissions quota,''' or '''allowable emissions''', is an upper limit of total [[carbon dioxide]] ([[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) emissions associated with remaining below a specific global average temperature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meinshausen|first=Malte|last2=Meinshausen|first2=Nicolai|last3=Hare|first3=William|last4=Raper|first4=Sarah C.

Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Stocker, T.F., D. Qin, G.-K. Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA, 1535 pp&lt;/ref&gt;     

Global emissions budgets are calculated according to historical cumulative emissions from fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, and land-use change, but vary according to the global temperature target that is chosen, the probability of staying below that target, and the emission of other non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gases (GHGs)]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Friedlingstein, P., Andrew, R.

''Nature geoscience'', ''7''(10), 709.&lt;/ref&gt; Global emissions budgets can be further divided into national emissions budgets, so that countries can set specific climate mitigation goals. Emissions budgets are relevant to [[climate change mitigation]] because they indicate a finite amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted over time, before resulting in dangerous levels of global warming. Change in global temperature is independent from the geographic location of these emissions, and is largely independent of the timing of these emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zickfeld|first=K.|last2=Arora|first2=V.

An "emissions target" may be distinguished from an emissions budget, as an emissions target may be internationally or nationally set in accordance with objectives other than a specific global temperature. This includes targets created for their political palatability, rather than ones focused on climate science warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Babiker|first=Mustafa H.|last2=Eckaus|first2=Richard S.|date=2002-09-01|title=Rethinking the Kyoto Emissions Targets|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016139500611|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=54|issue=4|pages=399–414|doi=10.1023/A:1016139500611|issn=0165-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the pre-industrial period to 2011, approximately 1890 [[Gigatonnes]] of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has already been emitted globally, and 2050 GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; up to 2015.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Rogelj, J., Schaeffer, M., Friedlingstein, P., Gillett, N.

Alternative to budgets set explicitly using temperature objectives, emissions budgets have also been estimated using the [[Representative Concentration Pathways]], which are based on [[radiative forcing]] values at the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vuuren|first=Detlef P. van|last2=Edmonds|first2=James A.|last3=Kainuma|first3=Mikiko|last4=Riahi|first4=Keywan|last5=Weyant|first5=John|date=2011-11-01|title=A special issue on the RCPs|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-011-0157-y|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=109|issue=1-2|pages=1|doi=10.1007/s10584-011-0157-y|issn=0165-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Although temperatures may be inferred from radiative forcing). These were presented in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|International Panel on Climate Change]] Fifth Assessment report.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== National emissions budgets ==
In light of the many differences between nations, including but not limited to population, level of industrialization, national emissions histories, and mitigation capabilities, scientists have made attempts to allocate global carbon budgets among countries using methods that follow various principles of equity.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Ringius, L., Torvanger, A., &amp; Underdal, A. (2002). Burden sharing and fairness principles in international climate policy. ''International Environmental Agreements'', ''2''(1), 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Allocating national emissions budgets is comparable to sharing the burdens of climate change&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;, underlined by some assumptions of state-level responsibility of climate change. Many authors have conducted quantitative analyses which allocate emissions budgets &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;, often simultaneously addressing disparities in historical GHG emissions between nations. 

One common principle that has been used to allocate global emissions budgets to nations is the "responsibility" or "[[Polluter pays principle|polluter-pays" principle]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This principle recognizes nations' cumulative historical contributions to global emissions. So those countries with greater emissions levels over a set time period (for example, since the pre-industrial era to the present) would be responsible for reducing a greater portion of global emissions. Thus, their national emissions budgets would be smaller than those that have polluted less in the past. The concept of national historical responsibility for climate change has prevailed in the literature since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Grübler, A., &amp; Fujii, Y. (1991). Inter-generational and spatial equity issues of carbon accounts. ''Energy'', ''16''(11-12), 1397-1416.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K. R. (1992). Allocating responsibility for global warming: The natural debt index. ''Ambio. Stockholm'', ''20''(2), 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, some have quantified cumulative historical emissions of states, while highlighting the ethical challenges of allocating climate responsibilities according to this principle.&lt;ref&gt;Botzen, W. J., Gowdy, J. M., &amp; van den Bergh, J. C. (2008). Cumulative CO2 emissions: shifting international responsibilities for climate debt. ''Climate policy'', ''8''(6), 569-576. doi:10.3763/cpol.2008.0539.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle is often favoured by developing countries, as it gives them larger emissions budgets.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Pan, J. (2003). Emissions rights and their transferability: equity concerns over climate change mitigation. ''International Environmental Agreements'', ''3''(1), 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another common equity principle for calculating national emissions budgets is the "[[Egalitarianism|egalitarian" principle]]. This principle stipulates individuals should have equal rights to pollute, and therefore emissions budgets should be distributed proportionally according to state populations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some scientists have thus reasoned the use of national per-capita emissions in national emissions budget calculations.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Baer, P., Athanasiou, T., Kartha, S., &amp; Kemp-Benedict, E. (2009). Greenhouse development rights: A proposal for a fair global climate treaty. ''Ethics place and environment'', ''12''(3), 267-281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=H. Damon|date=January 2016|title=Quantifying historical carbon and climate debts among nations|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2774|journal=Nature Climate Change|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|pages=60–64|doi=10.1038/nclimate2774|issn=1758-6798|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neumayer|first=Eric|title=In defence of historical accountability for greenhouse gas emissions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00135-X|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=33|issue=2|pages=185–192|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(00)00135-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This principle may be favoured by nations with larger or rapidly growing populations.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  

A third equity principle that has been employed in national budget calculations considers national [[Westphalian sovereignty|sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The "sovereignty" principle highlights the equal right of nations to pollute.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The grandfathering method for calculating national emissions budgets uses this principle. Grandfathering allocates these budgets proportionally according to emissions at a particular base year,&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and has been used under international regimes such as the [[Kyoto Protocol]]&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC (1998). "Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change".(&lt;nowiki&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;) &lt;/ref&gt; and the early phase of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS)&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2010) 2010/384/: Commission Decision of 9 July 2010 on the Community-wide quantity of allowances to be issued under the EU Emission Trading Scheme for 2013 (notified under document C(2010) 4658). ''Official Journal of the European Union'' '''L 175''' 36-37 (&lt;nowiki&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32010D0384&lt;/nowiki&gt;) &lt;/ref&gt; This principle is often favoured by developed countries, as it allocates larger emissions budgets to them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

'''Environmental communication''' refers to the study and practice of how individuals, institutions, societies, and cultures craft, distribute, receive, understand, and use messages about the [[Natural environment|environment]] and human interactions with the environment. This includes a wide range of possible interactions, from interpersonal communication to [[virtual communities]], participatory decision making, and environmental media coverage. And it also includes verbal communication.

From the perspective of practice, Alexander Flor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/181519/Environmental_Communication|title=Environmental Communication|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines environmental communication as the application of communication approaches, principles, strategies and techniques to environmental management and protection.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander.

Flor (2004) considers it as a significant element in the environmental sciences, which he believes to be a [[transdisciplinary|transdicipline]]. He begins his textbook on environmental communication with a declarative statement, "Environmentalism as we know it today began with environmental communication. The environmental movement was ignited by a spark from a writer’s pen, or more specifically and accurately, [[Rachel Carson]]’s typewriter." According to Flor, environmental communication has six essentials: knowledge of ecological laws; sensitivity to the cultural dimension; ability to network effectively; efficiency in using media for social agenda setting; appreciation and practice of environmental ethics; and conflict resolution, mediation and arbitration (Ibid). In an earlier book, Flor and Gomez (1993) explore the development of an environmental communication curriculum from the perspectives of practitioners from the government, the private sector and the academe.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander, and Gomez, Ely D., eds. (1993). ''Environmental Communication: Considerations in Curriculum and Delivery Systems Development''. Los Banos, Laguna: University of the Philippines Los Banos - Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change communications has historically focused on [[news]] coverage and [[dissemination|disseminating]] information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nisbet|first1=M. C.|title=Communicating climate change:  Why frames matter for public engagement|journal=Environment|date=2009|volume=51|issue=2|pages=14–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic fields such as [[psychology]], [[environmental sociology]], and [[risk communication]] have argued that public nonresponse to climate change is due to a lack of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norgaard|first1=K. M.|title=Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life|date=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262015448}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her book ''Living in Denial: Climate Change, Emotions, and Everyday Life,'' Norgaard's (2011) study of Bygdaby (a fictional name used for a real city in Norway) found that non-response was much more complex than just a lack of information. In fact, too much information can do the exact opposite because people tend to neglect [[global warming]] once they realize there is no easy solution. When people understand the complexity of the issue, they can feel overwhelmed and helpless which can lead to [[apathy]] or [[skepticism]]. [[Environmental skepticism]] is an increasing challenge for environmental rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacques|first1=P.|title=Environmental Skepticism: Ecology, Power and Public Life|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=978-0754671022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolic action ==
Environmental communication is also a type of symbolic action that serves two functions. Those functions are [[wikt:pragmatic|pragmatic]] and [[wikt:constitutive|constitutive]]. Environmental human communication is pragmatic because it helps individuals and organizations to accomplish goals and literally do things through communication. Examples of this include educating, alerting, persuading and collaborating. Environmental human communication is constitutive because it helps to shape people's understandings of environmental issues, themselves, and Nature; it shapes the meanings we hold of these things. Examples of this include values, attitudes, and ideologies vis-à-vis Nature and environmental issues and problems.Environmental nature communication happens when plants actually communicate,within ecosystems:"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112]&lt;/ref&gt; "When a leaf gets eaten, it warns other leaves by using some of the same signals as animals. Plant biologists are "starting to unravel a long-standing mystery about how different parts of a plant communicate with one another."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Communication Theory has one universal law, written by S. F. Scudder in the early 1900s, and later published in 1980. The Universal Communication Law states that, "All living entities, beings and creatures communicate."{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In an unpublished interview, Scudder clarified the concept - "All of the living communicate through movements, sounds, reactions, physical changes, gestures, languages, breath, color transformations, etc. Communication is a means of survival, existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge the communication exists. Examples - the cry of a child (communication that it is hungry, hurt, cold, etc.); the browning of a leaf,a leaf that becomes defensive as it's being consumed,"A plant injured on one leaf by a nibbling insect can alert its other leaves to begin anticipatory defense responses. Working in the model plant Arabidopsis, Toyota et al. show that this systemic signal begins with the release of glutamate, which is perceived by glutamate receptor–like ion channels (see the Perspective by Muday and Brown-Harding). The ion channels then set off a cascade of changes in calcium ion concentration that propagate through the phloem vasculature and through intercellular channels called plasmodesmata. This glutamate-based long-distance signaling is rapid: Within minutes, an undamaged leaf can respond to the fate of a distant leaf." &lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6407/1112&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt; A leaf that communicates that it is being eaten); the cry of an animal (communicating that it is injured, hungry, angry, etc.)are examples that sit inside the universal law that Everything living communicates."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/plants-communicate-distress-using-their-own-kind-nervous-system]&lt;/ref&gt;]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Scudder's thesis is aptly reinforced by General Systems Theory, which submits that one of the three critical functions of living systems is the exchange of information with its environment and with other living systems (the other two being the exchange of materials and the exchange of energy). In his book, Flor (2004, page 4) extends this argument by forwarding that, "All living systems, from the simplest to the most complex, are equipped to perform these critical functions. They are called ''critical'' because they are necessary for the survival of the living system. Communication is nothing more than the exchange of information. Hence, at its broadest sense, environmental communication is necessary for the survival of every living system, be it an organism, an ecosystem, or (even) a social system."

== Areas of study and practice ==
According to J. Robert Cox, the field of environmental communication is composed of seven major areas of study and practice:

# Environmental [[rhetoric]] and [[discourse]]
# [[News media|Media]] and [[environmental journalism]]
# [[Public participation]] in environmental decision making
# [[Social marketing]] and [[advocacy|advocacy campaigns]]
# Environmental [[collaboration]] and [[conflict resolution]]
# [[Risk communication]]
# Representations of Nature in [[popular culture]] and [[green marketing]]&lt;ref&gt;Cox, J. Robert. (2010). ''Environmental Communication And The Public Sphere''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, pp.??{{page needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ethnomethodology''' is the study of methods people use for understanding and producing the [[social order]] in which they live.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1974 pp 15–18"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1974) 'The origins of the term ethnomethodology', in R.Turner (Ed.) Ethnomethodology, Penguin, Harmondsworth, pp 15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; It generally seeks to provide an alternative to mainstream [[sociology|sociological]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; In its most radical form, it poses a challenge to the social sciences as a whole.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (2002) ''Ethnomethodology's Program: Working out Durkheim's Aphorism'', Rowman &amp; Littleford, Lanham.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, its early investigations led to the founding of [[conversation analysis]], which has found its own place as an accepted discipline within the academy. According to Psathas, it is possible to distinguish five major approaches within the ethnomethodological family of disciplines (see {{section link||Varieties}}).&lt;ref&gt;Psathas, G. (1995) ''Talk and Social Structure' and 'Studies of Work'', in Human Studies, 18: 139–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnomethodology provides methods which have been used in [[ethnography|ethnographic]] studies to produce accounts of people's methods for negotiating everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, Michael Makowsky (1978). The discovery of society. London: Random House. Page 232&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fundamentally descriptive discipline which does not engage in the explanation or evaluation of the particular social order undertaken as a topic of study.&lt;ref&gt;Wes W. Sharrock, Bob Anderson, R. J. Anderson (1986) The ethnomethodologists. London: Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|0-85312-949-5}}. Page 18&lt;/ref&gt; However, applications have been found within many applied disciplines, such as software design and management studies.&lt;ref&gt;Rooke, J. &amp; Seymour, D. (2005) 'Studies of Work: Achieving Hybrid Disciplines in IT Design and Management Studies', Human Studies 28(2):205–221. http://usir.salford.ac.uk/642&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term's meaning can be broken down into its three constituent parts: ''ethno'' – ''method'' – ''ology'', for the purpose of explanation. Using an appropriate Southern California example: ''ethno'' refers to a particular socio-cultural group (for example, a particular, local community of surfers); ''method'' refers to the methods and practices this particular group employs in its everyday activities (for example, related to surfing); and ''ology'' refers to the systematic description of these methods and practices. The focus of the investigation used in our example is the social order of surfing, the ethnomethodological interest is in the "how" (the methods and practices) of the production and maintenance of this social order. In essence ethnomethodology attempts to create classifications of the social actions of individuals within groups through drawing on the experience of the groups directly, without imposing on the setting the opinions of the researcher with regards to social order, as is the case with sociological studies.&lt;ref name="lynch1993"&gt;Michael Lynch, Scientific Practice and Ordinary Action: Ethnomethodology and Social Studies of Science, Cambridge UP, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and scope==
The approach was originally developed by [[Harold Garfinkel]], who attributed its origin to his work investigating the conduct of jury members in 1954.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1974 pp 15–18"/&gt; His interest was in describing the common sense methods through which members of a jury produce themselves in a jury room ''as a jury''. Thus, their methods for: establishing matters of fact; developing evidence chains; determining the reliability of witness testimony; establishing the organization of speakers in the jury room itself; and determining the guilt or innocence of defendants, etc. are all topics of interest. Such methods serve to constitute the social order of being a juror for the members of the jury, as well as for researchers and other interested parties, in that specific social setting.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"&gt;Garfinkel, H. (1984) Studies in Ethnomethodology, Polity Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;

This interest developed out of Garfinkel's critique of [[Talcott Parsons]]' attempt to derive a general theory of society. This critique originated in his reading of [[Alfred Schutz]], though Garfinkel ultimately revised many of Schutz's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. &amp; Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Garfinkel also drew on his study of the principles and practices of financial accounting; the classic sociological theory and methods of [[Emile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber|Weber]]; and the traditional sociological concern with the [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]ian "problem of order".&lt;ref name="annerawls"&gt;Anne Rawls, "Harold Garfinkel", Blackwell Companion to Major Social Theorists, ed. G. Ritzer. Blackwell: London, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the ethnomethodologist, participants produce the order of social settings through their shared sense making practices. Thus, there is an essential natural reflexity between the activity of making sense of a social setting and the ongoing production of that setting; the two are in effect identical. Furthermore, these practices (or methods) are witnessably enacted, making them available for study.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"/&gt; This opens up a broad and multi-faceted area of inquiry. [[John Heritage]] writes, "In its open-ended reference to [the study of] any kind of sense-making procedure, the term represents a signpost to a domain of uncharted dimensions rather than a staking out of a clearly delineated territory."&lt;ref&gt;Heritage, J. (1984). ''Garfinkel and ethnomethodology.'' Cambridge, U.K: Polity Press. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and methods==

{{Synthesis|section|date=June 2012}}

Ethnomethodology has perplexed commentators, due to its radical approach to questions of theory and method.&lt;ref name="doug1991"&gt;Doug Maynard &amp; Steve Clayman, "The Diversity of Ethnomethodology", ASR, V.17, pp. 385–418. 1991. A survey of various ethnomethodological approaches to the study of social practices. Pages 413–418.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Heritage, Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology, Cambridge:Polity. 1991.({{ISBN|0-7456-0060-3}}). Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to theory, Garfinkel has consistently advocated an attitude of ethnomethodological indifference, a principled agnosticism with regard to social theory which insists that the shared understandings of members of a social setting under study take precedence over any concepts which a social theorist might bring to the analysis from outside that setting. This can be perplexing to traditional social scientists, trained in the need for social theory and a multiplicity of theoretical references by Anne Rawls, in her introduction to ''Ethnomethodology's Program'' might be interpreted to suggest a softening of this position towards the end of Garfinkel's life.&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garf0742516423"&gt;[[Harold Garfinkel]] (2002). Ethnomethodology's Program. New York: Rowman and Littlefield. {{ISBN|0-7425-1642-3}}. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the position is consistent with ethnomethodology's understanding of the significance of "member's methods", and with certain lines of philosophical thought regarding the philosophy of science (Polanyi 1958; Kuhn 1970; Feyerabend 1975), and the study of the actual practices of scientific procedure.&lt;ref name="lynch1993"/&gt; It also has a strong correspondence with the later philosophy of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], especially as applied to social studies by Peter Winch.&lt;ref&gt;Cuff, E. C., Sharrock, W. W. &amp; Francis, D.W. (2006) Perspectives in Sociology (fifth edition) Unwin Hyman, London&lt;/ref&gt; References are also made in Garfinkel's work to Husserl (Transcendental Phenomenology), Gurwitsch ([[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt Theory]]), and, most frequently, of course, to the works of the social phenomenologist Alfred Schutz (Phenomenology of the Natural Attitude), among others. On the other hand, the authors and theoretical references cited by Garfinkel do not constitute a rigorous theoretical basis for ethnomethodology. Ethnomethodology is not Durkheimian, although it shares some of the interests of Durkheim; it is not phenomenology, although it borrows from Husserl and Schutz's studies of the [[lifeworld]] (''Lebenswelt''); it is not a form of Gestalt theory, although it describes social orders as having Gestalt-like properties; and, it is not Wittgensteinian, although it makes use of Wittgenstein's understanding of rule-use, etc. Instead, these borrowings are only fragmentary references to theoretical works from which ethnomethodology has appropriated theoretical ideas for the expressed purposes of ''doing'' ethnomethodological investigations.

Similarly, ethnomethodology advocates no formal methods of enquiry, insisting that the research method be dictated by the nature of the phenomenon that is being studied.&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garfinkel, H. 1984"/&gt;&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; Ethnomethodologists have conducted their studies in a variety of ways,&lt;ref name="doug1991" /&gt; and the point of these investigations is "to discover the things that persons in particular situations ''do'', the methods ''they'' use, to create the patterned orderliness of social life."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; [[Michael Lynch (ethnomethodologist)|Michael Lynch]] has noted that: "Leading figures in the field have repeatedly emphasised that there is no obligatory set of methods [employed by ethnomethodologists], and no prohibition against using any research procedure whatsoever, if it is ''adequate'' to the particular phenomena under study".&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lynch1989"&gt;Michael Lynch, The Social Science Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2nd Ed., 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garfinkel, H. &amp; Wieder, D. L. (1992) 'Two Incommensurable, Asymmetrically Alternate Technologies of Social Analysis', in G. Watson  &amp; R. M. Seiler (eds.), Text in Context, Sage, London, pp. 175–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some leading policies, methods and definitions==

; The fundamental assumption of ethnomethodological studies : As characterised by Anne Rawls, speaking for Garfinkel: "If one assumes, as Garfinkel does, that the meaningful, patterned, and orderly character of everyday life is something that people must work to achieve, then one must also assume that they have some methods for doing so". That is, "...members of society must have some shared methods that they use to mutually construct the meaningful orderliness of social situations."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;
; Ethnomethodology is an empirical enterprise : Rawls states: "Ethnomethodology is a thoroughly empirical enterprise devoted to the discovery of social order and intelligibility [sense making] as witnessable collective achievements." "The keystone of the [ethnomethodological] argument is that local [social] orders exist; that these orders are witnessable in the scenes in which they are produced; and that the possibility of [their] intelligibility is based on the actual existence and detailed enactment of these orders."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; Ethnomethodology is not, however, conventionally empricist.  Its empirical nature is specified in the weak form of the ''unique adequacy requirement''.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (weak form) : is that the researcher should have a 'vulgar competence' in the research setting. That is, they should be able to function as an ordinary member of that setting.
; The unique adequacy requirement of methods (strong form) : is identical to the requirement for ethnomethodological indifference.
; Ethnomethodological indifference : This is the policy of deliberate [[agnosticism]], or indifference, towards the dictates, prejudices, methods and practices of sociological analysis as traditionally conceived (examples: theories of "deviance", analysis of behavior as rule governed, [[role theory]], institutional (de)formations, theories of [[social stratification]], etc.). Dictates and prejudices which serve to pre-structure traditional social scientific investigations independently of the subject matter taken as a topic of study, or the investigatory setting being subjected to scrutiny.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; The policy of ethnomethodological indifference is specifically not to be conceived of as indifference to the problem of social order taken as a group (member's) concern.
; First time through : This is the practice of attempting to describe any social activity, regardless of its routine or mundane appearance, as if it were happening for the very first time. This is in an effort to expose how the observer of the activity assembles, or constitutes, the activity for the purposes of formulating any particular description. The point of such an exercise is to make available and underline the complexities of sociological analysis and description, particularly the [[indexical]] and reflexive properties of the actors', or observer's, own descriptions of what is taking place in any given situation. Such an activity will also reveal the observer's inescapable reliance on the [[hermeneutic circle]] as the defining "methodology" of social understanding for both lay persons and social scientists.&lt;ref name="Mark Okrent 1988. Pages 157–172"&gt;Mark Okrent, Heidegger's Pragmatism, Cornell University Press, 1988. Pages 157–172&lt;/ref&gt;
; Breaching experiment : A method for revealing, or exposing, the common work that is performed by members of particular social groups in maintaining a clearly recognisable and shared [[social order]]. For example, [[driving the wrong way]] down a busy one-way street can reveal myriads of useful insights into the patterned social practices, and moral order, of the community of road users. The point of such an exercise—a person pretending to be a stranger or boarder in his own household—is to demonstrate that gaining insight into the work involved in maintaining any given social order can often best be revealed by breaching that social order and observing the results of that breach—especially those activities related to the reassembly of that social order, and the normalisation of that social setting.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;
; Sacks' gloss : A question about an aspect of the social order that recommends, as a method of answering it, that the researcher should seek out members of society who, in their daily lives, are responsible for the maintenance of that aspect of the social order. This is in opposition to the idea that such questions are best answered by a sociologist. Sacks' original question concerned objects in public places and how it was possible to see that such objects did or did not belong to somebody. He found his answer in the activities of police officers who had to decide whether cars were abandoned.
; [[Durkheim]]'s aphorism : Durkheim famously recommended: "...our basic principle, that of the objectivity of social facts."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; This is usually taken to mean that we should assume the [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] of social facts as a principle of study (thus providing the basis of sociology as a science). Garfinkel's alternative reading of Durkheim is that we should treat the objectivity of social facts as an achievement of society's members, and make the achievement process itself the focus of study.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; An ethnomethodological respecification of Durkheim's statement via a "misreading" (see below) of his quote appears above. There is also a textual link/rationale provided in the literature. Both links involve a leap of faith on the part of the reader; that is, we don't believe that one method for this interpretation is necessarily better than the other, or that one form of justification for such an interpretation outweighs its competitor.
; Accounts : Accounts are the ways members signify, describe or explain the properties of a specific social situation. They can consist of both verbal and non-verbal objectifications. They are always both indexical to the situation in which they occur (see below), and, simultaneously reflexive—they serve to constitute that situation. An account can consist of something as simple as a wink of the eye, a material object evidencing a state of affairs (documents, etc.), or something as complex as a story detailing the boundaries of the universe.
; [[Indexicality]] : The concept of indexicality is a key core concept for ethnomethodology. Garfinkel states that it was derived from the concept of indexical expressions appearing in ordinary language philosophy (1967), wherein a statement is considered to be indexical insofar as it is dependent for its sense upon the context in which it is embedded (Bar-Hillel 1954:359–379). The phenomenon is acknowledged in various forms of analytical philosophy, and sociological theory and methods, but is considered to be both limited in scope and remedied through specification [[operationalisation]]. In ethnomethodology, the phenomenon is universalised to all forms of language and behavior, and is deemed to be beyond remedy for the purposes of establishing a scientific description and explanation of social behavior.&lt;ref name="garf1984"&gt;Harold Garfinkel, Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. ({{ISBN|0-7456-0005-0}}) (first published in 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; The consequence of the degree of contextual dependence for a "segment" of talk or behavior can range from the problem of establishing a "working consensus" regarding the description of a phrase, concept or behavior, to the end-game of social scientific description itself. Note that any serious development of the concept must eventually assume a theory of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] as its foundation (see Gurwitsch 1985). Without such a foundational underpinning, both the traditional social scientist and the ethnomethodologist are relegated to merely telling stories around the campfire (Brooks 1974).
; Misreading (a text) : Misreading a text, or fragments of a text, does not denote making an erroneous reading of a text in whole or in part. As Garfinkel states, it means to denote an, "alternate reading", of a text or fragment of a text. As such, the original and its misreading do not, "...translate point to point", but, "...instead, they go together."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; No criteria are offered for the translation of an original text and its misreading—the outcome of such translations are in Garfinkel's term: "incommensurable."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; The misreading of texts or fragments of texts is a standard feature of ethnomethodology's way of doing theory, especially in regards to topics in phenomenology.
; Reflexivity : Despite the fact that many sociologists use "reflexivity" as a synonym for "[[Introspection|self-reflection]]," the way the term is used in ethnomethodology is different: it is meant "to describe the acausal and non-[[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] determination of meaningful action-in-context."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/mg60u8574h414t0l/ Michael Lynch, Mark Peyrot. "Introduction: A reader's guide to ethnomethodology". ''Qualitative Sociology''. Springer Netherlands. 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Reflexivity (social theory)]].
; Documentary method of interpretation : The documentary method is the method of understanding utilised by everyone engaged in trying to make sense of their social world—this includes the ethnomethodologist. [[Garfinkel]] recovered the concept from the work of [[Karl Mannheim]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Mannheim]], "On the Interpretation of Weltanschauung" (1952),in, From Karl Mannheim (ed. Kurt Wolf), Transaction Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; and repeatedly demonstrates the use of the method in the case studies appearing in his central text, Studies in Ethnomethodology.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt; Mannheim defined the term as a search for an identical homologous pattern of meaning underlying a variety of totally different realisations of that meaning. Garfinkel states that the documentary method of interpretation consists of treating an actual appearance as the "document of", "as pointing to", as "standing on behalf of", a presupposed underlying pattern.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt; These "documents" serve to constitute the underlying pattern, but are themselves interpreted on the basis of what is already known about that underlying pattern. This seeming paradox is quite familiar to hermeneuticians who understand this phenomenon as a version of the hermeneutic circle.&lt;ref name="Mark Okrent 1988. Pages 157–172"/&gt; This phenomenon is also subject to analysis from the perspective of [[Gestaltism|Gestalt]] theory (part/whole relationships), and the phenomenological theory of perception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aron Gurwitsch]], The Field of Consciousness, Duquesne University Press, 1964 [out-of-print]. Pages 202–227&lt;/ref&gt;
; Social orders : Theoretically speaking, the object of ethnomethodological research is social order taken as a group members' concern. Methodologically, social order is made available for description in any specific social setting as an accounting of specific social orders: the sensible coherencies of accounts that order a specific social setting for the participants relative to a specific social project to be realised in that setting. Social orders themselves are made available for both participants and researchers through phenomena of order: the actual accounting of the partial ([[:wkit:adumbration|adumbrated]]) appearances of these sensibly coherent social orders. These appearances (parts, adumbrates) of social orders are embodied in specific accounts, and employed in a particular social setting by the members of the particular group of individuals party to that setting. Specific social orders have the same formal properties as identified by A. Gurwitsch in his discussion of the constituent features of perceptual ''noema'', and, by extension, the same relationships of meaning described in his account of Gestalt Contextures (see Gurwitsch 1964:228–279). As such, it is little wonder that Garfinkel states: "you can't do anything unless you do read his texts."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;
; Ethnomethodology's field of investigation : For ethnomethodology the topic of study is the social practices of real people in real settings, and the methods by which these people produce and maintain a shared sense of social order.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

==Differences with sociology ==

Since ethnomethodology has become anathema to certain sociologists, and since those practicing it like to perceive their own efforts as constituting a radical break from prior sociologies, there has been little attempt to link ethnomethodology to these prior sociologies.&lt;ref name="Paul Attewell 1974 pp. 179–210"&gt;Attewell, Paul. (1974). "Ethnomethodology since Garfinkel," ''Theory and Society'' '''1'''(2): 179–210.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whilst ethnomethodology is distinct from sociological methods, it does not seek to compete with it, or provide remedies for any of its practices.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Garfinkel]], Studies in Ethnomethodology, Malden MA: Polity Press/Blackwell Publishing. 1984. ({{ISBN|0-7456-0005-0}}) (first published in 1967). Page: viii&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethnomethodological approach differs as much from the sociological approach as sociology does from psychology even though both speak of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Mehan &amp; Houston Wood, The reality of ethnomethodology. 1975. Chichester: Wiley. {{ISBN|0-471-59060-6}}. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that ethnomethodology does not use traditional sociological forms as a sounding board for its own programmatic development, or to establish benchmarks for the differences between traditional sociological forms of study and ethnomethodology as it only means that ethnomethodology was not established in order to: repair, criticize, undermine, or 'poke fun' at traditional sociological forms {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}. In essence the distinctive difference between sociological approaches and ethnomethodology is that the latter adopts a commonsense attitude towards knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Leiter, ''A Primer of Ethnomethodology''. 1980. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-502628-4}}. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to traditional sociological forms of inquiry, it is a hallmark of the ethnomethodological perspective that it does not make theoretical or methodological appeals to: outside assumptions regarding the structure of an actor or actors' characterisation of social reality; refer to the subjective states of an individual or groups of individuals; attribute conceptual projections such as, "value states", "sentiments", "goal orientations", "mini-max economic theories of behavior", etc., to any actor or group of actors; or posit a specific "normative order" as a transcendental feature of social scenes, etc.

For the ethnomethodologist, the methodic realisation of social scenes takes place within the actual setting under scrutiny, and is structured by the participants in that setting through the reflexive accounting of that setting's features. The job of the Ethnomethodologist is to describe the methodic character of these activities, not account for them in a way that transcends that which is made available in and through the actual accounting practices of the individual's party to those settings.

The differences can therefore be summed up as follows:

# While traditional sociology usually offers an analysis of society which takes the [[facticity]] (factual character, objectivity) of the social order for granted, ethnomethodology is concerned with the procedures (practices, methods) by which that social order is produced, and shared.
# While traditional sociology usually provides descriptions of social settings which compete with the actual descriptions offered by the individuals who are party to those settings, ethnomethodology seeks to describe the procedures (practices, methods) these individuals use in their actual descriptions of those settings

==Links with phenomenology==
{{main|Phenomenology (philosophy)}}

Even though ethnomethodology has been characterised as having a "phenomenological sensibility",&lt;ref name="doug1991" /&gt; and reliable commentators have acknowledged that "there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology..." (Maynard and Kardash 2007:1484), orthodox adherents to the discipline—those who follow the teachings of Garfinkel—do not represent it as a branch, or form, of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology.

The confusion between the two disciplines stems, in part, from the practices of some ethnomethodologists (including Garfinkel), who sift through phenomenological texts, recovering phenomenological concepts and findings relevant to their interests, and then transpose these concepts and findings to topics in the study of social order. Such interpretive transpositions do not make the ethnomethodologist a phenomenologist, or ethnomethodology a form of phenomenology.

To further muddy the waters, some phenomenological sociologists seize upon ethnomethodological findings as examples of applied phenomenology; this even when the results of these ethnomethodological investigations clearly do not make use of phenomenological methods, or formulate their findings in the language of phenomenology. So called phenomenological analyses of social structures that do not have prima facie reference to any of the structures of intentional consciousness should raise questions as to the phenomenological status of such analyses.

Garfinkel speaks of phenomenological texts and findings as being "appropriated" and intentionally "misread" for the purposes of exploring topics in the study of social order.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt; These appropriations and methodical "misread[ings]" of phenomenological texts and findings are clearly made for the purposes of furthering ethnomethodological analyses, and should not be mistaken for logical extensions of these phenomenological texts and findings.&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

Lastly, there is no claim in any of Garfinkel's work that ethnomethodology is a form of phenomenology, or phenomenological sociology. To state that ethnomethodology has a "phenomenological sensibility" or that "there is a strong influence of phenomenology on ethnomethodology" is not the equivalent of describing ethnomethodology as a form of phenomenology (see Garfinkel/Liberman 2007:3–7).

Even though ethnomethodology is not a form of phenomenology, the reading and understanding of phenomenological texts, and developing the capability of seeing phenomenologically is essential to the actual doing of ethnomethodological studies. As Garfinkel states in regard to the work of the phenomenologist Aron Gurwitsch, especially his "Field of Consciousness" (1964: ethnomethodology's phenomenological ''urtext''): "you can't do anything unless you do read his texts."&lt;ref name="garf0742516423" /&gt;

== Varieties ==
According to [[George Psathas]], five types of ethnomethodological study can be identified (Psathas 1995:139–155). These may be characterised as:

# ''The organisation of practical actions and practical reasoning''. Including the earliest studies, such as those in Garfinkel's seminal ''Studies in Ethnomethodology''.&lt;ref name="garf1984" /&gt;
# ''The organisation of talk-in-interaction''. More recently known as [[conversation analysis]], [[Harvey Sacks]] established this approach in collaboration with his colleagues [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and [[Gail Jefferson]].
# ''Talk-in-interaction within institutional or organisational settings''. While early studies focused on talk abstracted from the context in which it was produced (usually using tape recordings of telephone conversations) this approach seeks to identify interactional structures that are specific to particular settings.
# ''The study of work''. 'Work' is used here to refer to any social activity. The analytic interest is in how that work is accomplished within the setting in which it is performed.
# ''The [[haecceity]] of work''. Just what makes an activity what it is? e.g. what makes a test a test, a competition a competition, or a definition a definition?

Further discussion of the varieties and diversity of ethnomethodological investigations can be found in Maynard &amp; Clayman's work.&lt;ref name="doug1991"/&gt;

==Relationship with conversational analysis==
The relationship between ethnomethodology and conversation analysis has been contentious at times, given their overlapping interests, the close collaboration between their founders and the subsequent divergence of interest among many practitioners. In as much as the study of social orders is "inexorably intertwined" with the constitutive features of talk about those social orders, ethnomethodology is committed to an interest in both conversational talk, and the role this talk plays in the constitution of that order. Talk is seen as indexical and embedded in a specific social order. It is also naturally reflexive to and constitutive of that order. Anne Rawls pointed out: "Many, in fact most, of those who have developed a serious interest in ethnomethodology have also used conversational analysis, developed by Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson, as one of their research tools."&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt;{{rp|143}}

On the other hand, where the study of conversational talk is divorced from its situated context—that is, when it takes on the character of a purely technical method and "formal analytic" enterprise in its own right—it is not a form of ethnomethodology.&lt;ref name="annerawls" /&gt; The "danger" of misunderstanding here, as Rawls notes, is that conversational analysis can become just another formal analytic enterprise, like any other formal method which brings an analytical toolbox of preconceptions, formal definitions, and operational procedures to the situation/setting under study. When such analytical concepts are generated from within one setting and conceptually applied (generalised) to another, the (re)application represents a violation of the strong form of the ''unique adequacy requirement'' of methods.

[[Image:Fabaxo1.jpg|thumb|300px|Fab Tree Hab, a "Local Biota Living Graft Structure"&lt;ref name="TerreformOne" /&gt;]]

The '''Fab Tree Hab''' is a hypothetical ecological home design developed at [[MIT]] by [[Mitchell Joachim]], Javier Arbona and Lara Greden. With the idea of easing the burden Humanity places on the environment with conventional housing by growing "living, breathing" [[tree house|tree homes]].&lt;ref name=CanadaFab&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|title=Grow your own home: 'Fab tree hab'|publisher=|accessdate=2015-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115053717/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|archivedate=2016-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be built by allowing native trees to grow over a computer-designed ([[CNC]]) removable [[plywood]] [[scaffold]]. Once the plants are interconnected and stable,&lt;ref name="TerreformOne"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mitchell Joachim |title=Terreform One |url=http://www.archinode.com/bienal.html |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plywood would be removed and reused. MIT is experimenting with [[trees]] that grow quickly and develop an interwoven root structure that's soft enough to "train" over the scaffold, but then hardens into a more durable structure. The inside walls would be conventional [[clay]] and [[plaster]].

An old methodology new to buildings is introduced in this design - [[pleaching]]. Pleaching is a method of weaving together tree branches to form living [[arch]]ways, [[latticework|lattice]]s, or screens.&lt;ref name=Technologyreview&gt;{{Cite web|author = Tracy Staedter |title=Architects design a living home|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17102|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the technique is also named "[[Tree shaping#Aeroponic culture|Aeroponic culture]]". The load-bearing part of the structure uses trees that self-graft or inosculate such as [[Live oak|Live Oak]], [[Elm]] and [[Dogwood]]. The lattice frame for the walls and roof are created with the branches of the trees. Vines create a dense protective layer woven along the exterior, interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

The Fab Tree Hab is an experiment that would develop over time.  Extra operating costs required over the life-time of the home include pest management with organic pesticides and maintenance of the [[living machine]]'s water treatment system.  Technical demonstration and innovation is still needed for certain components, primarily the bioplastic windows that accept growth of the structure and the management of flows across the wall section to assure that the interior remains dry and animal-free.  All in all, the elapsed time to reach livability is greater than the traditional sense, but so should be the health and longevity of the home and family.  Above all, building this home could be achieved at a minimal price. Depending on the surrounding climate the house is to be grown in, the team expect it will take a minimum of five years to complete its structure.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt; Realization of these homes will begin as an experiment, and it is envisioned that thereafter, the concept of renewal will take on a new architectural form - one of inter-dependency between nature and people.

As of May 2007 Mitchell Joachim stated that there is a "50 per cent" organic project in California, combining natural elements and traditional construction.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;

==Trees==
Main trees suggested to be used are [[elm]]s and [[oak]]s. The teams hopes the homes can be grown using mainly native trees.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

'''Geriatric sexology''' is the systematic study of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in the elderly. It encompasses all aspects of sexuality, including attempting to characterise "normal sexuality" and its variants, including [[paraphilia]]s and disorders of or relating to [[sex]] and the [[sex organ]]s. The field covers [[physiological]] and [[psychological]] aspects of sexuality and its disorders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9577">There is a criticism of the [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]].  The criticism stems from the fact that this measurement of [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] does not account for [[environmental degradation]] and [[resource depletion]].  A new approach to the situation of allocating these omitted environmental features in the [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] has been the advent of the '''green national product'''.

== Criticism of gross national product ==

The [[gross national product]] (GNP) measures the [[Welfare economics|welfare]] of a nation's economy through the aggregate of products and services produced in that nation.  Although GNP is a proficient measurement of the magnitude of the economy, many economists, environmentalists and citizens have been arguing the validity of the GNP in respect to measuring [[Welfare economics|welfare]].  [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize–winning economist]], states that this standard measurement for any [[national economy]] has become deficient as a measure of long-term economic health in our recently resource-driven and [[Globalization|globalizing]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/02/8387507/index.htm?postversion=2006092508 | title=Good Numbers Gone Bad | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2008-04-02 | date=2006-10-02 | first=Joseph | last=Stiglitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics suggest that GNP often includes the environment on the wrong side of the balance sheet because if someone first pollutes and then another person cleans the pollution, both activities add to GNP making environmental degradation frequently look good for the economy.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | title=Green Accounting | publisher=[[Gernot Wagner]] | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307223603/http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | archive-date=2008-03-07 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of [[mainstream economics]] complain that GNP compiles spending that makes us worse off, spending that allows us to stay in the same place, and spending that makes us better off all in a single measure, giving a nation no clue if they are making progress or not.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", [[University Press of America]], c1994. p.2 "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Manfred Max-Neef]], Chilean economist, explains that politicians feel that it is irrelevant whether the spending is productive, unproductive, or destructive.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"/&gt;  In this sense, it is common to see political policies that call to depredate a natural resource in order to increase the GNP.  To take into account the environmental depredation and resource depletion, there is a call to shift away from the traditional GNP and construct an assessment of national product that takes into account environmental effects.

== History ==

=== Measure of economic welfare ===

Ever since the Industrial Revolution, scientists and economists have warned of an [[inflection point]] for the United States economy where expansion is inevitably limited by the steadily decreasing availability of natural resources.  In 1973, [[William D. Nordhaus]] and [[James Tobin]], [[Yale University|Yale]] economists, were the first to question the GNP in "is growth obsolete?"  Nordhaus and Tobin developed a [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (MEW) and stated that welfare must be sustainable, in the sense that nations that devour their stock of capital are not as "well" as the national income would suggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p03b/p0398a.pdf |format = pdf |  title=Is Growth Obsolete? | publisher=Milton Moss | year=1973 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Index of sustainable economic welfare ===

However, in "The Green National Product", Clifford Cobb and John Cobb argue that the Measure of Economic Welfare failed to encompass the depletion of [[natural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.10-11 "How to Measure Welfare: Some Options"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1989, [[Herman Daly]], John Cobb, and Clifford Cobb created what is known as the [[Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare]] (ISEW).  This new measurement of welfare was created in the hopes that it would replace the flawed GNP.  Herman Daly stated that the key flaw of the traditional GNP was that it ignored core accounting principles of business where all revenues and expenses are allocated to income.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | title=Fixing GDP: Green Accounting in the United States | publisher=National Public Radio | date=April 9, 2004 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402233502/http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | archive-date=2008-04-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ISEW called for ecological and economic sustainability to coincide since the economy is ultimately dependent on the natural resources that the earth provides.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than the original GNP, ISEW takes into account costs that are naturally unsustainable.  By creating ISEW, they wanted to expand the current national product so that individuals, businesses, and governments could take actions that will generally enhance welfare, rather than merely enhancing the traditional GNP.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280-281 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genuine progress indicator ===

In 1995, Redefining Progress created the [[genuine progress indicator]] (GPI) as an alternative to the traditional GNP.  This new measurement of national income would allow policymakers to gauge how well citizens are, economically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redifining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike welfare adjustments in the past like MEW and ISEW, GPI adjusts not only for environmental depredation, but also for income distribution, housework, volunteering, crime, changes in leisure time, and life-span of consumer durables and public infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redefining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was one of the first alternatives to the traditional GNP to be used by the scientific community and governmental organizations globally.

=== In the United States ===

In 1992, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (BEA) of the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] initiated intensive work to create an environmental accounting system.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rcted.ncu.edu.tw/speech/On%20Green%20NP%202007%201117[1].pdf |format = pdf |  title=On "Green National Product": Theories and a Comparison Among Difference Approaches | publisher=Eolss Publishers | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BEA began by creating satellite accounts with easily measurable commodities such as petroleum and coal.  The first BEA publication was the U.S. Integrated Environmental and Economic Satellite Accounts (IEESA) in 1994.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;  The initial results were quite significant, and showed how GNP was overestimating the impact of mining industries in respect to the nations economic wealth.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"/&gt;  Mining companies didn't care for the initial publications, for obvious reasons, and soon [[Alan Mollohan]], a Democratic House Representative from [[West Virginia]]'s coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 [[Appropriation Bill]].  In response, Congress directed the BEA to suspend further work in [[Sustainability measurement|environmental accounting]], and to obtain an external review on their findings.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;

== Need ==

Many people are calling for a green national product that would indicate if activities benefit or harm the economy and well-being.  This green national product would revolve around the social and economic issues on which many green movements have focused: care for the earth and all that sustain it.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"/&gt;  This new national product would differ from the traditional GNP by addressing both the sustainability and well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"/&gt;  It is essential that this system takes into account natural capital, which is currently hidden from our traditional measurement.

The '''Guild of Saint Luke''' was the most common name for a city [[guild]] for painters and other artists in [[early modern Europe]], especially in the [[Low Countries]]. They were named in honor of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]] [[Saint Luke|Luke]], the [[patron saint]] of artists, who was identified by [[John of Damascus]] as having painted the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin's]] portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Howe.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous such organizations was founded in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Ford-Wille.&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to function until 1795, although by then it had lost its [[Legal monopoly|monopoly]] and therefore most of its power. In most cities, including Antwerp, the local government had given the Guild the power to regulate defined types of trade within the city.  Guild membership, as a master, was therefore required for an artist to take on apprentices or to sell paintings to the public. Similar rules existed in [[Delft]], where only members could sell paintings in the city or have a shop.&lt;ref&gt;Montias (1977): 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The early guilds in Antwerp and [[Bruges]], setting a model that would be followed in other cities, even had their own showroom or market stall from which members could sell their paintings directly to the public.&lt;ref name="prak248"&gt;Prak (2003): 248.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The guild of Saint Luke not only represented painters, sculptors, and other visual artists, but also—especially in the seventeenth century—dealers, amateurs, and even art lovers (the so-called ''liefhebbers'').&lt;ref name="prak249"&gt;Prak (2004): 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period most members in most places were probably [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]], where these were in the same guild as painters on wood and cloth—in many cities they were joined with the scribes or "scriveners". In traditional guild structures, house-painters and decorators were often in the same guild. However, as artists formed under their own specific guild of St. Luke, particularly in the Netherlands, distinctions were increasingly made.&lt;ref name="smith432"&gt;Smith (1999): 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, guilds also made judgments on disputes between artists and other artists or their clients.&lt;ref name="prak249" /&gt; In such ways, it controlled the economic career of an artist working in a specific city, while in different cities they were wholly independent and often competitive against each other. 

==Antwerp ==
Although it did not become a major artistic center until the sixteenth century, Antwerp was one of, if not the first, city to found a guild of Saint Luke. It is first mentioned in 1382, and was given special privileges by the city in 1442.&lt;ref name="baudouin"&gt;Baudouin (1973): 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The registers, or ''[[Liggeren]]'', from the guild exist, cataloging when artists became masters, who the dean for each year was, what their specialities were, and the names of any students.&lt;ref name="baudouin" /&gt;  In Bruges, however, which was the dominant city for artistic production in the Low Countries in the fifteenth century, the earliest known list of guild members dates to 1453, although the guild was certainly older than this.  There all artists had to belong to the guild in order to practice in their own names or to sell their works, and the guild was very strict about which artistic activities could be practiced–distinctly forbidding an artisan to work in an area where another guild's members, such as tapestry weaving, were represented.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell (1976): 191.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Bruges==
The Bruges guild, in a typically idiosyncratic medieval arrangement, also included the saddlemakers, probably because most members were painting [[illuminated manuscript]]s on [[vellum]], and were therefore grouped as a sort of leatherworker. Perhaps because of this link, for a period they had a rule that all miniatures needed a tiny mark to identify the artist, which was registered with the Guild.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar (1980): 371–383.&lt;/ref&gt;   Only under special privileges, such as court artist, could an artist effectively practice their craft without holding membership in the guild.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens]] had a similar situation in the seventeenth century, when he obtained special permission from the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]] to be both court artist in [[Brussels]] and an active member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership also allowed members to sell works at the guild-owned showroom. Antwerp, for example, opened a market stall for selling paintings in front of the  [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|cathedral]] in 1460, and Bruges followed in 1482.&lt;ref name="prak248" /&gt;

==Dutch Republic==
[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Governors of the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]] in 1675. [[Jan de Bray]] painted himself second from the left. Surprisingly, fewer such group portraits exist for painters than other Guild occupations.]] 
Guilds of St. Luke in the [[Dutch Republic]] began to reinvent themselves as cities there changed over to Protestant rule, and there were dramatic movements in population.  Many St. Luke guilds reissued charters to protect the interests of local painters from the influx of southern talent from places like Antwerp and Bruges. Many cities in the young republic became more important artistic centres in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. [[Amsterdam]] was the first city to reissue a St. Luke's charter after the reformation in 1579, and it included painters, sculptors, engravers, and other trades dealing specifically in the visual arts.&lt;ref name="prak241"&gt;Prak (2003): 241.&lt;/ref&gt; When trade between the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] resumed with the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] in 1609, immigration increased and many Dutch cities reissued guild charters as a form of protection against the great number of paintings that began to cross the border.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; 

[[Image:Guild of Saint Luke.jpg|thumb|1730s engraving of the Delft Guild of St. Luke, by an unknown artist. Today the location of the [[Vermeer Centre]]]]
For example, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Delft]], all founded guilds between 1609 and 1611.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; In each of those cases, panel painters removed themselves from their traditional guild structure that included other painters, such as those who worked in fresco and on houses, in favor of a specific "Guild of St. Luke".&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; On the other hand, these distinctions did not take effect at that time in Amsterdam or Haarlem.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; In the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]], however, a strict hierarchy was attempted in 1631 with panel painters at the top, though this hierarchy was eventually rejected.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt;  In the [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] guild, also founded in 1611, the break was with the saddlemakers, but in 1644 a further split created a new painters' guild, leaving the guild of Saint Luke with only the sculptors and woodcarvers. A similar move in [[The Hague]] in 1656 led to the painters leaving the Guild of Saint Luke to establish a new ''[[Confrerie Pictura]]'' with all other kinds of visual artists, leaving the guild to the house-painters.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.66 &amp; 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists in other cities were not successful in setting up their own guilds of St. Luke, and remained part of the existing guild structure (or lack thereof). For example, an attempt was made in [[Leiden]] to set up a guild in 1610 specifically for painters to protect themselves against the sale of art from foreigners, especially those from areas of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and the area around [[Antwerp]]. However, the town, which traditionally resisted guilds in general, only offered to help them from illegal imports.&lt;ref name="montias93"&gt;Montias (1977): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1648 was a loosely organized "quasi-guild" permitted in that city.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2003): 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guilds of the small but wealthy seat of government The Hague and its near neighbour, Delft, were constantly battling to stop the other's artists encroaching into their city, often without success.  By the later part of the century a kind of balance was achieved, with The Hague's portraitists supplying both cities, whilst Delft's genre painters did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
In [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] the Guild of St. Luke, ''per se'', did not exist. Painters belonged to the guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries ("Arte dei Medici e Speziali") as they bought their pigments from the apothecaries, while sculptors were members of the Masters of Stone and Wood ("Maestri di Pietri e Legname).&lt;ref name="hughes3"&gt;Hughes (1986): 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also frequently members in the confraternity of St. Luke (''Compagnia di San Luca'')—which had been founded as early as 1349—although it was a separate entity from the guild system.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20; Jack (1976): 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were similar confraternal organizations in other parts of Italy, such as Rome.  By the 16th century a guild had even been established in [[Heraklion|Candia]] in [[Crete]], then a Venetian possession, by the very successful Greek artists of the [[Cretan School]]. In the sixteenth century, the ''Compagnia di San Luca'' began to meet at [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze|SS. Annunziata]], and sculptors, who had previously been members of a confraternity dedicated to St. Paul (''Compagnia di San Paolo''), also joined.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the ''compagnia'' developed into the Florentine [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia del Disegno]] in 1563, which was then formally incorporated into the city's guild system in 1572.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; The Florence example, in fact, eventually acted more like a traditional guild structure than the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; 

Founded by [[Federico Zuccari]] in 1593, Rome's Accademia reflects more clearly the "modern" notions of an artistic academy rather than perpetuating what has often been seen as the medieval nature of the guild system.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt;  Gradually other cities were to follow the example of Rome and the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] in [[Bologna]], with leading painters founding an "Academy", not always initially in direct competition with the local Guilds, but tending to eclipse and supplant it in time. This shift in artistic representation is generally associated with the modern conception of the visual arts as a liberal rather than mechanical art, and occurred in cities across Europe. In Antwerp [[David Teniers the Younger]] was both a dean of the Guild and founded the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy]], while in Venice [[Pittoni]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] led a breakaway [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Accademia]] from the old ''Fraglia dei Pittori'' as the local guild was known. The new academies began to offer training in drawing and the early stages of painting to students, and artistic theory, including the [[hierarchy of genres]], increased in importance.

==Guilds and intellectual pursuits==
[[File:Rhetoric-enthroned-invitation-antwerp-landjuweel-1561.jpg|thumb|Printed invitation to other [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] by the Antwerp ''[[Violieren]]'', for a ''landjuweel'' event, lasting 19 days, in 1561]]
The late sixteenth-century elevation of artist's status that occurred in Italy was echoed in the Low Countries by increased participation by artists in literary and humanistic societies. The Antwerp Guild of St. Luke, in particular, was closely associated with one of the city's eminent [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]], the ''[[Violieren]]'', and, in fact, the two were often discussed as being the same.&lt;ref name="gibson431"&gt;Gibson (1981): 431 (also n. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-sixteenth century, when [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] was active in the city, most of the members of the ''Violieren'', including [[Frans Floris]], [[Cornelis Floris]], and [[Hieronymus Cock]], were artists.&lt;ref name="gibson431" /&gt; The relationship between the two organizations, one for professionals practicing a trade and the other a literary and dramatist group, continued into the seventeenth century until the two groups formally merged in 1663 when the Antwerp Academy was founded a century after its Roman counterpart. Similar relationships between the Guild of St. Luke and chambers of rhetoric appear to have existed in Dutch cities in the seventeenth century. [[Haarlem|Haarlem's]] "Liefde boven al" ("Love above all") is a prime example, to which [[Frans Hals]], [[Esaias van de Velde]], and [[Adriaen Brouwer]] all belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Heppner (1939): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These activities also manifested themselves in groups that developed outside of the guild like Antwerp's [[Guild of Romanists|Romanists]], for whom travel to Italy and appreciation of classical and humanist culture were essential.

==Guild rules==
[[File:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|left| [[Judith Leyster]] self-portrait at 20, three years before she became the second woman to join the Haarlem Guild in 1633]]
Guild rules varied greatly. In common with the Guilds for other trades, there would be an initial [[apprentice]]ship of at least three, more often five years. Typically, the apprentice would then qualify as a "[[journeyman]]", free to work for any Guild member.  Some artists began to sign and date paintings a year or two before they reached the next stage, which often involved a payment to the Guild, and was to become a "[[Master craftsman|free Master]]".   After this the artist could sell his own works, set up his own workshop with apprentices of his own, and also sell the work of other artists.  [[Anthony van Dyck]] achieved this at eighteen, but in the twenties would be more typical.   

In some places the maximum number of apprentices was specified (as for example two), especially in the earlier periods, and alternatively a minimum of one might be specified.  In [[Nuremberg]] painting, unlike say goldsmithing, was a "free trade" without a Guild and regulated directly by the city council; this was intended to encourage growth in a city where much art was becoming linked with book [[publishing]], for which Nuremberg was the largest German centre.  Nonetheless there were rules and for example only married men could operate a workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (2002): 105-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In most cities the women who were important members of workshops making [[illuminated manuscript]]s were excluded from the Guild or from being masters; however not in Antwerp, where [[Caterina van Hemessen]] and others were members.  As the Christian title of the Guild suggested, Jews were excluded, at least from becoming masters, in most cities.  

When [[printmaking]] arrived, many [[engraver]]s were from a [[goldsmith]]ing background and stayed in that guild.  As that link weakened with the development of printmaking, some painter' guilds accepted [[engraver]]s or [[etcher]]s who did not paint as Members, and others did not.  In London painters on glass had their own separate guild with the glaziers; elsewhere they would be accepted by the painters.

The rules of the Delft guild have been much puzzled over by art historians seeking to illuminate the undocumented training of [[Vermeer]].  When he joined the Guild there in 1653, he must have received six years training, according to the local rules. In addition, he had to pay a six guilders admission fee, despite the fact that his father was a Guild member (as an art dealer), which would normally have meant only a three guilder fee. This appears to mean that his training had not been received in Delft itself. [[Pieter de Hooch]] on the other hand, as an immigrant to Delft, had to pay twelve guilders in 1655, which he could not afford to pay all at once.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, pp. 166, 285n60, 160,&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the Guild rules is illustrated by the dispute between [[Frans Hals]] and [[Judith Leyster]] in Haarlem.  Leyster was the second woman in Haarlem to join the Guild, and probably trained with Hals - she was a witness at the [[baptism]] of his daughter.  Some years later, in 1635, she brought a dispute to the Guild complaining that one of her three apprentices had left her workshop after only a few days, and had been accepted into Hals' shop, in breach of Guild rules.  The Guild had the power to fine members, and after discovering that the apprentice had not been registered with them, fined both artists, and made a ruling on the apprentice's position.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of the guilds==
All guild local monopolies came under general economic disapproval from the 17th century onwards; in the particular case of painters there was in many places a tension between the Guilds and artists imported as court painter by a ruler.  When [[Anthony van Dyck]] was finally enticed to come to England by King Charles I, he was provided with a house at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the boundary of the [[City of London]] to avoid the monopoly of the London guild.  [[The Hague]] with its Catholic court, split itself in two in 1656 with the [[Confrerie Pictura]]. By that time it was clear to all involved that the one-stop-shop concept of a guild was past its prime, and to ensure high quality and high prices, the education of artists needed to be separated from sales venues. Many towns set up ''academy'' style schools for education, while sales could be generated from arranged viewings at local inns, estate sales, or open markets.  In Antwerp the Habsburg Governors eventually removed the Guild's monopoly, and by the end of the 18th century hardly any guild monopolies survived, even before [[Napoleon]] disbanded all guilds in territories he controlled.  Guilds survived as societies or charitable organisations, or merged with the newer "[[Academy#Academies_of_the_arts|Academies]]" - as happened in Antwerp, but not in London or Paris.  Guild monopoly had a brief 20th century revival in Eastern Europe under [[Communism]], where non-members of the official artist's union or guild found it very hard to work as painters - for example the Czech [[Josef Váchal]].

==Paintings for the guilds==
In many cities the Guild of Saint Luke financed a chapel that was decorated with an altarpiece of their patron saint.&lt;ref name="olds"&gt;Olds (1990): 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogier van der Weyden|Rogier van der Weyden's]] ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'' ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]), one of the earliest-known paintings, set up a tradition that was followed by many subsequent artists.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; [[Jan Gossaert|Jan Gossaert's]] work in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]] (illustrated, top right) revisits Van der Weyden's composition while presenting the scene as a visionary experience instead of a directly witnessed portrait sitting.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; Later, [[Frans Floris]] (1556), [[Marten de Vos]] (1602) and [[Otto van Veen]] all represented the subject for the guild in Antwerp, and [[Abraham Janssens]] painted an altarpiece for the guild in [[Mechelen]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;King (1985): 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are frequently self-portraits with the artist as Luke, and often provide insight into artistic practices from the time when they were made since the subject is of an artist at work.

'''Harry Underwood''' (1969) is a painter known for his use of stenciled images and literary elements atop wood panels. His pictures are painted with house paints and written upon with ordinary No. 2 pencils. His subjects are an eclectic mix of realism, surrealism, pop art and invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry has been labelled an [[outsider artist]], a pop artist, and a folk artist. However, unlike most folk artists, his paintings are carefully planned often taking months prior to their execution. One critic said of the detailed planning that goes into Harry's work that "what results is more a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of [[Edward Hopper]] meets [[Salvador Dali]] meets [[Andy Warhol]]."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is popularly known by his first name "Harry", and distinctively signs his paintings with this moniker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nolan |first1=Joe |title=Harry Underwood at Estel Gallery |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/arts-culture/article/13017001/harry-underwood-at-estel-gallery |website=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Harry Underwood was born in 1969 in Miami, FL. His father was a carpenter and his mother worked in a supermarket. His family was deeply religious and he attended the Church of God pentecostal church with them until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Harry cleaned pools at motels and bussed tables at the Capri Italian Restaurant in Florida City, FL. He was uprooted by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 and spent time in Austin, TX and New Orleans, LA before settling in Nashville, TN where he found work in the construction industry. He began painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry's work is infused with romanticism and an undercurrent of nostalgia for a life not necessarily experienced, but wished for. Repeated images flesh out his work; bathing beauties, motel pools, vintage cars, commercial signs, palm trees, old bicycles, and dancing couples. There is a sense of mid-twentieth century Americana in his works which evokes nostalgia or longing for the vacation one never got to take, or the life one might have lived in the past, with touches of irony and commercialization that relate to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harry Underwood |url=https://www.justfolk.com/product-category/outsider-art/underwood/ |website=Just Folk |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Harry first started painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer and house painter in Nashville, TN. He discovered his color palette while going through half-used paint cans in the garage of a house at which he was working.

His first major solo show was titled "A Pictorial History of Wishful Thinking" and hosted by the Estel Gallery in Nashville, TN in 2007. Since then, his work has been exhibited at numerous leading galleries and institutions across the United States, United Kingdom, and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to "Outsider Artist" Label ==

Though labeled an outsider artist, Harry avoids the term. When asked about it once by a University of North Carolina (Wilmington) researcher, he answered "I don’t think of that label as having anything to do with my vision or how I approach work each day. I don’t consider myself part of a movement. I wasn’t aware of artists like Darger or Edward Hopper until I was meeting people at my shows and they began telling me I reminded them of all that. Persistence is what making art is about. The world is designed to wreck your imagination. I don’t expect I’ll be tied to folk art forever. It wouldn’t be bad if I was. A friend recently called it “Americana,” and I kind of like that." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Louise Smith |first1=Emily |title=A Conversation with Harry Underwood |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/464134/pdf |website=John Hopkins University |publisher=University of North Carolina, Wilmington |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harshness''' (also called '''raucousness'''), in [[music information retrieval]], is a Non-Contextual Low-Level Audio Descriptors (NLDs) that represents one dimension of the multi-dimensional [[psychoacoustic]] feature called as musical [[timbre]].

Classical timbre’ NLDs are [[surface roughness|roughness]], [[spectral centroid]], and [[spectral flux]]. While harmonicity and inharmonicity can also be considered NLDs, harshness differs from them, as well as from roughness, once it reckons for a distinguished perceptual audio feature expressed by the summary spectral periodicity. This feature is especially clear in single-[[Pitch (music)|pitch]], single-[[Musical note|note]], musical audio, where the timbre of two different musical instruments can greatly differ in levels of harshness (e.g., the difference in harshness between a flute and a saxophone is evident). As it is supposed to be, harshness is independent of all others NLDs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7600">An '''Index of Biological Integrity''' ('''IBI'''), also called an '''Index of Biotic Integrity''', is a scientific tool used to identify and classify [[water pollution]] problems. An IBI associates [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] influences on a water body with biological activity in the water body, and is formulated using data developed from [[biosurvey]]s.

==Overview==
To quantitatively assess changes in the composition of biologic communities, IBIs are developed to accurately reflect the [[ecological complexity]] from statistical analysis. There is no one universal IBI, and developing metrics that consistently give accurate assessment of the monitored population requires rigorous testing to confirm its validity for a given subject.  Often IBIs are region-specific and require experienced professionals to provide sufficient quality data to correctly assess a score.  Because communities naturally vary as do samples collected from a larger population, identifying robust [[statistics]] with acceptable variance is an area of active research.

This is the most powerful tool existing to identify systemic impacts on the [[health]] of biological systems.  IBIs are increasingly involved in the identification of [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|impairment]], and confirmation of recovery of [[impaired water]]s, in the [[Total Maximum Daily Load]] process required by the [[Clean Water Act]] in the USA.  

Unlike [[Water pollution#Chemical testing|chemical testing]] of water samples, which gives brief snap-shots of chemical concentrations, an IBI captures an integrated net impact on a biological community structure.  While the complete absence, particularly sudden disappearance of, suits of [[indicator species]] can constitute powerful evidence of a specific pollutant or [[stress factor]], IBIs generally do not resolve a specific cause of impairment.

The IBI concept was formulated by Dr. James Karr in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karr |first1=James R. |year=1981 |title=Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities |journal=Fisheries |volume=6 |issue= |pages=21–27 |url= |doi=10.1577/1548-8446(1981)006&lt;0021:AOBIUF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1548-8446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. 1991. [http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1941848 "Biological integrity: A long-neglected aspect of water resource management."] [http://esapubs.org/esapubs/journals/applications.htm ''Ecological Applications''] 1:66–84.&lt;/ref&gt; To date IBIs have been developed for [[fish]], [[algae]], [[macroinvertebrate]]s, pupal [[exuvia]] (shed skins of [[chironomidae]]), [[vascular plants]], and combinations of these.

==Biosurvey protocols==
Biosurvey protocols have been published for use in different waterbody types and ecoregions. One such publication is the ''Rapid Bioassessment Protocol'' for streams and rivers, issued by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA).&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, M.T., J. Gerritsen, B.D. Snyder, and J.B. Stribling. [http://www.epa.gov/owowwtr1/monitoring/rbp/ "Rapid Bioassessment Protocols for Use in Streams and Wadeable Rivers: Periphyton, Benthic Macroinvertebrates and Fish, Second Edition."] EPA, 1999. Document No. 841-B-99-002.&lt;/ref&gt; Such protocols provide a structure for developing an IBI, which may include measures such as richness of [[taxa]] (species, [[genera]], etc.) and proportion of pollution-tolerant or intolerant taxa.

==Development with volunteer and professional staff==
It is possible to create IBIs for use by minimally trained monitoring personnel, however the precision obtainable is lower than that conducted by trained professionals. Safeguards to assure robustness in spite of potential misidentifications or [[Protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]] variations require careful testing. Ongoing [[quality control]] by established experts is needed to maintain data integrity, and the analysis of IBI results becomes more complex.  Use of trained volunteers is being pioneered by government agencies responsible for monitoring large numbers of water bodies with limited resources, such as the [[Minnesota Pollution Control Agency]] (MPCA) and local volunteer stream monitoring programs supported by MPCA.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the [http://www.mnwhep.org Wetland Health Evaluation Program (WHEP)] in the greater [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] area.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has published guidance to assist volunteer programs in formulating IBIs and related findings.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-06/documents/stream.pdf "Volunteer Stream Monitoring: A Methods Manual."] November 1997. Document No. EPA 841-B-97-003. Section 4.3.&lt;/ref&gt; While IBIs from such programs are legally admissible in [[Federal judiciary of the United States|US courts]], defending the validity of conclusions based solely on such results is unlikely to be feasible.

Agreement among multiple IBIs from data collected by established professionals can be more conclusive. A case in point is the phenomenon that stream IBI scores indicate significant impairment, or partial [[ecological collapse]] where more than 10 to 15 percent of the immediately surrounding [[drainage basin|watershed]] is [[impervious surface|impervious]] due to [[urbanization]].&lt;ref&gt;Schueler, Thomas R. [http://www.cwp.org/Resource_Library/Center_Docs/PWP/ELC_PWP1.pdf "The Importance of Imperviousness."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227110104/http://www.cwp.org/Resource_Library/Center_Docs/PWP/ELC_PWP1.pdf |date=2009-02-27 }} Reprinted in [http://www.cwp.org/Store/guidance.htm ''The Practice of Watershed Protection.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223004441/http://www.cwp.org/Store/guidance.htm |date=2008-12-23 }} 2000. Center for Watershed Protection. Ellicott City, MD.&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying reasons for such impairments, and possible exceptions to these trends, are major research challenges for academics studying [[cumulative watershed effects]], and the use of [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|Low Impact Development]] techniques to mitigate the impacts of [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] pollution.

'''Jerome John McGann''' (born July 22, 1937) is an American academic and textual scholar whose work focuses on the history of literature and culture from the late eighteenth century to the present.

==Career==

Educated at [[Le Moyne College]] ([[B.S.]] 1959), [[Syracuse University]] ([[Master of Arts|M.A.]] 1962) and [[Yale University]] ([[Ph.D.]], 1966), McGann currently teaches at the [[University of Virginia]] (1986–present), where he arrived after leaving [[Caltech]].

McGann is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and has received honorary doctoral degrees from University of Chicago (1996) and University of Athens (2009). Other awards include: Melville Cane Award, American Poetry Society, 1973, for his work on [[Swinburne]] as "The Year's Best Critical Book about Poetry"; Distinguished Scholar Award from the [[John Keats|Keats]]-[[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] Association of America (1989); Distinguished Scholar Award from the Byron Society of America, 1989; and the [[Wilbur Cross Medal]], Yale University Graduate School, 1994.

In 2002 he was the recipient of three major awards: the Richard W. Lyman Award for Distinguished Contributions to Humanities Computing, National Humanities Center (first award recipient); the James Russell Lowell Award (from the Modern Language Association) for ''Radiant Textuality'' as the Most Distinguished Scholarly Book of the Year; and the Mellon Foundation Distinguished Achievement Award.

He has been a [[Fulbright Fellow]] (1965–66), an American Philosophical Society Fellow (1967) and [[Guggenheim Fellow]] (1970–71, 1976–77) and has been awarded NEH grants in 1975-76, 1987–89, 2003–2006, as well as grants from the Getty Foundation, the Delmas Foundation, and the Mellon Foundation.

'''Jérôme Lefèvre''' is an independent art curator and art critic.

In the late 1990s Lefèvre curated a series of cinema programs with films by [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Marie Menken]], [[Tony Conrad]], [[Robert Whitaker (photographer)|Robert Whitaker]], [[Richard Kern]] and Henry Hills. At the same time he curated the exhibition "Sound Games" &lt;ref&gt;(Centre Noroit, Arras, France)&lt;/ref&gt; with artists [[Frédéric Le Junter]], [[Pierre Bastien]] and Arnaud Labelle-Rojoux as well as contemporary music composers. 
In 2004, Lefèvre co-organized "Meanwhile in the real world" at the Sorbonne Chapell where he curated works by [[Franz West]], [[Olaf Breuning]], [[Jean-Michel Othoniel]], Fabrice Gygi and Alex McQuilkin. 
He curated two successive exhibitions at the Palais d'Iéna in Paris : "Pearls Of The North" (with artists [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Atelier Van Lieshout]], Joris van de Moortel, Kelly Schacht, The Plug, Anne Wenzel and Scarlett Hooft Graafland) and "Unlimited Bodies" (with [[Marnie Weber]], [[Tony Oursler]], [[Steven Claydon]], Don Brown, Edward Lipski, Stephan Balkenhol, Damien Deroubaix as well as [[Lucy+Jorge Orta]].

== Contemporary art and heavy metal ==

Lefèvre's work as a curator and a writer focuses on the links between contemporary art and music cultures.  A [[grindcore]] musician himself, he is particularly interested in the imbrications between contemporary art and heavy metal music and culture.

He founded [[C.S. (Conservative Shithead) Journal]] with artist [[Damien Deroubaix]] ([[Marcel Duchamp Prize]] 2009 nominee). C.S. Journal is a monographic publication each time dedicated to a visual artist in regards with its musical references in extreme metal music. The first C.S. Journal issue (with Damien Deroubaix) sorted out for the FIAC, Contemporary Art Fair in Paris in 2009 and contained contributions by legendary [[Mick Harris]] ([[Napalm Death]], Scorn) and [[Jeffrey Walker]] (Carcass).
The second issue  had been conceived by artist Elodie Lesourd and feature contributions by [[Fenriz]] ([[Darkthrone]]) and Hunter Hunt-Hendrix (Liturgy). The third issue is the work of [[Steven Shearer]] with Dieter Roelstraete (MCA Chicago) and Marky Marquis (Coroner) had been published for the 54th [[Venice Biennale]] where Steven Shearer represented Canada.

Lefèvre regularly contributes to magazines and books on the topic. He is the author of an essay on this generation of artists in the book "Black-Metal : Beyond the Darkness" together with Nick Richardson and Brandon Stosuy.

He also exhibited in 2009 the work of photographer [[Seldon Hunt]] (artist and author of art covers for [[Sunn O)))]], [[Earth (American band)]] and [[The Melvins]]) at Galerie du Jour - agnès b. in Paris.

'''Mesohabitat simulation model (MesoHABSIM)''', created by Dr. [[Piotr Parasiewicz]] addresses the requirements of [[Drainage basin|watershed]]-based management of running waters and is designed to predict an aquatic community's response to [[habitat]] modification.

== Overview ==

'''MesoHABSIM''' builds upon pre-existing physical habitat simulation models (e.g. PHABSIM) which is an essential component of the United States government's methods for establishing minimum [[stream flow]] requirements. 
MesoHABSIM is an augmentation of this system, designed during a restoration study of the [[Quinebaug River]].&lt;ref&gt;Northeast Instream Habitat Program. Northeast Instream Habitat Program – Quinbaug River 10 November. 2008. {{cite web |url=http://neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725063409/http://www.neihp.org/projects/quinebaug/index.htm |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The changing spatial distributions of physical attributes of a river as a result of variations in flow and the biological responses of aquatic species to these changes, provide the basis for simulating the consequences of [[ecosystem]] alteration, and consequently the justification of restoration measures. MesoHABSIM modifies the data acquisition technique and analytical approach of similar models by changing the scale of resolution from micro- to meso-scales. Due to this increase in scale, the model takes variations in stream morphology along the river into account and allows for application in larger-scale projects.

== Data collection and analysis ==

Mesohabitat types are defined by their hydromorphological units (HMUs), such as pools and [[rapids]], [[geomorphology]], [[land cover]] and other [[hydrological]] characteristics. Mesohabitats are mapped under multiple flow conditions at extensive sites along the river. Fish data is collected in randomly distributed mesohabitats where habitat surveys are also conducted. This allows modeling of available fish habitat at a range of flows. Rating curves represent the changes in relative area of suitable habitat in response to flow and allow for the determination of habitat quantity at any given flow within the range of surveys. These rating curves can be developed for river units of any size allowing conclusions to be drawn about the suitability of channel patterns or habitat structures for various species of fish for specific sections as well as for the entire river. Rating curves can also be used to evaluate the benefits of various restoration measures on the entire fish community. In combination with hydrologic time series, rating curves are used to create Continuous Under Threshold (CUT) curves for the analysis of frequency, magnitude and duration of significant habitat events. The CUT curve technique described by Capra et al. (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Capra, H., B. Pascal, and Y. Souchon. 1995. A new tool to interpret magnitude and duration of fish habitat variations. Regulated Rivers: Research and Management. 10: 281–289.&lt;/ref&gt;  defines critical thresholds and determines what habitat variability and availability is necessary to support the target river [[fauna]]. CUT curves evaluate durations of unsuitable habitat under a specified threshold by comparing continuous durations in days under this threshold to the cumulative durations in the study period. A highly useful product of the CUT curves are reference tables that can be used to determine how long a given species can tolerate unsuitable conditions depending on its life stage.

== Results ==

To use physical habitat models to analyze and predict ecosystem potential, compositions must also be determined of the native fish community and a subset of species must be selected for model development. The development of a Reference Fish Community (RFC) is based on the Target Fish Community approach, described by Bain and Meixler (2000).&lt;ref&gt;Meixler. 2000. Defining a Target Fish Community for Planning and Evaluating Enhancement on the Quinebaug River in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Report for Quinebaug River Study Agencies. [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, NY&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of species is generated from literature sources and available regional data collected on relatively intact river reaches. The species are ranked on the basis of abundance in long-term fish collection data from multiple rivers of similar character. Securing habitat for naturally occurring [[dominant species (ecology)]] should preserve the most profound characteristics of the ecosystem, providing survival conditions for the majority of the aquatic community and therefore a reference for restoration efforts. The simplest way to create a river habitat model is therefore to select the five to ten highest ranking species for model development. It can then be assumed that community structure reflects habitat structure; therefore, the most common species should indicate the most common habitat. Since habitat availability forms the structure of aquatic fauna, the affinity between the structure of the river habitat and the structure of the fish community can be used as a measure of habitat quality.

The results of MesoHABSIM creates the framework for integrative analysis of many aspects of the ecosystem. It also allows managers to recreate reference conditions and evaluate possible instream and watershed restoration measures or alterations (such as dam removals or changes in water withdrawals). From the perspective of resource managers, it not only allows for quantitative measures of ecological integrity, but also creates a basis for making decisions where trade-offs between resource use and river restoration need to be considered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1518">The '''National Committee for the History of Art''' (NCHA) is the U.S. affiliate of the [[Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art]] (CIHA, i.e. the international community of art historians). It was founded in 1980 by [[Irving Lavin]]. 

Both committees aim to foster intellectual exchange among scholars and students interested in all fields of art history. They organize scholarly conferences and promote the communication, dissemination and exchange of knowledge and information about art history in order to promote a global community of art historians. 

The NCHA is supported by the [[Getty Foundation]] and interested in developing global networks of art historians, particularly in areas of the world in which art history is an emerging discipline. Therefore, it brings together art historians from Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe for discussions on the state of the discipline. The NCHA also provides travel support to congresses for students enrolled in US doctoral programs.

The current president of the NCHA is [[Marc Gotlieb]], Director of the Graduate Program and Class of 1955 Memorial Professor of Art at [[Williams College]], [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]].

The '''neuroscience of music''' is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying [[music]]. These behaviours include music [[listening]], [[Performance|performing]], [[Musical composition|composing]], reading, writing, and ancillary activities. It also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for [[Aesthetics of music|musical aesthetics]] and musical emotion. Scientists working in this field may have training in cognitive neuroscience, [[neurology]], [[neuroanatomy]], [[psychology]], [[music theory]], [[computer science]], and other relevant fields.

The cognitive neuroscience of music represents a significant branch of [[music psychology]], and is distinguished from related fields such as [[cognitive musicology]] in its reliance on direct observations of the brain and use of such techniques as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS), [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG), [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

== Neurological bases ==

===Pitch===
Successive parts of the [[tonotopy|tonotopically]] organized [[basilar membrane]] in the [[cochlea]] resonate to corresponding [[frequency]] [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidths]] of incoming sound. The [[hair cell]]s in the cochlea release [[neurotransmitter]] as a result, causing [[action potentials]] down the [[auditory nerve]]. The auditory nerve then leads to several layers of [[synapses]] at numerous [[Nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] in the [[Auditory system#Central auditory system|auditory brainstem]]. These nuclei are also tonotopically organized, and the process of achieving this tonotopy after the cochlea is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nn.2332 |title=Tonotopic reorganization of developing auditory brainstem circuits |year=2009 |last1=Kandler |first1=Karl |last2=Clause |first2=Amanda |last3=Noh |first3=Jihyun |journal=Nature Neuroscience |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=711–7 |pmid=19471270 |pmc=2780022}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tonotopy is in general maintained up to [[primary auditory cortex]] in [[mammals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(82)90118-3 |title=Cortical magnetic fields evoked by frequency glides of a continuous tone |year=1982 |last1=Arlinger |first1=S |last2=Elberling |first2=C |last3=Bak |first3=C |last4=Kofoed |first4=B |last5=Lebech |first5=J |last6=Saermark |first6=K |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=642–53 |pmid=6183097}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it is often found that cells in primary and non-primary auditory cortex have [[Spatio temporal receptive field|spatio-temporal receptive fields]], rather than being strictly responsive or phase-locking their action potentials to narrow frequency regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cercor/11.3.183 |title=Feature Article: The Structure and Function of Dynamic Cortical and Thalamic Receptive Fields |year=2001 |last1=Ghazanfar |first1=A.

=== Melody processing in the secondary auditory cortex ===

Studies suggest that individuals are capable of automatically detecting a difference or anomaly in a [[melody]] such as an out of tune [[pitch (music)|pitch]] which does not fit with their previous music experience. This automatic processing occurs in the secondary auditory cortex. Brattico, Tervaniemi, Naatanen, and Peretz (2006) performed one such study to determine if the detection of tones that do not fit an individual's expectations can occur automatically.&lt;ref name="Brattico"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2006.08.023 |title=Musical scale properties are automatically processed in the human auditory cortex |year=2006 |last1=Brattico |first1=Elvira |last2=Tervaniemi |first2=Mari |last3=Näätänen |first3=Risto |last4=Peretz |first4=Isabelle |journal=Brain Research |volume=1117 |pages=162–74 |pmid=16963000 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They recorded [[event-related potential]]s (ERPs) in nonmusicians as they were presented unfamiliar melodies with either an out of tune pitch or an out of key pitch while participants were either distracted from the sounds or attending to the melody. Both conditions revealed an early frontal negativity independent of where attention was directed. This negativity originated in the auditory cortex, more precisely in the supratemporal lobe (which corresponds with the secondary auditory cortex) with greater activity from the right hemisphere. The negativity response was larger for pitch that was out of tune than that which was out of key. Ratings of musical incongruity were higher for out of tune pitch melodies than for out of key pitch.  In the focused attention condition, out of key and out of tune pitches produced late parietal positivity. The findings of Brattico et al. (2006) suggest that there is automatic and rapid processing of melodic properties in the secondary auditory cortex.&lt;ref name="Brattico"/&gt; The findings that pitch incongruities were detected automatically, even in processing unfamiliar melodies, suggests that there is an automatic comparison of incoming information with long term knowledge of musical scale properties, such as culturally influenced rules of musical properties (common chord progressions, scale patterns, etc.) and individual expectations of how the melody should proceed. The auditory area processes the sound of the music. The auditory area is located in the temporal lobe. The temporal lobe deals with the recognition and perception of auditory stimuli, memory, and speech (Kinser, 2012).

=== Role of right auditory cortex in fine pitch resolution ===

[[File:Brodmann 41 42.png|right|250px|thumb|The [[primary auditory cortex]] is one of the main areas associated with superior pitch resolution.]]

The right secondary auditory cortex has finer pitch resolution than the left. Hyde, Peretz and Zatorre (2008) used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in their study to test the involvement of right and left auditory cortical regions in frequency processing of melodic sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.09.004 |title=Evidence for the role of the right auditory cortex in fine pitch resolution |year=2008 |last1=Hyde |first1=Krista L. |last2=Peretz |first2=Isabelle |last3=Zatorre |first3=Robert J. |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=632–9 |pmid=17959204}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as finding superior pitch resolution in the right secondary auditory cortex, specific areas found to be involved were the [[planum temporale]] (PT) in the secondary auditory cortex, and the [[primary auditory cortex]] in the medial section of Heschl's gyrus (HG).

Many neuroimaging studies have found evidence of the importance of right secondary auditory regions in aspects of musical pitch processing, such as melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(02)01060-7 |title=The Processing of Temporal Pitch and Melody Information in Auditory Cortex |year=2002 |last1=Patterson |first1=Roy D |last2=Uppenkamp |first2=Stefan |last3=Johnsrude |first3=Ingrid S |last4=Griffiths |first4=Timothy D |journal=Neuron |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=767–76 |pmid=12441063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these studies such as one by Patterson, Uppenkamp, Johnsrude and Griffiths (2002) also find evidence of a hierarchy of pitch processing. Patterson et al. (2002) used spectrally matched sounds which produced: no pitch, fixed pitch or melody in an fMRI study and found that all conditions activated HG and PT. Sounds with pitch activated more of these regions than sounds without. When a melody was produced activation spread to the [[superior temporal gyrus]] (STG) and planum polare (PP). These results support the existence of a pitch processing hierarchy.

===Rhythm===
The belt and parabelt areas of the right hemisphere are involved in processing [[rhythm]]. When individuals are preparing to tap out a rhythm of regular intervals (1:2 or 1:3) the left [[frontal cortex]], left [[parietal cortex]], and right [[cerebellum]] are all activated.  With more difficult rhythms such as a 1:2.5, more areas in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum are involved.&lt;ref name="Tramo"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1126/science.10.1126/science.1056899|title=BIOLOGY AND MUSIC: Enhanced: Music of the Hemispheres |year=2001 |last1=Tramo |first1=M. J. |journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5501 |pages=54–6 |pmid=11192009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[EEG]] recordings have also shown a relationship between brain electrical activity and rhythm perception. Snyder and Large (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cogbrainres.2004.12.014 |title=Gamma-band activity reflects the metric structure of rhythmic tone sequences |year=2005 |last1=Snyder |first1=Joel S. |last2=Large |first2=Edward W. |journal=Cognitive Brain Research |volume=24 |pages=117–26 |pmid=15922164 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed a study examining rhythm perception in human subjects, finding that activity in the [[gamma wave|gamma band]] (20 – 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) corresponds to the [[Beat (music)|beats]] in a simple rhythm. Two types of gamma activity were found by Snyder &amp; Large: induced gamma activity, and [[Evoked potential#Auditory evoked potential|evoked]] gamma activity. Evoked gamma activity was found after the onset of each tone in the rhythm; this activity was found to be phase-locked (peaks and troughs were directly related to the exact onset of the tone) and did not appear when a gap (missed beat) was present in the rhythm. Induced gamma activity, which was not found to be phase-locked, was also found to correspond with each beat. However, induced gamma activity did not subside when a gap was present in the rhythm, indicating that induced gamma activity may possibly serve as a sort of internal metronome independent of auditory input. The motor and auditory areas are located in the cerebrum of the brain.  The motor area processes the rhythm of the music (Dean, 2013).{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}  The motor area of the brain is located in the parietal lobe. The parietal lobe also deals with orientation, recognition, and perception.

===Tonality===
[[Tonality]] describes the relationships between the elements of melody and [[harmony]] – tones, [[Interval (music)|intervals]], [[Chord (music)|chords]], and [[Scale (music)|scales]]. These relationships are often characterised as hierarchical, such that one of the elements dominates or attracts another. They occur both within and between every type of element, creating a rich and time-varying percept between tones and their melodic, harmonic, and [[Chromatic scale|chromatic]] contexts. In one conventional sense, tonality refers to just the [[Major scale|major]] and [[Minor scale|minor]] scale types – examples of scales whose elements are capable of maintaining a consistent set of functional relationships. The most important functional relationship is that of the [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] note and the tonic chord with the rest of the scale. The tonic is the element which tends to assert its dominance and attraction over all others, and it functions as the ultimate point of attraction, rest and resolution for the scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Krumhansl |first=Carol |title=Cognitive Foundations of Musical Pitch |year=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-514836-7}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right auditory cortex is primarily involved in perceiving  pitch, and parts of harmony, melody and rhythm.&lt;ref name="Tramo"/&gt; One study by Petr Janata found that there are tonality-sensitive areas in the [[medial prefrontal cortex]], the [[cerebellum]], the [[Superior temporal sulcus|superior temporal sulci]] of both hemispheres and the [[Superior temporal gyrus|superior temporal gyri]] (which has a skew towards the right hemisphere).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1076262 |title=The Cortical Topography of Tonal Structures Underlying Western Music |year=2002 |last1=Janata |first1=P. |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5601 |pages=2167–70 |pmid=12481131 |last2=Birk |first2=JL |last3=Van Horn |first3=JD |last4=Leman |first4=M |last5=Tillmann |first5=B |last6=Bharucha |first6=JJ|bibcode = 2002Sci...298.2167J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music production and performance==

===Motor control functions===

Musical performance usually involves at least three elementary motor control functions: timing, sequencing, and spatial organization of motor movements.  Accuracy in timing of movements is related to musical rhythm. Rhythm, the pattern of temporal intervals within a musical measure or [[musical phrase|phrase]], in turn creates the perception of stronger and weaker beats.&lt;ref name= Zatorre&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zatorre | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Halpern | first2 = A. R. | year = 2005 | title = Mental concerts: musical imagery and auditory cortex | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 9–12 | doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.06.013 | pmid=15996544}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sequencing and spatial organization relate to the expression of individual notes on a [[musical instrument]].

These functions and their neural mechanisms have been investigated separately in many studies, but little is known about their combined interaction in producing a complex musical performance.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;  The study of music requires examining them together.

====Timing====
Although neural mechanisms involved in timing movement have been studied rigorously over the past 20 years, much remains controversial.  The ability to phrase movements in precise time has been accredited to a neural [[metronome]] or clock mechanism where time is represented through oscillations or pulses.&lt;ref name= Buhusi &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buhusi | first1 = C.

[[Functional neuroimaging]] studies, as well as studies of brain-damaged patients, have linked movement timing to several [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] and sub-cortical regions, including the [[cerebellum]], [[basal ganglia]] and [[supplementary motor area]] (SMA).&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; Specifically the basal ganglia and possibly the SMA have been implicated in interval timing at longer timescales (1 second and above), while the cerebellum may be more important for controlling motor timing at shorter timescales (milliseconds).&lt;ref name="Buhusi"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Lewis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = P.

Neurobiol. | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 250–255 | doi=10.1016/s0959-4388(03)00036-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these results indicate that motor timing is not controlled by a single brain region, but by a network of regions that control specific parameters of movement and that depend on the relevant timescale of the rhythmic sequence.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;

====Sequencing====
Motor sequencing has been explored in terms of either the ordering of individual movements, such as finger sequences for key presses, or the coordination of subcomponents of complex multi-joint movements.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; Implicated in this process are various cortical and sub-cortical regions, including the basal ganglia, the SMA and the pre-SMA, the cerebellum, and the premotor and prefrontal cortices, all involved in the production and learning of motor sequences but without explicit evidence of their specific contributions or interactions amongst one another.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt; In animals, neurophysiological studies have demonstrated an interaction between the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia during the learning of movement sequences.&lt;ref name= Graybiel&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graybiel | first1 = A.

Chunking, defined as the re-organization or re-grouping of movement sequences into smaller sub-sequences during performance, is thought to facilitate the smooth performance of complex movements and to improve [[motor memory]].&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;  
Lastly, the premotor cortex has been shown to be involved in tasks that require the production of relatively complex sequences, and it may contribute to motor prediction.&lt;ref name= Janata&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janata | first1 = P. | last2 = Grafton | first2 = S.

====Spatial organization====
Few studies of complex motor control have distinguished between sequential and spatial organization, yet expert musical performances demand not only precise sequencing but also spatial organization of movements. Studies in animals and humans have established the involvement of [[parietal lobe|parietal]], sensory–motor and premotor cortices in the control of movements, when the integration of spatial, sensory and motor information is required.&lt;ref name= Johnson&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = P.

Clin. Neurophysiol. | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 283–296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Few studies so far have explicitly examined the role of spatial processing in the context of musical tasks.

===Auditory-motor interactions===

====Feedforward and feedback interactions====
An auditory–motor interaction may be loosely defined as any engagement of or communication between the two systems.  Two classes of auditory-motor interaction are "feedforward" and "feedback".&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;  In feedforward interactions, it is the auditory system that predominately influences the motor output, often in a predictive way.&lt;ref name= Large&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Large | first1 = E. W. | last2 = Palmer | first2 = C. | year = 2002 | title = Perceiving temporal regularity in music. | url = | journal = Cogn Sci | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 1–37 | doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2601_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the phenomenon of tapping to the beat, where the listener anticipates the rhythmic accents in a piece of music. Another example is the effect of music on movement disorders: rhythmic auditory stimuli have been shown to improve walking ability in [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[stroke]] patients.&lt;ref name= Thaut&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thaut | first1 = M.

Psychiatry | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 22–26 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.62.1.22| pmc = 486690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feedback interactions are particularly relevant in playing an instrument such as a violin, or in singing, where pitch is variable and must be continuously controlled. If auditory feedback is blocked, musicians can still execute well-rehearsed pieces, but expressive aspects of performance are affected.&lt;ref name= Repp&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Repp | first1 = B. H. | year = 1999 | title = Effects of auditory feedback deprivation on expressive piano performance | url = | journal = Music Perception | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 409–438 | doi=10.2307/40285802}}&lt;/ref&gt; When auditory feedback is experimentally manipulated by delays or distortions,&lt;ref name= Pfordresher&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pfordresher | first1 = P. Q. | last2 = Palmer | first2 = C. | year = 2006 | title = Effects of hearing the past, present, or future during music performance | url = | journal = Percept. Psychophys. | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 362–376 | doi=10.3758/bf03193683}}&lt;/ref&gt; motor performance is significantly altered: asynchronous feedback disrupts the timing of events, whereas alteration of pitch information disrupts the selection of appropriate actions, but not their timing. This suggests that disruptions occur because both actions and percepts depend on a single underlying mental representation.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;

====Models of auditory–motor interactions====
Several models of auditory–motor interactions have been advanced. The model of Hickok and Poeppel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hickok | first1 = G. | last2 = Poeppel | first2 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Dorsal and ventral streams: a framework for understanding aspects of the functional anatomy of language | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 67–99 | doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.10.011 | pmid=15037127}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is specific for speech processing, proposes that a ventral auditory stream maps sounds onto meaning, whereas a dorsal stream maps sounds onto articulatory representations. They and others&lt;ref name= Scott&gt;Scott, S. K. &amp; Johnsrude, I. S. "The neuroanatomical and functional organization of speech perception. ''Trends Neurosci''. 26, 100–107 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that posterior auditory regions at the parieto-temporal boundary are crucial parts of the auditory–motor interface, mapping auditory representations onto motor representations of speech, and onto melodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hickok | first1 = G. | last2 = Buchsbaum | first2 = B. | last3 = Humphries | first3 = C. | last4 = Muftuler | first4 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Auditory–motor interaction revealed by fMRI: speech, music, and working memory in area SPT | url = | journal = J.

====Mirror/echo neurons and auditory–motor interactions====
The [[mirror neuron]] system has an important role in neural models of sensory–motor integration. There is considerable evidence that neurons respond to both actions and the accumulated observation of actions.  A system proposed to explain this understanding of actions is that visual representations of actions are mapped onto our own motor system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Fogassi | first2 = L. | last3 = Gallese | first3 = V. | year = 2001 | title = Neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the understanding and imitation of action | doi = 10.1038/35090060 | journal = Nature Reviews Neuroscience| volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 661–670 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some mirror neurons are activated both by the observation of goal-directed actions, and by the associated sounds produced during the action.  This suggests that the auditory modality can access the motor system.&lt;ref name= Kohler&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohler | first1 = E. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = Hearing sounds, understanding actions: action representation in mirror neurons | url = | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = | pages = 846–848 | doi=10.1126/science.1070311 | pmid=12161656|bibcode = 2002Sci...297..846K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Keysers&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keysers | first1 = C. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2003 | title = Audiovisual mirror neurons and action recognition.

Results point to a broader involvement of the dPMC and other motor areas.&lt;ref name="Zatorre"/&gt;

==Music and language==
{{See also|Musical semantics|Musical syntax}}
Certain aspects of [[language]] and melody have been shown to be processed in near identical functional brain areas.  Brown, Martinez and Parsons (2006) examined the neurological structural similarities between music and language.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.04785.x |title=Music and language side by side in the brain: A PET study of the generation of melodies and sentences |year=2006 |last1=Brown |first1=Steven |last2=Martinez |first2=Michael J. |last3=Parsons |first3=Lawrence M. |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=2791–803 |pmid=16817882}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Utilizing positron emission tomography (PET), the findings showed that both linguistic and melodic phrases produced activation in almost identical functional brain areas.  These areas included the [[primary motor cortex]], [[supplementary motor area]], [[Broca's area]], anterior insula, primary and secondary auditory cortices, temporal pole, [[basal ganglia]], ventral [[thalamus]] and posterior [[cerebellum]].  Differences were found in lateralization tendencies as language tasks favoured the left hemisphere, but the majority of activations were bilateral which produced significant overlap across modalities.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

Syntactical information mechanisms in both music and language have been shown to be processed similarly in the brain.  Jentschke, Koelsch, Sallat and Friederici (2008) conducted a study investigating the processing of music in children with [[Speech and language pathology in school settings#Specific language impairment|specific language impairments]] (SLI).&lt;ref name="Jentschke"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.2008.20135 |title=Children with Specific Language Impairment Also Show Impairment of Music-syntactic Processing |year=2008 |last1=Jentschke |first1=Sebastian |last2=Koelsch |first2=Stefan |last3=Sallat |first3=Stephan |last4=Friederici |first4=Angela D. |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=1940–51 |pmid=18416683}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children with typical language development (TLD) showed ERP patterns different from  those of children with SLI, which reflected their challenges in processing music-syntactic regularities.  Strong correlations between the ERAN (''Early Right Anterior Negativity''—a specific ERP measure) amplitude and linguistic and musical abilities provide additional evidence for the relationship of syntactical processing in music and language.&lt;ref name="Jentschke"/&gt;

However, production of melody and production of speech may be subserved by different neural networks.  Stewart, Walsh, Frith and Rothwell (2001) studied the differences between speech production and song production using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb05762.x |title=Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Produces Speech Arrest but Not Song Arrest |year=2006 |last1=Stewart |first1=Lauren |last2=Walsh |first2=Vincent |last3=Frith |first3=UTA |last4=Rothwell |first4=John |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=930 |pages=433–5 |pmid=11458860 |issue=1|bibcode = 2001NYASA.930..433S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart et al. found that TMS applied to the left [[frontal lobe]] disturbs speech but not melody supporting the idea that they are subserved by different areas of the brain.  The authors suggest that a reason for the difference is that speech generation can be localized well but the underlying mechanisms of melodic production cannot.  Alternatively, it was also suggested that speech production may be less robust than melodic production and thus more susceptible to interference.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;

Language processing is a function more of the left side of the brain than the right side, particularly Broca's area and [[Wernicke's area]], though the roles played by the two sides of the brain in processing different aspects of language are still unclear. Music is also processed by both the left and the right sides of the brain.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mb1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nimg.2002.1154 |title=Bach Speaks: A Cortical "Language-Network" Serves the Processing of Music |year=2002 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Gunter |first2=Thomas C. |last3=v Cramon |first3=D.Yves |last4=Zysset |first4=Stefan |last5=Lohmann |first5=Gabriele |last6=Friederici |first6=Angela D. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=956–66 |pmid=12377169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent evidence further suggest shared processing between language and music at the conceptual level.&lt;ref name=Daltrozzo09&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.2009.21113 |title=Conceptual Processing in Music as Revealed by N400 Effects on Words and Musical Targets |year=2009 |last1=Daltrozzo |first1=Jérôme |last2=Schön |first2=Daniele |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=21 |issue=10 |pages=1882–92 |pmid=18823240}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that, among music conservatory students, the prevalence of absolute pitch is much higher for speakers of tone language, even controlling for ethnic background, showing that language influences how musical tones are perceived.&lt;ref name="phil-43"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.2151799 |title=Absolute pitch among American and Chinese conservatory students: Prevalence differences, and evidence for a speech-related critical period |year=2006 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |last2=Henthorn |first2=Trevor |last3=Marvin |first3=Elizabeth |last4=Xu |first4=Hongshuai |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=719–22 |pmid=16521731|bibcode = 2006ASAJ..119..719D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-388"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.3081389 |title=Absolute pitch among students in an American music conservatory: Association with tone language fluency |year=2009 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |last2=Dooley |first2=Kevin |last3=Henthorn |first3=Trevor |last4=Head |first4=Brian |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=125 |issue=4 |pages=2398–403 |pmid=19354413|bibcode = 2009ASAJ..125.2398D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Musician vs. non-musician processing ==

[[File:Player piano keyboard.jpg|right|thumb|Professional pianists show less cortical activation for complex finger movement tasks due to structural differences in the brain.]]

=== Differences ===

Brain structure within musicians and non-musicians is distinctly different.  Gaser and Schlaug (2003) compared brain structures of professional musicians with non-musicians and discovered [[Grey matter|gray matter]] volume differences in motor, auditory and visual-spatial brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14534258 |year=2003 |last1=Gaser |first1=C |last2=Schlaug |first2=G |title=Brain structures differ between musicians and non-musicians |volume=23 |issue=27 |pages=9240–5 |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, positive correlations were discovered between musician status (professional, amateur and non-musician) and gray matter volume in the primary motor and [[Somatosensory system|somatosensory areas]], [[Premotor cortex|premotor areas]], anterior superior parietal areas and in the inferior temporal gyrus bilaterally.  This strong association between musician status and gray matter differences supports the notion that musicians' brains show use-dependent structural changes.&lt;ref name="DoifpsygMissing"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00393 |title=Music, Neuroscience, and the Psychology of Well-Being: A Précis |year=2012 |last1=Croom |first1=Adam M. |journal=Frontiers in Psychology |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the distinct differences in several brain regions, it is unlikely that these differences are innate but rather due to the long-term acquisition and repetitive rehearsal of musical skills.

Brains of musicians also show functional differences from those of non-musicians.  Krings, Topper, Foltys, Erberich, Sparing, Willmes and Thron (2000) utilized fMRI to study brain area involvement of professional pianists and a control group while performing complex finger movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0304-3940(99)00930-1 |title=Cortical activation patterns during complex motor tasks in piano players and control subjects. A functional magnetic resonance imaging study |year=2000 |last1=Krings |first1=Timo |last2=Töpper |first2=Rudolf |last3=Foltys |first3=Henrik |last4=Erberich |first4=Stephan |last5=Sparing |first5=Roland |last6=Willmes |first6=Klaus |last7=Thron |first7=Armin |journal=Neuroscience Letters |volume=278 |issue=3 |pages=189–93 |pmid=10653025}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Krings et al. found that the professional piano players showed lower levels of cortical activation in motor areas of the brain.  It was concluded that a lesser amount of neurons needed to be activated for the piano players due to long-term motor practice which results in the different cortical activation patterns.  Koeneke, Lutz, Wustenberg and Jancke (2004) reported similar findings in keyboard players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000127463.10147.e7 |title=Long-term training affects cerebellar processing in skilled keyboard players |year=2004 |last1=Koeneke |first1=Susan |last2=Lutz |first2=Kai |last3=Wüstenberg |first3=Torsten |last4=Jäncke |first4=Lutz |journal=NeuroReport |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=1279–82 |pmid=15167549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled keyboard players and a control group performed complex tasks involving unimanual and bimanual finger movements. During task conditions, strong hemodynamic responses in the cerebellum were shown by both non-musicians and keyboard players, but non-musicians showed the stronger response. This finding indicates that different cortical activation patterns emerge from long-term motor practice. This evidence supports previous data showing that musicians require fewer neurons to perform the same movements.

Musicians have been shown to have significantly more developed left planum temporales, and have also shown to have a greater word memory.&lt;ref&gt;(Chan et al.){{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan's study controlled for age, grade point average and years of education and found that when given a 16 word memory test, the musicians averaged one to two more words above their non musical counterparts.

=== Similarities ===

Studies have shown that the human brain has an implicit musical ability.&lt;ref name="KoelschGunter"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/089892900562183 |title=Brain Indices of Music Processing: "Nonmusicians" are Musical |year=2000 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Gunter |first2=Tomas |last3=Friederici |first3=Angela D. |last4=Schröger |first4=Erich |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=520–41 |pmid=10931776}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KoelschSchroger"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1469-8986.3910038 |title=Music matters: Preattentive musicality of the human brain |year=2002 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Schroger |first2=Erich |last3=Gunter |first3=Thomas C. |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=39 |pages=38–48 |pmid=12206294 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koelsch, Gunter, Friederici and Schoger (2000) investigated the influence of preceding musical context, task relevance of unexpected [[Chord (music)|chord]]s and the degree of probability of violation on music processing in both musicians and non-musicians.&lt;ref name="KoelschGunter"/&gt; Findings showed that the human brain unintentionally extrapolates expectations about impending auditory input. Even in non-musicians, the extrapolated expectations are consistent with music theory.  The ability to process information musically supports the idea of an implicit musical ability in the human brain.  In a follow-up study, Koelsch, Schroger, and Gunter (2002) investigated whether ERAN and N5 could be evoked preattentively in non-musicians.&lt;ref name="KoelschSchroger"/&gt; Findings showed that both ERAN and N5 can be elicited even in a situation where the musical stimulus is ignored by the listener indicating that there is a highly differentiated preattentive musicality in the human brain.

== Gender differences ==

Minor neurological differences regarding hemispheric processing exist between brains of males and females.  Koelsch, Maess, Grossmann and Friederici (2003) investigated music processing through EEG and ERPs and discovered gender differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001756-200304150-00010 |title=Electric brain responses reveal gender differences in music processing |year=2003 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Maess |first2=Burkhard |last3=Grossmann |first3=Tobias |last4=Friederici |first4=Angela D. |journal=NeuroReport |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=709–13 |pmid=12692468}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Findings showed that females process music information bilaterally and males process music with a right-hemispheric predominance.  However, the early negativity of males was also present over the left hemisphere.  This indicates that males do not exclusively utilize the right hemisphere for musical information processing.  In a follow-up study, Koelsch, Grossman, Gunter, Hahne, Schroger and Friederici (2003)  found that boys show lateralization of the early anterior negativity in the left hemisphere but found a bilateral effect in girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.2003.15.5.683 |title=Children Processing Music: Electric Brain Responses Reveal Musical Competence and Gender Differences |year=2003 |last1=Koelsch |first1=Stefan |last2=Grossmann |first2=Tobias |last3=Gunter |first3=Thomas C. |last4=Hahne |first4=Anja |last5=Schröger |first5=Erich |last6=Friederici |first6=Angela D. |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=683–93 |pmid=12965042}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This indicates a developmental effect as early negativity is lateralized in the right hemisphere in men and in the left hemisphere in boys.

== Handedness differences ==

It has been found that subjects who are lefthanded, particularly those who are also ambidextrous, perform better than righthanders on short term memory for the pitch.&lt;ref name="phil-4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.622558 |title=Pitch memory: An advantage for the left-handed | volume=199 | issue=4328 |journal=Science |pages=559–560 |pmid=622558 |date=February 1978|bibcode = 1978Sci...199..559D  | last1 = Deutsch | first1 = D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-25"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutsch |first=Diana |chapter=Handedness and Memory for Tonal Pitch |editor1-first=Jeannine |editor1-last=Herron |title=Neuropsychology of Lefthandedness |pages=263–71 |year=1980 |chapterurl=http://philomel.com/pdf/Ch-Handedness-1980.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was hypothesized that this handedness advantage is due to the fact that lefthanders have more duplication of storage in the two hemispheres than do righthanders. Other work has shown that there are pronounced differences between righthanders and lefthanders (on a statistical basis) in how musical patterns are perceived, when sounds come from different regions of space.  This has been found, for example, in the [[Octave illusion]]&lt;ref name="phil-85"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/251307a0 |title=An auditory illusion |year=1974 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |journal=Nature |volume=251 |issue=5473 |pages=307–9 |pmid=4427654|bibcode = 1974Natur.251..307D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-2"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0028-3932(83)90047-7 |title=The octave illusion in relation to handedness and familial handedness background |year=1983 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=289–93 |pmid=6877583}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Scale illusion]].&lt;ref name="phil-6"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1121/1.380573 |title=Two-channel listening to musical scales |year=1975 |last1=Deutsch |first1=Diana |journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=1156–60 |pmid=1127169|bibcode = 1975ASAJ...57.1156D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phil-22"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutsch |first=D. |chapter=Grouping mechanisms in music |editor1-first=D. |editor1-last=Deutsch |title=The psychology of music |edition=2nd |pages=299–348 |year=1999 |chapterurl=http://philomel.com/pdf/PsychMus_Ch9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical imagery==
{{See also|Audiation}}
Musical imagery refers to the experience of replaying music by imagining it inside the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb05733.x |title=Cerebral Substrates of Musical Imagery |year=2006 |last1=Halpern |first1=Andrea R. |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=930 |pages=179–92 |pmid=11458829 |issue=1|bibcode = 2001NYASA.930..179H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Musicians show a superior ability for musical imagery due to intense musical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06515.x |title=Neural basis of music imagery and the effect of musical expertise |year=2008 |last1=Herholz |first1=Sibylle C. |last2=Lappe |first2=Claudia |last3=Knief |first3=Arne |last4=Pantev |first4=Christo |journal=European Journal of Neuroscience |volume=28 |issue=11 |pages=2352–60 |pmid=19046375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Herholz, Lappe, Knief and Pantev (2008) investigated the differences in neural processing of a musical imagery task in musicians and non-musicians.  Utilizing magnetoencephalography (MEG), Herholz et al. examined differences in the processing of a musical imagery task with familiar melodies in musicians and non-musicians.  Specifically, the study examined whether the [[mismatch negativity]] (MMN) can be based solely on imagery of sounds.  The task involved participants listening to the beginning of a melody, continuation of the melody in his/her head and finally hearing a correct/incorrect tone as further continuation of the melody.  The imagery of these melodies was strong enough to obtain an early preattentive brain response to unanticipated violations of the imagined melodies in the musicians.  These results indicate similar neural correlates are relied upon for trained musicians imagery and perception.  Additionally, the findings suggest that modification of the imagery mismatch negativity (iMMN) through intense musical training results in achievement of a superior ability for imagery and preattentive processing of music.

Perceptual musical processes and musical imagery may share a neural substrate in the brain.  A PET study conducted by Zatorre, Halpern, Perry, Meyer and Evans (1996) investigated [[cerebral blood flow]] (CBF) changes related to auditory imagery and perceptual tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.1996.8.1.29 |title=Hearing in the Mind's Ear: A PET Investigation of Musical Imagery and Perception |year=1996 |last1=Zatorre |first1=Robert J. |last2=Halpern |first2=Andrea R. |last3=Perry |first3=David W. |last4=Meyer |first4=Ernst |last5=Evans |first5=Alan C. |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=8 |pages=29–46 |pmid=23972234 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tasks examined the involvement of particular anatomical regions as well as functional commonalities between perceptual processes and imagery. Similar patterns of CBF changes provided evidence supporting the notion that imagery processes share a substantial neural substrate with related perceptual processes. Bilateral neural activity in the secondary auditory cortex was associated with both perceiving and imagining songs. This implies that within the secondary auditory cortex, processes underlie the phenomenological impression of imagined sounds.  The [[supplementary motor area]] (SMA) was active in both imagery and perceptual tasks suggesting covert vocalization as an element of musical imagery.  CBF increases in the inferior frontal polar cortex and right thalamus suggest that these regions may be related to retrieval and/or generation of auditory information from memory.

== Absolute pitch ==

[[File:A C D notes.svg|right|150px|thumb|Musicians possessing perfect pitch can identify the pitch of musical tones without external reference.]]

{{Main|Absolute pitch}}

[[Absolute pitch]] (AP) is defined as the ability to identify the pitch of a musical tone or to produce a musical tone at a given pitch without the use of an external reference pitch.&lt;ref name="phil-494"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Deutsch, D. | title=Absolute pitch In D. Deutsch (Ed.) | journal=The psychology of music, 3rd Edition | volume= | pages=141–182 | year=2013 |doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-381460-9.00005-5 | isbn=9780123814609 }} [http://philomel.com/pdf/PsyMus_3_Ch5_Absolute_Pitch.pdf PDF Document]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.113.2.345 |title=Absolute pitch |year=1993 |last1=Takeuchi |first1=Annie H. |last2=Hulse |first2=Stewart H. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=113 |issue=2 |pages=345–61 |pmid=8451339}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neuroscientific research has not discovered a distinct activation pattern common for possessors of AP.  Zatorre, Perry, Beckett, Westbury and Evans (1998) examined the neural foundations of AP using functional and structural brain imaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert J. |last1=Zatorre |first2=David W. |last2=Perry |first3=Christine A. |last3=Beckett |first4=Christopher F. |last4=Westbury |first5=Alan C. |last5=Evans |pmid=9501235 |year=1998 |title=Functional anatomy of musical processing in listeners with absolute pitch and relative pitch |volume=95 |issue=6 |pages=3172–7 |pmc=19714 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.3172Z |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.6.3172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Positron emission tomography (PET) was utilized to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) in musicians possessing AP and musicians lacking AP.  When presented with musical tones, similar patterns of increased CBF in auditory cortical areas emerged in both groups.  AP possessors and non-AP subjects demonstrated similar patterns of left dorsolateral frontal activity when they performed relative pitch judgments.  However, in non-AP subjects activation in the right inferior frontal cortex was present whereas AP possessors showed no such activity.  This finding suggests that musicians with AP do not need access to working memory devices for such tasks.  These findings imply that there is no specific regional activation pattern unique to AP.  Rather, the availability of specific processing mechanisms and task demands determine the recruited neural areas.

== Emotion ==
{{Main|Music and emotion}}
[[Emotion]]s induced by music activate similar frontal brain regions compared to emotions elicited by other stimuli.&lt;ref name="DoifpsygMissing"/&gt; Schmidt and Trainor (2001) discovered that valence (i.e. positive vs. negative) of musical segments was distinguished by patterns of frontal EEG activity.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02699930126048 |title=Frontal brain electrical activity (EEG) distinguishes valence and intensity of musical emotions |year=2001 |last1=Schmidt |first1=Louis A. |last2=Trainor |first2=Laurel J. |journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=487–500}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joyful and happy musical segments were associated with increases in left frontal EEG activity whereas fearful and sad musical segments were associated with increases in right frontal EEG activity.  Additionally, the intensity of emotions was differentiated by the pattern of overall frontal EEG activity.  Overall frontal region activity increased as affective musical stimuli became more intense.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

Music is able to create an incredibly pleasurable experience that can be described as "chills".&lt;ref name="Blood"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.191355898 |title=Intensely pleasurable responses to music correlate with activity in brain regions implicated in reward and emotion |year=2001 |last1=Blood |first1=A. J. |last2=Zatorre |first2=R. J. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=98 |issue=20 |pages=11818–11823|bibcode = 2001PNAS...9811818B |pmid=11573015 |pmc=58814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blood and Zatorre (2001) used PET to measure changes in cerebral blood flow while participants listened to music that they knew to give them the "chills" or any sort of intensely pleasant emotional response. They found that as these chills increase, many changes in cerebral blood flow are seen in brain regions such as the [[amygdala]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[ventral striatum]], [[midbrain]], and the ventral medial [[prefrontal cortex]]. Many of these areas appear to be linked to reward, motivation, emotion, and arousal, and are also activated in other pleasurable situations.&lt;ref name="Blood"/&gt; [[Nucleus accumbens#Research|Nucleus accumbens]] (a part of [[striatum]]) is involved in both music related emotions, as well as rhythmic timing.

When unpleasant melodies are played, the posterior [[cingulate cortex]] activates, which indicates a sense of conflict or emotional pain.&lt;ref name="Tramo"/&gt; The right hemisphere has also been found to be correlated with emotion, which can also activate areas in the cingulate in times of emotional pain, specifically social rejection (Eisenberger). This evidence, along with observations, has led many musical theorists, philosophers and neuroscientists to link emotion with tonality. This seems almost obvious because the tones in music ''seem'' like a characterization of the tones in human speech, which indicate emotional content. The [[vowels]] in the [[phonemes]] of a song are elongated for a dramatic effect, and it seems as though musical tones are simply exaggerations of the normal verbal tonality.

[[Music-related memory|Musical memory]] involves both explicit and implicit memory systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11065-009-9085-2 |title=Memory for Music in Alzheimer's Disease: Unforgettable? |year=2009 |last1=Baird |first1=Amee |last2=Samson |first2=Séverine |journal=Neuropsychology Review |volume=19 |pages=85–101 |pmid=19214750 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit musical memory is further differentiated between episodic (where, when and what of the musical experience) and semantic (memory for music knowledge including facts and emotional concepts). Implicit memory centers on the 'how' of music and involves automatic processes such as procedural memory and motor skill learning – in other words skills critical for playing an instrument. Samson and Baird (2009) found that the ability of musicians with Alzheimer's Disease to play an instrument (implicit procedural memory) may be preserved.

=== Neural correlates of musical memory ===

A PET study looking into the neural correlates of musical [[Semantic memory|semantic]] and [[episodic memory]] found distinct activation patterns.&lt;ref name="Platel"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00287-8 |title=Semantic and episodic memory of music are subserved by distinct neural networks |year=2003 |last1=Platel |first1=Hervé |last2=Baron |first2=Jean-Claude |last3=Desgranges |first3=Béatrice |last4=Bernard |first4=Frédéric |last5=Eustache |first5=Francis |journal=NeuroImage |volume=20 |pages=244–56 |pmid=14527585 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semantic musical memory involves the sense of familiarity of songs. The semantic memory for music condition resulted in bilateral activation in the medial and orbital frontal cortex, as well as activation in the left angular gyrus and the left anterior region of the middle temporal gyri. These patterns support the functional asymmetry favouring the left hemisphere for semantic memory. Left anterior temporal and inferior frontal regions that were activated in the musical semantic memory task produced activation peaks specifically during the presentation of musical material, suggestion that these regions are somewhat functionally specialized for musical semantic representations.

Episodic memory of musical information involves the ability to recall the former context associated with a musical excerpt.&lt;ref name="Platel"/&gt; In the condition invoking episodic memory for music, activations were found bilaterally in the middle and superior frontal gyri and precuneus, with activation predominant in the right hemisphere. Other studies have found the precuneus to become activated in successful episodic recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001756-199510020-00014 |title=Functional role of the prefrontal cortex in retrieval of memories: A PET study |year=1995 |last1=Kapur |first1=Shitij |last2=Craik |first2=Fergus I. M. |last3=Jones |first3=Corey |last4=Brown |first4=Gregory M. |last5=Houle |first5=Sylvain |last6=Tulving |first6=Endel |journal=NeuroReport |volume=6 |issue=14 |pages=1880–4 |pmid=8547589}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was activated in the familiar memory condition of episodic memory, this activation may be explained by the successful recall of the melody.

When it comes to memory for pitch, there appears to be a dynamic and distributed brain network subserves pitch memory processes. Gaab, Gaser, Zaehle, Jancke and Schlaug (2003) examined the functional anatomy of pitch memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1053-8119(03)00224-6 |title=Functional anatomy of pitch memory—an fMRI study with sparse temporal sampling |year=2003 |last1=Gaab |first1=Nadine |last2=Gaser |first2=Christian |last3=Zaehle |first3=Tino |last4=Jancke |first4=Lutz |last5=Schlaug |first5=Gottfried |journal=NeuroImage |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=1417–26 |pmid=12948699}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An analysis of performance scores in a pitch memory task resulted in a significant correlation between good task performance and the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) as well as the dorsolateral cerebellum.  Findings indicate that the dorsolateral cerebellum may act as a pitch discrimination processor and the SMG may act as a short-term pitch information storage site.  The left hemisphere was found to be more prominent in the pitch memory task than the right hemispheric regions.

=== Therapeutic effects of music on memory ===
Musical training has been shown to aid [[memory]].  Altenmuller et al. studied the difference between active and passive musical instruction and found both that over a longer (but not short) period of time, the actively taught students retained much more information than the passively taught students. The actively taught students were also found to have greater cerebral cortex activation. It should also be noted that the passively taught students weren't wasting their time; they, along with the active group, displayed greater left hemisphere activity, which is typical in trained musicians.&lt;ref name="Strickland"/&gt;

==Attention ==
Treder et al.&lt;ref name="Treder"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1741-2560/11/2/026009 |title=Decoding auditory attention to instruments in polyphonic music using single-trial EEG classification |year=2014 |last1=Treder |first1=Matthias |last2=Purwins |first2=Hendrik |last3=Miklody |first3=Daniel |last4=Sturm |first4=Irene |last5=Blankertz |first5=Benjamin |journal= Journal of Neural Engineering |volume=11| number=2 |pages=026009|bibcode = 2014JNEng..11b6009T }}&lt;/ref&gt; identified neural correlates of attention when listening to simplified polyphonic music patterns. In a musical oddball experiment, they had participants shift selective attention to one out of three different instruments in music audio clips, with each instrument occasionally playing one or several notes deviating from an otherwise repetitive pattern. Contrasting attended versus unattended instruments, ERP analysis shows subject- and instrument-specific responses including P300 and early auditory components. The attended instrument could be classified offline with high accuracy.  This indicates that attention paid to a particular instrument in polyphonic music can be inferred from ongoing EEG, a finding that is potentially relevant for building more ergonomic music-listing based brain-computer interfaces.&lt;ref name="Treder"/&gt;

==Development==
Musical four-year-olds have been found to have one greater left hemisphere intrahemispheric coherence.&lt;ref name="Strickland"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00094056.2002.10522714 |title=Review of Research: Music and the Brain in Childhood Development |year=2001 |last1=Burriss |first1=Kathleen Glascott |last2=Strickland |first2=Susan J. |journal=Childhood Education |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musicians have been found to have more developed anterior portions of the [[corpus callosum]] in a study by Cowell et al. in 1992.  This was confirmed by a study by Schlaug et al. in 1995 that found that classical musicians between the ages of 21 and 36 have significantly greater anterior corpora callosa than the non-musical control. Schlaug also found that there was a strong correlation of musical exposure before the age of seven, and a great increase in the size of the corpus callosum.&lt;ref name="Strickland"/&gt; These fibers join together the left and right hemispheres and indicate an increased relaying between both sides of the brain. This suggests the merging between the spatial- emotiono-tonal processing of the right brain and the linguistical processing of the left brain. This large relaying across many different areas of the brain might contribute to music's ability to aid in memory function.

== Impairment ==
{{Main|Music-specific disorders}}

=== Focal hand dystonia ===

Focal hand [[dystonia]] is a task-related movement disorder associated with occupational activities that require repetitive hand movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9646753 |year=1998 |last1=Chen |first1=R |last2=Hallett |first2=M |title=Focal dystonia and repetitive motion disorders |issue=351 |pages=102–6 |journal=Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Focal hand dystonia is associated with abnormal processing in the premotor and primary sensorimotor cortices.  An fMRI study examined five guitarists with focal hand dystonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/nimg.2000.0615 |title=Brain Cortical Activation during Guitar-Induced Hand Dystonia Studied by Functional MRI |year=2000 |last1=Pujol |first1=J. |last2=Roset-Llobet |first2=J. |last3=Rosinés-Cubells |first3=D. |last4=Deus |first4=J. |last5=Narberhaus |first5=B. |last6=Valls-Solé |first6=J. |last7=Capdevila |first7=A. |last8=Pascual-Leone |first8=A. |journal=NeuroImage |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=257–67 |pmid=10944408}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study reproduced task-specific hand dystonia by having guitarists use a real guitar neck inside the scanner as well as performing a guitar exercise to trigger abnormal hand movement.  The dystonic guitarists showed significantly more activation of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex as well as a bilateral underactivation of premotor areas.  This activation pattern represents abnormal recruitment of the cortical areas involved in motor control.  Even in professional musicians, widespread bilateral cortical region involvement is necessary to produce complex hand movements such as [[Musical scale|scales]] and [[arpeggio]]s.  The abnormal shift from premotor to primary sensorimotor activation directly correlates with guitar-induced hand dystonia.

=== Music agnosia ===

Music [[agnosia]], an [[auditory agnosia]], is a syndrome of selective impairment in music recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1076/jnmr.28.3.209.3108 |title=Music Agnosias: Selective Impairments of Music Recognition After Brain Damage |year=1999 |last1=Dalla Bella |first1=Simone |last2=Peretz |first2=Isabelle |journal=Journal of New Music Research |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=209–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three cases of music agnosia are examined by Dalla Bella and Peretz (1999); C.N., G.L., and I.R.. All three of these patients suffered bilateral damage to the auditory cortex which resulted in musical difficulties while speech understanding remained intact. Their impairment is specific to the recognition of once familiar melodies. They are spared in recognizing environmental sounds and in recognizing lyrics. Peretz (1996) has studied C.N.'s music agnosia further and reports an initial impairment of pitch processing and spared temporal processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1162/jocn.1996.8.6.481 |title=Can We Lose Memory for Music? A Case of Music Agnosia in a Nonmusician |year=1996 |last1=Peretz |first1=Isabelle |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=481–96 |pmid=23961980}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.N. later recovered in pitch processing abilities but remained impaired in tune recognition and familiarity judgments.

Musical agnosias  may be categorized based on the process which is impaired in the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/brain/123.9.1926 |title=Patterns of music agnosia associated with middle cerebral artery infarcts |year=2000 |last1=Ayotte |first1=J. |journal=Brain |volume=123 |issue=9 |pages=1926–38 |pmid=10960056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apperceptive music agnosia involves an impairment at the level of perceptual analysis involving an inability to encode musical information correctly. Associative music agnosia reflects an impaired representational system which disrupts music recognition. Many of the cases of music agnosia have resulted from surgery involving the middle cerebral artery. Patient studies have surmounted a large amount of evidence demonstrating that the left side of the brain is more suitable for holding long-term memory representations of music and that the right side is important for controlling access to these representations. Associative music agnosias tend to be produced by damage to the left hemisphere, while apperceptive music agnosia reflects damage to the right hemisphere.

=== Congenital amusia ===
Congenital [[amusia]], otherwise known as [[tone deafness]], is a term for lifelong musical problems which are not attributable to mental retardation, lack of exposure to music or deafness, or brain damage after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00600.x |title=Musical Disorders: From Behavior to Genes |year=2008 |last1=Peretz |first1=Isabelle |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=329–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amusic brains have been found in fMRI studies to have less white matter and thicker cortex than controls in the right inferior frontal cortex. These differences suggest abnormal neuronal development in the auditory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, two areas which are important in musical-pitch processing.

Studies on those with [[amusia]] suggest different processes are involved in speech [[tonality]] and musical tonality. [[Congenital]] amusics lack the ability to distinguish between pitches and so are for example unmoved by dissonance and playing the wrong key on a piano. They also cannot be taught to remember a melody or to recite a song; however, they are still capable of hearing the intonation of speech, for example, distinguishing between "You speak French" and "You speak French?" when spoken.

=== Amygdala damage ===
[[File:Amgydala.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Damage to the [[amygdala]] may impair recognition of scary music.]]

Damage to the amygdala has selective emotional impairments on musical recognition.  Gosselin, Peretz, Johnsen and Adolphs (2007) studied S.M., a patient with bilateral damage of the [[amygdala]] with the rest of the temporal lobe undamaged and found that S.M. was impaired in recognition of scary and sad music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.07.012 |title=Amygdala damage impairs emotion recognition from music |year=2007 |last1=Gosselin |first1=Nathalie |last2=Peretz |first2=Isabelle |last3=Johnsen |first3=Erica |last4=Adolphs |first4=Ralph |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages=236–44 |pmid=16970965}}&lt;/ref&gt; S.M.'s perception of happy music was normal, as was her ability to use cues such as tempo to distinguish between happy and sad music. It appears that damage specific to the amygdala can selectively impair recognition of scary music.

=== Selective deficit in music reading ===

Specific musical impairments may result from brain damage leaving other musical abilities intact.  Cappelletti, Waley-Cohen, Butterworth and Kopelman (2000) studied a single case study of patient P.K.C., a professional musician who sustained damage to the left posterior temporal lobe as well as a small right occipitotemporal lesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13554790008402780 |title=A selective loss of the ability to read and to write music |year=2000 |last1=Cappelletti |first1=M. |last2=Waley-Cohen |first2=H. |last3=Butterworth |first3=B. |last4=Kopelman |first4=M. |journal=Neurocase |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=321–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After sustaining damage to these regions, P.K.C. was selectively impaired in the areas of reading, writing and understanding musical notation but maintained other musical skills. The ability to read aloud letters, words, numbers and symbols (including musical ones) was retained. However, P.K.C. was unable to read aloud musical notes on the staff regardless of whether the task involved naming with the conventional letter or by singing or playing. Yet despite this specific deficit, P.K.C. retained the ability to remember and play familiar and new melodies.

=== Auditory arrhythmia ===

[[Auditory Arrhythmia|Arrhythmia in the auditory modality]] is defined as a disturbance of rhythmic sense; and includes deficits such as the inability to rhythmically perform music, the inability to keep time to music and the inability to discriminate between or reproduce rhythmic patterns.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00198-1 |title=Modelling rhythmic function in a musician post-stroke |year=2002 |last1=Wilson |first1=Sarah J |last2=Pressing |first2=Jeffrey L |last3=Wales |first3=Roger J |journal=Neuropsychologia |volume=40 |issue=8 |pages=1494–505 |pmid=11931954}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A study investigating the elements of rhythmic function examined Patient H.J., who acquired arrhythmia after sustaining a right temporoparietal infarct.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;  Damage to this region impaired H.J.'s central timing system which is essentially the basis of his global rhythmic impairment.  H.J. was unable to generate steady pulses in a tapping task.  These findings suggest that keeping a musical beat relies on functioning in the right temporal auditory cortex.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2457">The '''Nordic Network for Interdisciplinary Environmental Studies (NIES)''' is a research network for environmental studies based primarily in the humanities. By organizing regular conferences, symposia and workshops, NIES aims to create opportunities for researchers in the [[Nordic countries]] who address environmental questions to exchange ideas and develop their work in various interdisciplinary contexts. Fields represented by members of the network include [[Ecocriticism]], [[Environmental history]], [[Environmental philosophy]], [[Science and Technology Studies]], [[Art history]], [[Media studies]], [[Ecological economics]], [[Human Geography]], [[Cultural studies]], [[Anthropology]], [[Archeology]], [[Sustainability Studies]], [[Education for Sustainability]] and [[Landscape Studies]].

NIES is responsible for organizing and editing the research series '''''Studies in the Environmental Humanities (SEH)''''' published by [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]].

Formed in 2007, NIES was originally a cooperation among small academic groups in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Today, it includes more than 100 researchers from all the [[Nordic countries]].  The network actively sponsors a wide range of educational initiatives, research projects and public outreach activities and is a key partner in pan-European and other international initiatives to build capacity and foster theoretical advancement in the Environmental Humanities. Since January 2011, the network's primary anchoring institution is Mid Sweden University in Sundsvall, Sweden. National anchoring institutions include University of Turku, University of Oslo, University of Iceland, Uppsala University and University of Southern Denmark. The network's current phase of operations (2011–2015) is supported by NordForsk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">The '''political science of religion''' (also referred to as politicology of religion or politology of religion) is one of the youngest disciplines in the [[political science]]s that deals with a study of influence that [[religion]] has on [[politics]] and vice versa with a focus on the relationship between the subjects ([[Actor (policy debate)|actors]]) in politics in the narrow sense: [[government]], [[political parties]], [[pressure group]]s, and [[religious communities]]. It was established in the last decades of the twentieth century.

==Research areas==
The basic research areas of the political science of religion are:
* All aspects of [[religion|religious]] teachings and practices that have direct political contents and messages, such as religious understanding of government, [[Power (sociology)|power]], political [[authority]], [[State (polity)|state]], political organizing, [[war]], [[peace]], etc.;
* All aspects of religious behavior and practice that don’t have direct political contents and messages but do have direct political consequences, such as building of [[Religious architecture|religious edifices]], [[pilgrimage]]s, etc.;
* Attitudes and positions of political subjects in the narrow sense towards religion and religious communities, such as that of [[political party|political parties]] and pressure groups towards religion and religious communities;
* Everything within apparently completely [[secular]] public behavior with no religious motives that causes religious consequences, such as an economic [[monopoly]] achieved by a religious group within a multi-confessional society – it cannot but cause political consequences.

These fields of research are in constant development. The newest area of research in political science of religion is on the subject of religion and international relations.

==History==
The political science of religion or politology of religion was established as an [[academic discipline]] in 1993 at the Faculty of Political Science of the [[University of Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210043816/http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  founder of this discipline is Dr Miroljub Jevtic; http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/undergraduate-studies/political-department/third-year/ . In 2006, [[Georgetown University]] established the [[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] as one of the first American university research centers devoted to issues surrounding the political science of religion.

The ''Politics and Religion Journal'' was founded by the Center for Study of Religion and Religious Tolerance in [[Belgrade, Serbia]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028171212/http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |archivedate=2008-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ''spiritus movens'' and [[editor in chief]] is [[Miroljub Jevtić]], professor at the Faculty of Political Science, University of Belgrade, Serbia. The journal ''Politics and Religion'', produced by Cambridge Journals, published its first volume in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=RAP Politics and Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

The political science of religion is studied at almost all universities and political science departments in the United States. The [[American Political Science Association]] has a religion and politics section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://connect.apsanet.org/s11/home/ “Religion and Politics”]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Project Pericles''' Inc. is a [[non-profit]] organization composed of [[liberal arts college]]s and universities geared towards the ideas that social responsibility and participatory citizenship are essential parts of an [[undergraduate]] curriculum, in the classroom, on campus, and in the community.

==Background==
Conceived by [[Eugene M. Lang]], a retired businessman known for his educational philanthropy, Project Pericles seeks to counter the growing political cynicism and civic disengagement of young people. Convinced that higher education must promote social and civic engagement, in 1999 Lang organized a planning committee and consulted with college presidents, trustees, faculty, students, and others. By the end of 2000, the objectives, policies, and startup plans of Project Pericles were set. Ten colleges and universities became “founding Pericleans.”   

The Boards of the Pericleans formally committed their institutions to the policies and objectives of Project Pericles. Their presidents formed a Presidents’ Council to cooperate in policy-making and program development and implementation. The planning committee became the Board of Directors. Distinguished educational, business, political, and community leaders became the National Board of Advisors. 

In April 2003, the first ten Pericleans met in New York for the first national conference of Project Pericles. Delegates included presidents, provosts, deans, faculty, students, and alumni. In August 2003, Project Pericles established an independent office and hired Karen E. Holt as Executive Director. In November 2005, Jan R. Liss became its second Executive Director.

In 2004 and 2005, a select group of new Pericleans added to the diversity of Project Pericles. The spirit of Pericleans and cumulative experience continue to strengthen Project Pericles in its mission as a transforming force for higher education.

The '''''{{lang|la|Prosopographia Imperii Romani}}''''', abbreviated '''''PIR''''', is a collective historical work to establish the [[prosopography]] of high-profile people from the [[Roman empire]]. The time period covered extends from the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC to the reign of [[Diocletian]]. The final volume of the second edition, '''''PIR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''''', vol. IX, V-Z, appeared in November 2015.

The first edition was rapidly achieved and published in [[Berlin]] in the line of the great works of scholarship from the [[historical school of economics]] which had been successful in achieving the project of a corpus of all the [[Latin]] inscriptions, the ''[[Corpus inscriptionum latinarum]]''. Led by [[Elimar Klebs]], [[Hermann Dessau]] and [[Paul von Rohden]],&lt;ref name=Maurin&gt;Jean Maurin, ''La prosopographie romaine : pertes et profits'', ''Annales. Économies, Sociétés, Civilisations'', 37th year, N. 5-6, 1982. pp. 824-836., [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/ahess_0395-2649_1982_num_37_5_282906], p. 835 note 23&lt;/ref&gt; the first edition of the ''PIR'' was edited in three volumes from 1897 to 1898.

The implementation of a second edition was last updated in 1933 for publication in Berlin. The first booklet of the second edition was led by [[Edmund Groag]] and [[Arthur Stein (historian)|Arthur Stein]]&lt;ref name=Maurin/&gt; who brought together the letters A and B. The publication was interrupted by [[World War II]] while working on the letter F (1943). From 1952 they took the direction of Stein and then [[Leiva Petersen]]. After German unification the project found a new dynamic. It was from then on led by K. Wachtel. The fascicle concerning the letter S was then published in 2006, and T in 2009. The index of names and people integral to the ''PIR'' was in the meantime made searchable on the website of the ''PIR''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbaw.de/bbaw/Forschung/Forschungsprojekte/pir/de/Publikationen ''PIR'' website (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 2 of the ''PIR'' includes notes for all the well-known [[Roman senate|Roman senators]], the [[equestrian order|nobles]], and some civil servants not of equestrian rank, such as [[manumission|manumitted]] imperial freedmen who are attested in the literary tradition. Entries in the ''PIR'' are indexed by the initial letter of the name, then by the number of the entry, i.e. [[Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus]] corresponds to the entry PIR&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; C 973: the 973rd entry under the letter C.

For periods after the third century which the ''PIR'' does not cover, there is ''[[Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire]]'' by [[Arnold Hugh Martin Jones|A.H.M. Jones]], J.R. Martindale, and [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]].&lt;ref name=Maurin/&gt;

{{Indo-European topics}}
{{PIE notice}}
'''Proto-Indo-European mythology''' is the body of myths and stories associated with the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]. Although these stories are not directly attested, they have been reconstructed by scholars of [[comparative mythology]] based on the similarities in the belief systems of various Indo-European peoples.

Various schools of thought exist regarding the precise nature of Proto-Indo-European mythology, which do not always agree with each other. [[Vedic mythology]], [[Roman mythology]], and [[Norse mythology]] are the main mythologies normally used for comparative reconstruction, though they are often supplemented with supporting evidence from the [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]], [[Celtic mythology|Celtic]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Slavic mythology|Slavic]], and [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] traditions as well.

The Proto-Indo-European pantheon includes well-attested deities such as [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'']], the god of the daylit skies, his daughter [[Hausos|*''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;éusōs'']], the goddess of the dawn, the [[divine twins]], and the storm god [[Perkwunos|*''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'']]. Other probable deities include ''*Péh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;usōn'', a pastoral god, and ''*Seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ul'', a female [[solar deity]].

Well-attested myths of the Proto-Indo-Europeans include a myth involving a [[storm god]] who slays a multi-headed serpent that dwells in water and a creation story involving two brothers, one of whom sacrifices the other to create the world. The Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed that the [[Otherworld]] was guarded by a watchdog and could only be reached by crossing a river. They also may have believed in a world tree, bearing fruit of immortality, either guarded by or gnawed on by a serpent or dragon, and tended by three goddesses who spun the thread of life.

==Methods of reconstruction==
===Schools of thought===


The mythology of the Proto-Indo-Europeans is not directly attested and it is difficult to match their language to archaeological findings related to any specific culture from the [[Chalcolithic]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=}} Nonetheless, scholars of comparative mythology have attempted to reconstruct aspects of Proto-Indo-European mythologies based on the existence of similarities among the [[Deity|deities]], religious practices, and myths of various Indo-European peoples. This method is known as the [[Comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]]. Different schools of thought have approached the subject of Proto-Indo-European mythology from different angles. The Meteorological School holds that Proto-Indo-European mythology was largely centered around deified natural phenomena such as the [[sky]], the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], and the [[dawn]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=428}} This meteorological interpretation was popular among early scholars, but has lost a considerable degree of scholarly support in recent years.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=14-15}} The Ritual School, on the other hand, holds that Proto-Indo-European myths are best understood as stories invented to explain various rituals and religious practices.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=428–429}} Bruce Lincoln, a member of the Ritual School, argues that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed that every sacrifice was a reenactment of the original sacrifice performed by the founder of the human race on his twin brother.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=428–429}} The Functionalist School holds that Proto-Indo-European society and, consequently, their mythology, was largely centered around the [[trifunctional hypothesis|trifunctional system]] proposed by [[Georges Dumézil]],{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=429–430}} which holds that Proto-Indo-European society was divided into three distinct social classes: farmers, warriors, and priests.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=429–430}}&lt;ref&gt;''Mythe et Épopée I, II, III'', by G. Dumézil, Gallimard, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=18}} The Structuralist School, by contrast, argues that Proto-Indo-European mythology was largely centered around the concept of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] opposition.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}} This approach generally tends to focus on cultural universals within the realm of mythology, rather than the genetic origins of those myths,{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}} but it also offers refinements of the Dumézilian trifunctional system by highlighting the oppositional elements present within each function, such as the creative and destructive elements both found within the role of the warrior.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}}

===Source mythologies===
[[File:IE expansion.png|thumb|right|330px|Scheme of Indo-European migrations from c. 4000 to 1000 BC according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]]]

One of the earliest attested and thus most important of all Indo-European mythologies is [[Vedic mythology]],{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}} especially the mythology of the [[Rigveda]], the oldest of the [[Vedas]]. Early scholars of comparative mythology such as [[Max Müller]] stressed the importance of Vedic mythology to such an extent that they practically equated it with Proto-Indo-European myth.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=14}} Modern researchers have been much more cautious, recognizing that, although Vedic mythology is still central, other mythologies must also be taken into account.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=14}}

Another of the most important source mythologies for comparative research is [[Roman mythology]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}}{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=191}} Contrary to the frequent erroneous statement made by some authors that "Rome has no myth", the Romans possessed a very complex mythological system, parts of which have been preserved through the characteristic Roman tendency to rationalize their myths into historical accounts.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=146–147}} Despite its relatively late attestation, [[Norse mythology]] is still considered one of the three most important of the Indo-European mythologies for comparative research,{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}} simply due to the vast bulk of surviving Icelandic material.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=191}}

[[Baltic mythology]] has also received a great deal of scholarly attention, but has so far remained frustrating to researchers because the sources are so comparatively late.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=223–228}} Nonetheless, Latvian folk songs are seen as a major source of information in the process of reconstructing Proto-Indo-European myth.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=228–229}} Despite the popularity of [[Greek mythology]] in western culture,{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=126-127}} Greek mythology is generally seen as having little importance in comparative mythology due to the heavy influence of [[Pre-Greek]] and Near Eastern cultures, which overwhelms what little Indo-European material can be extracted from it.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=138, 143}} Consequently, Greek mythology received minimal scholarly attention until the mid 2000s.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=440}}

Although [[Scythians]] are considered relatively conservative in regards to Proto-Indo-European cultures, retaining a similar lifestyle and culture,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, David W. (2007). The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-05887-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scythian religion|their mythology]] has very rarely been examined in an Indo-European context and infrequently discussed in regards to the nature of the ancestral Indo-European mythology. At least three deities, [[Tabiti]], [[Papaios]] and [[Api]], are generally interpreted as having Indo-European origins,&lt;ref&gt;West, M. L. Indo-European Poetry and Myth. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, G. C. (1904). The History of Herodotus, Vol. I. London: Macmillan &amp; Co. pp. 313–317.&lt;/ref&gt; while the remaining have seen more disparate interpretations. Influence from Siberian, Turkic and even Near Eastern beliefs, on the other hand, are more widely discussed in literature.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Jacobson, The Deer Goddess of Ancient Siberia: A Study in the Ecology of Belief, BRILL, 01/01/1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bessonova, S. S. 1983. Religioznïe predstavleniia skifov. Kiev: Naukova dumka&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/34823985/Argimpasa_Scythian_goddess_patroness_of_shamans_a_comparison_of_historical_archaeological_linguistic_and_ethnographic_data]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pantheon==
Linguists are able to reconstruct the names of some deities in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE) from many types of sources. Some of the proposed deity names are more readily accepted among scholars than others.{{efn|In order to present a consistent notation, the reconstructed forms used here are cited from {{Harvnb|Mallory|Adams|2006}}. For further explanation of the laryngeals – &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;, and &lt;h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&gt; – see the [[Laryngeal theory]] article.}}

The term for "a god" was ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/deywós|*deiwos]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=408}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflected in Hittite, ''sius''; Latin, ''deus'', ''divus''; Sanskrit, ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]''; [[Avestan]], ''[[daeva]]'' (later, Persian, ''div''); Welsh, ''duw''; Irish, ''dia''; Old Norse, ''tívurr''; Lithuanian, ''[[Dievas]]''; Latvian, ''Dievs''.&lt;ref&gt;''Indo-European ''*Deiwos'' and Related Words'' by Grace Sturtevant Hopkins (''Language'' Dissertations published by the Linguistic Society of America, Number XII, December 1932)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavenly deities===
====Sky Father====
{{main|Sky father}}
[[File:Stater Zeus Lampsacus CdM.jpg|thumb|[[Laurel wreath|Laurel-wreathed]] head of [[Zeus]] on a gold [[stater]] from the Greek city of [[Lampsacus]], c 360–340 BC]]

The head deity of the Proto-Indo-European pantheon was the god [[Dyeus|*''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'']],{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=409, 431–432}} whose name literally means "Sky Father".{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=409, 431–432}}{{sfn|Winters|2003|pages=134–135}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=17}} He is believed to have been regarded as the god of the daylit skies.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=166–168}} He is, by far, the most well-attested of all the Proto-Indo-European deities.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}}{{sfn|West|2007|page=166}} The Greek god [[Zeus]], the Roman god [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], and the Illyrian god Dei-Pátrous all appear as the head gods of their respective pantheons.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=198–200}}{{sfn|Burkert|1985|page=17}} The Norse god [[Týr]], however, seems to have been demoted to the role of a minor war-deity prior to the composition of the earliest Germanic texts.{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=198–200}} *''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'' is also attested in the [[Rigveda]] as [[Dyaus Pita|Dyáus Pitā]], a minor ancestor figure mentioned in only a few hymns.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=409 and 431}} The names of the Latvian god [[Dievs]] and the Hittite god Attas Isanus do not preserve the exact literal translation of the name *''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'',{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}} but do preserve the general meaning of it.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=431}}

''*Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'' may have had a consort who was an earth goddess.{{snf|West|2007|page=181}} This possibility is attested in the Vedic pairing of Dyáus Pitā and [[Prithvi|Prithvi Mater]],{{snf|West|2007|page=181}} the Roman pairing of Jupiter and [[Tellus Mater]] from [[Macrobius]]'s ''[[Saturnalia (Macrobius)|Saturnalia]]'',{{snf|West|2007|page=181}} and the Norse pairing of [[Odin]] and [[Jörð]]. Odin is not a reflex of *''Dyḗus Pḥ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tḗr'', but his cult may have subsumed aspects of an earlier chief deity who was.{{snf|West|2007|page=183}} This pairing may also be further attested in an Old English ploughing prayer{{snf|West|2007|page=183}} and in the Greek pairings of [[Ouranos]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and Zeus and [[Demeter]].{{snf|West|2007|pages=181–183}}

====Dawn Goddess====
[[File:Eos chariot 430-420 BC Staatliche Antikensammlungen.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eos]] in her chariot flying over the sea, red-figure [[krater]] from South [[Italy]], 430–420 BC, [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]], Munich]]

[[Hausos|*''H&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;éusōs'']] has been reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European goddess of the dawn.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=410, 432}}{{sfn|West|2007|217-227}} Twenty-one hymns in the Rigveda are dedicated to the dawn goddess [[Ushas|Uṣás]]{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} and a single passage from the Avesta honors the dawn goddess Ušå.{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The dawn goddess [[Eos]] appears prominently in early Greek poetry and mythology.{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The Roman dawn goddess [[Aurora (mythology)|Aurora]] is a reflection of the Greek Eos,{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} but the original Roman dawn goddess may have continued to be worshipped under the cultic title [[Mater Matuta]].{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The Anglo-Saxons worshipped the goddess [[Ēostre]], who was associated with a festival in spring which later gave its name to a month, which gave its name to the Christian holiday of [[Easter]] in English.{{sfn|West|2007|page=217}} The name ''Ôstarmânôth'' in [[Old High German]] has been taken as an indication that a similar goddess was also worshipped in southern Germany.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=217–218}} The Lithuanian dawn goddess [[Austrine|Aušra]] was still acknowledged in the sixteenth century.{{sfn|West|2007|page=218}} Uṣás in the Sanskrit tradition and Eos in the Greek have very similar attributes, indicating that these attributes were established by at least the Greco-Aryan period.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=218–224}} Both goddesses are also portrayed as taking mortal lovers.{{sfn|West|2007|pages=224–225}}

====Sun and Moon====
[[File:HittiteGoddessAndChildAnatolia15th-13thCenturyBCE.jpg|thumb|left|Possible depiction of the [[Sun goddess of Arinna|Hittite Sun goddess]] holding a child in her arms from between 1400 and 1200 BC]]

[[Sun deity|''*Seh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ul'']] and [[Moon deity|''*Meh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;not'']] are reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European goddess of the Sun and god of the Moon respectively.

===Divine Twins===
====Horse Twins====
[[File:Dioskouroi Met L.2008.18.1-2 n03.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pair of Roman statuettes from the third century AD depicting the Dioscuri as horsemen, with their characteristic skullcaps ([[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York)]]

The [[Divine Twins|Horse Twins]] are a set of twin brothers found throughout nearly every Indo-European pantheon who usually have a name that means 'horse' ''*ekwa-'',{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=432}} but the names are not always cognate and no Proto-Indo-European name for them can be reconstructed.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=432}} In most Indo-European pantheons, the Horse Twins are brothers of the Sun Maiden or Dawn goddess, and sons of the sky god.{{snf|West|2007|pages=185–191}}

They are reconstructed based on the Vedic [[Ashvins]], the Lithuanian [[Ašvieniai]], the Latvian [[Dieva deli]], the Greek [[Dioskouroi]] (Kastor and Polydeukes), the Roman [[Dioscuri]] (Castor and Pollux), and the Old English [[Hengist]] and [[Horsa]] (whose names mean "stallion" and "horse").{{sfn|West|2007|pages=186–191}} References from the Greek writer [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] indicate that the Celts may have had a set of horse twins as well.{{sfn|West|2007|page=190}} The Welsh [[Brân the Blessed|Brân]] and [[Manawydan]] may also be related.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=432}} The horse twins may have been based on the morning and evening star (the planet [[Venus]]) and they often have stories about them in which they "accompany" the Sun goddess, because of the close orbit of the planet Venus to the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Shapiro. ''Journal of Indo-European Studies'', 10&amp;thinsp;(1&amp;2), pp.&amp;nbsp;137–166; who references D. Ward (1968) "The Divine Twins". ''Folklore Studies'', No.&amp;nbsp;19. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twin Founders====
The Proto-Indo-European Creation myth seems to have involved two key figures: *''Manu-'' ("Man"; Indic [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]; Germanic [[Mannus]]) and his twin brother *''Yemo-'' ("Twin"; Indic [[Yama]]; Germanic [[Ymir]]).{{sfn|Mallory|1991|page=140}}{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}} Reflexes of these two figures usually fulfill the respective roles of founder of the human race and first human to die.{{snf|Mallory|1991|page=140}}{{snf|Lincoln|1991|page=}}

===Storm deities===

[[Perkwunos|*''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'']] has been reconstructed as the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning and storms. His name literally means "The Striker." He is reconstructed based on the Norse goddess [[Fjörgyn and Fjörgynn|Fjǫrgyn]] (the mother of [[Thor]]), the Lithuanian god [[Perkūnas]], and the Slavic god [[Perun|Perúnú]]. The Vedic god [[Parjanya|Parjánya]] may also be related, but his possible connection to *''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'' is still under dispute.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=410 and 433}} The name of *''Perk&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;unos'' may also be attested in Greek as ''[[wikt:κεραυνός|κεραυνός]]'' (''Keraunós''), an epithet of the god [[Zeus]] meaning "thunder-shaker."{{snf|Puhvel|1987|page=235}} A possible alternative name, through the root *(s)tenh₂, is responsible for [[Thor]] as well as Hittite [[Tarhunt]] and Celtic [[Taran]]/[[Taranis]]. The Roman god [[Mars]] is also a speculated descendent, since he originally had thunderer characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;York, Michael. Romulus and Remus, Mars and Quirinus. Journal of Indo-European Studies 16:1 &amp; 2 (Spring/Summer, 1988), 153-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water deities===
Some authors have proposed ''*Neptonos'' or *''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;epom Nepōts'' as the Proto-Indo-European god of the waters. The name literally means "Grandson [or ''Nephew''] of the Waters."{{refn|Dumézil, G., [Tr] Krapp, P. (1996). ''Archaic Roman Religion''. Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press. Translation from French by P. Krapp of &lt;ref name=Dumezil_1966&gt;Dumézil, G.(1966). ''La Religion romaine archaïque, avec un appendice sur la religion des Étrusques''. Payot.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=410}} Philologists reconstruct his name from that of the Vedic god [[Apam Napat|Apám Nápát]], the Roman god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptūnus]], and the Old Irish god [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtain]]. Although such a god has been solidly reconstructed in [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion]], Mallory and Adams nonetheless still reject him as a Proto-Indo-European deity on linguistic grounds.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=410}}

A river goddess *''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/déh₂nu|Deh&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;nu-]]'' has been proposed based on the Vedic goddess [[Danu (Asura)|Dānu]], the Irish goddess [[Danu (Irish goddess)|Danu]], the Welsh goddess Don and the names of the rivers [[Danube]], Don, Dnieper, and Dniester. Mallory and Adams, however, dismiss this reconstruction, commenting that it does not have any evidence to support it.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=434}}

Some have also proposed the reconstruction of a sea god named *''Trih&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;tōn'' based on the Greek god [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] and the Old Irish word ''trïath'', meaning "sea." Mallory and Adams reject this reconstruction as having no basis, asserting that the "lexical correspondence is only just possible and with no evidence of a cognate sea god in Irish."{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=434}}

''*Péh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;usōn'', a pastoral deity, is reconstructed based on the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and the Vedic god [[Pushan|Pūshān]]. Both deities are closely affiliated with goats and were worshipped as pastoral deities.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=411 and 434}} The minor discrepancies between the two deities can be easily explained by the possibility that many attributes originally associated with Pan may have been transferred over to his father [[Hermes]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=411 and 434}} The association between Pan and Pūshān was first identified in 1924 by the German scholar [[Hermann Collitz]].&lt;ref&gt;H.

In 1855, [[Adalbert Kuhn]] suggested that the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed in a set of helper deities, whom he reconstructed based on the Germanic [[elves]] and the Hindu [[ribhus]].&lt;ref name="Kuhn1855-p110"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Adalbert|authorlink=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Die sprachvergleichung und die urgeschichte der indogermanischen völker|journal=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung|volume=4|year=1855|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wvRTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA110}}, "Zu diesen ṛbhu, alba.. stellt sich nun aber entschieden das ahd. alp, ags. älf, altn . âlfr"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;in ''[[Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung|K.

===Societal deities===

It is highly probable that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed in [[Triple goddesses|three fate goddesses]] who [[Spinning (textiles)|spun]] the destinies of mankind.{{snf|West|2007|pages=380–385}} Although such fate goddesses are not directly attested in the Indo-Aryan tradition, the [[Atharvaveda]] does contain an allusion comparing fate to a [[Warp and woof|warp]].{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} Furthermore, the three Fates appear in nearly every other Indo-European mythology.{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} The earliest attested set of fate goddesses are the [[Gulses]] in Hittite mythology, who were said to preside over the individual destinies of human beings.{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} They often appear in mythical narratives alongside the goddesses Papaya and Istustaya,{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} who, in a ritual text for the foundation of a new temple, are described sitting holding mirrors and spindles, spinning the king's thread of life.{{snf|West|2007|page=380}} In the Greek tradition, the [[Moirai]] ("Apportioners") are mentioned dispensing destiny in both the ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'', in which they are given the epithet Κλῶθες (''Klothes'', meaning "Spinners").&lt;ref&gt;''[[Iliad]]'' 20.127, 24.209; ''[[Odyssey]]'' 7.197&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|pages=380–381}} In Hesiod's ''Theogony'', the Moirai are said to "give mortal men both good and ill" and their names are listed as [[Clotho|Klotho]] ("Spinner"), [[Lachesis]] ("Apportioner"), and [[Atropos]] ("Inflexible").&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'', lines 904–906&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|page=381}} In his ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', [[Plato]] records that Klotho sings of the past, Lachesis of the present, and Atropos of the future.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} In Roman legend, the [[Parcae]] were three goddesses who presided over the births of children and whose names were Nona ("Ninth"), Decuma ("Tenth"), and Morta ("Death").{{snf|West|2007|page=381}} They too were said to spin destinies, although this may have been due to influence from Greek literature.{{snf|West|2007|page=381}}

In the Old Norse ''[[Völuspá]]'' and ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', the [[Norns]] are three cosmic goddesses of fate who are described sitting by the well of [[Urðr]] at the foot of the world tree [[Yggdrasil]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Völuspá]]'' 20; ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' 15&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|page=382}}{{efn|The names of the individual Norns are given as [[Urðr]] ("Happened"), [[Verðandi]] ("Happening"), and [[Skuld]] ("Due"),{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} but M. L. West notes that these names may be the result of classical influence from Plato.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}}}} In Old Norse texts, the Norns are frequently conflated with [[Valkyrie]]s, who are sometimes also described as spinning.{{snf|West|2007|page=382}} Old English texts, such as ''[[The Rhyming Poem|Rhyme Poem]]'' 70, and ''[[Guthlac of Crowland|Guthlac]]'' 1350 f., reference [[Wyrd]] as a singular power that "weaves" destinies.{{snf|West|2007|pages=382–383}} Later texts mention the Wyrds as a group, with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] referring to them as "the Werdys that we clepyn Destiné" in ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Chaucer]], ''The Legend of Good Women, Hypermnestra'' 19&lt;/ref&gt;{{snf|West|2007|page=383}}{{efn|They also, most famously, appear as the [[Three Witches]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' ({{circa}} 1606).{{snf|West|2007|page=383}}}} A goddess spinning appears in a [[bracteate]] from southwest Germany{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} and a relief from [[Trier]] shows three mother goddesses, with two of them holding distaffs.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} Tenth-century German ecclesiastical writings denounce the popular belief in three sisters who determined the course of a man's life at his birth.{{snf|West|2007|page=383}} An Old Irish hymn attests to seven goddesses who were believed to weave the thread of destiny, which demonstrates that these spinster fate-goddesses were present in Celtic mythology as well.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} A Lithuanian folktale recorded in 1839 recounts that a man's fate is spun at his birth by seven goddesses known as the ''[[Deives Valdytojos|deivės valdytojos]]'' and used to hang a star in the sky;{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} when he dies, his thread snaps and his star falls as a meteor.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} In Latvian folk songs, a goddess called the [[Laima|Láima]] is described as weaving a child's fate at its birth.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} Although she is usually only one goddess, the Láima sometimes appears as three.{{snf|West|2007|page=384}} The three spinning fate goddesses appear in Slavic traditions in the forms of the Russian Rožanicy, the Czech Sudičky, the Bulgarian Narenčnice or Urisnice, the Polish Rodzanice, the Croatian Rodjenice, the Serbian [[Sudjenice]], and the Slovene Rojenice.{{snf|West|2007|pages=384–385}} Albanian folk tales speak of the [[Fatit]], three old women who appear three days after a child is born and determine its fate, using language reminiscent of spinning.{{snf|West|2007|page=385}}

[[Image:Franks Casket vorne links.jpg|thumb|left|320px|Depiction of [[Wayland the Smith]] from the [[Franks Casket]], dating to the eighth century AD]]

Although the name of a particular Proto-Indo-European smith god cannot be linguistically reconstructed,{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=410}} it is highly probable that the Proto-Indo-Europeans had a smith deity of some kind, since smith gods occur in nearly every Indo-European culture, with examples including the Hittite god Hasammili, the Vedic god [[Tvastr]], the Greek god [[Hephaestus]], the Germanic villain [[Wayland the Smith]], and the Ossetian culture figure [[Kurdalagon]].{{snf|West|2009|154–157}} Many of these smith figures share certain characteristics in common. Hephaestus, the Greek god of blacksmiths, and Wayland the Smith, a nefarious blacksmith from Germanic mythology, are both described as lame.{{snf|West|2009|page=}} Additionally, Wayland the Smith and the Greek mythical inventor [[Daedalus]] both escape imprisonment on an island by fashioning sets of mechanical wings from feathers and wax and using them to fly away.{{snf|West|2009|page=155}}

The Proto-Indo-Europeans may have had a goddess who presided over the [[Trifunctional hypothesis|trifunctional]] organization of society. Various epithets of the Iranian goddess [[Anahita]] and the Roman goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] provide sufficient evidence to solidly attest that she was probably worshipped, but no specific name for her can be lexically reconstructed.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|page=433}} Vague remnants of this goddess may also be preserved in the Greek goddess [[Athena]].{{snf|Puhvel|1987|pages=133–134}}

Some scholars have proposed a war god *''Māwort-'' based on the Roman god [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] and the Vedic [[Maruts|Marutás]], companions of the war-god [[Indra]]. Mallory and Adams, however, reject this reconstruction on linguistic grounds.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|pages=410–411}} Likewise, some researchers have found it more plausible that Mars was originally a storm deity, while this cannot be said for Ares.&lt;ref&gt;York, Michael.

Several variations of the story are also found in [[Greek mythology]] as well.{{sfn|West|2007|page=460}} The story is attested in the legend of [[Zeus]] slaying the hundred-headed [[Typhon]] from [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'',{{sfn|West|2007|pages=255–259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=448–460}} but it is also in the myths of the slaying of the nine-headed [[Lernaean Hydra]] by [[Heracles]] and the slaying of [[Python (mythology)|Python]] by [[Apollo]].{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=460–464}} The story of [[Heracles]]'s theft of the cattle of [[Geryon]] is probably also related.{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–259}} Although Heracles is not usually thought of as a storm deity in the conventional sense, he bears many attributes held by other Indo-European storm deities, including physical strength and a knack for violence and gluttony.{{sfn|West|2007|pp=255–259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=374–383}}

The original Proto-Indo-European myth is also reflected in [[Germanic paganism|Germanic mythology]].{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=414–441}} In [[Norse mythology]], [[Thor]], the god of thunder, slays the giant serpent [[Jörmungandr]], which lived in the waters surrounding the realm of [[Midgard]].{{sfn|West|2007|p=259}}{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=429–441}} Other dragon-slaying myths are also found in the Germanic tradition. In the ''[[Völsunga saga]]'', [[Sigurd]] slays the dragon [[Fafnir]] and, in ''[[Beowulf]]'', the eponymous hero slays [[The Dragon (Beowulf)|a different dragon]].

Reflexes of the Proto-Indo-European dragon-slaying myth are found throughout other branches of the language family as well. In [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Persian mythology]], [[Fereydun]], and later [[Garshasp]], slays [[Zahhak]]. In [[Slavic mythology]], [[Perun]], the god of storms, slays [[Veles (god)|Veles]] and [[Dobrynya Nikitich]] slays the three-headed dragon [[Zmey]]. In [[Armenian mythology]], the god [[Vahagn]] slays the dragon [[Vishap]].{{sfn|Kurkjian|1958|p=}} In [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]], [[Făt-Frumos]] slays the fire-spitting monster [[Zmeu]]. In [[Celtic mythology]], [[Dian Cecht]] slays Meichi. The myth is believed to have symbolized a clash between forces of order and chaos.{{snf|Watkins|1995|pages=299–300}} In every version of the story, the dragon or serpent always loses, although in some mythologies, such as the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Ragnarök]] myth, the hero or god dies as well.{{sfn|Watkins|1995|pages=324–330}}

===Twin founders===
The analysis of different Indo-European tales indicates that the Proto-Indo-Europeans believed there were two progenitors of mankind: *''{{PIE|Manu-}}'' ("Man") and *''{{PIE|Yemo-}}'' ("Twin"), his twin brother. A reconstructed creation myth involving the two is given by [[David W. Anthony]], attributed in part to [[Bruce Lincoln]]:{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}} Manu and Yemo traverse the cosmos, accompanied by the primordial cow, and finally decide to create the world. To do so, Manu sacrifices either Yemo or the cow, and with help from the sky father, the storm god and the divine twins, forges the earth from the remains. Manu thus becomes the first priest and establishes the practice of sacrifice. The sky gods then present cattle to the third man, *''{{PIE|Trito}}'', who loses it to the three-headed [[#Dragon or Serpent|serpent]] *''{{PIE|Ng&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;hi}}'', but eventually overcomes this monster either alone or aided by the sky father. Trito is now the first warrior and ensures that the cycle of mutual giving between gods and humans may continue.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}} Reflexes of *Manu include Indic [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]], Germanic [[Mannus]]; of Yemo, Indic [[Yama]], Avestan [[Jamshid|Yima]], Norse [[Ymir]], possibly Roman [[Romulus and Remus|Remus]] (&lt; earlier [[Old Latin]] ''*Yemos'').{{sfn|Anthony|2007|pages=134–135}}

[[File:Maria Saal Dom Grabrelief Romulus und Remus 27122013 774.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Ancient Roman relief from the [[Maria Saal#Cathedral|Cathedral of Maria Saal]] showing the infant twins [[Romulus and Remus]] being suckled by a she-wolf]]

The early "history" of Rome is widely recognized as a historicized retelling of various old myths.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=144–165}} [[Romulus and Remus]] are twin brothers from Roman mythology who both have stories in which they are killed.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=286–287}} The Roman writer Livy reports that Remus was believed to have been killed by his brother Romulus at the founding of Rome when they entered into a disagreement about which hill to build the city on. Later, Romulus himself is said to have been torn limb-from-limb by a group of senators.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=286–290}}{{efn|One of the original sources for the stories of Romulus and Remus is Livy's ''History of Rome'', vol. 1, parts iv–vii and xvi. This has been published in an Everyman edition, translated by W. M. Roberts, E. P. Dutton &amp; Co., New York 1912.}} Both of these myths are widely recognized as historicized remnants of the Proto-Indo-European creation story.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=286–290}}

The Germanic languages have information about both Ymir and Mannus (reflexes of ''*Yemo-'' and ''*Manu-'' respectively),{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} but they never appear together in the same myth.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} Instead, they only occur in myths widely separated by both time and circumstances.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} In chapter two of his book ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', which was written in Latin in around 98 A.D., the Roman writer [[Tacitus]] claims that Mannus, the son of Tuisto, was the ancestor of the Germanic peoples.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=285}} This name never recurs anywhere in later Germanic literature,{{sfn|Drinkwater|2007|pages=63–69}} but one proposed meaning of the continental Germanic tribal name ''[[Alamanni]]'' is "[[Mannus]]' own people" ("all-men" being another scholarly etymology).{{sfn|Drinkwater|2007|pages=63–69}}

===Fire in water===
Another important possible myth is the myth of the fire in the waters, a myth which centers around the possible deity *''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;epom Nepōts'', a fiery deity who dwells in water.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=438}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=277–283}} In the Rigveda, the god [[Apam Napat|Apám Nápát]] is envisioned as a form of fire residing in the waters.{{sfn|West|2007|p=270}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=277–279}} In [[Celtic mythology]], a well belonging to the god [[Nechtan (mythology)|Nechtain]] is said to blind all those who gaze into it.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=438}}{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=279}} In an old Armenian poem, a small reed in the middle of the sea spontaneously catches fire and the hero [[Vahagn]] springs forth from it with fiery hair and a fiery beard and eyes that blaze as suns.{{sfn|West|2007|p=271}} In a ninth-century Norwegian poem by the poet Thiodolf, the name ''sǣvar niþr'', meaning "grandson of the sea," is used as a [[kenning]] for fire.{{sfn|West|2007|p=272}} Even the Greek tradition contains possible allusions to the myth of a fire-god dwelling deep beneath the sea.{{sfn|West|2007|p=271}} The phrase "''νέποδες καλῆς Ἁλοσύδνης''," meaning "descendants of the beautiful seas," is used in ''[[The Odyssey]]'' 4.404 as an epithet for the seals of [[Proteus]].{{sfn|West|2007|p=271}}

===Binding of evil===
Jaan Puhvel notes similarities between the Norse myth in which the god [[Týr]] inserts his hand into the wolf [[Fenrir]]'s mouth while the other gods bind him with [[Gleipnir]], only for Fenrir to bite off Týr's hand when he discovers he cannot break his bindings,{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=199}} and the Iranian myth in which [[Jamshid]] rescues his brother's corpse from [[Ahriman]]'s bowels by reaching his hand up Ahriman's anus and pulling out his brother's corpse, only for his hand to become infected with [[leprosy]].{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=119}} In both accounts, an authority figure forces the evil entity into submission by inserting his hand into the being's orifice (in Fenrir's case the mouth, in Ahriman's the anus) and losing it.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=119}} Fenrir and Ahriman fulfill different roles in their own mythological traditions and are unlikely to be remnants of a Proto-Indo-European "evil god";{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|pages=119–120}} nonetheless, it is clear that the "binding myth" is of Proto-Indo-European origin.{{sfn|Puhvel|1987|page=120}}

==Cosmogony==

In the [[Cosmogony|cosmogonic myths]] of many Indo-European cultures a [[World egg | Cosmic Egg]] symbolizes the primordial state from which the universe arises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leeming |first1=David Adams |title=Creation Myths of the World: An Encyclopedia, Book 1 |date=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=144 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=9I62BcuPxfYC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=world+egg+indo+european#v=onepage&amp;q=world%20egg%20indo%20european&amp;f=false|isbn=9781598841749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cosmology==
===Underworld===
[[File:Attic Red Figure (White Ground) Lekythos with Charon, attributed to the Tymbos painter, ca 500 - 450 BC, Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, UK (22681344331).jpg|thumb|right|Attic [[red-figure]] [[lekythos]] attributed to the Tymbos painter showing [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] welcoming a soul into his boat, c. 500-450 BC]]
{{Main|Otherworld}}

Most Indo-European traditions contain some kind of [[Underworld]] or [[Afterlife]]. It is possible that the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed that, in order to reach the Underworld, one needed to cross a river, guided by an old man (''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/ǵérh₂onts|*ĝerh&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;ont-]]'').{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=439}} The Greek tradition of the dead being ferried across the river [[Styx]] by [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] is probably a reflex of this belief.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=439}} The idea of crossing a river to reach the Underworld is also present throughout Celtic mythologies.{{snf|West|2007|page=390}} Several Vedic texts contain references to crossing a river in order to reach the land of the dead and the Latin word ''tarentum'' meaning "tomb" originally meant "crossing point."{{snf|West|2007| page=389}} In Norse mythology, Hermóðr must cross a bridge over the river Giöll in order to reach [[Hel (being)|Hel]].{{snf|West|2007|pages=390–391}} In Latvian folk songs, the dead must cross a marsh rather than a river.{{snf|West|2007|page=391}} Traditions of placing coins on the bodies of the deceased in order to pay the ferryman are attested in both ancient Greek and early modern Slavic funerary practices.{{snf|West|2007|page=390}} It is also possible that the Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed that the Underworld was guarded by some kind of watchdog, similar to the Greek [[Cerberus]], the Hindu Śárvara, or the Norse [[Garmr]].{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=439}}{{snf|West|2007|page=392}}

===World tree and serpent===
The Proto-Indo-Europeans may have believed in some kind of world tree.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}} It is also possible that they may have believed that this tree was either guarded by or under constant attack from some kind of dragon or serpent.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}} In Norse mythology, the cosmic tree [[Yggdrasil]] is tended by the three [[Norns]] while the dragon [[Nidhogg]] gnaws at its roots.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}} In Greek mythology, the tree of the golden apples in the Garden of the Hesperides is tended by the three [[Hesperides]] and guarded by the hundred-headed dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]].{{snf|West|2007|pages=346–347}} In Indo-Iranian texts, there is a mythical tree dripping with [[Soma (drink)|Soma]], the immortal drink of the gods and, in later Pahlavi sources, a malicious lizard is said to lurk at the bottom of it.{{snf|West|2007|page=346}}

[[File:Johann Georg Seitz Gemüsestilleben mit Häschen.jpg|thumb|''Gemüsestilleben mit Häschen'' ("Still Life with Rabbits") by [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Seitz Johann Georg Seitz] (c. 1870)]]

'''Rabbits and hares are common motifs''' in the [[visual arts]], with variable mythological and artistic meanings in different cultures. The [[rabbit]] as well as the [[hare]] have been associated with [[Lunar deity|moon deities]] and may signify rebirth or resurrection.{{r|Windling}} They may also be symbols of [[fertility]] or sensuality, and they appear in depictions of hunting and spring scenes in the [[Labours of the Months]].

== Judaism ==
[[File:Pederastic gifts Macron Louvre G142 n3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The rabbit as a gift in courtship, exterior detail of a red-figure [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/kylix kylix], (Athens c. 480 BC)]]

In [[Judaism]], the rabbit is considered an unclean animal, because "though it [[ruminant|chews the cud]], does not have a [[Cloven hoof|divided hoof]]."&lt;ref&gt;Leviticus 11.6, cf. Deuteronomy 14.7&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=rock hyrax}} This led to derogatory statements in the Christian art of the Middle Ages, and to an ambiguous interpretation of the [[Three hares#In Judaism|rabbit's symbolism]]. The "[[Rock Hyrax|shafan]]" in [[Hebrew]] has symbolic meaning. Although rabbits were a non-[[kosher]] animal in the [[Bible]], positive symbolic connotations were sometimes noted, as for [[Three Lions (disambiguation)|lions]] and eagles. 16th century German scholar [[Rabbi]] [[Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi]], saw the rabbits as a symbol of the [[Diaspora]].  In any case, a [[three hares]] motif was a prominent part of many [[Synagogue]]s.{{r|Windling}}{{r|Wonnenberg}}

== Antiquity ==
In antiquity, the hare, because it was prized as a hunting quarry, was seen as the epitome of the hunted creature that could survive only by prolific breeding. [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''The Histories'' 3.108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and [[Claudius Aelianus]] all described the rabbit as one of the most fertile of animals. It thus became a symbol of vitality, sexual desire and fertility. The hare served as an attribute of [[Aphrodite]] and as a gift between lovers. In [[late antiquity]] it was used as a symbol of good luck and in connection with ancient burial traditions.

== Christian art ==
[[File:1505 Piero di Cosimo Venus, Mars and Cupid anagoria.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|''Venus, Mars and Cupid'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]], a  Cupid lying on Venus clings to a white rabbit.]]
In [[Early Christian art]], hares appeared on [[relief]]s, [[epitaph]]s, icons and oil lamps although their significance is not always clear.

The ''[[Physiologus]]'', a resource for medieval artists, states that when in danger the rabbit seeks safety by climbing high up rocky cliffs, but when running back down, because of its short front legs, it is quickly caught by its predators.&lt;ref&gt;''Physiologus''. Ed. by Ursula Treu. 3rd edition. Hanau 1998. pp. 103-104 (German).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, according to the teaching of [[St. Basil]], men should seek his salvation in the rock of Christ, rather than descending to seek worldly things and falling into the hands of the [[devil]]. The negative view of the rabbit as an unclean animal, which derived from the [[Old Testament]], always remained present for [[medieval]] artists and their patrons. Thus the rabbit can have a negative connotation of unbridled sexuality and lust or a positive meaning as a symbol of the steep path to salvation. Whether a representation of a hare in Medieval art represents man falling to his doom or striving for his eternal salvation is therefore open to interpretation, depending on context.

[[File:Paderborner Dom Dreihasenfenster.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[three hares]] at [[Paderborn Cathedral]]]]

The ''Hasenfenster'' (hare windows) in [[Paderborn Cathedral]] and in the [[Muotathal]] Monastery in Switzerland, in which [[three hares]] are depicted with only three ears between them, forming a triangle, can be seen as a symbol of the [[Trinity]], and probably go back to an old symbol for the passage of time. The three hares shown in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s [[woodcut]], ''The Holy Family with the Three Hares'' (1497), can also be seen as a symbol of the Trinity.

The idea of rabbits as a symbol of vitality, rebirth and resurrection derives from antiquity. This explains their role in connection with [[Easter]], the [[resurrection of Christ]]. The unusual presentation in Christian iconography of a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] with the [[Child Jesus|Infant Jesus]] playing with a white rabbit in [[Titian]]'s Parisian painting, can thus be interpreted christologically. Together with the basket of bread and wine, a symbol of the sacrificial death of Christ, the picture may be interpreted as the resurrection of Christ after death.

The phenomenon of [[superfetation]], where embryos from different [[menstrual cycle]]s are present in the [[uterus]], results in hares and rabbits being able to give birth seemingly without having been impregnated, which caused them to be seen as symbols of virginity.&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, Susan; John Seidensticker (2011). Rabbits: The Animal Answer Guide. JHU Press. {{ISBN|0-8018-9789-0}}. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbits also live underground, an echo of the tomb of Christ.
[[File:Tizian-Madonna mit dem Kaninchen.jpg|thumb|left|168px|[[Titian]], ''Mary and Infant Jesus with a rabbit'', Paris, Louvre]]
As a symbol of fertility, white rabbits appear on a wing of the high altar in [[Freiburg Minster]]. They are playing at the feet of two pregnant women, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|Elizabeth]]. [[Martin Schongauer]]'s engraving ''Jesus after the Temptation'' (1470) shows nine (three times three) rabbits at the feet of Jesus Christ, which can be seen as a sign of extreme vitality.  In contrast, the tiny squashed rabbits at the base of the columns in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s ''[[Rolin Madonna]]'' symbolize "Lust", as part of a set of references in the painting to all the [[Seven Deadly Sins]].&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, Craig. ''Jan van Eyck, The Play of Realism'', p. 114, Reaktion Books, London, 1991, {{ISBN|0-948462-18-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Giovanni Bellini St Jerome Reading in the Countryside.jpg|thumb|right|''St. Jerome Reading in the Countryside'', by [[Giovanni Bellini]], with a white hare.]]
Hunting scenes in the sacred context can be understood as the pursuit of good through evil. In the Romanesque sculpture (c. 1135) in the [[Königslutter]] imperial Cathedral, a hare pursued by a hunter symbolises the human soul seeking to escape persecution by the devil. Another painting, ''Hares Catch the Hunters'', shows the triumph of good over evil. Alternatively, when an eagle pursues the hare, the eagle can be seen as symbolizing Christ and the hare, uncleanliness and the evil's terror in the face of the light.

In Christian [[iconography]], the hare is an attribute of Saint [[Martin of Tours]] and Saint Alberto di Siena, because legend has it that both protected hares from persecution by dogs and hunters. They are also an attribute of the patron saint of Spanish hunters, [[Olegarius]] of Barcelona. White hares and rabbits were sometimes the symbols of chastity and purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunniesinbaskets.org/the-symbolism-of-rabbits-and-hares-by-terri-windling.html|title=the-symbolism-of-rabbits-and-hares|publisher=bunniesinbaskets.org|accessdate= 1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In secular art ==

[[File:Jan Weenix - Een aap en een hond bij dood wild.jpg|thumb|''Hunting still life with lap dog and monkey'' by Jan Weenix, 1714]]

In non-religious art of the modern era, the rabbit appears in the same context as in antiquity: as prey for the hunter, or representing spring or autumn, as well as an attribute of Venus and a symbol of physical love.  In cycles of the [[Labours of the Months]], rabbits frequently appear in the spring months. In [[Francesco del Cossa]]'s painting of April in the [[Palazzo Schifanoia]] in [[Ferrara]], Italy, [[Venus]]' children, surrounded by a flock of white rabbits, symbolize love and fertility.

In [[Italian Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] art, rabbits are depicted more often than hares. In an [[allegory]] on lust by [[Pisanello]], a naked woman lies on a couch with a rabbit at her feet. [[Pinturicchio]]'s scene of ''[[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna in the Bath]]'' is displayed in the Vatican's [[Borgia Apartment]]. Here, each of the two old men are accompanied by a pair of hares or rabbits, clearly indicating wanton lust. In [[Piero di Cosimo]]'s painting of Venus and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], a cupid resting on Venus clings to a white rabbit for similar reasons.

[[Still life]]s in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and their [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish equivalents]] often included a moralizing element which was understood by their original viewers without assistance: fish and meat can allude to religious dietary precepts, fish indicating fasting while great piles of meat indicate ''[[Original sin|voluptas carnis]]'' (lusts of the flesh), especially if lovers are also depicted. Rabbits and birds, perhaps in the company of [[carrot]]s and other [[phallic symbol]]s, were easily understood by contemporary viewers in the same sense.

As small animals with fur, hares and rabbits allowed the artist to showcase his ability in painting this difficult material.  Dead hares appear in the works of the earliest painter of still life collections of foodstuffs in a kitchen setting, [[Frans Snyders]], and remain a common feature, very often sprawling hung up by a rear leg, in the works of [[Jan Fyt]], [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] and many other specialists in the genre.  By the end of the 17th century, the grander subgenre of the hunting trophy still life appeared, now set outdoors, as though at the back door of a palace or hunting lodge.  Hares (but rarely rabbits) continued to feature in the works of the Dutch and Flemish originators of the genre, and later French painters like [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, William S., "Jean-Baptiste Oudry: Hare and Leg of Lamb", p. 150, ''The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art'', Vol. 57, No. 5 (May, 1970), pp. 149-158
, Cleveland Museum of Art, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25152331 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Middle Ages]] until modern times, the right to hunt was a vigorously defended privilege of the ruling classes. Hunting [[Still life]]s, often in combination with hunting equipment, adorn the rooms of baroque palaces, indicating the rank and prestige of their owners. [[Jan Weenix]]' painting shows a still life reminiscent of a trophy case with birds and small game, fine fruits, a pet dog and a pet monkey, arranged in front of a classicising garden sculpture with the figure of [[Hercules]] and an opulent palace in the background. The wealth and luxurious lifestyle of the patron or owner is clearly shown.
 
The children's tales of the English author [[Beatrix Potter]], illustrated by herself, include several titles featuring the badly behaved [[Peter Rabbit]] and other rabbit characters, including her first and most successful book ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' (1902), followed by ''[[The Tale of Benjamin Bunny]]'' (1904), and ''[[The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies]]'' (1909).  Potter's anthropomorphic clothed rabbits are probably the most familiar artistic rabbits in the English-speaking world, no doubt influenced by illustrations by [[John Tenniel]] of the [[White Rabbit]] in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s book ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.

[[Joseph Beuys]], who always finds a place for a rabbit in his works, sees it as symbolizing resurrection. In the context of his action "[[How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]", he stated that the rabbit "...has a direct relationship to birth... For me, the rabbit is the symbol of incarnation. Because the rabbit shows in reality what man can only show in his thoughts. He buries himself, he buries himself in a depression. He incarnates himself in the earth, and that alone is important."

''[[Masquerade (book)]]'' (1979), written and illustrated by the artist [[Kit Williams]], is ostensibly a children’s book, but contains elaborate clues to the location of a jewelled golden hare, also made by Williams, which he had buried at the location in England to which the clues in the book led.  The hare was not found until 1982, in what later emerged as dubious circumstances.

The Welsh sculptor [[Barry Flanagan]] (1944-2009) was best known for his energetic bronzes of hares, which he produced throughout his career. Many have a comic element, and the length and thinness of the hare's body is often exaggerated.

=== Dürer's ''Young Hare'' ===
{{Anchor|Dürer's hare|reason="Dürer's hare" is the old subsection name, which was changed to "Dürer's ''Young Hare''" on 8 March 2018.}}
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Hare, 1502 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Young Hare]]'', by [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1502)]]
[[File:Wolpertinger.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Wolpertinger]]'' (2005), in the style of Albrecht Dürer]]

Probably one of the most famous depictions of an animal in the history of European art is the painting ''[[Young Hare]]'' by [[Albrecht Dürer]], completed in 1502 and now preserved in the [[Albertina]] in Vienna. Dürer's [[watercolor]] is seen in the context of his other nature studies, such as his almost equally famous ''Meadow'' or his ''Bird Wings''. He chose to paint these in watercolor or [[gouache]], striving for the highest possible precision and "realistic" representation.

The hare pictured by Dürer probably does not have a symbolic meaning, but it does have an exceptional reception history. Reproductions of Dürer's ''Hare'' have often been a permanent component of [[bourgeois]] living rooms in Germany. The image has been printed in textbooks; published in countless reproductions; embossed in copper, wood or stone; represented three-dimensionally in plastic or plaster; encased in [[plexiglas]]; painted on ostrich eggs; printed on plastic bags; surreally distorted in ''Hasengiraffe'' ("Haregiraffe") by Martin Missfeldt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martin-missfeldt.de/kunst-bilder/albrecht-duerer/hase-albrecht-duerer.php|title=Hase nach Albrecht Dürer|website=www.martin-missfeldt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; reproduced as a joke by [[Fluxus]] artists;{{r|fluxus}} and cast in gold; or sold cheaply in [[art galleries|galleries]] and at [[art fairs]]

Since early 2000, [[Ottmar Hörl]] has created several works based on Dürer's ''Hare,'' including a giant pink version.&lt;ref name="Hörl’s Pink Hare"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smyth|first1=Debbie|title=Pink Rabbit!|url=https://travelwithintent.com/2015/03/26/pink-rabbit-young-hare-vienna/|website=Travel with Intent|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmar Polke]] has also engaged with the hare on paper or textiles, or as part of his installations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-frieder-burda.de/1.328.2.html?&amp;shadow=79&amp;cHash=93690b7a29|title=Illustration, Gouache on patterned fabric|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even in rubber band form.&lt;ref name="Poke rubber band"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butler|first1=Sharon|title=More on Prince, Polke, and rubber bands|url=http://www.twocoatsofpaint.com/2012/06/more-on-prince-polke-and-rubber-bands.html|website=Two Coats of Paint|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=5 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dieter Roth]]'s ''Köttelkarnikel'' ("Turd Bunny") is a copy of Dürer's ''Hare'' made from rabbit droppings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leben.freenet.de/pictureshow/reisen/multimedial-kuenstler-roth_799796_533042_779680_6.html|title=Multimedial: Künstler Roth|website=leben.freenet.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Klaus Staeck]] enclosed one in a little wooden box, with a cutout hole, so that it could look out and breathe. Dürer's ''Hare'' has even inspired a depiction of the mythological [[Wolpertinger]].

Śārṅgadeva was born in a [[Brahmin]] family of [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref name=massey41/&gt; In an era of Islamic invasion of the northwest regions of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the start of [[Delhi Sultanate]], his family migrated south and settled in the Hindu kingdom in the Deccan region ruled by the Yadava dynasty near [[Ellora Caves]] (Maharashtra). Sarangadeva worked as an accountant with freedom to pursue his music interests in the court of King [[Seuna_Yadavas_of_Devagiri#Singhana_II|Singhana II]] (1210–1247).&lt;ref name=massey41&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reginald Massey|author2=Jamila Massey|title=The Music Of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yySNDP9XVggC&amp;pg=PA41|year=1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-332-8|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramanlal Chhotalal Mehta, ''Musical Musings: Selected Essays'', Indian Musicological Society (1996), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

==Ideas==
Śārṅgadeva presented his ideas on music and dance in seven chapters of ''Sangita Ratnakara'', but integrated it with philosophical context.&lt;ref name="Lal1992p3987"/&gt; He systematically presented his ideas on the nature of sound, register, the smallest distinct sounds that humans can hear and musical instruments can produce (''[[Shruti (music)|shruti]]''), musical scales and modes, 264 ''[[raga]]s'', beats and role of time (''[[tala (music)|tala]]''), prosody (''[[Chanda]]s''), relation between performance arts and human emotions and sentiments, musical and vocal ornaments, the composition of drama and songs, and the limitless opportunities available to the artist to express and affect her audience.&lt;ref name="Lal1992p3987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lewis Rowell|title=Music and Musical Thought in Early India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_UCgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-73034-9|pages=13, 212–214, 284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter G. Fletcher|Peter Fletcher]] – a professor of Music and Drama, Śārṅgadeva states in ''Sangita Ratnakara'' that "the composer was expected to be a competent performer, but he also made clear that the composer was expected to know his audience, and how their minds work, rising above his own likes and dislikes, in order to bring delight to everyone".&lt;ref name=fletcher253&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Fletcher|title=World Musics in Context: A Comprehensive Survey of the World's Major Musical Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vBEfViLyp8C&amp;pg=PA253 |year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-816636-8|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarangadeva's views on music, states Fletcher, exemplified ideas in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' relating to non-attachment.&lt;ref name=fletcher253/&gt;

'''Sexology''' is the scientific study of [[human sexuality]], including human sexual interests, [[Human sexual activity|behavior]]s and functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sexology|title=Sexology|work=Merriam Webster|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sexology'' does not generally refer to the non-scientific study of sexuality, such as [[political science]] or [[social criticism]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt;

Sexologists apply tools from several academic fields, such as [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[epidemiology]], [[sociology]], and [[criminology]]. Topics of study include [[sexual development]] (puberty), [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual relationship]]s, sexual activities, [[paraphilia]]s, atypical sexual interests.  It also includes the study of sexuality across the lifespan, including [[child sexuality]], [[puberty]], [[adolescent sexuality]], and [[geriatric sexology|sexuality among the elderly]]. Sexology also spans sexuality among the mentally and/or physically disabled. The sexological study of [[sexual dysfunction]]s and disorders, including [[erectile dysfunction]], [[anorgasmia]], and [[pedophilia]], are also mainstays.

==History==
===Early===
[[sex manual|Sexual manuals]] have existed since antiquity, such as [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], the ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'' and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]''.  {{lang|fr|De la prostitution dans la ville de Paris}} (''Prostitution in the City of Paris''), an early 1830s study on 3,558 registered prostitutes in [[Paris]], published by Alexander Jean Baptiste Parent-Duchatelet (and published in 1837, a year after he died), has been called the first work of modern sex research.&lt;ref name=Bullough1989&gt;Bullough, V. L. (1989). ''The society for the scientific study of sex: A brief history.'' Mt. Vernon, Iowa: The Foundation for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of sexual behavior in human beings began in the 19th century. Shifts in [[Europe]]'s national borders at that time brought into conflict laws that were sexually liberal and laws that criminalized behaviors such as homosexual activity.

===Victorian Era to WWII===
[[File:Portrait of Havelock Ellis (1859-1939), Psychologist and Biologist (2575987702) crop.jpg|thumb|[[Havelock Ellis]], a pioneering figure in the movement towards sexual emancipation in the late 19th century.]]

Despite the prevailing social attitude of sexual repression in [[Victorian morality|the Victorian era]], the movement towards sexual emancipation began towards the end of the nineteenth century in England and Germany. In 1886, [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing]] published ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]].'' That work is considered as having established sexology as a scientific discipline.&lt;ref name = Hoenig1977&gt;Hoenig, J. (1977). Dramatis personae: Selected biographical sketches of 19th century pioneers in sexology. In J. Money and H. Musaph (Eds.), ''Handbook of Sexology,'' (pp. 21-43). Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the founding father of sexology was the doctor and sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]] who challenged the sexual taboos of his era regarding [[masturbation]] and [[homosexuality]] and revolutionized the conception of sex in his time. His seminal work was the 1897 ''Sexual Inversion'', which describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys. Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality, (the term was coined by Kertbeny) as he did not characterize it as a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age [[taboo]]s as well as gender taboos. Seven of his twenty-one case studies are of inter-generational relationships. He also developed other important psychological concepts, such as [[autoerotism]] and [[narcissism]], both of which were later developed further by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of Psycho-analysis|author1=Laplanche, J.|author2=Pontalis, J.B.|date=1988|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=9780946439492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA45|page=45|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis pioneered [[transgender]] phenomena alongside the German [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. He established it as new category that was separate and distinct from homosexuality.&lt;ref name=ttp&gt;Ekins, Richard and King, Dave (2006) ''The transgender phenomenon'', SAGE, {{ISBN|0-7619-7163-7}}, pp. 61-64&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of Hirschfeld's studies of [[transvestism]], but disagreeing with his terminology, in 1913 Ellis proposed the term ''sexo-aesthetic inversion'' to describe the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ellis1933&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Albert|title=Psychology of Sex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSLybrnLVeIC&amp;pg=PA209year=1933|isbn=9781443735322|publisher=Read Books|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5dNnT3GuF_gC&amp;dq=father+of+sexology+ellis|title=The Real Facts Of Life: Feminism And The Politics Of Sexuality C1850-1940|author=Jackson, Margaret|year=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203992395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the first scholarly journal of the field, ''Journal of Sexology'' (Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft), began publication and was published monthly for one year. Those issues contained articles by Freud, [[Alfred Adler]], and [[Wilhelm Stekel]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle&gt;Haeberle, E. J. (1983). ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents.'' World Association for Sexology.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the first academic association was founded: the ''Society for Sexology''.&lt;ref&gt;Kewenig, W. A. (1983). Foreword. In E. J. Haeberle, ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents''. World Association for Sexology. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud developed a theory of sexuality. These stages of development include: Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latency and Genital. These stages run from infancy to puberty and onwards.&lt;ref name="gutenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14969 |title=Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex by Sigmund Freud - Free Ebook |publisher=gutenberg.org|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his studies of his clients, between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Otto Gross]], were disciples of Freud, but rejected by his theories{{vague|date=November 2013}} because of their emphasis on the role of sexuality in the revolutionary struggle for the emancipation of mankind.

[[Image:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|left|thumb|Hirschfeld's books were burned by the Nazis in Berlin for being "un-German".]]
Pre-Nazi Germany, under the sexually liberal [[Napoleonic code]], organized and resisted the anti-sexual, Victorian cultural influences. The momentum from those groups led them to coordinate sex research across traditional [[academic discipline]]s, bringing Germany to the leadership of sexology. Physician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] was an outspoken advocate for sexual minorities, founding the [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], the first advocacy for homosexual and transgender rights.&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, Dustin (2008). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer movements. In A. Lind &amp; S. Brzuzy (Eds.), ''Battleground: Women, gender, and sexuality, 2,'' 291. Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirschfeld also set up the first [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in Berlin in 1919. Its library housed over 20,000 volumes, 35,000 photographs, a large collection of art and other objects. People from around [[Europe]] visited the Institute to gain a clearer understanding of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and to be treated for their sexual concerns and dysfunctions.

Hirschfeld developed a system which identified numerous actual or hypothetical types of sexual intermediary between heterosexual male and female to represent the potential diversity of human sexuality, and is credited with identifying a group of people that today are referred to as [[transsexual]] or [[transgender]] as separate from the categories of homosexuality, he referred to these people as 'transvestiten' (transvestites).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Hirschfeld | first= Magnus | title= Die Transvestiten. Eine Untersuchung über den erotischen Verkleidungstrieb. Mit umfangreichen casuistischen und historischen | location= Leipzig | publisher= Verlag von Max Spohr (Ferd.

Other sexologists in the early [[gay rights]] movement included [[Ernst Burchard]], [[Hans Blüher]], and [[Benedict Friedlaender]]. [[Ernst Gräfenberg]], after whom the [[G-spot]] is named, published the initial research developing the [[intrauterine device]] (IUD).

===Post WWII===
After World War II, sexology experienced a renaissance, both in the United States and Europe. Large scale studies of sexual behavior, sexual function, and [[sexual dysfunction]] gave rise to the development of [[sex therapy]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt; Post-WWII sexology in the U.S. was influenced by the influx of European refugees escaping the Nazi regime and the popularity of the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey studies]]. Until that time, American sexology consisted primarily of groups working to end [[prostitution]] and to educate youth about [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] founded the [[Institute for Sex Research]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] at [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] in 1947. This is now called the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction]]. He wrote in his 1948 book that more was scientifically known about the sexual behavior of farm animals than of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = Alfred C. | last2 = Martin | first2 = Clyde E. | last3 = Pomeroy | first3 = Wardell B. | author-link1 = Alfred Kinsey | author-link2 = Clyde Martin | author-link3 = Wardell Pomeroy | title = Sexual behavior in the human male | page = 3 | publisher = W.B. Saunders | location = New York and Philadelphia | year = 1948 | oclc = 705195970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and sexologist [[John Money]] developed theories on sexual identity and [[gender identity]] in the 1950s. His work, notably on the [[David Reimer]] case has since been regarded as controversial, even while the case was key to the development of treatment protocols for [[intersex]] infants and children.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Milton | last2 = Sigmundson | first2 = H.

[[Kurt Freund]] developed the [[penile plethysmograph]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] in the 1950s. The device was designed to provide an objective measurement of [[sexual arousal]] in males and is currently used in the assessment of [[pedophilia]] and [[hebephilia]]. This tool has since been used with [[sex offenders]].&lt;ref name="apobit"&gt;{{cite news | last = Associated Press | title = Kurt Freund, 82, notable sexologist | url = http://www.s-t.com/daily/10-96/10-29-96/c06wn888.htm | date = October 26, 1996 }} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kubanobit"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kuban | first = Michael | title = Sexual Science Mentor: Dr. Kurt Freund | journal = Sexual Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | url = http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101222215801/http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2010-12-22 | date = Summer 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 and 1970, [[Masters and Johnson]] released their works ''Human Sexual Response'' and ''Human Sexual Inadequacy,'' respectively. Those volumes sold well, and they were founders of what became known as the [[Masters &amp; Johnson Institute]] in 1978.

[[Vern Bullough]] was a historian of sexology during this era, as well as being a researcher in the field.&lt;ref name="vernbullough"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040727172744/http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archivedate=July 27, 2004 |dead-url=yes |title=Dr. Vern L. Bullough: Profile |publisher=web.archive.org |website=vernbullough.com |accessdate=July 25, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s caused a dramatic shift in sexological research efforts towards understanding and controlling the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gagnon | first = John H. | title = Sex research and sexual conduct in the era of AIDS | journal = [[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]] | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 593–601 | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] | pmid = 3225745 | date = December 1988 | url = http://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/1988/12000/Sex_Research_and_Sexual_Conduct_in_the_Era_of.11.aspx | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Oriel | first = Jennifer | title = Sexual pleasure as a human right: Harmful or helpful to women in the context of HIV/AIDS? | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 392–404 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | date = September 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/248654/original/sexual+pleasure+as+a+HR.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual stimulation''' is any [[stimulation|stimulus]] (including bodily contact) that leads to, enhances and maintains [[sexual arousal]], and may lead to [[orgasm]]. Although sexual arousal may arise without [[physical stimulation]], achieving orgasm usually requires physical sexual stimulation.

The term ''sexual stimulation'' often implies stimulation of the [[sex organ|genitals]], but may also include stimulation of other areas of the body, stimulation of the senses (such as sight or hearing) and mental stimulation (i.e. from reading or [[sexual fantasy|fantasizing]]). Sufficient stimulation of the [[human penis|penis]] in males and the [[clitoris]] in females usually results in an orgasm.&lt;ref name="Weiten"&gt;{{cite book|first=Wayne |last=Weiten |first2=Dana S.|last2=Dunn |first3=Elizabeth Yost |display-authors=2 |last3=Hammer|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st century|page=386|isbn =1-111-18663-4|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2011 |accessdate=5 January 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&amp;pg=PT423&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clitoris"&gt;{{cite web|title='I Want a Better Orgasm!'|publisher=[[WebMD]]|accessdate=August 18, 2011|url=http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113132443/http://www.webmd.com/sex/want-better-orgasms|archivedate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenneth Mah"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Kenneth | last = Mah | first2 = Yitzchak M | last2 = Binik | title = The nature of human orgasm: a critical review of major trends | journal = [[Clinical Psychology Review]] | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 823–856| date = January 7, 2001 | pmid = 11497209| doi = 10.1016/S0272-7358(00)00069-6 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735800000696 | quote=Women rated clitoral stimulation as at least somewhat more important than vaginal stimulation in achieving orgasm; only about 20% indicated that they did not require additional clitoral stimulation during intercourse.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kammerer-Doak"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Dorothy | last = Kammerer-Doak | first2 = Rebecca G. | last2 = Rogers | title =  Female Sexual Function and Dysfunction | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–183 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18486835 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2008.03.006 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889854508000235 | quote=Most women report the inability to achieve orgasm with vaginal intercourse and require direct clitoral stimulation ...

Some people practice [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]], whereby a person or their sexual partner controls the level of sexual stimulation to delay orgasm, and to prolong the sexual experience leading up to orgasm.

==Physical sexual stimulation==
[[File:Primary and specific erogenous zones.svg|thumb|The erogenous zones of the male and female body.]]

===Genital===
Physical sexual stimulation usually consists of touching the genitals or other [[erogenous zone]]s. [[Masturbation]], [[erotic massage]], sexual intercourse, a [[handjob]] or [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] are types of physical sexual stimulation involving the genitals. [[Sexual arousal]] is usually triggered through sensitive nerves in these body parts,&lt;ref&gt;Schober, Justine M., and Donald Pfaff. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Justine_Schober/publication/5968480_The_neurophysiology_of_sexual_arousal/links/545cf0c90cf2c1a63bfa5af6.pdf The neurophysiology of sexual arousal.]" Best practice &amp; research Clinical endocrinology &amp; metabolism 21.3 (2007): 445-461.&lt;/ref&gt; which cause the release of pleasure-causing  chemicals ([[endorphins]]) that act as mental rewards to pursue such stimulation. A person may also become sexually aroused by touching another person's genitals or other body parts.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The [[bulbocavernosus reflex]] is triggered by stimulation of the glans penis or clitoris.&lt;ref name=Wheeless&gt;http://www.wheelessonline.com/ortho/bulbocavernosus_reflex Bulbocavernosus Reflex&amp;nbsp;– Wheeless' Textbook of Orthopaedics&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of [[sex toy]]s is to provide pleasure and stimulation through an alternative route than just using people's bodies. They can be used by someone on their own, with partnered sex, or group sex. They can be exciting and provide new types of stimulation that the body cannot produce, such as vibrations.

Sex toys have been used as a source of sexual stimulation for thousands of years. There have been [[dildo]]s found from the [[Paleolithic|Palaeolithic era]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4713323.stm|title=Ancient Phallus Unearthed in Cave.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; made of [[Siltstone]] and polished to a high gloss. Dildos were also made of camel dung and coated with resin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Book of Kink: Sex Beyond the Missionary|last=Christina, E.|first=|publisher=Tarcher Perigree|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SFcWmcGLXJ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians are uncertain whether these have been used for [[religious ritual]]s or for personal pleasure. It is known that dildos were used for [[fertility ritual]]s,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/sex-amp-relationships/sex-toy|title=The long, strange history of sex toys.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] created their dildos from a carved penis covered in leather or animal intestines to create a more natural feel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Romans created double-ended dildos for use with a partner. Ancient Chinese dildos were made of [[bronze]] or other metals and some were hollow allowing them to be filled with liquid to simulate an [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=With the hand: a cultural history of masturbation|last=Driel, M.|first=|publisher=Reaktion Books.|year=2012|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were used because wealthy Chinese men would often have too many wives to please. In Persia, they thought that the blood of the [[hymen]] was unclean, and should be avoided by husbands. On the night before a lady's wedding, a local holy-man would come and break her hymen with a large stone dildo, a ritual also used to confirm the virginity of the bride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marriage customs of the world: from henna to honeymoons|last=Monger, G.|first=|publisher=ABC-Clio|year=2004|isbn=|location=California|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-genital stimulation  ===
There are many areas through which a person can be sexually stimulated, other than the genitals. To name a few, the nipples, thighs, lips, and neck can all provide sexual stimulation when touched. 
[[File:Oral nipple stimulation small sharpened.png|thumb|Sexual stimulation of a nipple]]
[[Nipples]]: One study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levin, R. &amp;|first=Meston, C.|year=2006|title=Nipple/breast stimulation and sexual arousal in young men and women.|url=http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)31341-2/fulltext|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=3|pages=450–454|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2006.00230.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; administered a questionnaire about sexual activity to 301 participants and found that 81.5% of women reported that stimulating their nipples caused or enhanced sexual arousal and that 59.1% of them asked to have their nipples stimulated during sex. Furthermore, 51.7% of men reported that nipple stimulation caused sexual arousal, and 39% said that it enhanced their existing arousal. Research  using &lt;ref name="Komisaruk"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Komisaruk |first1=B.

The research suggests the sensations are genital orgasms caused by [[nipple stimulation]], and may also be directly linked to "the genital area of the brain".&lt;ref name="Komisaruk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levi |first=R, J. |year=2006|title=The breast/nipple/areola complex and human sexuality.|url=|journal=Sexual &amp; Relationship therapy|volume=21|pages=237–249|via=|doi=10.1080/14681990600674674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In women, one study indicated that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix. Nipple stimulation may trigger uterine contractions, which then produce a sensation in the genital area of the brain.&lt;ref name="Komisaruk" /&gt;

[[Thigh]]s: In 2012 the California Institute of Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=V. |last1=Gazzola |first2=M.L. |last2=Spezio |first3=J.A. |last3=Etzel |first4=F. |last4=Castelli |first5=R. |last5=Adolphs |first6=C. |last6=Keysers|first=|year=2012|title=Primary somatosensory cortex discriminates affective significance in social touch.|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|pages=1657–1666.|doi=10.1073/pnas.1113211109|pmc=3382530}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured brain responses in heterosexual males as they were having their inner thighs touched whilst being [[MRI Scanner|MRI scanned]]. They were either watching a video of a woman touching their thigh or a man touching their thigh. They reported more sexual pleasure when they thought it was the woman touching them than the man, and this was reflected in their MRI scans with greater arousal of their somatosensory cortex. It can be therefore concluded that the thighs are an area that can cause sexual stimulation when touched.

[[Lip]]s: Lips contain a huge number of [[nerve endings]] and are considered to be an erogenous zone. Men report experiencing more pleasure from the stimulation of their lips than women do (see below for sex differences in stimulation). In addition to stimulation of the lips by touching, men can be visually stimulated by looking at a woman's lips. It has also been&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Evolution of Human Sexuality.|last=Symons, D.|first=|publisher=Oxford university press.|year=1979|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that men prefer women with fuller lips because they are an indicator of youth.

[[Neck]]:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Turnbull |first1=O. H. |last2=Lovett |first2=V. E. |last3=Chaldecott |first3=J. |last4=Lucas |first4=M.

Females reported neck stimulation as being more arousing than men did, and the nape of the neck was more arousing for both sexes than the back of the neck.{{Contradict-inline|reason="nape is the back of the neck"|date=October 2017}}

=== Sex differences in erogenous zones ===
This table&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; shows the sex differences in erogenous zones and includes the top ten most arousing areas for both sexes. Each body part was rated out of ten for how arousing it is when touched. Apart from body parts exclusive to one gender such as the penis or clitoris, many of the erogenous zones are similar and contain lots of nerve endings. They suggested also that women experience more areas of greater arousal than men do.

=== Internal stimulation: excitation-transfer theory of sexual arousal ===
The [[excitation-transfer theory]] states that existing arousal in the body can be transformed into another type of arousal. For example, sometimes people can be sexually stimulated from residual arousal arising from something such as exercise, being transformed into another type of arousal such as sexual arousal. In one study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Cantor |first1=J. R. |last2=Bryant |first2=J. |last3=Zillmann |first3=D. |year=1975|title=Enhancement of experienced sexual arousal in response to erotic stimuli through misattribution of unrelated residual excitation.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joanne_Cantor/publication/21948123_Enhancement_of_Experienced_Sexual_Arousal_in_Response_to_Erotic_Stimuli_Through_Misattribution_of_Unrelated_Residual_Excitation/links/5431cbe00cf277d58e982d6f.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=32|pages=69–75|via=|doi=10.1037/h0076784}}&lt;/ref&gt; participants performed some physical exercise and at different stages of recovery had to watch an erotic film and rate how aroused it made them feel. They found that participants who were still experiencing excitatory residues from the exercise rated the film as more arousing than those who had fully recovered from the exercise. This suggests that the remaining arousal from the exercise was being transformed into sexual arousal without any external stimulation.

== Alternative routes ==
The human sexual response is a dynamic combination of cognitive, emotional, and physiological processes. Whilst the most common forms of sexual stimulation discussed are [[Sexual fantasy|fantasy]] or physical stimulation of the genitals and other erogenous areas, sexual arousal may also be mediated through alternative routes such as visual, olfactory and auditory means.

=== Visual ===
Perhaps the most researched non-tactile form of sexual stimulation is visual sexual stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnow | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Desmond | first2 = J.

Although seen socio-historically as an unacceptable form of '[[Paraphilia|sexual deviation]]', it highlights the human tendency to find sexual stimulation through purely visual routes. The multibillion-dollar industry that is [[pornography]] is yet another example. A common presumption in society and the media is that men respond more strongly to visual sexual stimuli than do women. This is perhaps best exemplified by the [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] hypothesis that men are more prone to sexual arousal from visual stimulation than women&lt;ref&gt;Kinsey, A. C., Pomeroy, W. B., Martin, C. E., &amp; Sloan, S. (1948). [[Sexual behavior in the human male]].&lt;/ref&gt; and, arguably, can be seen depicted through the "male glaze"&lt;ref&gt;Mulvey, L. (1989). [http://theslideprojector.com/pdffiles/art6/visualpleasureandnarrativecinema.pdf Visual pleasure and narrative cinema]. In ''Visual and other pleasures'' (pp. 14-26). Palgrave Macmillan UK.&lt;/ref&gt; that dominates the pornography industry. Nonetheless, both sexes can be sexually aroused through visual stimulation. In one study, visual stimulation was tested by means of an erotic video. Although significantly higher in the male group, sexual arousal was the main emotional reaction reported by both sexes. Their physiological responses to the video also showed characteristics of sexual arousal, such as increased urinary excretions of [[Epinephrine|adrenaline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levi | first1 = L | year = 1969 | title = Sympatho-adrenomedullary activity, diuresis, and emotional reactions during visual sexual stimulation in human females and males | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.564.5354&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 251–268 | doi=10.1097/00006842-196905000-00005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study investigating male arousal showed that men were able to achieve rigid [[erection]]s through visual stimulation of an erotic film alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = B. | last2 = Sikka | first2 = S.

Studies that use visual stimulation as a means for sexual stimulation find that sexual arousal is predominantly correlated with an activation in [[Limbic system|limbic]] and [[Paralimbic cortex|paralimbic]] cortex and in [[Cerebral cortex|subcortical]] structures, along with a deactivation in several parts of the [[Temporal cortex|temporal]] cortex. These same areas are activated during physical sexual stimulation highlighting how powerful visual stimulation can be as a means of [[sexual arousal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holstege | first1 = G. | last2 = Georgiadis | first2 = J.

=== Olfactory and evolutionary ===
Olfactory information is critical to human sexual behavior. One study investigating olfactory sexual stimulation found that men experience sexual arousal in response to a female perfume. Individuals rated odourant stimulation and perceived sexual arousal. They also had [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] scans taken during the experiment. The results showed that olfactory stimulation with women's perfume produces activation of specific brain areas associated with sexual arousal in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huh | first1 = J. | last2 = Park | first2 = K. | last3 = Hwang | first3 = I. S. | last4 = Jung | first4 = S. I. | last5 = Kim | first5 = H. J. | last6 = Chung | first6 = T. W. | last7 = Jeong | first7 = G. W. | year = 2008 | title = Brain activation areas of sexual arousal with olfactory stimulation in men: A preliminary study using functional MRI | url = http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)31972-X/fulltext | journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 619–625 | doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00717.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary analysis of sex differences in reproductive strategies can help explain the importance of smell in sexual arousal due to its link to immunological profile and offspring viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rikowski | first1 = A. | last2 = Grammer | first2 = K. | year = 1999 | title = Human body odour, symmetry and attractiveness | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences | volume = 266 | issue = | pages = 869–874 | doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0717| pmc = 1689917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because olfactory cues may be able to trigger an [[incest]] avoidance mechanism by reflecting parts of an individual's genetic equipment. In one study, males rated visual and olfactory information as being equally important for selecting a lover, while females considered olfactory information to be the single most important variable in [[mate choice]]. Additionally, when considering sexual activity, females singled out [[Body odor|body odour]] from all other sensory experiences as most able to negatively affect desire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Herz | first1 = R. S. | last2 = Cahill | first2 = E. D. | year = 1997 | title = Differential use of sensory information in sexual behavior as a function of gender | url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rachel_Herz/publication/225106584_Differential_use_of_sensory_information_in_sexual_behavior_as_a_function_of_sex/links/56e01e2608ae979addf0e501.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Human Nature | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 275–286 | doi=10.1007/bf02912495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditory ===
Auditory stimulants may also serve to intensify sexual arousal and the experience of pleasure. Making sounds during sexual arousal and sexual activity is widespread among primates and humans. These include sighs, moans, strong expirations and inspirations, increased breathing rate and occasionally, at orgasm, screams of ecstasy. Many of these sounds are highly exciting to men and women, and act as strong reinforcers of sexual arousal, creating a powerful positive feedback effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = R. J. | year = 1992 | title = The mechanisms of human female sexual arousal | url = | journal = Annual Review of Sex Research | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 1–48 | doi=10.1080/10532528.1992.10559874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Female copulatory vocalizations|copulatory vocalisations]] are likely to serve mutual sexual stimulation for mating partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W.

Even when not coupled with "touching", sounds can be highly sexually arousing. Commercial erotic material (mainly produced for the male market) uses such sounds extensively. As early as the 1920s and 30s, several genres of singers turned to "low moans" for erotic effect. [[Vaudeville]] Jazz singers often incorporated sex sounds into the narrative of the lyrics. Even contemporary music such as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "Orgasm" or [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[You Sure Love to Ball]]" includes sounds of the female orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Corbett | first1 = J. | last2 = Kapsalis | first2 = T. | year = 1996 | title =  Aural Sex: The Female Orgasm in Popular Sound| url = | journal =  TDR (1988-)| volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 102–111 | doi=10.2307/1146553}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown music to be an auditory sexual stimulant. In one mood induction study, exposure to certain music resulted in significantly greater [[penile tumescence]] and subjective sexual arousal for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = W.

H. | year = 1998 | title = Effects of positive and negative mood on sexual arousal in sexually functional males | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 197–207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar experiment, women did not show significant physiological responses to certain types of music but did reported higher levels of sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laan | first1 = E. | last2 = Everaerd | first2 = W. | last3 = Van Berlo | first3 = R. | last4 = Rijs | first4 = L. | year = 1995 | title = Mood and sexual arousal in women | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 441–443 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(94)00059-s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies have looked at the connection between auditory stimulation and the experience of sexual pleasure. Whilst the highest levels of physiological and subjective arousal were found for visual stimuli, spoken-text was found to elicit sexual arousal in men implicating sounds a means for sexual stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Julien | first1 = E. | last2 = Over | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Male sexual arousal across five modes of erotic stimulation | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 131–143 | doi=10.1007/bf01542663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental stimulation ==
Sexual arousal includes feelings, attractions and desires, as well as physiological changes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;LeVay, S., &amp; Valente, S. M. (2006). ''Human sexuality'' (2nd ed.). Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; These can be elicited not only by physical but also mental stimulations, such as [[Sexual fantasy|fantasy]], erotic literature, dreams, role-play, and imagination.

]]

=== Fantasy  ===
[[Sexual fantasy]] is a form of mental sexual stimulation which many people engage in.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is where a person imagines a sexual experience while they are awake. Fantasy has less social or safety limits than in real life situations. It gives people more freedom to experiment or think of things they could not necessarily try in real life and can be anything from imagining your spouse naked, to imagining a sexual experience with a mythical creature. Common sexual fantasies include imagining activities with a loved partner, reliving past experiences and experiences with multiple partners of the opposite gender.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It's also common to have fantasies about things you would not do in real life and about taboo or illegal activities, such as forcing another, or being forced to have sex, intercourse with a stranger and sex with a boy or girl or older partner.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leitenberg | first1 = H. | last2 = Henning | first2 = K. | year = 1995 | title = Sexual fantasy | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 469–496 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful for research because it makes differences between male and female heterosexual preferences clearer than studies of behaviour. Many sexual fantasies are shared between men and women, possibly because of cultural influence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, there are still gender differences that have been found. Men are more likely than women to imagine being in a dominant or active role, whereas women are more likely to imagine themselves as passive participants.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women's fantasies have significantly more affection and commitment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kelley | first1 = K | year = 1984 | title = Sexual fantasy and attitudes as functions of sex of subject and content of erotica | url = | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 339–347 | doi=10.2190/j66d-n10e-lth5-8aw5}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas men are more likely to fantasise using visual imagery and explicit detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barclay | first1 = A. M. | year = 1973 | title = Sexual fantasies in men and women | url = | journal = Medical Aspects of Human Sexuality | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 205–216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardin | first1 = K. | last2 = Gold | first2 = S. | year = 1988 | title = Relationship of sex, sex guilt, and experience to written sexual fantasies | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2190/YQQJ-7A8U-23LE-59KJ | journal = Imagination, Cognition, and Personality | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 155–163 | doi=10.2190/yqqj-7a8u-23le-59kj}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation of this difference comes from the [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary perspective]]. Women have a higher minimum parental investment than males (they have 9 months of gestation prior birth and are then the main care givers, whereas men only have to provide sperm to ensure their genes are passed on) and are therefore more likely to want commitment from their partner in order to gain resources to improve their offspring's chance of survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = B. | last2 = Symons | first2 = D. | year = 1990 | title = Sex Differences in Sexual Fantasy: An Evolutionary Psychological Approach | url = | journal = The Journal of Sex Research | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 527–555 | doi=10.1080/00224499009551579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasies can have benefits, such as increasing arousal more than other forms of sexual stimuli (such as an [[Erotic literature|erotic story]]) and increasing [[sexual desire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goldey | first1 = K. L. | last2 = van Anders | first2 = S. M. | year = 2012 | title = Sexual arousal and desire: Interrelations and responses to three modalities of sexual stimuli | url = http://www.jsm.jsexmed.org/article/S1743-6095(15)34099-6/fulltext | journal = Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 2315–2329 | doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02845.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who disclose their sexual fantasies to their partners also have a higher sexual satisfaction. However, whether people are willing to open up to their partner generally depends on the content of such fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, M. (2012). ''[https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/bitstream/handle/1808/9806/Anderson_ku_0099D_11825_DATA_1.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Sexual communication in romantic relationships: An investigation into the disclosure of sexual fantasies]'' (Order No. AAI3489846).&lt;/ref&gt; A more negative effect of sexual fantasy is that it has been linked with [[sexual crimes]], and indeed sexual offenders often report that they have had fantasies related to their offense.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, such fantasies are also common among those who have not been involved in such criminal acts&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and non-offenders do not use their fantasies to guide their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Howitt | first1 = D | year = 2004 | title = What is the role of fantasy in sex offending? | url = | journal = Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 182–188 | doi=10.1002/cbm.585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, fantasy alone cannot be used as a sign that someone will become an offender.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Dreams ===
Nocturnal orgasms, or "[[Nocturnal emission|wet dreams]]" are when men ejaculate during sleep. These occur during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM (rapid eye movement)]] phases of sleep,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; which is the main stage when humans dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suzuki | first1 = H. | last2 = Kuga | first2 = R. | last3 = Uchiyama | first3 = M. | year = 2002 | title = Relationship between dream experience and sleep state under ultra-short sleep-wake schedule | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jjppp1983/20/1/20_19/_pdf | journal = Japanese Journal of Physiological Psychology and Psychophysiology | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 19–28 | doi=10.5674/jjppp1983.20.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that [[Erotic Dream|erotic dreams]] alone are enough to stimulate men, however erections accompany all REM phases.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to self-report data, as many as 22% of young women may also experience [[orgasm]] during sleep, with such dreams being more common in college students in higher school years than younger students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henton | first1 = C. L. | year = 1976 | title = Nocturnal orgasm in college woman: Its relation to dreams and anxiety associated with sexual factors | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 129 | issue = | page = 245 | doi=10.1080/00221325.1976.10534034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orgasms experienced were positively correlated with high emotionality, including [[Sexual arousal|sexual excitement]], but also [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Sexual role-play ===
[[Sexual roleplay|Sexual role-play]] is when people act out characters or scenarios which may sexually stimulate each other. This can include [[Sexual fantasy|fantasies]] (discussed above) and [[Sexual fetishism|fetishes]], such as [[BDSM]] (bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, sadism and masochism) or [[Ageplay|age-play]]. It has been described by some as an adult form of [[Live action role-playing game|L.A.R.P]] (live action role-play).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harviainen | first1 = J. T. | year = 2011 | title = Sadomasochist role-playing as live-action role-playing: a trait-descriptive analysis | url = http://www.ijrp.subcultures.nl/wp-content/issue2/IJRPissue2-Article5.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Journal of Role-Playing | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 59–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Role-play can also be carried out online, by typing stories to each other or pretending to be a character, and is therefore a form of mental stimulation you can engage in with another person without them being physically present. Many adolescents find online role-play pleasurable and arousing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nielsen | first1 = S. | last2 = Paasonen | first2 = S. | last3 = Spisak | first3 = S. | year = 2015 | title = 'Pervy role-play and such': Girls' experiences of sexual messaging online | url = | journal = Sex Education | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 472–485 | doi=10.1080/14681811.2015.1048852}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Role-play can also include sexual [[Fan fiction|fanfiction]], where characters from well-known stories, that were not sexually or romantically together in the original story, are written into sexual scenes. [[Slash fiction]] is a type of fan fiction where the characters of the same sex (originally male-male) engage in romantic or sexual activities. Slash fiction allows people the freedom to share stimulating things that can be counter-cultural. However, there may still be [[copyright]] or [[Obscenity|obscenity laws]] if posted onto a public forum or published.&lt;ref&gt;Kustritz, A. M. (2008). Productive (cyber) public space: Slash fan fiction's multiple imaginary (Order No. AAI3276215). Available From PsycINFO. (621716546; 2008-99030-157).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sociology of art''' is a subfield of [[sociology]] concerned with the social worlds of [[art]] and [[aesthetics]].

Studying the sociology of art throughout history is the study of the [[social history of art]], how various societies contributed to the appearance of certain artists.

In her 1970 book ''Meaning and Expression: Toward a Sociology of Art'', Hanna Deinhard gives these defining features of a sociology of art: "The point of departure of the sociology of art is the question: How is it possible that works of art, which always originate as products of human activity ''within'' a particular time and society and ''for'' a particular time, society, or function -- even though they are not necessarily produced as 'works of art' -- can live beyond their time and seem expressive and meaningful in completely different epochs and societies? On the other hand, how can the age and society that produced them be recognized in the works?&lt;ref name="M&amp;E" /&gt;"

'''Software studies''' is an emerging [[interdisciplinary]] research field, which studies [[software systems]] and their social and cultural effects.

==Overview==
The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as [[cyberculture]], [[Internet studies]], [[new media studies]], and [[digital culture]], yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study.

Software studies is an interdisciplinary field. To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the [[digital humanities]] and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.

==History==
The conceptual origins of software studies include [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in [[Friedrich Kittler]]'s essay, "Es gibt keine Software,"&lt;ref name="Kittler, 1993"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Reclam| pages = 225–242| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften| chapter = Es gibt keine Software| location = Leipzig| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = There is no software| work = CTheory.net| accessdate = 2013-01-19| date = 1995| url = http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Manovich]]'s ''Language of New Media'',&lt;ref name="Manovich, 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-13374-1 | pages = xxxix, 354| last = Manovich| first = Lev| title = The language of new media| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Fuller's ''Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software''.&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Autonomedia| isbn = 1-57027-139-9 | page = 165| last = Fuller| first = Matthew| title = Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and [[computer-aided design]] are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.

The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop Software Studies Workshop] Rotterdam 2006 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workshop.softwarestudies.com/ SoftWhere: Software Studies Workshop] San Diego 2008 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[MIT Press]] launched a ''Software Studies'' book series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fuller |first=Matthew |author2=Lev Manovich |author3=Noah Wardrip-Fruin |title=Software Studies - Series |work=MIT Press |accessdate=2013-01-18 |date=2010 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803154024/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's "Software Studies: a Lexicon"),&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Matthew | title = Software Studies: a lexicon | year = 2008 | publisher = The MIT Press | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061342/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archivedate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-262-06274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic program was launched, ([[Lev Manovich]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] and [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Software Studies Initiative" at U. California San Diego).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.softwarestudies.com/ Software Studies Initiative @ UCSD] official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established ''Computational Culture'', an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for "inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/calendar/?id=4870|title=Computational Culture: Double Book Launch and Launch of Computational Culture, a journal of software studies|work=Goldsmiths|date=December 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the [[digital humanities]] that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective.  Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code.  Notably related are [[critical code studies]], which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program,&lt;ref&gt;http://criticalcodestudies.com/wordpress&lt;/ref&gt; and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bogost | first = Ian |author2=Nick Montfort  | title = Platform Studies, a book series published by MIT Press | work = Platform Studies | accessdate = 2013-01-18 | url = http://platformstudies.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew| title = Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide [paywalled]| journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2013-01-18| date = 2009-01-23| url = http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science-and/14806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7303">The '''Space Situational Awareness''' ('''SSA''') '''Programme''' is the [[European Space Agency]]'s initiative designed to support [[Space policy of the European Union|Europe's independent space access and utilization]] through the timely and accurate information delivery regarding the space environment, and particularly hazards to both in orbit and ground infrastructure.&lt;ref name=ssa-about&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/About_SSA|title=About SSA|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSA programme is split into three main segments:&lt;ref name=ssa-overview&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/SSA_Programme_overview|title=SSA Programme overview|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Space Weather]] (SWE) segment: monitoring the [[Sun]], the [[solar wind]], and in Earth’s [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]] and [[thermosphere]], that can affect spaceborne and ground-based infrastructure or endanger human life or health
* [[Near-Earth Objects]] (NEO) segment: detecting natural objects, such as [[asteroids]] and [[comets]], which can potentially [[Impact event|impact Earth]]
* [[Space surveillance|Space Surveillance and Tracking]] (SST) segment: Tracking active and inactive [[satellite]]s and [[space debris]] (collectively these items are referred to as [[Resident Space Object | Resident Space Objects]] (RSOs)).

The SSA programme is being implemented as an optional ESA programme with financial participation by 14 Member States. The programme started in 2009 and its mandate was extended until 2019. The second phase of the programme received €46.5 million for the 2013-2016 period.&lt;ref name=ssa-overview /&gt;

==Space Weather Segment==
The main objective of the Space Weather Segment (SWE) is to detect and forecast of [[space weather]] events, avoid adverse effect on European space assets and ground-based infrastructure. To achieve that, the segment will focus on delivery of real-time space weather information, forecasts and warnings, supported by a data archive, applications and services. Assets currently available for the segment consist of multiple ground-based and spaceborne sensors monitoring the Sun, [[solar wind]] and Earth's [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]] and [[thermosphere]]. These include the [[PROBA2]] satellite and the [[Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory]]. The segment is jointly coordinated by the SWE Data Centre located at the [[ESTRACK]] [[Redu Station]] and the SSA Space Weather Coordination Centre (SSCC), both in [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=swe&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Space_Weather_-_SWE_Segment|title=SWE Segment|access-date=2015-05-03|publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Near-Earth Object Segment==
The [[near-Earth object]] segment aims to deliver monitoring and warning of potential [[Impact event|Earth impactors]] and tracking of newly discovered objects. The segment's current assets consist of a mixture of professional and amateur telescopes, including the [[OGS Telescope]], that are supported by tracking databases. The plans are to create a fully integrated system supporting alerts for civil authorities. The segment is operated by the SSA NEO Coordination Centre located at the [[ESA Centre for Earth Observation]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=neo&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Near-Earth_Objects_-_NEO_Segment |title=NEO Segment| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Space Surveillance and Tracking Segment==
The SST segment's primary goal is the detection, cataloguing and orbit prediction of objects orbiting the Earth. It is part of an effort to avoid collisions between orbiting satellites and debris, provide safe reentries, detect on-orbit explosions, assist missions at launch, deployment and end-of-life and overall reduce cost of space access. The segment currently relies on existing European radar and optical systems. Some of its assets are existing [[radio telescope|radio]] and [[optical telescopes]], with now serving a secondary role for tracking space debris.&lt;ref name=sst&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Situational_Awareness/Space_Surveillance_and_Tracking_-_SST_Segment| title=SST Segment| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The radar-based SST assets are split into two categories: surveillance and tracking systems. SSA SST radar systems include:&lt;ref name=sst-radars&gt;{{cite web|url = https://sst.ssa.esa.int/cwbi/general/radar_sens.xhtml| title=Europe’s Radar Space Surveillance and Tracking Sensors| access-date=2015-05-03| publisher=ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Surveillance

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4590">The '''Sussex Manifesto''' was a report on science and technology for development written at the request of the [[United Nations]] and published in 1970.

== History ==

In the late 1960s the United Nations asked for recommendations on science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/science/psd/un_unesco.pdf The rise and fall of S&amp;T on the UN agenda - 60 years of UN and UNESCO, Professor Dr Klaus-Heinrich Standke   Science and Public Policy,  November 2006  ]&lt;/ref&gt; from a team of academics at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS) and [[SPRU]] [[Science and Technology Policy Research]] (formerly called [[Science Policy Research Unit]]) at the [[University of Sussex]], UK.  This team became known as the Sussex Group and their report, ''Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade'', became known as the ''Sussex Manifesto''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Sussex-Manifesto-IDS-Reprint.pdf The Sussex Manifesto: Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' was intended as the introductory chapter to the ''UN World Plan of Action on Science and Technology for Development''. But the solutions presented in the Manifesto were deemed too radical to be used for that purpose.  It was instead published in 1970 as an annex in ''Science and Technology for Development: Proposals for the Second United Nations Development Decade'', a UN report by the Advisory Committee on the Application of Science and Technology to Development (ACAST).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0192-5121(1982)3%3A3%3C343%3ASATITN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K ACAST and the introduction of science and technology into the UN system]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' helped raise awareness of science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://sss.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/3/385.pdf  Science, Technology and Development: Part of a course in Development Studies for first and second year engineering and medical students at the University of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, David Wield and Carol Barker, Social Studies of Science 1978; 8; 385]&lt;/ref&gt; in UN circles &lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=134280&amp;set=487E2528_2_7&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNESCO’s contribution to Stage 2 of the World Plan of Action for the Application of Science and Technology to Development; science and technology policies and institutions],&lt;/ref&gt; influenced the design of development institutions and was used for teaching courses in both North and South universities.

The Sussex Group were [[Hans Singer]] (Chairman), Charles Cooper (Secretary), R.C. Desai, [[Christopher Freeman]], Oscar Gish, Stephen Hill and Geoffrey Oldham.

== Today ==

In 2008 one of the authors of the original report Professor Geoff Oldham gave a seminar &lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/event/steps-new-manifesto-seminar-geoff-oldham/ Professor Oldham's STEPS Seminar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/news/news-at-ids-the-sussex-manifesto IDS News]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[STEPS Centre]] – a research centre and policy engagement based at IDS and SPRU. Following this event the STEPS Centre decided to create a new manifesto in association its partners around the world and Professor Oldham. The new publication, ''Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/wp-content/uploads/steps-manifesto_small-file.pdf Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2010, forty years after the original.

The New Manifesto has also been translated into Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/publications/manifesto-translated-into-chinese-french-portuguese-and-spanish/ New Manifesto: translated versions]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The STEPS Centre is funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8053">'''Textual scholarship''' (or '''textual studies''') is an [[umbrella term]] for disciplines that deal with describing, transcribing, editing or annotating [[text (literary theory)|text]]s and physical [[document]]s. 

==Overview==
Textual research is mainly historically oriented. Textual [[scholar]]s study, for instance, how writing practices and printing technology has developed, how a certain writer has written and revised his or her texts, how literary documents have been edited, the history of reading culture, as well as censorship and the authenticity of texts. The subjects, methods and theoretical backgrounds of textual research vary widely, but what they have in common is an interest in the genesis and derivation of texts and textual variation in these practices.

There are many ways to think if you are a textual scholar, some are interested in what the author is trying to intend or there are those who seek to see how the text is transmitted. Textual scholars produce their own editions of what they discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textualscholarship.org/|title=Textual Scholarship|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disciplines of textual scholarship include, among others, [[textual criticism]], [[stemmatology]], [[paleography]], [[genetic editing|genetic criticism]] (critique génétique), [[bibliography]] and [[history of the book]]. Textual scholar [[David Greetham (textual scholar)|David Greetham]] has described textual scholarship as a term encompassing "the procedures of enumerative bibliographers, descriptive, analytical, and historical bibliographers, paleographers and codicologists, textual editors, and annotators-cumulatively and collectively".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greetham|first1=David C.|title=Textual Scholarship: An Introduction|date=1992|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-8153-0058-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some disciplines of textual scholarship focus on certain material sources or text genres, such as [[epigraphy]], [[codicology]] and [[diplomatics]]. 

The historical roots of textual scholarship date back to the 3rd century BCE, when the scholarly activities of copying, comparing, describing and archiving texts became professionalized in the [[Library of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;Greetham, David C.:  ''Textual Scholarship.

[[File:Lamps - Plate08.jpg|thumb|right|Plate VIII - Window from the [[Ca' Foscari]], Venice. Ruskin was one of the first critics to employ photography to aid the accuracy of his illustrations.]]
'''''The Seven Lamps of Architecture''''' is an extended essay, first published in May 1849 and written by the English art critic and theorist [[John Ruskin]]. The 'lamps' of the title are Ruskin's principles of architecture, which he later enlarged upon in the three-volume ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;His introduction to the second edition (1855) characterises ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'' not as a "complete exponent" of his matured views but "rather as an introduction to the more considered and careful statements of those views given in ''The Stones of Venice'', and in my Lectures&lt;!--Lectures in original--&gt; delivered at Edinburgh."&lt;/ref&gt; To an extent, they codified some of the contemporary thinking behind the [[Gothic Revival]]. At the time of its publication [[A. W. N. Pugin]] and others had already advanced the ideas of the Revival and it was well under way in practice. Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarise the thoughts of the movement. ''The Seven Lamps'' also proved a great popular success, and received the approval of the [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiologists]] typified by the [[Cambridge Camden Society]], who criticised in their publication ''[[The Ecclesiologist]]'' lapses committed by modern architects in ecclesiastical commissions.

==The 'Lamps'==
The essay was published in book form in May 1849 and is structured with eight chapters; an introduction and one chapter for each of the seven 'Lamps',&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p.424&lt;/ref&gt; which represent the demands that good architecture must meet, expressed as directions in which the [[association of ideas]] may take the observer:&lt;ref&gt;These directions are represented in graphic form in Cornelis J. Baljon, "Interpreting Ruskin: The Argument of ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'' and ''The Stones of Venice''", ''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'', '''55'''.4 (Autumn 1997:401–14)  p. 402. Baljon's article is the most extensive review of the interplay of philosophy and [[Empiricism|empirical observation]] in  ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture''.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Sacrifice – dedication of man's craft to God, as visible proofs of man's love and obedience
#Truth – handcrafted and honest display of materials and structure. Truth to materials and honest display of construction were bywords since the serious Gothic Revival had distanced itself from the whimsical "[[Gothick]]" of the 18th century; it had been often elaborated by Pugin and others.
#Power – buildings should be thought of in terms of their massing and reach towards the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublimity]] of nature by the action of the human mind upon them and the organization of physical effort in constructing buildings.
#Beauty – aspiration towards God expressed in ornamentation drawn from nature, his creation
#Life – buildings should be made by human hands, so that the joy of masons and stonecarvers is associated with the expressive freedom given them
#Memory – buildings should respect the culture from which they have developed
#Obedience – no originality for its own sake, but conforming to the finest among existing English values, in  particular expressed through the "English Early Decorated" Gothic as the safest choice of style.

Writing  within the essentially British tradition of the [[Association of Ideas|associational values]] that inform [[aesthetics|aesthetic appreciation]], Ruskin argued from a moral stance with polemic tone, that the technical innovations of architecture since the [[Renaissance]] and particularly the [[Industrial Revolution]], had subsumed its spiritual content and sapped its vitality. He also argued that no new style was needed to redress this problem, as the appropriate styles already existed. The 'truest' architecture was therefore, the older [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] of medieval cathedrals and Venice. The essay sketched out the principles which Ruskin later expounded upon in the three-volume ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'' published between 1851 and 1853. Practically, he suggested an 'honest' architecture with no veneers, finishes, hidden support nor machined mouldings and that beauty must be derived from nature and crafted by man.&lt;ref name="Curl668"&gt;Curl, p.668&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin drew upon [[Archibald Alison (author)|Archibald Alison]]'s ''Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste'' (1790–1810)&lt;ref&gt;Alison as a source is noted by Baljon 1997:403.&lt;/ref&gt; for some of his principles, such as the requirement of leisured poise as the best state for appreciating beauty, the thought that the natural countryside is more conducive to producing an artist than the city, that the glory of architecture lies in its age. ''The Seven Lamps'' was reduced to the status of a "moral gloss on Alison" by George L. Hersey, in ''High Victorian Gothic''.&lt;ref&gt;Hersey, ''High Victorian Gothic'' (Johns Hopkins Press) 1972:24, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had an abiding confidence in the natural, untutored instinct for rightness and beauty in the average person: "all men have sense of what is right in this matter, if they would only use and apply this sense; every man knows where and how beauty gives him pleasure, if he would only ask for it when he does so, and not allow it to be forced upon him when he does not want it."&lt;ref name="Ruskin"&gt;Ruskin, "The Lamp of Beauty".&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the thread of [[modernism]] that holds that people must be ''taught to appreciate'' good design. Another contrast with modernism is in the aesthetic of functionality: Ruskin saw no beauty in well-designed tools: beauty is out of place where there is not serene leisure, or "if you thrust it into the places of toil. Put it in the drawing-room, not into the workshop; put it on domestic furniture, not upon tools of handicraft." For Ruskin, Beauty was not an inherent characteristic but a thing that could be applied to an object or withheld from it.&lt;ref name="Ruskin"/&gt;

==Ruskin's choice of examples==
[[File:Paldoges v1 082005.jpg|thumb|right|Polychrome brickwork and sculptural decoration in the [[Doge's Palace, Venice]]]]
Though Ruskin expressly disavowed any attempt to present an essay in the course of European architecture, he noted that "The reader will perhaps be surprised by the small number of buildings to which reference has been made."&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, Preface to the First Edition, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; His nine pencil drawings that illustrate the principles he examines are all Tuscan and Venetian Romanesque and Gothic and northern French Gothic examples&lt;ref&gt;There is also a moulding from [[Salisbury Cathedral]], plate X.&lt;/ref&gt; and the example in his text range to the north of England, following his experience and affection, avoiding the "impure schools" of Spain and of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, Preface to the First Edition, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the second edition (1855), Ruskin had fixed his exemplars more certainly:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I have now no doubt that the only style proper for modern northern work, is the Northern Gothic of the thirteenth century, as exemplified, in England, pre-eminently by the cathedrals of [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and [[Wells Cathedral|Wells]], and, in France, by those of [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Paris]], [[Amiens Cathedral|Amiens]], [[Chartres Cathedral|Chartres]], [[Reims Cathedral|Rheims]]&lt;!--Rheims in original--&gt;, and [[Bourges Cathedral|Bourges]], and by the transepts of that of [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The importance of authentic detail to Ruskin is exemplified in the [[daguerreotype]]s from which he made drawings of details too high to see clearly,&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, Preface to the First Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and his urgent plea to amateur photographers in the Preface to the Second Edition, which presages the formative role that photography of architectural details was to play during the next decades, not only in Gothic Revival buildings:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...while a photograph of landscape is merely an amusing toy, one of early architecture is a precious historical document ; and that this architecture should be taken, not merely when it presents itself under picturesque general forms, but stone by stone, and sculpture by sculpture."&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, Preface to the Second Edition, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Chester Town Hall.jpg|thumb|Polychromy in Ruskinian Gothic: [[Chester Town Hall]], 1863–69 [[William Henry Lynn]], architect]]

==Gothic Revival==
By 1849, [[A. W. N. Pugin]] and others had already advanced the ideas of the [[Gothic Revival]] and its popularity was secured.&lt;ref&gt;The competition to rebuild the [[Houses of Parliament]] had been won in 1836 by Gothic designs of [[Charles Barry]] assisted in every detail by Pugin; Pugin's masterpiece, the interior of the [[House of Lords]], was completed in 1847&lt;/ref&gt; Ruskin offered little new to the debate, but the book helped to capture and summarise the thoughts of the movement, proved a great popular success, and received the approval of ''The [[Cambridge Camden Society#The Ecclesiologist|ecclesiologists]]'', the influential newsletter of architectural criticism published by the [[Cambridge Camden Society]].&lt;ref name="Curl668"/&gt; Effects such as the [[polychromy]] of High Victorian Gothic architecture may be traced to him, in a genre of "Ruskinian Gothic" that was practised in Britain and colonies like New Zealand and Canada, and in Anglophile strata of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Eve Blau, ''Ruskinian Gothic'' (Princeton University Press) 1982; an American Ruskinian is discussed in  Sarah Bradford Landau, ''P.B. Wight: Architect, Contractor, and Critic 1838–1925'', (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago) 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:All Saints Margaret Street interior.jpg|thumb|right|[[All Saints, Margaret Street]] by Beresford-Hope and Butterfield was immediately influenced by Ruskin's essay, particularly in its structural use of brick, rather than for surface decoration]]
Ruskin had made his debut as a critic of architecture with ''The Poetry of Architecture'' (1839), an essay in the [[picturesque]] that he later rejected,&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dougherty analyzed ''The Poetry of Architecture'' and set it in its philosophical context in the [[history of ideas]] in "A Study of ''The Poetry of Architecture''", in ''Studies in Ruskin'', R. Rhodes and D.I. Janik, eds, (Ohio University Press) 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Seven Lamps'' were still tentative steps for Ruskin's architectural criticism and offered a moral creed for architects. He later went on to disclaim the essay as a 'wretched rant'.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p.424, quoting Ruskin from Kenneth Clarke (1982) ''Ruskin Today'' Penguin edition, London. p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first effect of the book was almost immediate in the influence it had upon [[William Butterfield]]'s [[All Saints, Margaret Street]] Church. Politician [[Alexander Beresford Hope]] and architect Butterfield had agreed upon the general details just a month after Ruskin's book was published and by August they had revised their plans to encapsulate the principles it espoused. All Saints is considered the first Ruskinian building due to its use of brick 'honestly' employed as a structural system rather than for surface decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, p.425&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruskin's writings became a significant influence on [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] in the latter half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s expectations of a new, authentic American style had prepared the ground: Ruskin's ''Seven Lamps'' were quickly assimilated into the aesthetics of [[Transcendentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;The impact of Ruskin on the aesthetics or New England transcendentalists is examined in Barbara Novak, ''Nature and Culture: American Landscape and Painting, 1825–1875'' 3rd ed. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 [[Marcel Proust]] read a translation of Ruskin's chapter ''The Lamp of Memory'' in a Belgian magazine. He projected the transforming experience onto the narrator of ''Du côté de chez Swann'', who describes himself as a boy reading the piece in the garden at [[Combray]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Fraser, ''Proust and the Victorians'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Proust, who translated some works of Ruskin, claimed to know ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'' by heart.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia  J. Gamble''Proust as Interpreter of Ruskin: the Seven Lamps of Translation'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Seven Lamps of Architecture'' and other of Ruskin's writings on architecture are summarized and extensively quoted in John Unrau, ''Looking at Architecture with Ruskin'' (Toronto: University of Toronto), 1978.

==Gallery==
Writing in the preface to the first edition Ruskin remarks;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every apology is, however, due to the reader for the hasty and imperfect execution of the plates. Having much more serious work in hand, and desiring merely to render them illustrative of my meaning, I have sometimes very completely failed even of that humble aim; and the text, being generally written before the illustration was completed, sometimes naively describes as sublime or beautiful features which the plates represents by a blot. I shall be grateful if the reader will in such cases refer the expressions of praise to the Architecture, and not to the illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, Preface to the First Edition, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1956">'''Tonkunst''', literally "The Art of Tone", is an obsolete term in the German language applied for art music of the 19th century, and often used in music history and [[Aesthetics of music|musical aesthetic]] representations.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, William, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TRQMMHIW6NkC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=tonkunst+term&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a7nQT52sEIrRhAfxgunwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tonkunst%20term&amp;f=false The Musician As Entrepreneur, 1700-1914: Managers, Charlatans, and Idealists],'' p. 87, [[Indiana University Press]] (2004), {{ISBN|0253344565}}&lt;/ref&gt; It probably originated from the need to give the music a place among the classical arts like [[architecture]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], [[prose]] and [[poetry]], and also recognize the composer or musician as a creative individual. The term is found for example in the inscriptions of the [[Walhalla memorial]] built in 1842,&lt;ref&gt;Karnes, Kevin, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3dy1RLj-OjgC&amp;pg=PA176&amp;dq=tonkunst+term&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a7nQT52sEIrRhAfxgunwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tonkunst%20term&amp;f=false Music, Criticism, and the Challenge of History: Shaping Modern Musical Thought in Late Nineteenth-Century Vienna],'' p. 176, [[Oxford University Press]] (2008), {{ISBN|0195368665}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a good example is [[Joseph Haydn]], titled as "Doctor der Tonkunst" ("Doctor of Tone-Art"), and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as "Tondichter" ("Tone-poet"). Today the term is rarely used, but lives on, for example, in the name of the [[Tonkünstler Orchestra]].

Transparency is practiced in companies, organizations, administrations, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening government: A guide to best practice in transparency, accountability and civic engagement across the public sector|url=http://www.transparency-initiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Opening-Government3.pdf|website=Transparency Initiative|publisher=Transparency &amp; Accountability Initiative|accessdate=September 11, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218030712/http://www.transparency-initiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Opening-Government3.pdf|archivedate=February 18, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It guides an organization's decisions and policies on the disclosure of information to its employees and the public, or simply the intended recipient of the information.&lt;ref name='JOM'&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schnackenberg | first1 = Andrew K. | last2 = Tomlinson | first2 = Edward C. | title = Organizational transparency: a new perspective on managing trust in organization-stakeholder relationships | journal = [[Journal of Management]] | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0149206314525202 | date = March 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0149206314525202 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Published online before print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a cashier making change after a point of sale transaction by offering a record of the items purchased (e.g., a receipt) as well as counting out the customer's change on the counter demonstrates one type of transparency.

The term '''transparency''' has a very different meaning in Information Security where it is used to describe security mechanisms that are intentionally in-detectable or hidden from view.  Examples include hiding utilities and tools which the user does not need to know in order to do their job, like keeping the remote re-authentication operations of Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol hidden from the user. 

==Wages==
In Norway and in Sweden, tax authorities annually release the "skatteliste" or "tax list"; official records showing the annual income and overall wealth of nearly every taxpayer.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news |authorlink = |title = Norway Divided by Citizen Wealth Tables|date = October 23, 2009|publisher = |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/business/global/24tax.html?_r=2&amp;ref=global|work = The New York Times|pages = |accessdate = 22 November 2009|language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Spanish government for the first time released information on how much each cabinet member is worth, but data on ordinary citizens is private.

==Management==
[[File:Shimer College dialogue transparency 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Shimer College]] students demonstrate in favor of transparency in school administration, 2010]]
Recent research suggests there are three primary aspects of transparency relevant to management practice: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; To increase transparency, managers actively infuse greater disclosure, clarity, and accuracy into their communications with [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. For example, managers that voluntarily share information related to the firm's ecological impact with environmental activists are demonstrating disclosure; managers that limit the use of [[technical terminology]], [[fine print]], or complicated mathematical notations in their correspondence with suppliers and customers are demonstrating clarity; and managers that do not bias, embellish, or otherwise distort known facts in their communications with investors are demonstrating accuracy. The ''strategic'' management of transparency therefore involves intentional modifications in disclosure, clarity, and accuracy to accomplish the organization's specific objectives.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt;

Alternatively, [[radical transparency]] is a [[management]] method where nearly all decision making is carried out publicly. All draft documents, all arguments for and against a proposal, all final decisions, and the decision making process itself are made public and remain publicly archived. This approach has grown in popularity with the rise of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Marcia W. | last1= DiStaso | first2= Denise Sevick | last2= Bortree | title= Ethical practice of social media in public relations | page= 23 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 9781317917908 | year= 2014 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=MujpAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of organizations utilizing this style are the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community and [[Indymedia]].

[[Corporate transparency]], a form of [[radical transparency]], is the concept of removing all barriers to —and the facilitating of— free and easy public access to corporate information and the laws, rules, social [[connivance]] and processes that facilitate and protect those individuals and corporations that freely join, develop, and improve the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1= Bernardi | first1= Richard A. |last2= LaCross |first2= Catherine C. | title= Corporate transparency: code of ethics disclosures | url= http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2005/405/essentials/p34.htm | work= The CPA Journal | publisher= New York State Society of the Certified Public Accountants (CPA) | date= April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-governmental organizations===
Accountability and transparency are of high relevance for [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs). In view of their responsibilities to stakeholders, including donors, sponsors, programme beneficiaries, staff, states and the public, they are considered to be of even greater importance to them than to commercial undertakings.&lt;ref name="huidobro-p60"&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Maria | last1= Francesch-Huidobro | title= Governance, politics and the environment: a Singapore study | page= 60 | publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) | isbn = 9789812308313 | year= 2008 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=QrCqBmdZY5UC&amp;pg=PA60 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet these same values are often found to be lacking in NGOs.&lt;ref name="huidobro-p60"/&gt;

The ''[[INGO Accountability Charter|International NGO Accountability Charter]]'', linked to the [[Global Reporting Initiative]], documents the commitment of its members [[international NGO]]s to accountability and transparency, requiring them to submit an annual report, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Is GRI too much transparency for NGOs? | url = http://prizmablog.com/2011/03/27/is-gri-too-much-transparency-porn-for-ngos/ | publisher = PRIZMA | date = March 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Our accountability commitments: transparency | url = http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/home/our-accountability-commitments/transparency/ | publisher = INGO accountability charter | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150329081613/http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/home/our-accountability-commitments/transparency/ | archivedate = 2015-03-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signed in 2006 by 11 NGOs active in the area of humanitarian rights, the INGO Accountability Charter has been referred to as the “first global accountability charter for the non-profit sector”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Thompson | first = Andrew S. | contribution = Laying the groundwork: Considerations for a charter for a proposed global civi society forum | editor-last1 = Walker | editor-first1 = James W.

==Media==
{{Main|Media transparency}}
[[Media transparency]] is the concept of determining how and why [[information]] is conveyed through various means.

If the media and the public knows everything that happens in all authorities and county administrations there will be a lot of questions, protests and suggestions coming from media and the public. People who are interested in a certain issue will try to influence the decisions. Transparency creates an everyday participation in the political processes by media and the public. One tool used to increase everyday participation in political processes is [[freedom of information]] legislation and requests. Modern [[democracy]] builds on such participation of the people and media.

There are, for anybody who is interested, many ways to influence the decisions at all levels in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1= Moeller | first1= Susan D. | title= Openness &amp; accountability: a study of transparency in global media outlets | url= http://www.icmpa.umd.edu/pages/studies/transparency/main.html | work= Studies | publisher= International Center for Media and the Public Agenda (ICMPA) | display-authors= etal | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515174519/http://www.icmpa.umd.edu/pages/studies/transparency/main.html | archivedate= 2008-05-15 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Seal of Good Housekeeping plaque Santa Barbara Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|A 2011 [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] recognizing the municipality of [[Santa Barbara, Pangasinan]] for its "efforts in advancing the principles of [[accountability]] and transparency in [[local governance]]." ]]
The right and the means to examine the process of decision making is known as transparency.
In politics, transparency is used as a means of holding [[official|public officials]] [[accountability|accountable]] and fighting [[political corruption|corruption]]. When a [[government]]'s meetings are open to the [[Mass media|press]] and the public, its [[budgets]] may be reviewed by anyone, and its laws and decisions are open to discussion, it is seen as transparent. It is not clear however if this provides less opportunity for the authorities to abuse the system for their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Mattozzi | first1= Andrea | last2 = Merlo | first2 = Antonio | title = The transparency of politics and the quality of politicians | journal = [[American Economic Review]] | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | pages = 311–315 | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] | doi = 10.1257/aer.97.2.311 | date = May 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.97.2.311 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://people.hss.caltech.edu/~andrea/transparency.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

When military authorities [[classified information|classify]] their plans as secret, transparency is absent. This can be seen as either positive or negative; positive because it can increase [[national security]], negative because it can lead to corruption and, in extreme cases, a [[military dictatorship]].

While a [[liberal democracy]] can be a [[plutocracy]], where decisions are made behind locked doors and the people have fewer possibilities to influence politics between the elections, a [[participative democracy]] is more closely connected to the will of the people.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Participative democracy, built on transparency and everyday participation, has been used officially in northern [[Europe]] for decades. In the northern European [[country]] [[Sweden]], [[Constitution of Sweden#Public access to governmental documents|public access to government documents]] became a law as early as 1766. It has officially been adopted as an ideal to strive for by the rest of EU, leading to measures like [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]] and [[Lobby register|laws for lobby transparency]].

To promote transparency in [[politics]], [[Hans Peter Martin]], [[Paul van Buitenen]] ([[Europa Transparant]]) and [[Ashley Mote]] decided to cooperate under the name [[Platform for Transparency]] (PfT) in 2005. Similar organizations that promotes transparency are [[Transparency International]] and the [[Sunlight Foundation]].

A recent political movement to emerge in conjunction with the demands for transparency is the [[Pirate Party]], a label for a number of political parties across different countries who advocate freedom of information, direct democracy, network neutrality, and the free sharing of knowledge.

==Online culture==

21st century culture affords a higher level of public transparency than ever before, and actually requires it in many cases.  Modern technology and associated culture shifts have changed how government works (see [[WikiLeaks]]), what information people can find out about each other, and the ability of politicians to stay in office if they are involved in [[sex scandals]]. Due to the [[digital revolution]], people no longer have a high level of control over what is public information, leading to a tension between the values of transparency and [[privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Digital person: technology and privacy in the information age|page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0814798462|isbn=0814798462 |first=Daniel J. |last=Solove|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

[[research|Scholarly research]] in any [[scientific method|academic discipline]] may also be labeled as (partly) transparent (or [[open research]]) if some or all relevant aspects of the research are open in the sense of [[open source]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rocchini | first1 = Duccio | last2 = Neteler | first2 = Markus | title = Let the four freedoms paradigm apply to ecology | journal = [[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 310–311 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.009 | date = June 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.009 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[open data]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/engl_start.htm|title=Wissenschaftsrat: Home|work=wissenschaftsrat.de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417091550/http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/engl_start.htm|archivedate=2010-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby facilitating [[Recognition (sociology)|social recognition]] and [[accountability]] of the scholars who did the research and [[Reproducibility|replication]] by others interested in the matters addressed by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v3/n1/full/embor241.html|title=Transparent science| volume=3|doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kvf018|pages=9–11|journal=EMBO Reports|pmc=1083937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[mathematicians]] and scientists are critical of using closed source [[mathematical software]] such as [[Mathematica]] for [[mathematical proofs]], because these do not provide transparency, and thus are not verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Mathematica+and+free+software|title=Mathematica and free software|work=everything2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open-source software such as [[SageMath]] aims to solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news116173009.html|title=Free software brings affordability, transparency to mathematics|publisher=physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

In the computer software world, [[open source software]] concerns the creation of software, to which access to the underlying [[source code]] is freely available. This permits use, study, and modification without restriction.

In computer security, the debate is ongoing as to the relative merits of the [[Full disclosure (computer security)|full disclosure]] of security vulnerabilities, versus a [[Security through obscurity|security-by-obscurity]] approach.

There is a different (perhaps almost opposite) sense of [[Transparency (human–computer interaction)|transparency in human-computer interaction]], whereby a system after change adheres to its previous external interface as much as possible while changing its internal behaviour. That is, a change in a system is transparent to its users if the change is unnoticeable to them.

==Sports==

[[Sports]] has become a global business over the last century, and here, too, initiatives ranging from mandatory drug testing to the fighting of sports-related corruption are gaining ground based on the transparent activities in other domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencyinsport.org/|title=Transparency in Sport|work=transparencyinsport.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2011}}

==Criticism==

[[Sigmund Freud]] following [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] ("On Truth and Lie in a Nonmoral Sense") regularly argues that transparency is impossible because of the occluding function of the unconscious.

Among philosophical and literary works that have examined the idea of transparency are [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' or [[David Brin]]'s ''[[The Transparent Society]]''. 
The German philosopher and media theorist [[Byung-Chul Han]] in his 2012 work ''Transparenzgesellschaft'' sees transparency as a cultural norm created by neoliberal market forces, which he understands as the insatiable drive toward voluntary disclosure bordering on the pornographic. According to Han, the dictates of transparency enforce a totalitarian system of openness at the expense of other social values such as shame, secrecy, and trust. He was criticized for his concepts, as they would suggest corrupt politics and for referring to the anti-democratic Carl Schmitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klarheit schaffen|url=http://www.freitag.de/kultur/1223-klarheit-schaffen|work=der Freitag | language = German |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate= 3 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists have long explored ethnographically the relation between revealed and concealed knowledges, and have increasingly taken up the topic in relation to accountability, transparency and conspiracy theories and practices today.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, M. 2000.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20131111183729/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/worldwide/initiatives/global/nas/people/Academics/birchall/index.aspx Clare Birchall], Christina Gaarsten, Mikkel Flyverbom, and Mark Fenster among others, write in the vein of 'Critical Transparency Studies' which attempts to challenge particular orthodoxies concerning transparency. 
Birchall, assessed in an article "[...] whether the ascendance of transparency as an ideal limits political thinking, particularly for western socialists and radicals struggling to seize opportunities for change [...]". She argues that the promotion of 'datapreneurial' activity through open data initiatives outsources and interrupts the political contract between governed and government. She is concerned that the dominant model of governmental data-driven transparency produces neoliberal subjectivities that reduce the possibility of politics as an arena of dissent between real alternatives. She suggests that the radical Left might want to work with and reinvent secrecy as an alternative to neoliberal transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Birchall | first = Clare | title = Transparency interrupted: secrets of the left | journal = [[Theory, Culture &amp; Society]] | volume = 28 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 60–84 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0263276411423040 | date = December 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0263276411423040 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[University of Oxford]] and [[Warwick Business School]] found that transparency can also have significant unintended consequences in the field of medical care. McGivern&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://warwick.academia.edu/GerryMcGivern|title=Gerry  McGivern - University of Warwick - Academia.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fischer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer|title=Michael D Fischer - Australian Catholic University - Academia.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found 'media spectacles' and transparent regulation combined to create 'spectacular transparency' which some perverse effects on doctors' practice and increased defensive behaviour in doctors and their staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry |last2=Fischer|first2=Michael D. |title=Medical regulation, spectacular transparency and the blame business|journal=Journal of Health, Organization and Management |year=2010|volume=24|issue=6|pages=597–610 |pmid=21155435 |doi=10.1108/14777261011088683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry |last2=Fischer|first2=Michael D. |title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counselling|journal=[[Social Science &amp; Medicine]]|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a four-year organizational study, [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and [https://kcl.academia.edu/EwanFerlie Ferlie] found that transparency in the context of a clinical risk management can act perversely to undermine ethical behavior, leading to organizational crisis and even collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Michael D. | last2 = Ferlie | first2 = Ewan |title=Resisting hybridization between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=[[Accounting, Organizations and Society]] |date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002 |doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
