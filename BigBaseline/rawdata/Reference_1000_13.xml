[[File:Schriftprobe Latein 15 Jh.jpg|thumb|Example of [[Latin]] text with abbreviations]]

An '''abbreviation''' (from [[Latin]] ''brevis'', meaning ''short'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=brevis/breve, brevis M – Latin is Simple Online Dictionary|url=https://www.latin-is-simple.com/en/vocabulary/adjective/91/|website=www.latin-is-simple.com|accessdate=29 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a shortened form of a word or phrase.  It consists of a group of letters taken from the word or phrase. For example, the word ''abbreviation'' can itself be represented by the abbreviation ''abbr.'', ''abbrv.'', or ''abbrev.''

In strict analysis, abbreviations should not be confused with [[Contraction (grammar)|contractions]], [[crasis]], [[acronym]]s, or [[initialism]]s, with which they share some [[semantic]] and [[phonetic]] functions, though all four are connected by the term "abbreviation" in loose parlance.&lt;ref name=harts&gt;{{cite book|title=New Hart's Rules: The handbook of style for writers and editors|publisher=Oxford University Press, 2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uwGtj8i_vkC&amp;dq=New+Hart%27s+Rules&amp;q=acronyms+contractions+10.1#v=snippet&amp;q=acronyms%20contractions%2010.1&amp;f=false|isbn=0-19-861041-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p167}}An abbreviation is a shortening by any method; a contraction is a reduction of size by the drawing together of the parts. A contraction of a word is made by omitting certain letters or [[syllable]]s and bringing together the first and last letters or elements; an abbreviation may be made by omitting certain portions from the interior or by cutting off a part. A contraction is an abbreviation, but an abbreviation is not necessarily a contraction. Acronyms and initialisms are regarded as subsets of abbreviations (e.g. by the [[Council of Science Editors]]). They are abbreviations that consist of the initial letters or parts of words.

== History ==
{{See also|Scribal abbreviation}}

Abbreviations have a long history, created so that spelling out a whole word could be avoided. This might be done to save time and space, and also to provide secrecy. Shortened words were used and initial letters were commonly used to represent words in specific applications. In classical [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the reduction of words to single letters was common.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=HA9kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=abbreviations+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D2NaVIitA6vbsASp94DgAg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=abbreviations%20history&amp;f=false ''The British Cyclopaedia of the Arts, Sciences, History, Geography, Literature, Natural History, and Biography'', Wm. S. Orr and Company, 1838, p.5.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman inscriptions, "Words were commonly abbreviated by using the initial letter or letters of words, and most inscriptions have at least one abbreviation." However, "some could have more than one meaning, depending on their context. (For example, ''A'' can be an abbreviation for many words, such as ''ager'', ''amicus'', ''annus'', ''as'', ''Aulus'', ''Aurelius'', ''aurum'' and ''avus''.)"&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, L., [https://books.google.com/books?id=zGY1Sqjwf8kC&amp;dq=abbreviations++fashionable&amp;q=abbreviated+%22the+initial%22#v=snippet&amp;q=abbreviated%20%22the%20initial%22&amp;f=false ''Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome''], Infobase Publishing, 2004, p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbreviations in English were frequently used from its earliest days. Manuscripts of copies of the [[old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]'' used many abbreviations, for example ''7'' or ''&amp;'' for ''and'', and ''y'' for ''since'', so that "not much space is wasted".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=68EjAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=abbreviations+history&amp;q=abbreviations+beowulf#v=snippet&amp;q=abbreviations%20beowulf&amp;f=false Gelderen, E. v, ''A History of the English Language: Revised edition'', John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2014, Ch. 4 1.]&lt;/ref&gt; The standardisation of English in the 15th through 17th centuries included such a growth in the use of abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php Spelling Society : Shortcuts 1483–1660&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015214606/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j7/shortcuts.php |date=October 15, 2007 }} Doesn't work.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} At first, abbreviations were sometimes represented with various suspension signs, not only periods. For example, sequences like ‹er› were replaced with ‹ɔ›, as in ‹mastɔ› for ''master'' and ‹exacɔbate› for ''exacerbate''. While this may seem trivial, it was symptomatic of an attempt by people manually reproducing academic texts to reduce the copy time. An example from the Oxford University Register, 1503:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

{{quote|Mastɔ subwardenɔ y ɔmēde me to you. And wherɔ y wrot to you the last wyke that y trouyde itt good to differrɔ thelectionɔ ovɔ to quīdenaɔ tinitatis y have be thougħt me synɔ that itt woll be thenɔ a bowte mydsomɔ.}}

The [[Early Modern English]] period, between the 15th and 17th centuries, had abbreviations like ''y&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'' for ''Þ&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;'', used for the word ''the'': "hence, by later misunderstanding, Ye Olde Tea Shoppe."&lt;ref&gt;Lass, R., ''The Cambridge History of the English Language'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, Vol. 2, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the growth of [[philology|philological]] linguistic theory in academic Britain, abbreviating became very fashionable. The use of abbreviation for the names of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and his friend [[C. S. Lewis]], and other members of the [[Oxford]] literary group known as the [[Inklings]], are sometimes cited as symptomatic of this.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Likewise, a century earlier in [[Boston]], a fad of abbreviation started that swept the United States, with the globally popular term [[Okay|OK]] generally credited as a remnant of its influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |title=The Choctaw Expression 'Okeh' and the Americanism 'Okay' |publisher=Jim Fay |date=2007-09-13 |accessdate=2008-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224185657/http://www.illinoisprairie.info/chocokeh.htm |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html |title=What does "OK" stand for? |work=[[The Straight Dope]] |accessdate=2008-05-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512085453/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html| archivedate= 12 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the British greatly reduced the use of the [[full stop]] and other punctuation points after abbreviations in at least semi-formal writing, while the Americans more readily kept such use until more recently, and still maintain it more than Britons{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. The classic example, considered by their American counterparts quite curious, was the maintenance of the internal comma in a British organisation of secret agents called the "[[Special Operations, Executive]]"—"S.O., E"—which is not found in histories written after about 1960.

But before that, many Britons were more scrupulous at maintaining the French form. In French, the period only follows an abbreviation if the last letter in the abbreviation is ''not'' the last letter of its antecedent:  "M." is the abbreviation for "monsieur" while "Mme" is that for "madame". Like many other cross-[[English Channel|channel]] linguistic acquisitions, many Britons readily took this up and followed this rule themselves, while the Americans took a simpler rule and applied it rigorously.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Over the years, however, the lack of convention in some style guides has made it difficult to determine which two-word abbreviations should be abbreviated with periods and which should not. The U.S. media tend to use periods in two-word abbreviations like United States (U.S.), but not [[personal computer]] (PC) or television (TV). Many British publications have gradually done away with the use of periods in abbreviations.

Minimization of punctuation in typewritten material became economically desirable in the 1960s and 1970s for the many users of carbon-film [[IBM Selectric typewriter#Ribbons|ribbons]] since a period or comma consumed the same length of non-reusable expensive ribbon as did a capital letter.

Widespread use of electronic communication through mobile phones and the Internet during the 1990s allowed for a marked rise in colloquial abbreviation. This was due largely to increasing popularity of textual communication services such as instant- and text messaging. [[Short Message Service|SMS]], for instance, supports message lengths of 160 characters at most (using the [[GSM 03.38]] character set). This brevity gave rise to an informal abbreviation scheme sometimes called [[SMS language|Textese]], with which 10% or more of the words in a typical SMS message are abbreviated.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David. [[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8]]. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently Twitter, a popular [[social networking service]], began driving abbreviation use with 140 character message limits.

== Style conventions in English ==

In modern English, there are several conventions for abbreviations, and the choice may be confusing. The only rule universally accepted is that one should be ''consistent'', and to make this easier, publishers express their preferences in a [[style guide]]. Questions which arise include those in the following subsections.

=== Lowercase letters ===

If the original word was capitalized then the first letter of its abbreviation should retain the capital, for example Lev. for ''Leviticus''. When a word is abbreviated to more than a single letter and was originally spelled with lower case letters then there is no need for capitalization. However, when abbreviating a phrase where only the first letter of each word is taken, then all letters should be capitalized, as in YTD for ''year-to-date'', PCB for ''printed circuit board'' and FYI for ''for your information''. However, see the following section regarding abbreviations that have become common vocabulary: these are no longer written with capital letters.

=== Periods (full stops) and spaces ===
[[File:“To Penna. R.R. Station”.jpg|thumb|Sign in New York City subway, reading “Penna.” for Penn''sylvani''a, showing American style of including the period even for contractions.]]
A period (full stop) is often used to signify an abbreviation, but opinion is divided as to when and if this should happen.

According to [[Hart's Rules]], the traditional rule is that abbreviations (in the narrow sense that includes only words with the ending, and not the middle, dropped) terminate with a full stop, whereas contractions (in the sense of words missing a middle part) do not, but there are exceptions.&lt;ref name="harts"/&gt;{{rp|p167–170}} [[Fowler's Modern English Usage]] says full stops are used to mark both abbreviations and contractions, but recommends against this practice: advising them only for abbreviations and lower-case initialisms and not for upper-case initialisms and contractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pocket Fowler's Modern English Usage|edition=2nd|editor-first=Robert|editor-last=Allen|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2008|isbn=9780191727078|contribution=Full stop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[American English]], the period is usually included regardless of whether or not it is a contraction, e.g. ''Dr.'' or ''Mrs.''. In some cases, periods are optional, as in either ''US'' or ''U.S.'' for  ''United States'', ''EU'' or ''E.U.'' for ''European Union'', and ''UN'' or ''U.N.'' for ''United Nations''. There are some house styles, however—American ones included—that remove the periods from almost all abbreviations. For example:
* The U.S. [[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices]] advises that periods should not be used with abbreviations on road signs, except for cardinal directions as part of a destination name. (For example, ''"Northwest Blvd"'', ''"W. Jefferson"'', and ''"PED XING"'' all follow this recommendation.) 
* [[AMA Manual of Style|AMA style]], used in many [[medical journal]]s, uses no periods in abbreviations or acronyms, with almost no exceptions. Thus [[exempli gratia|eg]], [[id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[et al.]], [[Doctor (title)|Dr]], [[Mr.|Mr]], [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], [[intensive care unit|ICU]], and hundreds of others contain no periods. The only exceptions are "[[Numéro sign|No.]]" (to avoid the appearance of "[[yes and no|No]]"); initials within persons' names (such as "George R. Smith"); and "St." within persons' names when the person prefers it (such as "Emily R. St. Clair") (but not in city names such as ''St Louis''  or ''St Paul''). (AMA style also forgoes italic on terms long since naturalized into English from [[Latin]], [[New Latin]], other languages, or [[international scientific vocabulary|ISV]]; thus, no italic for [[exempli gratia|eg]], [[id est|ie]], [[wikt:versus|vs]], [[et al.]], [[in vivo]], [[in vitro]], or [[in situ]].)

Acronyms that were originally capitalized (with or without periods) but have since entered the vocabulary as generic words are no longer written with capital letters nor with any periods. Examples are [[sonar]], [[radar]], [[lidar]], [[laser]], [[SNAFU|snafu]], and [[Scuba set|scuba]].

Today, spaces are generally not used between single-letter abbreviations of words in the same phrase, so one almost never encounters "U.&amp;nbsp;S."

When an abbreviation appears at the end of a sentence, only one period is used: ''The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C''.

=== Plural forms ===

There is a question about how to pluralize abbreviations, particularly acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in "PC's". However, this style is not preferred by many style guides. For instance, Kate Turabian, writing about style in academic writings,&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;Turabian, K., ''A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations'', 7th Edition, subsection 20.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms "only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters". Turabian would therefore prefer "DVDs" and "URLs" and "Ph.D.'s", while the [[Modern Language Association]]&lt;ref name="MLA"&gt;Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, 7th Edition 2009, subsection 3.2.7.g&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly says, "do not use an apostrophe to form the plural of an abbreviation".  Also, the [[American Psychological Association]] specifically says,&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 5th Edition 2001, subsection 3.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association'', 6th Edition 2010, subsection 4.29&lt;/ref&gt; "without an apostrophe".

However, the 1999 style guide for ''[[The New York Times]]'' states that the addition of an apostrophe is necessary when pluralizing all abbreviations, preferring "PC's, TV's and VCR's".&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, AM., Connolly, WG., [https://books.google.com/books?ei=-y5aVHCTyLAEl5GB0AE&amp;id=RT5w0s7_op8C&amp;dq=new+york+times+style&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=plurals+abbreviations ''The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage''], Three Rivers Press, 1999, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following those who would generally omit the apostrophe, to form the plural of [[run batted in]], simply add an s to the end of RBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan|title=Garner's Modern American Usage|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford; New York|isbn=978-0-19-538275-4|page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*RBIs

For all other rules, see below:

To form the plural of an abbreviation, a number, or a capital letter used as a noun, simply add a lowercase ''s'' to the end. Apostrophes following decades and single letters are also common.
* A group of MPs
* The roaring 20s
* Mind your Ps and Qs

To indicate the plural of the abbreviation or symbol of a unit of measure, the same form is used as in the singular.
* 1&amp;nbsp;lb or 20&amp;nbsp;lb
* 1&amp;nbsp;ft or 16&amp;nbsp;ft
* 1 min or 45 min

When an abbreviation contains more than one full point, ''Hart's Rules'' recommends putting the ''s'' after the final one.
* Ph.D.s
* M.Phil.s
* the d.t.s
However, subject to any house style or consistency requirement, the same plurals may be rendered less formally as:
* PhDs
* MPhils
* the DTs. (This is the recommended form in the ''New Oxford Dictionary for Writers and Editors''.)

According to ''Hart's Rules'', an apostrophe may be used in rare cases where clarity calls for it, for example when letters or symbols are referred to as objects.
* The x's of the equation
* Dot the i's and cross the t's
However, the apostrophe can be dispensed with if the items are set in italics or quotes:
* The ''x''s of the equation
* Dot the 'i's and cross the 't's

In Latin, and continuing to the derivative forms in European languages as well as English, single-letter abbreviations had the plural being a doubling of the letter for note-taking. Most of these deal with writing and publishing. A few longer abbreviations use this as well.

=== Conventions followed by publications and newspapers ===

==== United States ====

Publications based in the U.S. tend to follow the style guides of ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' and the [[Associated Press]].{{Verify source|date=May 2008}} The U.S. Government follows a style guide published by the [[U.S. Government Printing Office]].  The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] sets the style for abbreviations of units.

==== United Kingdom ====

Many British publications follow some of these guidelines in abbreviation:
* For the sake of convenience, many British publications, including the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Guardian]]'', have completely done away with the use of full stops or periods in all abbreviations. These include:
** Social titles, e.g. Ms or Mr (though these would usually have not had full stops—see above) Capt, Prof, ''etc.;''
** Two-letter abbreviations for countries (''"US"'', not ''"U.S."'');
** Abbreviations beyond three letters (full caps for all except initialisms{{clarify|date=November 2015}});
** Words seldom abbreviated with lower case letters (''"PR"'', instead of ''"p.r."'', or ''"pr"'')
** Names (''"FW de Klerk"'', ''"GB Whiteley"'', ''"Park JS"'').  A notable exception is ''[[The Economist]]'' which writes ''"Mr F. W. de Klerk"''.
** Scientific units (see Measurement below).
* Acronyms are often referred to with only the first letter of the abbreviation capitalized. For instance, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] can be abbreviated as ''"Nato"'' or ''"NATO"'', and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] as ''"Sars"'' or ''"SARS"'' (compare with ''"[[laser]]"'' which has made the full transition to an English word and is rarely capitalised at all).
* Initialisms are always written in capitals; for example the ''"British Broadcasting Corporation"'' is abbreviated to ''"BBC"'', never ''"Bbc"''. An initialism is similar to acronym but is not pronounced as a word.
* When abbreviating scientific units, no space is added between the number and unit (&lt;nowiki&gt;100mph, 100m, 10cm, 10°C&lt;/nowiki&gt;). (This is contrary to the SI standard; see below.)

==== Miscellaneous and general rules ====

* A doubled letter appears in abbreviations of some Welsh names, as in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the double "l" is a separate sound: "Ll. George" for (British prime minister) [[David Lloyd George]].
* Some titles, such as "Reverend" and "Honourable", are spelt out when preceded by "the", rather than as "Rev." or "Hon." respectively.  This is true for most British publications, and some in the United States.
* A repeatedly used abbreviation should be spelt out for identification on its first occurrence in a written or spoken passage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 53. New York City: Macmillan Publishers, 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbreviations likely to be unfamiliar to many readers should be avoided.

== Measurement shorthand—symbol or abbreviation ==
[[File:PRC Expressway RoadSign Distances.jpg|thumb|200px|Road sign in China—"km" is a symbol, not an abbreviation, as it is not a contraction of a Chinese word]]

Writers often use shorthand to denote units of measure.  Such shorthand can be an abbreviation, such as "in" for "[[inch]]" or can be a symbol such as "km" for "[[kilometre]]/kilometer".

The shorthand "in" applies to English only—in [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] for example, the shorthand "dm" is used for the equivalent Afrikaans word "duim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| title = Woordeboek/Dictionary; Afrikaans-English / Engels-Afrikaans
| editor = Abel Coetzee
| publisher = Collins
| year = 1969
| oclc = 29232187
| location = Glasgow and Johannesburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since both "in" and "dm" are contractions of the same word, but in different languages, they are abbreviations. A symbol on the other hand, defined as "Mark or character taken as the conventional sign of some object or idea or process"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title = Oxford Concise Dictionary
|publisher = Oxford University Press
|year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; applies the appropriate shorthand by ''substitution'' rather than by ''contraction''. Since the shorthand for kilometre/kilometer (''[[:pt:Quilômetro|quilômetro]]'' in Portuguese or ''[[:el:Χιλιόμετρο|χιλιόμετρο]]'' in Greek) is "km" in both languages and the letter "k" does not appear in the expansion of either translation, "km" is a symbol as it is a substitution rather than a contraction. It is a [[logogram]] rather than an abbreviation.

In the [[International System of Units]] (SI) manual&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word "symbol" is used consistently to define the shorthand used to represent the various SI units of measure. The manual also [[International System of Units|defines the way in which units should be written]], the principal rules being:
*The conventions for upper and lower case letters must be observed—for example 1&amp;nbsp;MW (megawatts) is equal to 1,000,000,000&amp;nbsp;mW (milliwatts).
*No periods should be inserted between letters—for example "m.s" (which is an approximation of "m·s", which correctly uses [[middle dot]]) is the symbol for "metres multiplied by seconds", but "ms" is the symbol for milliseconds.
*No periods should follow the symbol unless the syntax of the sentence demands otherwise (for example a full stop at the end of a sentence).
*The singular and plural versions of the symbol are identical—not all languages use the letter "s" to denote a plural.

== Syllabic abbreviation ==
&lt;!--irony is this is linked from the MOS on how not to do it like this! - see [[MOS:CAPSACRS]]--&gt;
A syllabic abbreviation is usually formed from the initial syllables of several words, such as ''[[Interpol]]'' = '''''Inter'''national'' + '''''pol'''ice''. It is a variant of the acronym. Syllabic abbreviations are usually written using [[lower case]], sometimes starting with a [[capital letter]], and are always pronounced as words rather than letter by letter. Syllabic abbreviations should be distinguished from [[portmanteau]]s, which combine two words without necessarily taking whole syllables from each.

=== Usage ===

Syllabic abbreviations are not widely used in English. Some UK government ministries such as [[Ofcom]] ('''''Of'''fice of '''Com'''munications'') and [[Oftel]] ('''''Of'''fice of '''Tel'''ecommunications'') use this style.

New York City has various neighborhoods named by syllabic abbreviation, such as [[Tribeca]] ('''''Tri'''angle '''be'''low '''Ca'''nal Street'') and [[SoHo]] ('''''So'''uth of '''Ho'''uston Street''). This usage has spread into other American cities, giving [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]], San Francisco ('''''So'''uth of '''Ma'''rket'') and [[LoDo, Denver]] ('''''Lo'''wer '''Do'''wntown''), among others.

==== Languages other than English====

On the other hand, syllabic abbreviations prevailed both in Germany under the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and in the Soviet Union for naming the plethora of new bureaucratic organisations. For example, ''[[Gestapo]]'' stands for '''''Ge'''heime '''Sta'''ats-'''Po'''lizei'', or "secret state police". Similarly, Leninist organisations such as the ''[[Comintern]]'' (''Communist International'') and ''[[Komsomol]]'' ('''''Kom'''munisticheskii '''So'''yuz '''Mol'''odyozhi'', or "Communist youth union") used Russian language syllabic abbreviations. This has given syllabic abbreviations negative connotations in some countries,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} (as in Orwell's [[Newspeak]]), notwithstanding that such abbreviations were used in Germany even before the Nazis came to power, e.g., ''[[:de:Schupo|Schupo]]'' for ''Schutzpolizei'', and are still used, e.g. ''[[:de:Kripo|Kripo]]'' for ''[[:de:Kriminalpolizei|Kriminalpolizei]]''.

In the modern Russian language words like ''Minoborony'' (from '''Min'''isterstvo '''oborony''' — Ministry of Defence) and ''Minobrnauki'' (from '''Min'''isterstvo '''obr'''azovaniya i '''nauki''' — Ministry of Education and Science) are still commonly used.

Syllabic abbreviations were also typical for the [[German language]] used in the [[German Democratic Republic]], e.g. ''[[Stasi]]'' for '''''Sta'''ats'''si'''cherheit'' ("state security", the secret police) or ''Vopo'' for ''Volkspolizist'' ("people's policeman"). Other uses are in company or product names such as [[Aldi]], from the name of the founder, Theo '''Al'''brecht, and the German word '''''Di'''skont'' (discount) or [[Haribo]], from the name of the founder and the headquarters of the company, '''Ha'''ns '''Ri'''egl '''Bo'''nn.

Syllabic abbreviations are ''de rigueur'' in Spanish; examples abound in organization names such as [[Pemex]] for '''''Pe'''tróleos '''Mex'''icanos'' ("Mexican Petroleums") or Fonafifo for '''''Fo'''ndo '''Na'''cional de '''Fi'''nancimiento '''Fo'''restal'' (National Forestry Financing Fund).

East Asian languages whose writing systems use [[Chinese characters]] form abbreviations similarly by using key Chinese characters from a term or phrase.  For example, in Japanese the term for the [[United Nations]], ''kokusai rengō'' (国際連合) is often abbreviated to ''kokuren'' (国連). (Such abbreviations are called [[:ja:略語|ryakugo]] (略語) in Japanese; see also [[Japanese abbreviated and contracted words]]). The syllabic abbreviation is frequently used for universities: for instance, ''Běidà'' (北大) for ''Běijīng Dàxué'' (北京大学, [[Peking University]]) and ''Tōdai'' (東大) for ''Tōkyō daigaku'' (東京大学, [[University of Tokyo]]).  The English phrase "[[:wikt:gung ho|Gung ho]]" originated as a Chinese abbreviation.

==== Organizations ====
{{See also|Neologism}}

Partially syllabic abbreviations are preferred by the US Navy, as it increases readability amidst the large number of initialisms that would otherwise have to fit into the same acronyms. Hence ''[[DESRON]] 6'' is used (in the full capital form) to mean "Destroyer Squadron 6", while ''[[COMNAVAIRLANT]]'' would be "Commander, Naval Air Force (in the) Atlantic."

'''BRD''' ({{lang-de|'''&lt;u&gt;B&lt;/u&gt;undes&lt;u&gt;r&lt;/u&gt;epublik &lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;eutschland'''}}; English: Federal Republic of Germany); ({{Audio|De-Bundesrepublik Deutschland.ogg|listen|help=no}}) is an unofficial abbreviation commonly used between 1968 and 1990 by the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|communist regime]] of the [[German Democratic Republic]] (East Germany) to refer to the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], informally known at the time as [[West Germany]]. The East German regime previously used the term "[[German Federal Republic]]" to refer to its western counterpart.

Unlike the [[English language|English]] equivalent '''FRG''', which was used as an [[List of IOC country codes|IOC country code]] and a [[List of FIFA country codes|FIFA trigramme]], the use of ''BRD'' was strongly discouraged by the authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany itself, because it was considered to be a derogatory [[communist]] term.&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-40606777.html Wer BRD sagt, richtet Unheil an], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 25 September 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTThlFv55ksC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=R4upIEECw6&amp;dq=brd%20communist%20term%20east%20germany&amp;pg=PR11#v=onepage&amp;q=brd%20communist%20term%20east%20germany&amp;f=true ''Dialectics, Dogmas, and Dissent: Stories from East German Victims of Human Rights Abuse''], John Rodden, Penn State Press, 2010, page xi&lt;/ref&gt; The term was not banned by law, but its use was discouraged or forbidden in schools in Western Germany.&lt;ref name="schulrecht"&gt;[http://www.schulrecht-sh.de/texte/b/brd.htm Erlass der Schulbehörde Schleswig-Holstein], RdErl. vom 4. Oktober 1976 (NBl. KM. Schl.-H. S. 274)&lt;/ref&gt; After [[German reunification]], the country is usually referred to simply as Germany (''{{lang|de|Deutschland}}''), and hence the need for abbreviations is greatly diminished. The most widely used abbreviation for West Germany was its [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code "DE", which has remained the country code of reunified Germany.

==History==
[[File:Deutschland Besatzungszonen 1945.svg|thumb|upright|Allied occupation zones in post-war Germany: British (green), Soviet (red), American (orange), French (blue)]]

===Background===
The official name was and is ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' ("Federal Republic of Germany"). The name, even though in the beginning referring only to the republic established in the [[Trizone]], was to reflect a name for all of Germany, therefore it was particularly to include the term ''Deutschland'' ("Germany"). This corresponded to the spirit of the then West German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], allowing all [[States of Germany|states or ''Länder'']], then under Allied control, to join the new Federal Republic. In 1949 the original eleven states in the Trizone and [[West Berlin]] did so.&lt;ref&gt;The initial states were the following: [[South Baden|Baden (south)]], [[Bavaria]], [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], [[Hesse]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Württemberg-Baden]], and [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]]. The latter two and the first merged in [[Baden-Württemberg]] in 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; However the latter was prevented by Allied objection on account of the city being a quadripartite allied occupation area. The [[Saarland]] joined with effect from 1 January 1957, while the [[New states of Germany|"new states"]] of the East did so with effect from 3 October 1990, including reunited Berlin.

Therefore, the term Germany had an importance as part of the official name, which is reflected in the naming conventions which developed in the [[Cold War]]. Starting in June 1949 the abbreviation was sometimes used in the Federal Republic of Germany without any special connotations. The initialism ''BRD'' began to enter into such regular usage in West German scientific and ministerial circles, that it was added to the western edition of the German language dictionary [[Duden]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-8AqAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=duden+brd+1967&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=duden+brd''Deutschland - Ein Name im Wandel''], Helmut Berschin, Olzog, 1979, page 76&lt;/ref&gt; The German Democratic Republic at first used the name ''Westdeutschland'' or "West Germany" (abbreviated "WD") for the Federal Republic of Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rV8fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Westdeutschland+wd&amp;dq=Westdeutschland+wd&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjU__jHr8nKAhVE2RoKHfPfBG4Q6AEIRDAF ''Deutschland seit 1945: eine dokumentierte gesamtdeutsche Geschichte in der Zeit der Teilung''], Gerhart Binder, Seewald, 1969, page 600&lt;/ref&gt; but since the 1950s the East German government insisted on calling West Germany ''Deutsche Bundesrepublik'' or "German Federal Republic" (abbreviated "DBR"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_BLwAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=dbr+deutsche+bundesrepublik&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=dbr+ ''Dokumentation zur Deutschlandfrage''], Heinrich Siegler Siegler, 1971, page 46&lt;/ref&gt; because they also considered East Germany part of Germany, and thus would not permit the West German government to use the name "Germany".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ch3P_mZeDZ4C&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Deutsche%20Bundesrepublik%22&amp;f=false ''Der Vertrag von Versailles und seine Folgen für die Pfalz oder deutsche Sozialdemokraten verraten Deutschland''], Reinhard Welz Vermittler Verlag e.K., 2004, page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in East Germany===
This changed in 1968 with the [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|new constitution]] of the German Democratic Republic. The communists no longer strove for German reunification, and the name ''BRD'' was introduced as a [[propaganda]] counter-term to the term ''DDR'', trying to express the equality of the states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoqqs9l7ikC&amp;lpg=PA338&amp;dq=Deutschland%20%E2%80%93%20ein%20Name%20im%20Wandel.%20Die%20deutsche%20Frage%20im%20Spiegel%20der%20Sprache&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q=BRD&amp;f=false ''Bezeichnungen für "Deutschland" in der Zeit der "Wende": dargestellt an ausgewählten westdeutschen Printmedien''], Ute Röding-Lange Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1997, page 84&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the West would speak of the ''sogenannte DDR'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45935352.html Vom Sogenannten], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 21 October 1968, page 65&lt;/ref&gt; or "so-called 'DDR'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9gQMAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22so-called+%27DDR%27%22&amp;dq=%22so-called+%27DDR%27%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp-M_NkMnKAhXEPxoKHUj4BrIQ6AEIIDAA ''Facts about Germany: The Federal Republic of Germany''], 1959 - Germany (West), page 20&lt;/ref&gt; when it had to be belittled.

At that time, the initialism ''BRD'' had been adopted by ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'', the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]]'s daily newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nd-archiv.de/ausgabe/1970-12-08 ''Neues Deutschland'', 8 December 1970]&lt;/ref&gt; while East German official sources adopted that initialism as standard in 1973.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt;

The East German decision to abandon the idea of a single German nation was accompanied by omitting the terms ''Deutschland'' ("Germany") and ''deutsch'' ("German") in a number of terms, for example:
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L0827-207, München, XX. Olympiade, Eröffnungsfeier, DDR-Mannschaft.jpg|thumb|East German team at the opening ceremony of the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]]]

Hellmann Gunter Narr Verlag, 1992, page 813&lt;/ref&gt;
* The words of the national anthem, ''[[Auferstanden aus Ruinen]]'', which referred to ''Deutschland, einig Vaterland'' ("Germany, united fatherland") ceased to be sung&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sCKrYdBoYFgC&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;ots=1Y-Gnpd95H&amp;dq=auferstanden%20aus%20ruinen%20words&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=auferstanden%20aus%20ruinen%20words&amp;f=true ''The German Language in a Changing Europe''], Michael G.

* The state television service, [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]] became "Fernsehen der DDR" in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2QpDAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Fernsehen+der+DDR%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22Fernsehen+der+DDR%22+1972 ''Hörfunk und Fernsehen in der DDR: Funktion, Struktur u.

* The [[North German Plain]], covering the north of East and West Germany, appeared in East German atlases as ''Nördliches Tiefland der DDR'' (Northern Plain of the GDR).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-X1OAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=N%C3%B6rdliches+Tiefland+ddr&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=N%C3%B6rdliches+Tiefland++ ''Muttersprache''], 1989, page 158&lt;/ref&gt;
* The GDR sent a separate team to the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], at which its flag and anthem were used for the first time&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rc1RAQAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;ots=qmwb3hyF94&amp;dq=The%20GDR%20sent%20a%20separate%20team%20to%20the%201972%20Summer%20Olympics%2C%20at%20which%20its%20flag%20and%20anthem%20were%20used%20for%20the%20first%20time.&amp;pg=PA143#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20GDR%20sent%20a%20separate%20team%20to%20the%201972%20Summer%20Olympics,%20at%20which%20its%20flag%20and%20anthem%20were%20used%20for%20the%20first%20time.&amp;f=true ''Sport, Politics, and Communism''], James Riordan, Manchester University Press, 1991, page 143&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1959, the GDR had used an identical flag to that of the Federal Republic, before adopting a version with the [[National Emblem of East Germany|national emblem]] in the centre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aXGTIu5jJDEC&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=east%20germany%20emblem%201959&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q=east%20germany%20emblem%201959&amp;f=true ''Germany from Partition to Reunification''], Henry Ashby Turner, Yale University Press, 1992, page 83&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the ruling party's full name, ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' or "Socialist Unity Party of Germany" remained unchanged, as did that of its newspaper ''[[Neues Deutschland]]'' ("New Germany") .

[[File:DDR_international_vehicle_registration_oval.svg|thumb|upright|DDR international vehicle registration oval, used between 1974 and 1990.]]
Therefore,  using the abbreviation ''BRD'' fitted perfectly into the official East German policy of downplaying the concept of a united Germany. In 1974, the GDR had replaced the [[List of international vehicle registration codes|vehicle registration code]] ''D'', hitherto shared with the Federal Republic, for ''DDR'' and demanded that West Germany recognise the division by likewise accepting ''BRD''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41667247.html Kennzeichen BÄÄH], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' 12 August 1974&lt;/ref&gt; 
This was rejected by the West, where some motorists  displayed bumper stickers with the slogan ''BRD - Nein Danke!'' ("BRD? No Thanks!").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkI3mUhsrDQC&amp;lpg=PA320&amp;ots=l0RQx0j75Q&amp;dq=%22BRD%22%20nein%20Danke!&amp;pg=PA320#v=onepage&amp;q=%22BRD%22%20nein%20Danke!&amp;f=false ''Kontroverse Begriffe: Geschichte des öffentlichen Sprachgebrauchs in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland''], Georg Stötzel, Martin Wengeler
Walter de Gruyter, 1995, page 320&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in the West the initialism became even more objectionable and using it was often considered either unreflecting or even expressing naïve Communist sympathies.&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;
 
As a result, the initialism reached only occasional frequency in West German parlance. In order to be precise West Germans increasingly used the terms ''Bundesrepublik'' or ''Bundesgebiet'' ("Federal Republic", or "Federal Territory") to refer to the country and ''Bundesbürger'' ("Federal Citizen[s]") as to its citizens, with the pertaining adjective ''bundesdeutsch'' ([[Federal Germans|federally German]]).

===Opposition to use in West Germany===
To distance themselves from the term ''BRD'', until [[German reunification]], the [[Cabinet of Germany|government of the Federal Republic of Germany]] and media sometimes used the abbreviations ''BR Deutschland,''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7SQun-nAqJAC&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=BR%20Deutschland&amp;pg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q=BR%20Deutschland&amp;f=false ''Konfession und Wahlverhalten in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland''], Karl Schmitt, Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1989, page 307&lt;/ref&gt; ''BR-Dt.'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qgJeAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22BR+Dt.%22+deutschland&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22BR+Dt.%22+ ''Deutschland-Jahrbuch, Volume 2''], Klaus Mehnert, Heinrich Schulte

West Germany had always claimed to be ''the'' Germany, and did not like the comparison to ''DDR'', or two separate German states. This claim was also reflected in the [[Hallstein Doctrine]] determining its foreign and interior policy until the early 1970s. Named after [[Walter Hallstein]], State secretary at the [[Foreign Office (Germany)|Foreign Office]], this was a key doctrine in the foreign policy of West Germany after 1955, which prescribed that the Federal Republic of Germany would not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognised the GDR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/1989/sep/15/berlinwall.germany The Two Germanies: Rivals struggle for Germany's soul - As worries surface in Bonn about the influx from the East, there are anxieties across Europe about the likely economic and international effects], ''[[The Guardian]]', 15 September 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Although this changed after 1973, with the Federal Republic no longer asserting an [[exclusive mandate]] over the whole of Germany, West Germany only established ''de facto'' diplomatic relations with East Germany. Under the terms of the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]] in 1972, [[Bonn]] and [[East Berlin]] exchanged "permanent missions",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chronik-der-mauer.de/index.php/.../Start/Index/id/652004 History of the Berlin Wall]&lt;/ref&gt; headed by "permanent representatives",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0908/090859.html East-West German trade up 8 percent] ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', 8 September 1982&lt;/ref&gt; rather than ''de jure'' embassies headed by ambassadors. Similarly, relations with the GDR were not conducted through the Foreign Office, but through a separate [[Minister of Intra-German Relations|Federal Ministry for Intra-German Relations]], to which the East German mission was accredited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFK7RkdQG14C&amp;pg=PA107&amp;lpg=PA107&amp;dq=Ministry+of+Intra-German+Relations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TeP4ln6BSF&amp;sig=kapXyUfDiTZORzMuCqPzs9Rzm10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWtKGmxMvKAhUDwxQKHWR-AewQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;f=true ''Germany Divided: From the Wall to Reunification''], A. James McAdams
Princeton University Press, 1994, page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the Federal Minister of All-German Affairs (later Intra-German Relations)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bKt9BgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;ots=CdUG2w_KQz&amp;dq=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q=Ministry%20of%20Intra-German%20Relations&amp;f=false ''Detente in Europe: Real or Imaginary?''], Josef Korbel, Princeton University Press, 2015, page 191&lt;/ref&gt; issued the ''Directives for the appellation of Germany'' recommending that the use of ''BRD'' be avoided.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt; On 31 May 1974 the heads of the federal and state governments recommended that the full name should always be used in official publications. In November 1979 the federal government informed the [[Bundestag]] that the West German public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] agreed not to use the initialism.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605033550/https://www.bundestag.de/dokumente/analysen/2009/abkuerzung_brd.pdf Stefan Schmidt, "Die Diskussion um den Gebrauch der Abkürzung «BRD»", in: ''Aktueller Begriff'', Deutscher Bundestag – Wissenschaftliche Dienste (ed.)], No. 71/09 (4 September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the West German federal system, the states were generally responsible for school education, and by the 1970s, some of them had either already recommended omitting the initialism, or, in the case of [[Bavaria]], forbidden it.&lt;ref name="preute"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9KEttd2OaPAC&amp;lpg=PA122&amp;dq=abk%C3%BCrzung%20brd%20schule%20verboten&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q=abk%C3%BCrzung%20brd%20schule%20verboten&amp;f=false ''Rechts um--zum Abitur: der geistige Wandel an deutschen Oberschulen''], Michael Preute
Ch. Links Verlag, 1995, page 122&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a decree by the educational authorities in the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] of 4 October 1976 declared the term to be ''nicht wünschenswert'' or "undesirable".&lt;ref name="schulrecht" /&gt; The [[Kultusministerkonferenz|conference of all the states ministers for school education]] decided on 12 February 1981 to not print the initialism in books, maps, and atlases for schools.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt; with pupils being required to write ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' in full and use of the term being deemed an error.&lt;ref name="preute" /&gt; The different usages were so ingrained that one could [[Shibboleth|deduce]] a person's or source's political leaning from the name used for West Germany, with far-left movements in the country using ''BRD''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F4QnAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=brd+imperialismus&amp;dq=brd+imperialismus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt_7HTuMnKAhWKXRQKHdw9De4Q6AEIKjAB ''Kampf dem BRD-Imperialismus''], Liga gegen den Imperialismus, 1972, page 30&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]] found, this debate on the initialism had little influence on changing the West German parlance with the usage of the initialism - in any event limited - unaffected by the debate.&lt;ref name="Stefan Schmidt 2009"/&gt;

==Naming difficulties over Berlin and East Germany==
[[File:Occupied Berlin.svg|thumb|Map of divided Berlin, indicating by the broken line at Berlin's western border the territorial redeployment decided by the Allies.]]
A similar ideological question was the question whether to use "Berlin (West)" (the officially preferred name) or "West Berlin", and even whether to write "West Berlin" in [[German language|German]] as two hyphenated words - ''West-Berlin'' - or as one word - ''Westberlin''.&lt;ref name="Glaeser"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s7kGqJGbaI4C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22Berlin+(West)%22+westberlin+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic28LjsMbKAhVFvRoKHRFoCQwQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Berlin%20(West)%22%20westberlin%20name&amp;f=true ''Divided in Unity: Identity, Germany, and the Berlin Police''], Andreas Glaeser
University of Chicago Press, 2000, page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Westerners called the [[West Berlin|Western sectors]] "Berlin", unless further distinction was necessary. The West German Federal government initially called West Berlin ''Groß-Berlin'' or "Greater Berlin",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf Article 127 [Extension of law to the French zone and to Berlin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075359/https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}
Within one year after promulgation of this Basic Law the Federal Government, with the consent of the governments of the Länder concerned, may extend to the Länder of Baden, Greater Berlin, Rhineland-Palatinate and Württemberg Hohenzollern any law of the Administration of the Combined Economic Area, insofar as it remains in force as federal law under Article 124 or 125.]&lt;/ref&gt; but changed this "Berlin (West)", although it also used the hyphenated "West-Berlin". However, the East German government commonly referred to it as "Westberlin".&lt;ref name="Glaeser" /&gt; Starting from 31 May 1961, East Berlin was officially called ''Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR'' (Berlin, Capital of the GDR), replacing the formerly used term ''Democratic Berlin'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DhuQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA344&amp;dq=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;pg=PA344#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;f=false ''Architecture, Politics, and Identity in Divided Berlin''], Emily Pugh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014, page 344&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "Berlin", by East Germany, and "Berlin (Ost)" by the West German Federal government. Other names used by West German media included ''Ost-Berlin'' and ''Ostberlin'' (both meaning "East Berlin") as well as ''Ostsektor'' or "Eastern Sector".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FMmOAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Ostsektor%22&amp;dq=%22Ostsektor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif8MfN8sjKAhVJPRQKHXPQA_EQ6AEI3AEwGw ''Der Rechtsstatus des Landes Berlin''], Ernst Renatus Zivier, Berlin Verlag, 1974, page 53&lt;/ref&gt; These different naming conventions for the divided parts of Berlin, when followed by individuals, governments, or media, commonly indicated their political leanings, with the centre-right ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' using "Ost-Berlin" and the centre-left ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' using "Ostberlin".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoqqs9l7ikC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Ost+Berlin%22,+%22Ostberlin%22,+or+%22Ostsektor%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dUlLgVcMcg&amp;sig=yg5HL2-Z23u3emp_z7D_ikH9sc0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoo6r-yrbKAhWGwxQKHeiNBxIQ6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ost%20Berlin%22%2C%20%22Ostberlin%22%2C%20or%20%22Ostsektor%22&amp;f=true ''Bezeichnungen für "Deutschland" in der Zeit der "Wende": dargestellt an ausgewählten westdeutschen Printmedien''], Ute Röding-Lange Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1997, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;

The naming of the German Democratic Republic was also a controversial issue, West Germans at first preferring the names [[Middle Germany|''Mitteldeutschland'' ("Middle Germany")]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lv_GCXcA8IYC&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;ots=H0OlpCONF6&amp;dq=%22BRd%22%20mitteldeutschland&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q=mitteldeutschland&amp;f=false ''Die Agrarpolitik in Mitteldeutschland: und ihre Auswirkung auf Produktion und Verbrauch landwirtschaftlicher Erzeugnisse''], Edgar Tümmler, Konrad Merkel, Georg Blohm, Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany|''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' (Soviet Occupation Zone)]] abbreviated as ''SBZ''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s8uGOqBCek8C&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=sbz%20deutschland&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=sbz%20deutschland&amp;f=true ''Das Widerstandsrecht: Entwickelt anhand d. höchstrichterl.

==Similar naming difficulties==
[[File:Germany Slovakia Locator.png|thumb|Germany (green) Slovakia (orange)]]
In 1995, a disagreement arose between reunified Germany and newly independent [[Slovakia]], as Germany objected to the use of the [[Slovak language]] name ''Nemecká spolková republika'' (literally  "German Federal Republic") owing to its Cold War connotations, instead of ''Spolková republika Nemecko''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kas.de/wf/doc/kas_20393-544-2-30.pdf?100831124854 Proven Partnerships with Development Potential: Germany’s relations with the Czech Republic and Slovakia], Konrad Adenauer-Stiftung, September 2010, page 47&lt;/ref&gt; This was almost identical to the equivalent ''Spolková republika Německo'' in [[Czech language|Czech]], a language closely related to Slovak,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/encyklopedie_statu/evropa/nemecko/ Německo], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt; but the Slovak authorities claimed that "Federal Republic of Germany" could not be translated grammatically into Slovak.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/semantic-spat-pits-german-against-slovak/336090.html Semantic Spat Pits German Against Slovak], ''[[Moscow Times]]'', Tony Barber, 10 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Government of Slovakia|Slovak government]] had used it until the previous year, leading to suggestions in the Bratislava newspaper ''Narodna Obroda'' that they were using "German Federal Republic" to show their displeasure with German attitudes to the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/name-calling-upsets-the-federal-republic-1594837.html Name-calling upsets the Federal Republic], ''[[The Independent]]'', 4 August 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bible]] is a compilation of many [[books of the Bible|shorter books]] written at different times by a variety of authors, and later assembled into the [[biblical canon]]. Since the early 13th century, most copies and editions of the Bible present all but the shortest of these books with divisions into [[chapter (books)| chapters]], generally a page or so in length. Since the mid-16th century editors have further subdivided each chapter into verses - each consisting of a few short lines or sentences. Sometimes a sentence spans more than one verse, as in the case of {{bibleref2|Ephesians|2:8–9|9}}, and sometimes there is more than one sentence in a single verse, as in the case of {{bibleref2|Genesis|1:2|9}}.

As the chapter and verse divisions did not appear in the original texts, they form part of the [[paratext]] of the Bible.

The Jewish divisions of the Hebrew text differ at various points from those used by Christians.  For instance, in Jewish tradition, the ascriptions to many [[Psalms]] are regarded as independent verses or parts of the subsequent verses, making 116 more verses, whereas established Christian practice treats each Psalm ascription as independent and unnumbered.  Some chapter divisions also occur in different places, e.g. Hebrew Bibles have  {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|5:27–41|HE}} where Christian translations have {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|6:1–15|NIV}}.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==History==
[[File:Isaiah Wall.jpg|thumb|left|"...they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." ~ [[Isaiah 2:4]] KJV (Bible verse across the street from the [[United Nations Building]] in [[New York City]])]]

===Chapters===
Early manuscripts of the biblical texts did not contain the chapter and verse divisions in the numbered form familiar to modern readers.  In antiquity Hebrew texts were divided into paragraphs ([[parashot]]) that were identified by two letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. [[Pe (letter)|Peh פ]] indicated an "open" paragraph that began on a new line, while [[Samekh|Samekh ס]] indicated a "closed" paragraph that began on the same line after a small space.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Würthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; These two letters begin the Hebrew words open ('''''p'''atuach'') and closed ('''''s'''agoor''), and are, themselves, open פ and closed ס. The earliest known copies of the [[Book of Isaiah]] from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] used parashot divisions, although they differ slightly from the [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] divisions.&lt;ref name=Wurthwein-2&gt;Würthwein, ''The Text of the Old Testament'', n. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is different from the use of consecutive letters of the Hebrew alphabet to structure certain poetic compositions, known as [[acrostic]]s, such as several of the [[Psalms]] and most of the [[Book of Lamentations]].)

The [[Hebrew Bible]] was also divided into some larger sections.  In Israel the [[Torah]] (its first five books) were divided into 154 sections so that they could be read through aloud in weekly worship over the course of three years. In Babylonia it was divided into 53 or 54 sections ([[Parashat ha-Shavua]]) so it could be read through in one year.&lt;ref name=Wurthwein-2/&gt;  The [[New Testament]] was divided into topical sections known as ''kephalaia'' by the fourth century. [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] divided the gospels into parts that he listed in tables or ''canons''. Neither of these systems corresponds with modern chapter divisions.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt and Barbara Aland, ''The Text of the New Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans and Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1989), pp. 252 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  (See fuller discussions below.)

Chapter divisions, with titles, are also found in the 9th century Tours manuscript, Paris Bibliothèque Nationale MS Lat. 3, the so-called Bible of Rorigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanaregia.eu/en/manuscripts/paris-bibliotheque-nationale-france-mss-latin-3/en|title=Europeana Regia - Paris Bibliothèque nationale de France MSS Latin 3|first=Europeana Regia|last=Consortium|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop [[Stephen Langton#Chapters of the Bible|Stephen Langton]] and Cardinal [[Hugo de Sancto Caro]] developed different schemas for systematic division of the Bible in the early 13th century. It is the system of Archbishop Langton on which the modern chapter divisions are based.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07175a.htm Hebrew Bible] article in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger]], ''The early versions of the New Testament: Their origin, transmission and limitations'', Oxford University Press (1977), p.347.

While chapter divisions have become nearly universal, editions of the Bible have sometimes been published without them.  Such editions, which typically use thematic or literary criteria to divide the biblical books instead, include [[John Locke|John Locke's]] ''Paraphrase and Notes on the Epistles of St. Paul'' (1707),&lt;ref&gt;London: Awnsham and John Churchill, 1707&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell's]] ''The Sacred Writings'' (1826),&lt;ref&gt;1826; repr.

===Verses===
Since at least 916 the [[Tanakh]] has contained an extensive system of multiple levels of section, paragraph, and phrasal divisions that were indicated in [[Masoretic]] vocalization and [[cantillation|cantillation markings]].&lt;!-- page 75 --&gt; One of the most frequent of these was a special type of punctuation, the ''[[sof passuq]]'', symbol for a full stop or sentence break, resembling the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] (:) of English and Latin orthography. With the advent of the printing press and the translation of the [[Bible]] into English, Old Testament versifications were made that correspond predominantly with the existing Hebrew full stops, with a few isolated exceptions. Most attribute these to Rabbi [[Isaac Nathan ben Kalonymus]]'s work for the first Hebrew [[Bible concordance]] around 1440.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;Moore, G.F. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3259119 The Vulgate Chapters and Numbered Verses in the Hebrew Bible], pages 73–78 at [[JSTOR]]. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3259119?seq=3 page 75]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to divide New Testament chapters into verses was Italian Dominican biblical scholar [[Santi Pagnini]] (1470–1541), but his system was never widely adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bible: A History|author1=Miller, Stephen M. |author2=Huber, Robert V. |year=2004|publisher=Good Books|isbn=1-56148-414-8|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; His verse divisions in the New Testament were far longer than those known today.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tools.pitts.emory.edu/Printer/|title = Pitts Theology Library Exhibit on the Verses of the New Testament|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Estienne]] created an alternate numbering in his 1551 edition of the Greek New Testament&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblestudymagazine.com/interactive/chaptersverses/ "Chapters and Verses: Who Needs Them?,"] Christopher R. Smith, Bible Study Magazine (July–Aug 2009): 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; which was also used in his 1553 publication of the Bible in French. Estienne's system of division was widely adopted, and it is this system which is found in almost all modern Bibles. Estienne produced a 1555 Vulgate that is the first Bible to include the verse numbers integrated into the text. Before this work, they were printed in the margins.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The first English New Testament to use the verse divisions was a 1557 translation by [[William Whittingham]] (c. 1524–1579). The first Bible in English to use both chapters and verses was the [[Geneva Bible]] published shortly afterwards in 1560. These verse divisions soon gained acceptance as a standard way to notate verses, and have since been used in nearly all English Bibles and the vast majority of those in other languages.  (Nevertheless, some Bibles have removed the verse numbering, including the ones noted above that also removed chapter numbers; a recent example of an edition that removed only verses, not chapters, is [[The Message (Bible)|''The Message: The Bible in Contemporary Language'']] by [[Eugene H. Peterson]].)&lt;ref&gt;Colorado Springs: NavPress, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish tradition==
{{Main article|Tanakh#Chapters and verse numbers, book divisions}}
The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[Masoretic text]] of the Bible notes several different kinds of subdivisions within the biblical books:

===Verse endings===
{{Main article|Sof passuk}}
Most important are the verse endings. According to the [[Talmud]]ic tradition, the division of the text into verses is of ancient origin.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud, ''Nedarim'' 37b&lt;/ref&gt; In Masoretic versions of the Bible, the end of a verse is indicated by a small mark in its final word called a ''silluq'' (which means "stop"). Less formally, verse endings are usually also indicated by two horizontal dots following the word with a ''silluq''.

===Parashiyot===
{{main article|Parashah}}
The Masoretic textual tradition also contains section endings called ''[[Parashah|parashot]]'', which are usually indicated by a space within a line (a "closed" section) or a new line beginning (an "open" section). The division of the text reflected in the ''parashot'' is usually thematic. Unlike chapters, the ''parashot'' are not numbered, but some of them have special titles.

In early manuscripts (most importantly in [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]] Masoretic manuscripts, such as the [[Aleppo codex]]), an "open" section may also be represented by a blank line, and a "closed" section by a new line that is slightly indented (the preceding line may also not be full). These latter conventions are no longer used in Torah scrolls and printed [[Hebrew Bible]]s. In this system, the one rule differentiating "open" and "closed" sections is that "open" sections must ''always'' start at the beginning of a new line, while "closed" sections ''never'' start at the beginning of a new line.

===Sedarim===
Another division of the biblical books found in the Masoretic text is the division of the ''[[Seder (Bible)|sedarim]]''. This division is not thematic, but is almost entirely based upon the ''quantity'' of text. For the [[Torah]], this division reflects the triennial cycle of reading that was practiced by the Jews of the Land of Israel.

==Christian versions==
The Byzantines also introduced a concept roughly similar to chapter divisions, called ''kephalaia'' (singular ''kephalaion'', literally meaning ''heading'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetextofthegospels.com/2016/04/kephalaia-ancient-chapters-of-gospels.html |title=Kephalaia: The Ancient Chapters of the Gospels |last=Snapp | first=James |date=15 April 2016 |accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system, which was in place no later than the 5th century, is not identical to the present chapters. Unlike the modern chapters, which tend to be of roughly similar length, the distance from one ''kephalaion'' mark to the next varied greatly in length both within a book and from one book to the next.  For example, the [[Sermon on the Mount]], comprising three chapters in the modern system, has but one ''kephalaion'' mark, while the single modern chapter 8 of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] has several, one per miracle.  Moreover, there were far fewer ''kephalaia'' in the [[Gospel of John]] than in the [[Gospel of Mark]], even though the latter is the shorter text. In the manuscripts, the ''kephalaia'' with their numbers, their standard titles (''titloi'') and their page numbers would be listed at the beginning of each biblical book; in the book's main body, they would be marked only with arrow-shaped or asterisk-like symbols in the margin, not in the text itself.

The titles usually referred to the first event or the first theological point of the section only, and some ''kephalaia'' are manifestly incomplete if one stops reading at the point where the next ''kephalaion'' begins (for example, the combined accounts of the miracles of the [[Daughter of Jairus]] and of the [[Christ healing the bleeding woman|healing of the woman with a haemorrhage]]  gets two marked ''kephalaia'', one titled ''of the daughter of the synagogue ruler'' at the beginning when the ruler approaches Jesus and one titled ''of the woman with the flow of blood'' where the woman enters the picture – well before the ruler's daughter is healed and the storyline of the previous ''kephalaion'' is thus properly concluded). Thus the ''kephalaia'' marks are rather more like a system of bookmarks or links into a continuous text, helping a reader to quickly find one of several well-known episodes, than like a true system of chapter divisions.

Cardinal [[Hugh of St Cher|Hugo de Sancto Caro]] is often given credit for first dividing the [[Latin Vulgate]] into chapters in the real sense, but it is the arrangement of his contemporary and fellow cardinal [[Stephen Langton]] who in 1205 created the chapter divisions which are used today. They were then inserted into Greek manuscripts of the New Testament in the 16th century. [[Robert Estienne]] (Robert Stephanus) was the first to number the verses within each chapter, his verse numbers entering printed editions in 1551 (New Testament) and 1571 (Hebrew Bible).&lt;ref name = "Examiner"&gt;[http://www.theexaminer.org/history/chap6.htm The Examiner].&lt;/ref&gt;

The division of the Bible into chapters and verses has received criticism from some traditionalists and modern scholars. Critics state that the text is often divided in an incoherent way, or at inappropriate rhetorical points, and that it encourages citing passages out of context. Nevertheless, the chapter and verse numbers have become indispensable as technical references for Bible study.

Several modern publications of the Bible have eliminated numbering of chapters and verses. [[Biblica]] published such a version of the [[NIV]] in 2007 and 2011. In 2014, [[Crossway Books|Crossway]] published the [[ESV]] Reader's Bible and ''[[Bibliotheca (Bible)|Bibliotheca]]'' published a modified ASV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zylstra |first=Sarah Eekhof |title=Introducing the Bible! Now with Less! |journal=[[Christianity Today]] |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=23 August 2014 |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2014/july-web-only/bibliotheca-readers-bible.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects such as Icthus&lt;ref name="Icthus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icthusapp.com|title=Icthus|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also exist which strip chapter and verse numbers from existing translations.

=={{anchor|Statistics}}Protestant Bible statistics==
The number of words can vary depending upon aspects such as whether the Hebrew alphabet in Psalm 119, the superscriptions listed in some of the Psalms, and the subscripts traditionally found at the end of the Pauline epistles, are included.
Except where stated, the following apply to the [[King James Version]] of the Bible in its modern 66-book Protestant form including the New Testament and the [[protocanonical]] Old Testament, not the [[deuterocanonical books]].

===Chapters===
* There are 929 chapters in the [[Old Testament]].
** 187 chapters in the Pentateuch
** 249 chapters in the Historical books
** 243 chapters in the Poetic books ("Wisdom")
** 183 chapters in the Major prophets
** 67 chapters in the Minor prophets
* There are 260 chapters in the [[New Testament]]. 
** 89 chapters in the Gospels
** 28 chapters in Acts
** 87 chapters in the Pauline Epistles (excluding Hebrews)
** 34 chapters in the General Epistles (including Hebrews)
** 22 chapters in Revelation
* This gives a total of 1,189 chapters (on average, 18 per book).
* Psalm 117, the shortest chapter, is also the middle chapter of the Bible, being the 595th Chapter.&lt;ref name=midbible&gt;[http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/midbible.html The Center of the Bible] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050828035123/http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/midbible.html |date=August 28, 2005 }} at BreakTheChain.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleverse||Psalm|119|ESV}} is the longest chapter of the Bible.
* Five books are a single chapter: Obadiah, Philemon, 2 &amp; 3 John, Jude. In many printed editions, the chapter number is omitted for these books, and references just use the verse numbers.

===Verses===
* There are 23,145 verses in the Old Testament and 7,957 verses in the New Testament. This gives a total of 31,102 verses,&lt;ref name="blueletterbiblebooks"&gt;[https://www.blueletterbible.org/study/misc/66books.cfm Study Resources: The Books of the Bible] at BlueLetterBible.org&lt;/ref&gt; which is an average of a little more than 26 verses per chapter.
* Contrary to popular belief, Psalm 118 does not contain the middle verse of the Bible. The King James Version has an even number of verses (31,102), with the two middle verses being {{bibleverse||Psalm|103:1–2|KJV}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblebelievers.com/believers-org/kjv-stats.html King James Bible Statistics] at BibleBelievers.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleref|John|11:35|NASB}} ("[[Jesus wept]]") is the shortest verse in most English translations. Some translations — including the New International Version, New Living Translation, New Life Version, Holman Christian Standard Bible and New International Reader's Version — render {{bibleverse||Job|3:2|HE}} as "He said". However, that is a translators' condensation of the Hebrew which literally translated is: "And Job answered and said."
&lt;!-- non English stats --&gt;
* The shortest verse in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Greek New Testament]] is {{bibleverse||Luke|20:30|NASB}} ("και ο δευτερος", "And the second") with twelve letters, according to the [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]] text. In the [[Textus Receptus]], the shortest verse is {{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:16|NASB}} ("παντοτε χαιρετε", "Rejoice always") with fourteen letters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=5585 First Thessalonians 5:12–28], [[John Walvoord]] at Bible.org&lt;/ref&gt; since [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus]]' rendering of Luke 20:30 includes some additional words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/LXX_WH-IGNT-KJV/Luke%2020:30 Luke 20:30 και ο δευτερος – and the second] with interlinear Greek-English and KJV&lt;br&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2020:30&amp;version=TR1550;WHNU Luke 20:30], in the 1550 [[Robert Estienne|Stephanus]] New Testament and the 1881 [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott-Hort]] New Testament.&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleref|Isaiah|10:8|ESV}} ("''Dicet enim''") is the shortest verse in the Latin [[Vulgate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinvulgate.com/verse.aspx?t=0&amp;b=27&amp;c=10 Isaias 10] at LatinVulgate.com&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{bibleverse||Esther|8:9|ESV}} is the longest verse in the Masoretic Text. The discovery of several manuscripts at [[Qumran]] (in the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]) has reopened what is considered the most original text of 1 Samuel 11; if one believes that those manuscripts better preserve the text, several verses in 1 Samuel 11 surpass Esther 8:9 in length.

A '''citation''' is a [[reference]] to a [[Publishing|published]] or unpublished source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/citation|title=Definition of CITATION|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of [[microattribution]].

Citations have several important purposes: to uphold [[intellectual honesty]] (or avoiding [[plagiarism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What Does it Mean to Cite?| publisher=MIT Academic Integrity|url=https://integrity.mit.edu/handbook/citing-your-sources/avoiding-plagiarism-cite-your-source}}&lt;/ref&gt; to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Legal Writing Directors &amp; Darby Dickerson, ''ALWD Citation Manual: A Professional System of Citation,'' 4th ed.(New York: Aspen, 2010), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As Roark and Emerson have argued, citations relate to the way authors perceive the substance of their work, their position in the academic system, and the moral equivalency of their place, substance, and words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Signals |ssrn=2688685 |date=2015-11-10 |location=Rochester, N.Y. |first=Marc Lane |last=Roark |first2=Warren |last2=Emerson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these attributes, many drawbacks and shortcoming of citation practices have been reported, including for example honorary citations, circumstantial citations, discriminatory citations, selective and arbitrary citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moustafa|first=Khaled|date=2016|year=|title=Aberration of the Citation|journal=Accountability in Research|volume=23|issue=4|pages=230–244|doi=10.1080/08989621.2015.1127763|issn=1545-5815|pmid=26636372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lc.unsw.edu.au/onlib/refbib.html |title=Oxford Referencing System |accessdate=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard, MLA, [[American Sociological Association]] (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.

Bibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgement by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.

== Concept ==
A '''bibliographic citation''' is a reference to a [[book]], [[article (publishing)|article]], [[web page]], or other published item. Citations should supply detail to identify the item uniquely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |title=Library glossary |accessdate=2009-02-27 |date=August 22, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Benedictine University]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430220849/http://www.ben.edu/library/help/glossary.htm |archivedate=April 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different citation systems and styles are used in [[scientific citation]], [[legal citation]], [[prior art]], [[the arts]], and the [[humanities]].

== Content ==
Citation content can vary depending on the type of source and may include:
*''Book:'' author(s), book title, place of publication, publisher, date of publication, and page number(s) if appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/workbook/evaluate.htm#citing |title=Anatomy of a Citation |work=LIU.edu |accessdate=2015-09-28 |ref=refLongIslandUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Journal:'' author(s), article title, journal title, date of publication, and page number(s).
*''Newspaper:'' author(s), article title, name of newspaper, section title and page number(s) if desired, date of publication.
*''Web site:'' author(s), article and publication title where appropriate, as well as a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]], and a date when the site was accessed.
*''Play:'' inline citations offer part, scene, and line numbers, the latter separated by periods: 4.452 refers to scene 4, line 452. For example, "In Eugene Onegin, Onegin rejects Tanya when she is free to be his, and only decides he wants her when she is already married" (Pushkin 4.452–53).&lt;ref name=Brigham&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |title=How to cite sources in the body of your paper |work=BYUI.edu |year=2008 |accessdate=2008-02-08 |ref=refBrigham |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113174823/http://www.byui.edu/english/mlaguide/MLA_intext_citation.htm |archivedate=November 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Poem:'' spaced [[Slash (punctuation)#In English text|slashes]] are normally used to indicate separate lines of a poem, and [[Parenthetical referencing|parenthetical citations]] usually include the line number(s). For example: "For I must love because I live&amp;nbsp;/ And life in me is what you give." (Brennan, lines 15–16).&lt;ref name=Brigham/&gt;
*''Interview:'' name of interviewer, interview descriptor (ex. personal interview) and date of interview.

=== Unique identifiers ===
Along with information such as author(s), date of publication, title and page numbers, citations may also include [[unique identifier]]s depending on the type of work being referred to.
* Citations of books may include an [[International Standard Book Number]] (ISBN).
* Specific volumes, articles or other identifiable parts of a periodical, may have an associated [[Serial Item and Contribution Identifier]] (SICI) or an [[International Standard Serial Number]] (ISSN).
* Electronic documents may have a [[digital object identifier]] (DOI).
* Biomedical research articles may have a PubMed Identifier ([[PMID]]).

== Systems ==
Broadly speaking, there are two types of citation systems, the Vancouver system and parenthetical referencing.&lt;ref name="Neville2012"&gt;Neville, C. (2012). Referencing: Principles, practices and problems. In RGUHS Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Vol 2:2. pp. 1-8&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE) adds a third, the'' citation-name system''.&lt;ref name="council2006scientific"&gt;Council of Science Editors, Style Manual Committee (2007). Scientific style and format: the CSE manual for authors, editors, and publishers.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vancouver system ===
{{main|Vancouver system}}
The Vancouver system uses sequential numbers in the text, either bracketed or superscript or both.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt; The numbers refer to either footnotes (notes at the end of the page) or endnotes (notes on a page at the end of the paper) that provide source detail. The notes system may or may not require a full bibliography, depending on whether the writer has used a full-note form or a shortened-note form.

For example, an excerpt from the text of a paper using a notes system ''without'' a full bibliography could look like:

:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance."&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

The note, located either at the foot of the page (footnote) or at the end of the paper (endnote) would look like this:

:1. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' (New York: Macmillan, 1969) 45–60.

In a paper with a full bibliography, the shortened note might look like:

:1. Kübler-Ross, ''On Death and Dying'' 45–60.

The bibliography entry, which is required with a shortened note, would look like this:

:Kübler-Ross, Elisabeth. ''On Death and Dying''. New York: Macmillan, 1969.

In the humanities, many authors also use footnotes or endnotes to supply anecdotal information. In this way, what looks like a citation is actually supplementary material, or suggestions for further reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studenthandouts.com/citations.htm |title=How to Write Research Papers with Citations: MLA, APA, Footnotes, Endnotes |accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parenthetical referencing ===
{{main|Parenthetical referencing}}
Parenthetical referencing, also known as Harvard referencing, has full or partial, in-text, citations enclosed in circular brackets and embedded in the paragraph.&lt;ref name="Neville2012" /&gt;

An example of a parenthetical reference:
:"The five stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance" (Kübler-Ross,1969, p 45–60).

Depending on the choice of style, fully cited parenthetical references may require no end section. Other styles include a list of the citations, with complete bibliographical references, in an end section, sorted alphabetically by author. This section is often called "References", "Bibliography", "Works cited" or "Works consulted".

In-text references for online publications may differ from conventional parenthetical referencing. A full reference can be hidden, only displayed when wanted by the reader, in the form of a [[tooltip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://livereference.org Live Reference Initiative]. Retrieved 2012-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt; This style makes citing easier and improves the reader's experience.

=== Citation-name system ===
Superscripted numbers are inserted at the point of reference, just as in the citation‐sequence system, but the citations are numbered according to the order of cited works at the end of the paper or book; this list is often sorted alphabetically by author.

{{Main|APA style|MLA style|The Chicago Manual of Style|Bluebook|ALWD Citation Manual|ASA style|Harvard referencing|Vancouver system}}

Citation styles can be broadly divided into styles common to the Humanities and the Sciences, though there is considerable overlap. Some style guides, such as [[the Chicago Manual of Style]], are quite flexible and cover both parenthetical and note citation systems. Others, such as [[MLA style manual|MLA]] and [[APA style|APA]] styles, specify formats within the context of a single citation system. These may be referred to as citation formats as well as citation styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csuchico.edu/lref/newciting.html |title=Citation Formats &amp; Style Manuals |work=CSUChico.edu |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refCaliforniaStateUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=Lesley.edu |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228053242/http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/citation/apa.html |archivedate=December 28, 2007 |ref=refLesleyUni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |title=APA Citation Format |work=RIT.edu |year=2003 |accessdate=2008-02-11 |ref=refRIT |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203115324/http://wally.rit.edu/pubs/guides/apa.html |archivedate=February 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The various guides thus specify order of appearance, for example, of publication date, title, and page numbers following the author name, in addition to conventions of punctuation, use of italics, emphasis, parenthesis, quotation marks, etc., particular to their style.

A number of organizations have created styles to fit their needs; consequently, a number of different guides exist. Individual publishers often have their own in-house variations as well, and some works are so long-established as to have their own citation methods too: [[Stephanus pagination]] for [[Plato]]; [[Bekker numbers]] for [[Aristotle]]; citing the Bible by book, chapter and verse; or [[Shakespeare]] notation by play.

=== Humanities ===
* The [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] (CMOS) was developed and its guide is ''The Chicago Manual of Style''. It is most widely used in history and economics as well as some social sciences. The closely related [[Turabian]] style—which derives from it—is for student references, and is distinguished from the CMOS by omission of quotation marks in reference lists, and mandatory access date citation.
* The Columbia Style was created by Janice R. Walker and Todd Taylor to give detailed guidelines for citing internet sources. Columbia Style offers models for both the humanities and the sciences.
* ''Evidence Explained: Citing History Sources from Artifacts to Cyberspace'' by Elizabeth Shown Mills covers primary sources not included in CMOS, such as censuses, court, land, government, business, and church records. Includes sources in electronic format. Used by genealogists and historians.&lt;ref name="evidence"&gt;Elizabeth Shown Mills. ''Evidence Explained : Citing History Sources from Artifacts to cyberspace.'' 2d ed. Baltimore:Genealogical Pub. Co., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Harvard referencing]] (or author-date system) is a specific kind of [[parenthetical referencing]]. Parenthetical referencing is recommended by both the [[BSI Group|British Standards Institution]] and the [[Modern Language Association]]. Harvard referencing involves a short author-date reference, e.g., "(Smith, 2000)", being inserted after the cited text within parentheses and the full reference to the source being listed at the end of the article.
* [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]] was developed by the [[Modern Language Association]] and is most often used in [[the arts]] and the [[humanities]], particularly in [[English studies]], other [[Literary criticism|literary studies]], including [[comparative literature]] and [[literary criticism]] in languages other than English ("[[foreign languages]]"), and some [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] studies, such as [[cultural studies]], [[drama]] and [[theatre]], [[film]], and other [[Mass media|media]], including [[television]]. This style of citations and bibliographical format uses [[parenthetical referencing]] with author-page (Smith 395) or author-[short] title-page (Smith, ''Contingencies'' 42) in the case of more than one work by the same author within parentheses in the text, keyed to an alphabetical list of sources on a "Works Cited" page at the end of the paper, as well as notes (footnotes or endnotes). See ''[[The MLA Style Manual]]'' and ''[[The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers]]'', particularly [[The MLA Style Manual#Citation and bibliography format|Citation and bibliography format]].{{efn|The field of [[Communication]] (or Communications) overlaps with some of the disciplines also covered by the [[Modern Language Association|MLA]] and has its own disciplinary style recommendations for documentation format; the style guide recommended for use in student papers in such departments in American colleges and universities is often ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the APA]]'' ([[American Psychological Association]]); designated for short as "[[APA style]]".}}
* The [[MHRA Style Guide]] is published by the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] (MHRA) and most widely used in the arts and humanities in the [[United Kingdom]], where the MHRA is based.  It is available for sale both in the UK and in the [[United States]]. It is similar to [[The MLA Style Manual|MLA style]], but has some differences.  For example, MHRA style uses footnotes that reference a citation fully while also providing a bibliography.  Some readers find it advantageous that the footnotes provide full citations, instead of shortened references, so that they do not need to consult the bibliography while reading for the rest of the publication details.&lt;ref&gt;The 2nd edition (updated April 2008) of the ''[[MHRA Style Guide]]'' is downloadable for free from the [[Modern Humanities Research Association]] official Website.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas of the Humanities, footnotes are used exclusively for references, and their use for conventional [[footnotes]] (explanations or examples) is avoided. In these areas, the term "footnote" is actually used as a synonym for "reference", and care must be taken by editors and typesetters to ensure that they understand how the term is being used by their authors.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Legal citation}}
*The [[Bluebook]] is a citation system traditionally used in American academic legal writing, and the Bluebook (or similar systems derived from it) are used by many courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/citation/ |title=Introduction to Basic Legal Citation (LII 2007 ed.) |work=Cornell.edu |first=Peter W |last=Martin |origyear=1993 |date=May 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-03 |ref=refMartin2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present, academic legal articles are always footnoted, but motions submitted to courts and court opinions traditionally use inline citations, which are either separate sentences or separate clauses. Inline citations allow readers to quickly determine the strength of a source based on, for example, the court a case was decided in and the year it was decided.
*The legal citation style used almost universally in Canada is based on the ''Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation'' (AKA ''[[McGill Guide]]''), published by ''McGill Law Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20130210184155/http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/citeguide.php Canadian Guide to Uniform Legal Citation (Cite Guide)]''. ''McGill Law Journal''. Updated October 2008. Retrieved 2009-02-05.&lt;/ref&gt;
*British legal citation almost universally follows the ''[[Oxford Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities]]'' (OSCOLA).

=== Sciences, mathematics, engineering, physiology, and medicine ===
*The [[American Chemical Society]] style, or [[ACS style]], is often used in [[Chemistry]] and some of the [[physical sciences]]. In ACS style references are numbered in the text and in the reference list, and numbers are repeated throughout the text as needed.
*In the style of the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP style), references are also numbered in the text and in the reference list, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.
*Styles developed for the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS), or AMS styles, such as [[AMS-LaTeX]], are typically implemented using the [[BibTeX]] tool in the [[LaTeX]] typesetting environment. Brackets with author's initials and year are inserted in the text and at the beginning of the reference. Typical citations are listed in-line with alphabetic-label format, e.g. [AB90]. This type of style is also called an "''Authorship trigraph.''"
*The [[Vancouver system]], recommended by the [[Council of Science Editors]] (CSE), is used in medical and scientific papers and research.
**In one major variant, that used by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), citation numbers are included in the text in square brackets rather than as superscripts. All bibliographical information is exclusively included in the list of references at the end of the document, next to the respective citation number.
**The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) is reportedly the original kernel of this biomedical style, which evolved from the Vancouver 1978 editors' meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmje.org "Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals"].&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[MEDLINE]]/[[PubMed]] database uses this citation style and the [[National Library of Medicine]] provides "ICMJE [[Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals]] -- Sample References".&lt;ref&gt;International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.  [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/uniform_requirements.html "ICMJE Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals -- Sample References"].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The AMA Style.
*The style of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), or [[IEEE style]], encloses citation numbers within square brackets and numbers them consecutively, with numbers repeated throughout the text as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf IEEE Style Manual]. Retrieved 2015-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In areas of biology that falls within the [[ICNafp]] (which itself uses this citation style throughout), a variant form of author-title citation is the primary method used when making nomenclatural citations and sometimes general citations (for example in code-related proposals published in ''[[Taxon (journal)|Taxon]]''), with the works in question not cited in the bibliography unless also cited in the text. Titles use standardized abbreviations following ''Botanico-Periodicum-Huntianum'' for periodicals and ''Taxonomic Literature 2'' (later [[IPNI]]) for books.
*Pechenik Citation Style is a style described in ''A Short Guide to Writing about Biology'', 6th ed. (2007), by [[Jan Pechenik|Jan A. Pechenik]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gonzaga.edu/academics/colleges-and-schools/college-of-arts-and-sciences/majors-programs/Biology/Undergraduate_Research/Forms/citation_guide.pdf "Pechenik Citation Style QuickGuide"] ([[PDF]]). [[University of Alberta]], Augustana Campus, Canada. [[World Wide Web|Web]]. November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1955, Eugene Garfield proposed a [[citation index|bibliographic system for scientific literature]], to consolidate the integrity of [[scientific publishing|scientific publications]].&lt;ref name=cisn&gt;{{cite journal |last=Garfield |first=Eugene |authorlink= |title=Citation indexes for science. A new dimension in documentation through association of ideas |journal=International Journal of Epidemiology |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=1123–1127 |publisher= |location= |year=2006 |url= |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl189 |id= |pmid=16987841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social sciences ===
* The style of the [[American Psychological Association]], or [[APA style]], published in the [[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]], is most often used in [[social sciences]]. APA citation style is similar to [[Harvard referencing]], listing the author's name and year of publication, although these can take two forms: ''name citations'' in which the surnames of the authors appear in the text and the year of publication then appears in parentheses, and ''author-date citations'', in which the surnames of the authors and the year of publication all appear in parentheses. In both cases, in-text citations point to an alphabetical list of sources at the end of the paper in a References section.
* The [[American Political Science Association]] publishes both a style manual and a style guide for publications in this field.&lt;ref name=APSA&gt;Stephen Yoder, ed. (2008). ''The APSA Guide to Writing and Publishing'' and ''Style Manual for Political Science''. Rev. ed. August 2006. [http://www.apsanet.org/PUBLICATIONS/Online-Store APSAnet.org Publications]. Retrieved 2015-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The style is close to the CMOS.
* The [[American Anthropological Association]] utilizes a modified form of the [[The Chicago Manual of Style|Chicago Style]] laid out in their Publishing Style Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm|title=Publishing Style Guide - Stay Informed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[ASA style]] of [[American Sociological Association]] is one of the main styles used in [[sociological]] publications.

== Issues ==
{{see also|Impact factor#Editorial policies that affect the impact factor}}

In their research on footnotes in scholarly journals in the field of communication, Michael Bugeja and Daniela V. Dimitrova have found that citations to online sources have a rate of decay (as cited pages are taken down), which they call a "half-life", that renders footnotes in those journals less useful for scholarship over time.&lt;ref&gt;Bugeja, Michael and Daniela V. Dimitrova. ''Vanishing Act: The Erosion of Online Footnotes and Implications for Scholarship in the Digital Age''. Duluth, Minnesota: Litwin Books (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experts have found that published replications do not have as many citations as original publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Replications and Extensions in Marketing: Rarely Published But Quite Contrary |author=Raymond Hubbard and J. Scott Armstrong |journal=International Journal of Research in Marketing |volume=11 |pages=233–248 |year=1994 |doi=10.1016/0167-8116(94)90003-5 |issue=3|url=http://cogprints.org/5199/1/Replications-and-Extensions-in-Marketing.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important issue is citation errors, which often occur due to carelessness on either the researcher or journal editor's part in the publication procedure. Experts have found that simple precautions, such as consulting the author of a cited source about proper citations, reduce the likelihood of citation errors and thus increase the quality of research.&lt;ref name="Wright2008"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Ombudsman: Verification of Citations: Fawlty Towers of Knowledge? |first1=Malcolm |last1=Wright |first2=J.&amp;nbsp;Scott |last2=Armstrong |author2-link=J. Scott Armstrong |work=Interfaces |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=125–139 |date=2008 |publisher=Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences |location=Catonsville, Maryland |url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/inte.1070.0317 |archive-url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/J_Armstrong2/publication/45579289_Verification_of_Citations_Fawlty_Towers_of_Knowledge/links/00b7d52b08d80022a0000000.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-17 |dead-url=no |format=PDF |doi=10.1287/inte.1070.0317 |issn=0092-2102 |eissn=1526-551X |jstor=25062982 |oclc=5582131729 |ssrn=1941335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests the impact of an article can be, partly, explained by superficial factors and not only by the scientific merits of an article.&lt;ref&gt;Bornmann, L., &amp; Daniel, H. D. (2008). What do citation counts measure? A review of studies on citing behavior. Journal of Documentation, 64(1), 45-80.&lt;/ref&gt; Field-dependent factors are usually listed as an issue to be tackled not only when comparison across disciplines are made, but also when different fields of research of one discipline are being compared.&lt;ref&gt;Anauati, Maria Victoria and Galiani, Sebastian and Gálvez, Ramiro H., Quantifying the Life Cycle of Scholarly Articles Across Fields of Economic Research (November 11, 2014). Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2523078&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in medicine, among other factors, the number of authors, the number of references, the article length, and the presence of a colon in the title influence the impact; while in sociology the number of references, the article length, and title length are among the factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11192-013-1154-x |first=M. |last=van Wesel |first2=S. |last2=Wyatt |first3=J. |last3=ten Haaf |title=What a difference a colon makes: how superficial factors influence subsequent citation |journal=Scientometrics |issue=3 |volume=98 |pages=1601–1615 |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citation patterns are also known to be affected by unethical behavior of both the authors and journal staff. Such behavior is called impact factor boosting, and was reported to involve even the top-tier journals. Specifically the high-ranking journals of medical science, including the Lancet, JAMA and New England Journal of Medicine, are thought to be associated with such behavior, with up to 30% of citations to these journals being generated by commissioned opinion articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/asi.22997 |first=P. |last=Heneberg |title=Parallel Worlds of Citable Documents and Others: Inflated Commissioned Opinion Articles Enhance Scientometric Indicators |journal=Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology |year=2014 |volume=65 |issue=3 |page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the phenomenon of citation cartels is rising. Citation cartels are defined as groups of authors that cite each other disproportionately more than they do other groups of authors who work on the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fister Jr. | first1 = I. | last2 = Fister | first2 = I. | last3 = Perc | first3 = M.| doi = 10.3389/fphy.2016.00049 | title = Toward the Discovery of Citation Cartels in Citation Networks | journal = Frontiers in Physics | volume = 4 | pages = 49 | year = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yearly citation for research paper.png|thumb|Yearly citation c(t) for a research paper from the e Physical Review corpus.]]
'''Citation dynamics''' describes the number of [[references]] received by the [[article (publishing)|article]] or other scientific work over [[time]]. The [[citation]] dynamics is usually described by the bang, that take place 2–3 years after the work has been published, and the burst size spans several [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]]. The presence of bursts is not consistent with other models based on [[preferential attachment]]. Those models are able to account for the skewed citation distribution but their reference accumulation is gradual.&lt;ref name="eom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eom|first1=Young-Ho|last2=Fortunato|first2=Santo|title=Characterizing and Modeling Citation Dynamics|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024926&amp;type=printable|website=journals.plos.org|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of scientific production has changed significantly over the past years. Due to [[Technological change|technological progress]], the number of published papers has been increasing exponentially until now. This, along with a much shorter time needed for the article to be published, has affected the [[citation]] dynamics of the modern papers. Furthermore, if the [[reference list]] of the study includes papers published in different years, older papers tend to have more citations. This may not necessarily because they are better but just because they had more time to accumulate those references.

==Model==
It has been found that citation distributions are best described by a shifted [[Power law|power-law]].&lt;ref name='eom'/&gt; The [[probability]] that paper &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is cited at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; after publication as:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pi_{i}(t) = \eta_{i}c_i^tP_{i}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; serves as the outcome variable for each particular paper &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Fitness,  &lt;math&gt;\eta_i&lt;/math&gt;, captures the inherent differences between papers, accounting for the perceived [[novelty]] and importance of a discovery. &lt;math&gt;c_i^t&lt;/math&gt; represents the cumulative number of citations acquired by a paper &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a log-normal survival probability.&lt;ref name="Barabasi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Dashun|last2=Song|first2=Chaoming|last3=Barabási|first3=Albert-László|title=Quantifying Long-Term Scientific Impact|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/342/6154/127.full.pdf|website=science.sciencemag.org|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The probability is equal

: &lt;math&gt;P_{i}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_it} exp \left \lbrack -\frac{(ln t - \mu_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \right \rbrack &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time; &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is [[longevity]], capturing the decay rate; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; indicates immediacy, governing the time for a paper to reach its citation peak.
The ultimate impact &lt;math&gt;c_i^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; represents the total number or citations that the paper receives during its lifetime.

:  &lt;math&gt;c_i^{\infty} = m(e^{\lambda_i} - 1)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a global parameter that has the same value for all publications. &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the relative fitness of the paper. From the above formula, we can see that the total number of references that the paper can receive during its lifetime depends only on its relative fitness which is very hard to quantify.

'''Citation Network''' is a [[social network]] which contains paper sources and linked by co-citation relationships. Egghe &amp; Rousseau once (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;228) explain "when a document ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' cites a document ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'', we can show this by an arrow going from the node representing ''d&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the document representing ''d&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''. In this way the documents from a collection D form a directed graph, which is called a 'citation graph' or 'citation network' ".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iva.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/citation_network.htm Science Citation Index: Effectiveness in locating articles in the anaesthetics field: 'Perturbation of ion transport'. British Journal of Anaesthesia, 43: 814, Cawkell, A. E. (1971)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and history ==
[[Citation]] is a reference to a published or unpublished source (not always the original source). More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears. Generally the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not). References to single, machine-readable assertions in electronic scientific articles are known as nanopublications, a form of microattribution.
Citation networks, the principal focus of this study, are one kind of social networks that have been studied quantitatively almost from the moment citation databases first became available. In 1965, Derek J. de Solla Price described the inherent linking characteristic of the SCI in his seminal paper titled "Networks of Scientific Papers". The links between citing and cited papers became dynamic when the SCI began to be published online. In 1973, Henry Small published his work on co-citation analysis which became a self-organizing classification system that led to document clustering experiments and eventually what is called "Research Reviews".&lt;ref name="background"&gt;[http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/publications/papers/CMU-ECE-2011-017.pdf Structures and Statistics of Citation Networks, Miray Kas]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis and figures&lt;ref name="background" /&gt; ==
* Citation networks are directed. The links go from one document to the other. 
* Citation networks are acyclic because a paper can cite only existing papers.
* All edges in the citation networks point backwards in time.
* Links in co-authorship networks are reciprocal (symmetric).
* The link weights between two authors in co-authorship networks can increase over time if they have further collaboration.
* Vertices and edges added to the citation/co-authorship networks are permanent and cannot be removed at a later time. 
* The already formed part of the network is mostly static and only the leading edge of the network changes.

The '''Comparative Toxicogenomics Database''' ('''CTD''') is a public website and research tool launched in November 2004 that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules.
The database is maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences at [[North Carolina State University]].

==Background==
The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public website and research tool that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules, launched on November 12, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattingly CJ, Rosenstein MC, Colby GT, Forrest JN, Boyer JL |title=The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD): A Resource for Comparative Toxicological Studies |journal=J Exp Zoolog.

==Goals and objectives==
One of the primary goals of CTD is to advance the understanding of the effects of environmental chemicals on human health on the genetic level, a field called [[toxicogenomics]].

The [[etiology]] of many chronic diseases involves interactions between environmental factors and genes that modulate important physiological processes. Chemicals are an important component of the environment. Conditions such as [[asthma]], cancer, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[immunodeficiency]], and [[Parkinson's disease]] are known to be influenced by the environment; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these correlations are not well understood. CTD may help resolve these mechanisms. The most up-to-date extensive list of peer-reviewed scientific articles about CTD is available at their publications page&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctdbase.org/about/publications/#ctdpubs CTD Publications page] ctdbase.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core data==
CTD is a unique resource where [[biocurator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bourne PE, McEntyre J |title=Biocurators: Contributors to the World of Science |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e142 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17411327 |pmc=1626157 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salimi N, Vita R |title=The Biocurator: Connecting and Enhancing Scientific Data |journal=PLoS Comput.

* Chemical-gene interactions
* Chemical-disease associations
* Gene-disease associations
* Chemical-phenotype associations

==Data integration==
By integrating the above four data sets, CTD automatically constructs putative chemical-gene-phenotype-disease networks to illuminate molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally-influenced diseases.

These inferred relationships are statistically scored and ranked and can be used by scientists and computational biologists to generate and verify testable hypotheses about toxicogenomic mechanisms and how they relate to human health.

Users can search CTD to explore scientific data for chemicals, genes, diseases, or interactions between any of these three concepts.  Currently,{{when|date=November 2015}} CTD integrates toxicogenomic data for vertebrates and invertebrates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1347">The '''comparative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''comp'''}}) is a [[grammatical case]] used in languages such as [[Mari language|Mari]] and [[Chechen language|Chechen]] to mark a likeness to something. 

It is not to be confused with the [[comparison (grammar)|comparative degree]], a much more widely used paradigm used to signify heightening of [[adjectives]] and [[adverbs]].

In Mari, the comparative case is marked with the suffix -ла ('-la')  For example, if something were to taste like fish (кол - 'kol'), the form used would be колла - 'kolla'). It is also used in regard to languages, when denoting the language a person is speaking, writing, or hearing. Then, however, the accentuation varies slightly from the standard case. Usually, the suffix is not stressed. When it is used with languages, however, it is stressed.

In Chechen, it is marked with the suffix ''-l''. For example, ''sha'' is 'ice', ''shiila'' is 'cold', and ''shal shiila'' is 'cold as ice'.

'''Comparative cognition''' is the comparative study of the mechanisms and origins of [[cognition]] in various [[species]], and is sometimes seen as more general than, or similar to, [[comparative psychology]].
From a biological point of view, work is being done on the brains of [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] that should yield techniques precise enough to allow an understanding of the workings of the human brain on a scale appreciative of individual groups of [[neurons]] rather than the more regional scale previously used. Similarly, gene activity in the human [[brain]] is better understood through examination of the brains of mice by the Seattle-based [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]] (see link below), yielding the freely available [[Allen Brain Atlas]]. This type of study is related to comparative cognition, but better classified as one of [[comparative genomics]]. Increasing emphasis in [[psychology]] and [[ethology]] on the biological aspects of [[perception]] and [[behavior]] is bridging the gap between [[genomics]] and [[behavioral analysis]].

In order for scientists to better understand cognitive function across a broad range of species they can systematically compare cognitive abilities between closely and distantly related species&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Horik|first=Jayden|last2=Emery|first2=Nathan J.|date=2011-11-01|title=Evolution of cognition|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=6|pages=621–633|doi=10.1002/wcs.144|pmid=26302412|issn=1939-5086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process they can determine what kinds of selection pressure has led to different cognitive abilities across a broad range of animals. For example, it has been hypothesized that there is convergent evolution of the higher cognitive functions of corvids and apes, possibly due to both being omnivorous, visual animals that live in social groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Comparative cultural studies''' is a contextual approach to the study of culture in a global and intercultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepress.purdue.edu/series/comparative-cultural-studies|title=Comparative Cultural Studies|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=October 32, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focus is placed on the theory, method, and application of the study process(es) rather than on the "what" of the object(s) of study.

==Overview==
In comparative cultural studies, selected tenets of [[comparative literature]] are merged with selected tenets of the field of [[cultural studies]] (including [[cultural theory|culture theories]], (radical) [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]], [[communication]] theories, and [[systems theories]]) with the objective to study culture and culture products (including but not restricted to literature, communication, media, art, etc.). This is performed in a contextual and relational construction and with a plurality of methods and approaches, interdisciplinary, and, if and when required, including teamwork. In comparative cultural studies, it is the processes of communicative action(s) in culture and the how of these processes that constitute the main objectives of research and study. However, scholarship in comparative cultural studies does not exclude [[textual analysis]] proper of other established fields of study. In comparative cultural studies, ideally, the framework of and methodologies available in the systemic and empirical study of culture are favored. Scholarship in comparative cultural studies includes the theoretical, as well as methodological and applied postulate to move and to dialogue between cultures, languages, literature, and disciplines: attention to other cultures against essentialist notions and practices and beyond the paradigm of the nation-state is a basic and founding element of the framework and its application.

'''Comparative research''' is a research methodology in the [[social science]]s that aims to make comparisons across different [[country|countries]] or [[culture]]s. A major problem in comparative research is that the data sets in different countries may not use the same categories, or define categories differently (for example by using different definitions of [[poverty]]).

== Development of the tradition ==

As Moutsios argues, cross-cultural and comparative research should be seen as part of the scientific spirit that arose in Greece in the 6th century and the overall appreciation of knowledge and learning that was characteristic of the 5th century. In other words, it is part of the emergence of ''episteme'' and ''philo-sophia'', as a love for knowledge that is independent from material benefits. ''Episteme'', as a form and activity in the field of ''logos'', marked the break of cognitive closure and advanced empirical inquiry, logical argumentation and the search for truth. And the high esteem for intellectual activity gave rise to a genuine curiosity about other cultures – which has lain thereafter at the heart of comparative inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Moutsios, S. (2014) ‘On comparative inquiry: the Ancient Greek origins’. Research paper presented at the conference of the Comparative Education Society in Europe (CESE), Freiburg, Germany, 11/06/14 - 14/06/14. &lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, behind the Greek comparative gaze also was the philosophical and political questioning which characterised the life of the democratic ''polis''. Philosophical inquiry, from the Milesians down to the Sophists, questioned the representations and the cognitive traditions of their own people; the inquiry of the traditions of other peoples was, as Herodotus’ ''Histories'' demonstrate, an activity associated with the ethos of philosophical critique that characterised democratic life in Greece. Similarly, questioning of the Greek laws and institutions and its related values and practices (e.g. ''isegoria'' and ''parrhesia''), as part of Greek politics, is associated with the effort of the first historians to reflect on home institutions through researching those of others.&lt;ref&gt;Moutsios, S. (2014) Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

According also to [[Karl Deutsch]], we have been using this form of investigation for over 2,000 years. Comparing things is essential to basic scientific and philosophic inquiry, which has been done for a long time.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"&gt;Deutsch 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Most authors are more conservative in their estimate of how long comparative research has been with us. It is largely an empty debate over the definition of the tradition with those questioning whether comparing things counts as comparative research.

Textbooks on this form of study were beginning to appear by the 1880s, but its rise to extreme popularity began after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Clasen"&gt;Clasen 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antal, Dierkes &amp; Weiler 1987: 13&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous reasons that comparative research has come to take a place of honour in the toolbox of the social scientist. [[Globalization]] has been a major factor, increasing the desire and possibility for educational exchanges and intellectual curiosity about other cultures. [[Information technology]] has enabled greater production of quantitative data for comparison, and international communications technology has facilitated this information to be easily spread.&lt;ref&gt;Øyen 2004: 276&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparative research defined ==
Comparative research, simply put, is the act of comparing two or more things with a view to discovering something about one or all of the things being compared. This technique often utilizes multiple disciplines in one study. When it comes to method, the majority agreement is that there is no methodology peculiar to comparative research.&lt;ref name="Heidenheimer"&gt;Heidenheimer, Heclo &amp; Adams 1983: 505&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary approach is good for the flexibility it offers, yet comparative programs do have a case to answer against the call that their research lacks a "seamless whole."&lt;ref&gt;Jones 1985: 28&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are certainly methods that are far more common than others in comparative studies, however. Quantitative analysis is much more frequently pursued than qualitative, and this is seen by the majority of comparative studies which use quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;Deacon 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Esping"&gt;Esping-Andersen 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clasen"/&gt; The general method of comparing things is the same for comparative research as it is in our everyday practice of comparison. Like cases are treated alike, and different cases are treated differently; the extent of difference determines how differently cases are to be treated. If one is able to sufficiently distinguish two carry the research conclusions will not be very helpful.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 1990: 14&lt;/ref&gt; 

Secondary analysis of quantitative data is relatively widespread in comparative research, undoubtedly in part because of the cost of obtaining primary data for such large things as a country's policy environment. This study is generally aggregate data analysis. Comparing large quantities of data (especially government sourced) is prevalent.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt; A typical method of comparing welfare states is to take balance of their levels of spending on social welfare.&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

In line with how a lot of theorizing has gone in the last century, comparative research does not tend to investigate "grand theories," such as [[Marxism]]. It instead occupies itself with middle-range theories that do not purport to describe our social system in its entirety, but a subset of it.&lt;ref name="Deutsch 1987"/&gt; A good example of this is the common research program that looks for differences between two or more social systems, then looks at these differences in relation to some other variable coexisting in those societies to see if it is related.&lt;ref&gt;Przeworski &amp; Teune 1970: 31&lt;/ref&gt; The classic case of this is Esping-Andersen's research on social welfare systems. He noticed there was a difference in types of social welfare systems, and compared them based on their level of decommodification of social welfare goods. He found that he was able to class welfare states into three types, based on their level of [[decommodification]]. He further theorized from this that decommodification was based on a combination of class coalitions and mobilization, and regime legacy.&lt;ref name="Esping"/&gt; Here, Esping-Andersen is using comparative research: he takes many western countries and compares their level of decommodification, then develops a theory of the divergence based on his findings.

Comparative research can take many forms. Two key factors are space and time. Spatially, cross-national comparisons are by far the most common, although comparisons within countries, contrasting different areas, cultures or governments also subsist and are very constructive, especially in a country like New Zealand, where policy often changes depending on which race it pertains to.&lt;ref name="Heidenheimer"/&gt; Recurrent interregional studies include comparing similar or different countries or sets of countries, comparing one's own country to others or to the whole world.

The [[historical comparative research]] involves comparing different time-frames. The two main choices within this model are comparing two stages in time (either snapshots or time-series), or just comparing the same thing over time, to see if a policy's effects differ over a stretch of time.&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

When it comes to subject matter of comparative inquiries, many contend there is none unique to it. This may indeed be true, but a brief perusal of comparative endeavours reveals there are some topics more recurrent than others. Determining whether socioeconomic or political factors are more important in explaining government action is a familiar theme. In general, however, the only thing that is certain in comparative research issues is the existence of differences to be analysed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25113">This is a conversion chart showing how the Dewey Decimal and Library of Congress Classification systems organize resources by concept, in part for the purpose of assigning [[Wiktionary:call number|call numbers]].  These two systems account for over 95% of the classification in [[United States]] libraries, and are used widely around the world.

The chart includes all ninety-nine second level (two-digit) DDC classes (040 is not assigned), and should include all second level (two-digit) LCC classes. Where a class in one system maps to several classes in other system, it will be listed multiple times (e.g. DDC class 551).

A number of authors have carried out comparisons of [[Nazism]] and [[Stalinism]], in which they have considered the similarities and differences of the two ideologies and [[political systems]], what relationship existed between the two regimes, and why both of them came to prominence at the same time. During the 20th century, the comparison of [[Stalinism]] and [[Nazism]] was made on the topics of [[totalitarianism]], ideology, and [[personality cult]]. Both regimes were seen in contrast to the liberal West, with an emphasis on the similarities between the two.&lt;ref name="Geyer2"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[political scientist]]s [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Carl Friedrich]] and historian [[Robert Conquest]] were prominent advocates of applying the "totalitarian" concept to compare Nazism and Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Geyer, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reflections2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The various authors are listed in chronological order, by the date of publication of the earliest work cited in their section. --&gt;
== Hannah Arendt==
[[File:Hannah arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hannah Arendt]] was one of the first scholars to propose that the regimes of Hitler and Stalin could be grouped in the same political category.]]
===The origins of totalitarianism===
One of the first scholars to publish a comparative study of Nazi Germany and Stalin’s Soviet Union was [[Hannah Arendt]]. In her 1951 work, ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Arendt puts forward the idea of [[totalitarianism]] as a distinct type of political movement and form of government, which “differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 460&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Arendt distinguishes between a totalitarian movement (such as a political party with totalitarian aims) and a totalitarian government. Not all totalitarian movements succeed in creating totalitarian governments once they gain power. In Arendt’s view, although many totalitarian movements existed in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, only the governments of Stalin and Hitler succeeded in fully implementing their totalitarian aims.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arendt traced the origin of totalitarian movements to the nineteenth century, focusing especially on [[antisemitism]] and [[New Imperialism|imperialism]]. She emphasized the connection between the rise of European [[nation-state]]s and the growth of antisemitism, which was due to the fact that the Jews represented an “inter-European, non-national element in a world of growing or existing nations.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]] abounded, and the Jews were accused of being part of various international schemes to ruin European nations.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Small antisemitic political parties formed in response to this perceived Jewish threat, and, according to Arendt, these were the first political organizations in Europe that claimed to represent the interests of the whole nation as opposed to the interests of a class or other social group.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; The later totalitarian movements would copy or inherit this claim to speak for the whole nation, with the implication that any opposition to them constituted treason.

European [[New Imperialism|imperialism of the nineteenth century]] also paved the way for totalitarianism, by legitimizing the concept of endless expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; After Europeans had engaged in imperialist expansion on other continents, political movements developed which aimed to copy the methods of imperialism on the European continent itself. Arendt refers specifically to the “[[Pan-nationalism|pan-movements]]” of [[pan-Germanism]] and [[pan-Slavism]], which promised continental empires to nations that had little hope of overseas expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; According to Arendt, “Nazism and Bolshevism owe more to Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism (respectively) than to any other ideology or political movement.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment, propaganda and indoctrination===
Arendt argues that both the Nazi and Bolshevik movements “recruited their members from [a] mass of apparently indifferent people whom all other parties had given up,”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; and who “had reason to be equally hostile to all parties.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, totalitarian movements did not need to use debate or persuasion, and did not need to refute the arguments of the other parties. Their target audience did not have to be persuaded to despise the other parties or the democratic system, because it consisted of people who already despised mainstream politics. As a result, totalitarian movements were free to use violence and terror against their opponents without fear that this might alienate their own supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of arguing against their opponents, they adopted [[determinism|deterministic]] views of human behavior and presented opposing ideas as “originating in deep natural, social, or psychological sources beyond the control of the individual and therefore beyond the power of reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis in particular, during the years before their rise to power, engaged in “killing small socialist functionaries or influential members of opposing parties” both as a means to intimidate opponents and as a means of demonstrating to their supporters that they were a party of action, “different from the ‘idle talkers’ of other parties.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian governments make extensive use of propaganda, and are often characterized by having a strong distinction between what they tell their own supporters and the propaganda they produce for others. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt distinguishes these two categories as "indoctrination" and "propaganda". Indoctrination consists of the message that a totalitarian government promotes internally, to the members of the ruling party and that segment of the population which supports the government. Propaganda consists of the message that a totalitarian government seeks to promote in the outside world, and also among those parts of its own society which may not support the government. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, “the necessities for propaganda are always dictated by the outside world,” while the opportunities for indoctrination depend on “the totalitarian governments’ isolation and security from outside interference.” &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

The type of indoctrination used by the Soviets and the Nazis was characterized by claims of “scientific” truth, and appeals to “objective laws of nature.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt; Both movements took a [[determinism|deterministic]] view of human society and claimed that their ideologies were based on scientific discoveries regarding race (in the case of the Nazis) or the forces governing human history (in the case of the Soviets). Arendt identifies this as being in certain ways similar to modern [[advertising]], in which companies claim that scientific research shows their products to be superior, but more generally she argues that it is an extreme version of “that obsession with science which has characterized the Western world since the rise of mathematics and physics in the sixteenth century.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt; By their use of [[pseudoscience]] as the main justification for their actions, Nazism and Stalinism are distinguished from earlier historical despotic regimes, who appealed instead to [[religion]] or sometimes did not try to justify themselves at all. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments did not merely use these appeals to supposed scientific laws as propaganda to manipulate others. Rather, totalitarian leaders like Hitler and Stalin genuinely believed that they were acting in accordance with immutable natural laws, to such an extent that they were willing to sacrifice the self-interest of their regimes for the sake of enacting those supposed laws.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Nazis treated the inhabitants of occupied territories with extreme brutality and planned to depopulate Eastern Europe in order to make way for colonists from the German “[[herrenvolk|master race]],” despite the fact that this actively harmed their war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin repeatedly [[Purges of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|purged the Communist Party]] of people who deviated even slightly from the party line, even when this weakened the party or the Soviet government, because he believed that they represented the interests of “dying classes” and their demise was historically inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Leader===
Arendt also identifies the central importance of an all-powerful leader in totalitarian movements. &lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; As in other areas, she distinguishes between totalitarian leaders (such as Hitler and Stalin) and non-totalitarian dictators or autocratic leaders. The totalitarian leader does not rise to power by personally using violence or through any special organizational skills, but rather by controlling appointments of personnel within the party, so that all other prominent party members owe their positions to him.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; With loyalty to the leader becoming the primary criterion for promotion, ambitious party members compete with each other in trying to express their loyalty, and a [[cult of personality]] develops around the leader. Even when the leader is not particularly competent and the members of his inner circle are aware of his deficiencies, they remain committed to him out of fear that without him the entire power structure would collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "enemies"===
Once in power, according to Arendt, totalitarian movements face a major dilemma: they built their support on the basis of anger against the status quo and on impossible or dishonest promises, but now they have become the new status quo and are expected to carry out their promises.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; They deal with this problem by engaging in a constant struggle against external and internal enemies, real or imagined, so as to enable them to say that, in a sense, they have not yet gained the power they need to fulfill their promises. According to Arendt, totalitarian governments must be constantly fighting enemies in order to survive. This explains their apparently irrational behavior, for example when Hitler continued to make territorial demands even after he was offered everything he asked for in the [[Munich Agreement]], or when Stalin unleashed the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] despite the fact that he faced no significant internal opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concentration camps===
Arendt points out the widespread use of [[concentration camp]]s by totalitarian governments, arguing that they are the most important manifestation of the need to find enemies to fight against, and are therefore “more essential to the preservation of the regime’s power than any of its other institutions.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 456&lt;/ref&gt; Although forced labor was commonly imposed on inmates of concentration camps, Arendt argues that their primary purpose was not any kind of material gain for the regime: “The only permanent economic function of the camps has been the financing of their own supervisory apparatus; thus from the economic point of view the concentration camps exist mostly for their own sake.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis in particular carried this to the point of “open anti-utility,” by expending large sums of money, resources and manpower – during a war – for the purpose of building and staffing [[extermination camps]] and transporting people to them.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 445&lt;/ref&gt; This sets apart the concentration camps of totalitarian regimes from older human institutions that bear some similarity to them, such as [[slavery]].  Slaves were abused and killed for the sake of profit; concentration camp inmates were abused and killed because a totalitarian government needed to justify its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 444&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Arendt points out that concentration camps under both Hitler and Stalin included large numbers of inmates who were innocent of any crime – not only in the ordinary sense of the word, but even by the standards of the regimes themselves. That is to say, most of the inmates had not actually committed any action against the regime.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 451&lt;/ref&gt;

===The future of totalitarian systems===
Throughout her analysis, Arendt emphasized the modernity and novelty of the governmental structures set up by Stalin and Hitler, arguing that they represented “an entirely new form of government” which is likely to manifest itself again in various other forms in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; She also cautioned against the belief that future totalitarian movements would necessarily share the ideological foundations of Nazism or Stalinism, writing that “all ideologies contain totalitarian elements.”&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (second edition), New York: Meridian Books, 1958, p. 470&lt;/ref&gt;

== Carl Friedrich and Zbigniew Brzezinski ==
[[File:Zbigniew Brzezinski, 1977.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] in 1977, the year he became [[National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)|United States National Security Advisor]] under president [[Jimmy Carter]].]]

===Totalitarian systems and autocracies===
The totalitarian paradigm in the comparative study of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was further developed by [[Carl Joachim Friedrich|Carl Friedrich]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], who wrote extensively on this topic both individually and in collaboration. Similar to Hannah Arendt, they state that “totalitarian dictatorship is a new phenomenon; there has never been anything quite like it before.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski classify totalitarian dictatorship as a type of [[autocracy]], but argue that it is different in important ways from most other historical autocracies. In particular, it is distinguished by a reliance on modern technology and mass legitimation.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski apply the notion of totalitarian dictatorship not only to the regimes of Hitler and Stalin, but also to the USSR throughout its entire existence, as well as the regime of [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy and the [[People’s Republic of China]] under [[Mao Zedong]].

Carl Friedrich noted that the “possibility of equating the dictatorship of Stalin in the Soviet Union and that of Hitler in Germany” has been a deeply controversial topic and a subject of debate almost from the beginning of those dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Various other aspects of the two regimes have also been the subject of intense scholarly debate, such as whether Nazi and Stalinist ideologies were genuinely believed and pursued by the respective governments, or whether the ideologies were merely convenient justifications for dictatorial rule.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich himself argues in favor of the former view.

Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that Nazism and Stalinism are not only similar to each other, but also represent a continuation or a return to the tradition of European [[absolute monarchy]] on certain levels.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In the absolute monarchies of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the monarch ultimately held all decisional power, and was considered accountable only to God. In Stalinism and Nazism, the leader likewise held all real power, and was considered accountable only to various intangible entities such as “the people”, “the masses” or “the Volk.” Thus the common feature of autocracies – whether monarchical or totalitarian – is the concentration of power in the hands of a leader who cannot be held accountable by any legal mechanisms, and who is supposed to be the embodiment of the will of an abstract entity.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify other features common to all autocracies, such as “the oscillation between tight and loose control.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The regime alternates between periods of intense repression and periods of relative freedom, often represented by different leaders. This depends in part on the personal character of different leaders, but Friedrich and Brzezinski believe that there is also an underlying political cycle, in which rising discontent leads to increased repression up to the point at which the opposition is eliminated, then controls are relaxed until the next time that popular dissatisfaction begins to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, placing Stalinism and Nazism within the broader historical tradition of autocratic government, Friedrich and Brzezinski hold that “totalitarian dictatorship, in a sense, is the adaptation of autocracy to twentieth-century industrial society.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the same time, they insist that totalitarian dictatorship is a “''novel'' type of autocracy”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and argue that twentieth century totalitarian regimes (such as those of Hitler and Stalin) had more in common with each other than with any other form of government, including historical autocracies of the past. Totalitarianism can only exist after the creation of modern technology, because such technology is essential for [[propaganda]], for surveillance of the population, and for the operation of a [[secret police]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when speaking of the differences and similarities between fascist and communist regimes, Friedrich and Brzezinski insist that the two kinds of totalitarian governments are “basically alike” but “not wholly alike” – they are more similar to each other than to other forms of government, but they are not the same.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Among the major differences between them, Friedrich and Brzezinski identify in particular the fact that communists seek “the world revolution of the proletariat,” while fascists wish to “establish the imperial predominance of a particular nation or race.” &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five pillars of totalitarian systems===
In terms of the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism, Friedrich lists five main aspects that they hold in common: First, an official ideology that is supposed to be followed by all members of society, at least passively, and which promises to serve as a perfect guide towards some ultimate goal. Second, a [[one-party state|single political party]], composed of the most enthusiastic supporters of the official ideology, representing an elite group within society (no more than 10 percent of the population), and organized along strictly regimented lines. Third, “a technologically conditioned near-complete monopoly of control of all means of effective armed combat” in the hands of the party or its representatives. Fourth, a similar monopoly held by the party over the mass media and all technological forms of communication. Fifth, “a system of terroristic police control” that is not only used to defend the regime against real enemies, but also to persecute various groups of people who are only suspected of being enemies or who may potentially become enemies in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Two first pillars of any totalitarian government, according to Friedrich and Brzezinski, are the dictator and the Party. The dictator, whether Stalin, Hitler or Mussolini, holds supreme power. Friedrich and Brzezinski explicitly reject the claim that the Party, or any other institution, could provide a significant counterweight to the power of the dictator in Nazism or Stalinism.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The dictator needs the Party in order to be able to rule, so he may be careful not to make decisions that would go directly against the wishes of other leading Party members, but ultimate authority rests with him and not with them. Like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify the cult of personality surrounding the leader as an essential element of a totalitarian dictatorship, and reference Stalin’s personality cult in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; They also draw attention to the fact that Hitler and Stalin were expected to provide ideological direction for their governments and not merely practical leadership. Friedrich and Brzezinski write that “unlike military dictators in the past, but like certain types of primitive chieftains, the totalitarian dictator is both ruler and high priest.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, he not only governs, but also provides the principles on which his government is to be based. This is partly due to the way that totalitarian governments arise. They come about when a militant ideological movement seizes power, so the first leader of a totalitarian government is usually the ideologue who built the movement that seized power, and subsequent leaders try to emulate him.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dictator and his henchmen ====
The totalitarian dictator needs loyal lieutenants to carry out his orders faithfully and with a reasonable degree of efficiency. Friedrich and Brzezinski identify parallels between the men in Hitler and Stalin’s entourage, arguing that both dictators used similar people to perform similar tasks. Thus, for example, [[Martin Bormann]] and [[Georgy Malenkov]] were both capable administrators and bureaucrats, while [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Lavrentiy Beria]] were ruthless secret police chiefs responsible for suppressing any potential challenge to the dictator’s power.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hitler and Stalin promoted rivalry and distrust among their lieutenants so as to ensure that none of them would become powerful enough to challenge the dictator himself.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; This is the cause of an important weakness of the totalitarian regimes: the problem of succession. Friedrich points out that neither the Nazi nor the Stalinist government ever established any official line of succession or any mechanism to decide who would replace the dictator after his death. The dictator, being the venerated “father of the people,” was regarded as irreplaceable. There could never be any heir apparent, because such an heir would have been a threat to the power of the dictator while he was alive. Thus the dictator’s inevitable death would always leave behind a major power vacuum and cause a political crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich (editor) et al., ''Totalitarianism'' [proceedings of a conference held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, March 1953], New York: Grosset and Dunlap, 1964, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Nazi regime, since Hitler died mere days before the final defeat of Germany in the war, this never became a major issue. In the case of the USSR, Stalin’s death led to a prolonged power struggle.

====Totalitarian Party====
Friedrich and Brzezinski also identify key similarities between the Nazi and Stalinist political parties, which set them apart from other types of political parties. Both the [[Nazi Party]] and the [[CPSU]] under Stalin had very strict membership requirements and did not accept members on the basis of mere agreement with the Party’s ideology and goals. Rather, they strictly tested potential members, in a manner similar to exclusive clubs, and often engaged in political [[purge]]s of the membership, expelling large numbers of people from their ranks (and sometimes arresting and executing those expelled, such as in the [[Great Purge]] or the [[Night of the Long Knives]]).&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the totalitarian party cultivates the idea that to be a member is a privilege which needs to be earned, and total obedience to the leader is required in order to maintain this privilege. While both Nazism and Stalinism required party members to display such total loyalty in practice, they differed in the way they dealt with it in theory. Nazism openly proclaimed the hierarchical ideal of absolute obedience to the [[Führer]] as one of its key ideological principles (the ''[[Führerprinzip]]''). Stalinism, meanwhile, denied that it did anything similar, and claimed instead to uphold democratic principles, with the Party Congress (made up of elected delegates) supposedly being the highest authority.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Stalinist elections typically featured only a single candidate, and the Party Congress met very rarely and simply approved Stalin’s decisions. Thus, regardless of the differences in their underlying ideological claims, the Nazi and Stalinist parties were organized in practice along similar lines, with a rigid hierarchy and centralized leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Each totalitarian party and dictator is supported by a specific totalitarian ideology. Friedrich and Brzezinski argue, in agreement with Arendt, that Nazi and Stalinist leaders really believed in their respective ideologies and did not merely use them as tools to gain power. Several major policies, such as the [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Stalinist collectivization of agriculture]] or the [[Final Solution |Nazi “final solution”]], cannot be explained by anything other than a genuine commitment to achieve ideological goals, even at great cost.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The ideologies were different and their goals were different, but what they had in common was a [[utopian]] commitment to reshaping the world, and a determination to fight by any means necessary against a real or imagined enemy.  This stereotyped enemy could be described as “the fat rich Jew or the Jewish Bolshevik” for the Nazis, or “the war-mongering, atom-bomb-wielding American Wallstreeter” for the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ideology and symbolism====
According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most important difference between Nazi and Stalinist ideology lies in the degree of universality involved. Stalinism, and communist ideology in general, is universal in its appeal and addresses itself to all the “[[Workers of the world, unite!|workers of the world]].” Nazism, on the other hand, and fascist ideology in general, can only address itself to one particular race or nation – the “[[master race]]” that is destined to dominate all others. Therefore, “in communism social justice appears to be the ultimate value, unless it be the classless society that is its essential condition; in fascism, the highest value is dominion, eventually world dominion, and the strong and pure nation-race is ''its'' essential condition, as seen by its ideology.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; This means that fascist or Nazi movements from different countries will be natural enemies, rather than natural allies, as they each seek to extend the dominion of their own nation at the expense of others.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; Friedrich and Brzezinski see this as a weakness inherent in fascist and Nazi ideology, while communist universalism is a source of ideological strength for Stalinism.

Friedrich and Brzezinski also draw attention to the symbols used by Nazis and Stalinists to represent themselves. The Soviet Union adopted the [[hammer and sickle]], a newly-created symbol, “invented by the leaders of the movement and pointing to the future.” Meanwhile, Nazi Germany used the [[swastika]], “a ritual symbol of uncertain origin, quite common in primitive societies.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, one is trying to project itself as being oriented towards a radically new future, while the other is appealing to a mythical heroic past.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

====Propaganda and terror====
Totalitarian dictatorships maintain themselves in power through the use of propaganda and terror, which Friedrich and Brzezinski believe to be closely connected. Terror may be enforced with arrests and executions of dissenters, but it can also take more subtle forms, such as the threat of losing one’s job, social stigma and defamation. “Terror” can refer to any widespread method used to intimidate people into submission as a matter of daily life. According to Friedrich and Brzezinski, the most effective terror is invisible to the people it affects. They simply develop a habit of acting in a conformist manner and not questioning authority, without necessarily being aware that this is what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, terror creates a society dominated by apparent consensus, where the vast majority of the population appears to support the government. Propaganda is then used to maintain this appearance of popular consent. &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Totalitarian propaganda is one of the features that distinguishes totalitarian regimes as modern forms of government and separates them from older autocracies, since a totalitarian government holds complete control over all means of communication (not only public communication such as the mass media, but also private communication such as letters and telephone calls, which are strictly monitored).&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; The methods of propaganda were very similar in the Stalinist USSR and in Nazi Germany. Both [[Joseph Goebbels]] and Soviet propagandists sought to demonize their enemies and present a picture of a united people standing behind its leader to confront foreign threats. In both cases there was no attempt to convey complex ideological nuances to the masses, with the message being instead about a simplistic struggle between good and evil. Both Nazi and Stalinist regimes produced two very different sets of propaganda – one for internal consumption and one for potential sympathizers in other countries. And both regimes would sometimes radically change their propaganda line as they made peace with a former enemy or got into a war with a former ally.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, paradoxically, a totalitarian government’s complete control over communications renders that government highly misinformed. With no way for anyone to express criticism, the dictator has no way of knowing how much support he actually has among the general populace. With all government policies always declared successful in propaganda, officials are unable to determine what actually worked and what didn’t.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalinism and Nazism suffered from this problem, especially during the war between them. As the war turned against Germany, there was growing opposition to Hitler’s rule, including within the ranks of the military, but Hitler was never aware of this until it was too late (see: [[20 July plot]]). In 1948, during the early days of the [[Berlin Blockade]], the Soviet leadership apparently believed that the population of [[West Berlin]] was sympathetic to Soviet Communism and that they would request to join the Soviet zone.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 136-137&lt;/ref&gt; Given enough time, the gap between real public opinion and what the totalitarian government believes about public opinion can grow so wide that the government is no longer able to even produce effective propaganda, because it does not know what the people actually think and so it does not know what to tell them. Friedrich and Brzezinski refer to this as the “ritualization of propaganda”: the totalitarian regime continues to produce propaganda as a political ritual, with little real impact on public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arrests, executions and concentration camps====
The totalitarian use of mass arrests, executions and concentration camps – also noted by Arendt – was analyzed at length by Friedrich and Brzezinski. They hold that “totalitarian terror maintains, in institutionalized form, the civil war that originally produced the totalitarian movement and by means of which the regime is able to proceed with its program, first of social disintegration and then of social reconstruction.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalinism and Nazism saw themselves as engaging in a life-or-death struggle against implacable enemies. But to declare that the struggle had been won would have meant to declare that most of the totalitarian features of the government were no longer needed. A secret police force, for instance, has no reason to exist if there are no dangerous traitors who need to be found. Thus the struggle, or “civil war” against internal enemies, must be institutionalized and must continue indefinitely. In the Stalinist USSR, the repressive apparatus was eventually turned against members of the Communist Party itself in the Great Purge and the [[Moscow Trials|show trials]] that accompanied it. &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 187, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; Nazism, by contrast, had a much shorter lifespan in power, and Nazi terror generally maintained an outward focus, with the extermination of the Jews always given top priority. The Nazis did not turn inward towards purging their own party except in a limited way on two occasions (the Night of the Long Knives and the aftermath of the 20 July plot). &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak of totalitarian terror was reached with the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. These ranged from [[labor camp]]s to [[extermination camp]]s, and they are described by Friedrich and Brzezinski as aiming to “eliminate all actual, potential, and imagined enemies of the regime.” &lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; As the field of [[Holocaust studies]] was still in its early stages at the time of their writing, they do not describe the conditions in detail, but do refer to the camps as involving “extreme viciousness.”&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; They also compare these camps with the Soviet [[Gulag]] system, and highlight the use of concentration camps as a method of punishment and execution by Nazi and Stalinist regimes alike. However, unlike Hannah Arendt, who held that the Gulag camps served no economic purpose, Friedrich and Brzezinski argue that they provided an important source of cheap labor for the Stalinist economy.&lt;ref&gt;Carl J. Friedrich and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moshe Lewin and Ian Kershaw==
[[File:Ian Kershaw 2012 crop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ian Kershaw]] in 2012]]

===Germany and Russia===
The comparative study of Nazism and Stalinism was carried further by other groups of scholars, such as [[Moshe Lewin]] and [[Ian Kershaw]] together with their collaborators. Writing after the [[dissolution of the USSR]], Lewin and Kershaw take a longer historical perspective and regard Nazism and Stalinism not so much as examples of a new type of society (like Arendt, Friedrich and Brzezinski did), but more as historical “anomalies” – unusual deviations from the typical path of development that most industrial societies are expected to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the task of comparing Nazism and Stalinism is, to them, a task of explaining why Germany and Russia (along with other countries) deviated from the historical norm. At the outset, Lewin and Kershaw identify similarities between the historical situations in Germany and Russia prior to the First World War and during that war. Both countries were ruled by authoritarian monarchies, who were under pressure to make concessions to popular demands. Both countries had “powerful bureaucracies and strong military traditions.” Both had “powerful landowning classes,” while also being in the process of rapid industrialization and modernization. And both countries had expansionist foreign policies with a particular interest in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin and Kershaw do not claim that these factors made Stalinism or Nazism inevitable, but rather that they help to explain why the Stalinist and Nazi regimes developed similar features.

===Similarities and differences of the systems===
Ian Kershaw  admitted that Stalinism and Nazism are comparable in “the nature and extent of their inhumanity,” but noted that the two regimes were different in a number of aspects&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 88-89&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin and Kershaw question the usefulness of grouping the Stalinist and Nazi regimes together under a “totalitarian” category, saying that it remains an open question whether the similarities between them are greater or smaller than the differences.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they criticize what they see as the ideologically-motivated attempt to determine which regime killed more people, saying that apologists of each regime are trying to defend their side by claiming the other was responsible for more deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personality cult====
Lewin and Kershaw place the [[cult of personality]] at the center of their comparison of Nazism and Stalinism, writing that both regimes “represented a new genre of political system centred upon the artificial construct of a leadership cult – the ‘heroic myth’ of the ‘great leader’, no longer a king or emperor but a ‘man of the people.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to Stalinism, they emphasize its bureaucratic character, and its “merging of the most modern with the most archaic traits” by combining modern technology and the latest methods of administration and propaganda with the ancient practice of arbitrary rule by a single man.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They compare this with the [[Prussia]]n military tradition in Germany, which had been called “bureaucratic absolutism” in the eighteenth century, and which played a significant role in the organization of the Nazi state in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Kershaw agrees with Mommsen that there was a fundamental difference between Nazism and Stalinism regarding the importance of the leader. Stalinism had an absolute leader, but he was not essential. He could be replaced by another. Nazism, on the other hand, was a “classic charismatic leadership movement,” defined entirely by its leader. Stalinism had an ideology which existed independently of Stalin. But for Nazism, “Hitler ''was'' ideological orthodoxy” – Nazi ideals were by definition whatever Hitler said they were. In Stalinism, the bureaucratic apparatus was the foundation of the system, while in Nazism, the person of the leader was the foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshe Lewin also focuses on the comparison between the personality cults of Hitler and Stalin, and their respective roles in Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. He refers to them as the “Hitler myth” and the “Stalin myth,” and argues that they served different functions within their two regimes. The function of the “Hitler myth” was to legitimize Nazi rule. The function of the “Stalin myth” was to legitimize not Soviet rule itself, but Stalin’s leadership within the Party. Stalin’s personality cult existed precisely because Stalin knew that he was replaceable, and feared that he might be replaced, and so needed to bolster his authority as much as possible. While the “Hitler myth” was essential to Nazi Germany, the “Stalin myth” was essential only to Stalin, not to the Soviet Union itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intrinsic instability of totalitarian systems====
Together with fellow historian [[Hans Mommsen]], Lewin argues that the Stalinist and Nazi regimes featured an “intrinsic structural contradiction” which led to “inherent self-destructiveness”: they depended on a highly organized state bureaucracy which was trying to set up complex rules and procedures for every aspect of life, yet this bureaucracy was under the complete personal control of a despot who made policy decisions as he saw fit, routinely changing his mind on major issues, without any regard for the rules and institutions which his own bureaucracy had set up.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The bureaucracy and the leader needed each other, but also undermined each other with their different priorities. Mommsen sees this as being a much greater problem in Nazi Germany than in Stalin’s Soviet Union, as the Nazis inherited large parts of the traditional German bureaucracy, while the Soviets largely built their own bureaucracy from the ground up.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that many of the irrational features of the Nazi regime – such as wasting resources on exterminating undesirable populations instead of using those resources in the war effort – were caused by the dysfunction of the Nazi state rather than by fanatical commitment to Nazi ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with the [[Führerprinzip]], all decisional power in the Nazi state ultimately rested with Hitler. But Hitler often issued only vague and general directives, forcing other Nazi leaders lower down in the hierarchy to guess what precisely the Führer wanted. This confusion produced competition between Nazi officials, as each of them attempted to prove that he was a more dedicated Nazi than his rivals, by engaging in ever more extreme policies. This competition to please Hitler was, according to Mommsen, the real cause of Nazi irrationality.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler was aware of it, and deliberately encouraged it out of a “social-darwinist conviction that the best man would ultimately prevail.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen argues that this represents a structural difference between the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. In spite of its purges, Stalin’s regime was more effective in building a stable bureaucracy, such that it was possible for the system to sustain itself and continue even without Stalin. The Nazi regime, on the other hand, was much more personalized and depended entirely on Hitler, being unable to build any lasting institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 85-87&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stalin and Hitler====
Kershaw also saw  major personal differences between Stalin and Hitler and their respective styles of rule. He describes Stalin as “a committee man, chief oligarch, man of the machine” and a “creature of his party,” who came to power only thanks to his party and his ability to manipulate the levers of power within that party.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler, by contrast, came to power based on his charisma and mass appeal, and in the Nazi regime it was the leader that created the party instead of the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kershaw, “Stalin was a highly interventionist dictator, sending a stream of letters and directives determining or interfering with policy,” while Hitler “was a non-interventionist dictator as far as government administration was concerned,” preferring to involve himself in military affairs and plans for conquest rather than the daily routine of government work, and giving only broad verbal instructions to his subordinates regarding civilian affairs, which they were expected to translate into policy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 91-92&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, although both regimes featured all-pervasive cults of personality, there was a qualitative difference between those cults. Stalin’s personality cult was “superimposed upon the Marxist-Leninist ideology and Communist Party,” and could be abandoned (or replaced with a personality cult around some other leader) without major changes to the regime. On the other hand, “the ‘Hitler myth’ was structurally indispensable to, in fact the very basis of, and scarcely distinguishable from, the Nazi Movement and its ''Weltanschauung''.”&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in the person of Adolf Hitler as the unique savior of the German nation was the very foundation of Nazism, to such an extent that Nazism found it impossible to even imagine a successor to Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in Kershaw’s analysis, Stalinism was a fundamentally bureaucratic system while Nazism was the embodiment of “charismatic authority” as described by [[Max Weber]]. Stalinism could exist without its leader. Nazism could not. &lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw and Moshe Lewin (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: dictatorships in comparison'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-521-56521-9}}, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rousso, Werth, and Burrin ==
[[File:Nicolas Werth 04-2012.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Werth in 2012]]
The topic of comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism was also studied in the 1990s and 2000s by historians [[Henry Rousso]], [[Nicolas Werth]] and Philippe Burrin.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===The differences between Stalinism and Nazism===
Rousso defends the work of Carl Friedrich by pointing out that Friedrich himself had only said that Stalinism and Nazism were comparable, not that they were identical. Rousso also argues that the popularity of the concept of totalitarianism (the way that large numbers of people have come to routinely refer to certain governments as “totalitarian”) should be seen as evidence that the concept is useful, that it really describes a specific type of government which is different from other dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, however, Rousso notes that the concept of totalitarianism is descriptive rather than analytical: the regimes described as totalitarian do not have a common origin and did not arise in similar ways. Nazism is unique among totalitarian regimes in having taken power in “a country endowed with an advanced industrial economy and with a system of political democracy (and an even older political pluralism).” All other examples of totalitarianism (including the Stalinist regime) took power, according to Rousso, “in an agrarian economy, in a poor society without a tradition of political pluralism, not to mention democracy, and where diverse forms of tyranny had traditionally prevailed.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He sees this as a weakness of the concept of totalitarianism, because it merely describes the similarities between Stalinism and Nazism without dealing with the very different ways they came to power.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Rousso agrees with Hannah Arendt that “totalitarian regimes constitute something new in regard to classical tyranny, authoritarian regimes, or other forms of ancient and medieval dictatorships,” and he says that the main strength of the concept of totalitarianism is the way it highlights this inherent novelty of the regimes involved.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict between the dictator and bureaucracy===
Nicolas Werth and Philippe Burrin have worked together on comparative assessments of Stalinism and Nazism, with Werth covering the Stalinist regime and Burrin covering Nazi Germany. One of the topics they have studied is the question of how much power the dictator really held in the two regimes. Werth identifies two main [[historiography|historiographical]] approaches in the study of the Stalinist regime: Those who emphasize the power and control exercised by Joseph Stalin himself, attributing most of the actions of the Soviet government to deliberate plans and decisions made by him, and those who argue that Stalin had no pre-determined course of action in mind, that he was reacting to events as they unfolded, and that the Soviet bureaucracy had its own agenda which often differed from Stalin’s wishes.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Werth regards these as two mistaken extremes, one making Stalin seem all-powerful, the other making him seem like a weak dictator.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; But he believes that the competing perspectives are useful in drawing attention to the tension between two different forms of organization in the Stalinist USSR: an “administrative system of command,” bureaucratic and resistant to change but effective in running the Soviet state, and the strategy of “running the country in a crudely despotic way by Stalin and his small cadre of directors.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Werth agrees with Lewin that there was an inherent conflict between the priorities of the Soviet bureaucracy and Stalin’s accumulation of absolute power in his own hands. According to Werth, it was this unresolved and unstated conflict that led to the Great Purge and to the use of terror by Stalin’s regime against its own party and state cadres.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In studying similar issues with regard to the Nazi regime, Philippe Burrin draws attention to the debate between the “Intentionalist” and “Functionalist” schools of thought, which dealt with the question of whether the Nazi regime represented an extension of Hitler’s autocratic will, faithfully obeying his wishes, or whether it was an essentially chaotic and uncontrollable system that functioned on its own with little direct input from the Führer.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Like Kershaw and Lewin, Burrin says that the relationship between the leader and his party’s ideology was different in Nazism compared to Stalinism: “One can rightly state that Nazism cannot be dissociated from Hitlerism, something that is difficult to affirm for Bolshevism and Stalinism.” Unlike Stalin, who inherited an existing system with an existing ideology and presented himself as the heir to the Leninist political tradition, Hitler created both his movement and its ideology by himself, claiming to be “someone sent by Providence, a Messiah whom the German people had been expecting for centuries, even for two thousand years, as Heinrich Himmler enjoyed saying.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there could be no real conflict between the Party and the leader in Nazi Germany, because the Nazi Party’s entire reason for existence was to support and follow Hitler. However, there was a potential for division between the leader and the state bureaucracy, due to the way that Nazism came to power – as part of an alliance with traditional conservative elites, industrialists, and the army.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the USSR, Nazi Germany did not build its own state, but rather inherited the state machinery of the previous government. This provided the Nazis with an immediate supply of capable and experienced managers and military commanders, but on the other hand it also meant that the Nazi regime had to rely on the cooperation of people who had not been Nazis prior to Hitler’s rise to power, and whose loyalty was questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 58-59&lt;/ref&gt; It was only during the war, when Nazi Germany conquered large territories and had to create Nazi administrations for them, that brand new Nazi bureaucracies were created without any input or participation from traditional German elites. This produced a surprising difference between Nazism and Stalinism: When the Stalinist USSR conquered territory, it created smaller copies of itself and installed them as the governments of the occupied countries. When Nazi Germany conquered territory, on the other hand, it did not attempt to create copies of the German government back home. Instead, it experimented with different power structures and policies, often reflecting a “far more ample Nazification of society than what the balance of power authorized in the Reich.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of terror and violence===
Another major topic investigated by Werth and Burrin was the violence and terror employed by the regimes of Hitler and Stalin. Werth reports that the Stalinist USSR underwent an “extraordinary brutalization of the relations between state and society” for the purpose of rapid modernization and industrialization, to “gain one hundred years in one decade, and to metamorphose the country into a great industrial power.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; This transformation was accomplished at the cost of massive violence and a sociopolitical regression into what Werth calls “military-feudal exploitation.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The types of violence employed by the Stalinist regime included loss of civil rights, mass arrests, deportations of entire ethnic groups from one part of the USSR to another, forced labor in the [[Gulag]], mass executions (especially during the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1937-38), and most of all the great famine of 1932-33, known as the [[Holodomor]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 73-74&lt;/ref&gt; All levels of Soviet society were affected by Stalinist repression, from the top to the bottom. At the top, high-ranking members of the Communist Party were arrested and executed under the claim that they had plotted against Stalin (and in some cases they were forced to confess to imaginary crimes in [[Moscow Trials|show trials]]). At the bottom, the peasantry suffered the Holodomor famine (especially in [[Ukraine]]), and even outside of the famine years they were faced with very high grain quotas.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Werth identifies four categories of people that became the targets of Stalinist violence in the USSR. He lists them from smallest to largest. The first and smallest group consisted of many of Stalin’s former comrades-in-arms, who had participated in the revolution and were known as “[[Old Bolshevik]]s.” They were dangerous to Stalin because they had known him before his rise to power and could expose the many false claims made by his personality cult. The second group consisted of mid-level Communist Party officials, who were subject to mass arrests and executions in the late 1930s, particularly during the Great Purge. Eliminating them served a dual purpose: It helped Stalin to centralize power in the Kremlin (as opposed to regional centers), and it also provided him with “corrupt officials” that he could blame for earlier repressions and unpopular policies. Werth draws parallels between this and the old [[Tsarist]] tradition of blaming “bad bureaucrats” – rather than the [[Tsar]] – for unpopular government actions.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; The third group was made up of ordinary citizens from all walks of life who resorted to petty crime in order to provide for themselves in the face of worsening living standards (for example by taking home some wheat from the fields or tools from the factory). This type of petty crime became very widespread, and was often punished as if it were intentional sabotage motivated by political opposition to the USSR. The fourth and largest category consisted of ethnic groups that were subject to deportation, famine, or arbitrary arrests under the suspicion of being collectively disloyal to Stalin or to the Soviet state. This included the Holodomor famine directed at the [[Ukrainians]], the deportation of ethnic groups suspected of pro-German sympathies (such as the [[Volga Germans]], the [[Crimean Tatars]], the [[Chechens]] and others), and eventually also persecution of ethnic [[Jews]], especially as [[Stalin and antisemitism|Stalin grew increasingly antisemitic]] near the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrin’s study of violence carried out by the Nazi regime begins with the observation that “violence is at the heart of Nazism,” and that Nazi violence is “established as a doctrine and exalted in speech.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; This marks a point of difference between Nazism and Stalinism, according to Burrin. In Stalinism, there was a gulf between ideology and reality when it came to violence. The Soviet regime continuously denied that it was repressive, proclaimed itself a defender of peace, and sought to conceal all the evidence to the contrary. In Nazism, on the other hand, “doctrine and reality were fused from the start.” Nazism not only practiced violent repression and war, but advocated it in principle as well, considering war to be a positive force in human civilization and openly seeking [[lebensraum|”living space”]] and the domination of the European continent by ethnic Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Burrin identifies three motivations for Nazi violence: political repression, exclusion and social repression, and racial politics.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these, political repression, is common in many dictatorships. The Nazis aimed to eliminate their real or imagined political opponents, first in the Reich and later in the occupied territories during the war. Some of these opponents were executed, while others were imprisoned in [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]. The first targets of political repression, immediately after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933, were the parties of the Left in general and the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Then, after the mid-1930s, repression was extended to members of the clergy, and later to the conservative opposition as well (especially after the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944). The death penalty was used on a wide scale, even before the war. During the war, political repression was greatly expanded both inside Germany and especially in the newly occupied territories. Political prisoners in the concentration camps numbered only about 25,000 at the beginning of the war. By January 1945 they had swelled to 714,211 – most of them non-Germans accused of plotting against the Reich.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The second type of Nazi violence, motivated by exclusion and social repression, was the violence aimed at purging German society of people whose lifestyle was considered incompatible with the social norms of the Nazi regime (even if the people involved were racially pure and able-bodied). Such people were divided into two categories: [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and “asocials.” The “asocials” were only vaguely defined, and included “Gypsies, tramps, beggars, prostitutes, alcoholics, the jobless who refused any employment, and those who left their work frequently or for no reason.”&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and final type of Nazi violence, by far the most extensive, was violence motivated by [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policies]]. This was aimed both inward, to cleanse the “Aryan race” of “degenerate” elements and [[life unworthy of life]], as well as outward, to seek the extermination of [[Untermensch|“inferior races”]]. Germans considered physically or mentally unfit were among the first victims. One of the first laws of the Nazi regime mandated the forced sterilization of people suffering from physical handicaps or who had psychiatric conditions deemed to be hereditary. Later, sterilization was replaced by murder of the mentally ill and of people with severe disabilities, as part of a “euthanasia” program called [[Aktion T4]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; Burrin notes that this served no practical political purpose – the people being murdered could not have possibly been political opponents of the regime – so the motivation was purely a matter of racial ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; The most systematic and by far the most large-scale acts of Nazi violence, however, were directed at “racially inferior” non-German populations. As laid out in ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'', the Nazis wished to eliminate most of the [[Slavs|Slavic]] populations of Eastern Europe, partly through deportation and partly through murder, in order to secure land for ethnic German settlement and colonization.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; But even more urgently, the Nazis wished to exterminate the [[Jews]] of Europe, whom they regarded as the implacable racial enemy of the Germans. This culminated in the [[Holocaust]], the Nazi [[genocide]] of the Jews. Unlike in the case of all other target populations, the Jews were to be exterminated completely, with no individual exceptions for any reason.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Rousso (ed.), ''Stalinism and Nazism: history and memory compared'', University of Nebraska Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-8032-9000-6}}, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geyer and Fitzpatrick ==
In ''Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared'', editors [[Michael Geyer]] and [[Sheila Fitzpatrick]] disputed the concept of totalitarianism, noting that the term entered political discourse first as a term of self-description by the Italian Fascists and was only later used as a framework to compare Nazi Germany with the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the totalitarian states were not as monolithic or as ideology-driven as they seemed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Geyer and Fitzpatrick describe Nazi Germany and the Stalinist USSR as “immensely powerful, threatening, and contagious dictatorships” who “shook the world in their antagonism.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Without calling them totalitarian, they identified their common features, including genocide, an all-powerful party, a charismatic leader, and pervasive invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; However, they argue that Stalinism and Nazism did not represent a new and unique type of government, but rather that they can be placed in the broader context of the turn to dictatorship in Europe in the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The reason they appear extraordinary is because they were the “most prominent, most hard-headed, and most violent” of the European dictatorships of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; They are comparable because of their “shock and awe” and sheer ruthlessness, but underneath superficial similarities they were fundamentally different and that “when it comes to one-on-one comparison, the two societies and regimes may as well have hailed from different worlds.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Geyer and Fitzpatrick, the similarities between Nazism and Stalinism stem from the fact that they were both “ideology driven” and sought to subordinate all aspects of life to their respective ideologies. The differences stem from the fact that their ideologies were opposed to each other and regarded each other as enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Another major difference is that Stalin created a stable and long-lasting regime, while Nazi Germany had a “short-lived, explosive nature.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the stable state created by Stalinism was based on an entirely new elite, while Nazism, despite having the support of the traditional elite, failed to achieve stability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the two regimes did borrow ideas from one another, especially regarding propaganda techniques (most of all in architecture and cinema), but also in terms of state surveillance and antisemitism. At the same time, they both vigorously denied borrowing anything from each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; While their methods of propaganda were similar, the content was different. For instance, Soviet wartime propaganda revolved around the idea of resisting imperial aggression, while Nazi propaganda was about wars of racial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Geyer and Fitzpatrick also take note of the fact that both Stalinism and Nazism sought to create a New Man, an “entirely modern, illiberal, and self-fashioned personage,” even though they had different visions about what being a “New Man” would mean.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopolitics, eugenics and social engineering===
Among the other authors contributing to the volume edited by Geyer and Fitzpatrick, David Hoffmann and Annette Timm discuss [[biopolitics]] and the pro-natalist policies of the Nazi and Stalinist regimes. Both governments were highly concerned over low fertility rates in their respective populations, and applied extensive and intrusive [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] techniques to increase the number of births.&lt;ref name="Geyer9"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 83-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Reproductive policies in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were administered through their health care systems—both regimes saw health care as a key pillar to their designs to develop a new society.&lt;ref name="Geyer11a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Soviet Union had to design a public health care system from scratch, Nazi Germany built upon the pre-existing public health care system in Germany that had existed since 1883, when [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s legislation had created the world's first national public health care program.&lt;ref name="Geyer11a"/&gt; The Nazis centralized the German health care system in order to enforce Nazi ideological components upon it, and replaced existing voluntary and government welfare agencies with new ones that were devoted to racial hygiene and other components of Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="Geyer11"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi and Stalinist attempt to control family size was not unique, as many other European states practiced [[eugenics]] at this time, and the Stalinist and Nazi ideals were vastly different.&lt;ref name="Geyer6"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, they had more in common with third parties than with each other: Nazi Germany’s policies were rather similar to those in Scandinavia at the time, while the USSR’s policies resembled those in Catholic countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;The common point between Nazi and Stalinist practices was the connection of reproduction policies with the ideological goals of the state — "part of the project of a rational, hypermodern vision for the re-organization of society".&lt;ref name="Geyer7"&gt;[[Comparison of Nazism and Stalinism#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; There were nevertheless substantial differences between the two regimes' approaches. Stalin's Soviet Union never officially supported eugenics as the Nazis did—the Soviet government called eugenics a "fascist science"—although there were in fact Soviet eugenicists.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/connections/54ece589642e09bce5000001|title=Russia (former USSR)|work=The Eugenics Archives|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two regimes also had different approaches to the relationship between family and paid labor—Nazism promoted the male single-breadwinner family while Stalinism promoted the dual-wage-earner household.&lt;ref name="Geyer8"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass violence, xenophobia and persecution of ethnic minorities===
In another contribution to the same volume, Christian Gerlach and Nicolas Werth discuss the topic of mass violence, and the way that it was used by both Stalinism and Nazism.&lt;ref name="Geyer13"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stalin's Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were violent societies where mass violence was accepted by the state, such as in the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1937 to 1938 in the Soviet Union and [[the Holocaust]] in Nazi Germany and its occupied territories in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Geyer15"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. Pp. 135, 139-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Stalinist Soviet Union and Nazi Germany utilized internment camps led by agents of the state – the NKVD in the Soviet Union and the SS in Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Geyer13" /&gt; They also both engaged in violence against minorities based on [[xenophobia]] – the xenophobic violence of the Nazis was outspoken but rationalized as being against "asocial" elements while the xenophobic violence of the Stalinists was disguised as being against "anti-soviet", "[[counter-revolutionary]]" and "socially harmful" elements – a term which often targeted diaspora nationalities.&lt;ref name="Geyer14"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stalinist Soviet Union established "special settlements" where the "socially harmful" or "socially dangerous" who included ex-convicts, criminals, vagrants, the disenfranchised and "declassed elements" were expelled to.&lt;ref name="Geyer15a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. Pp. 139-140.&lt;/ref&gt; These "special settlements" were largely in Siberia, the far north, the Urals, or other inhospitable territories.&lt;ref name="Geyer16"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1933, the Soviet Union made a mass arrest of 5000 [[Romani people]] effectively on the basis of their ethnicity, who were deported that month to the "special settlements" in Western Siberia.&lt;ref name="Geyer16" /&gt; In 1935, the Soviet Union arrested 160,000 homeless people and juvenile delinquents and sent many of them to NKVD labor colonies where they did [[forced labor]].&lt;ref name="Geyer17"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi regime was founded upon a racialist view of politics and envisioned the deportation or extermination of the majority of the population of Eastern Europe in order to open up “living space” for ethnic German settlers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; This was mainly intended to be carried out after an eventual German victory in the war, but steps had already started being taken while the war was still ongoing. For instance, by the end of 1942, the Nazis had deported 365,000 Poles and Jews from their original homes in western Poland (now German-annexed) and into the [[General Government]]. A further 194,000 Poles were internally displaced (not deported to another territory but expelled from their homes). The Nazis had also deported 100,000 persons from Alsace, Lorraine, and Luxembourg, as well as 54,000 Slovenians.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalinism in practice in the Soviet Union pursued ethnic deportations from the 1930s to the early 1950s, with a total of 3 million Soviet citizens being subjected to ethnic-based resettlement.&lt;ref name="Geyer17a"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt; The first major ethnic deportation took place from December 1932 to January 1933, during which some 60,000 Kuban Cossacks were collectively criminally charged as a whole with association with resistance to socialism and affiliation with Ukrainian nationalism.&lt;ref name="Geyer18"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1935 to 1936, the Soviet Union deported Soviet citizens of Polish and German origins living in the western districts of Ukraine, and Soviet citizens of Finnish origins living on the Finland-Soviet Union border.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; These deportations from 1935 to 1936 affected tens of thousands of families.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; From September to October 1937, Soviet authorities deported the Korean minority from its Far Eastern region that bordered on Japanese-controlled Korea.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; Soviet authorities claimed the territory was "rich soil for the Japanese to till" – implying a Soviet suspicion that the Koreans could potentially join forces with the Japanese to unite the land with Japanese-held Korea.&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt; Over 170,000 Koreans were deported to remote parts of Soviet Central Asia from September to October 1937. These ethnically-based deportations reflected a new trend in Stalinist policy, a "Soviet xenophobia" based on ideological grounds that suspected that these people were susceptible to foreign influence, and which was also based on a resurgent [[Russian nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Geyer18" /&gt;

After Nazi Germany declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941, the Soviet Union initiated another major round of ethnic deportations. The first group targeted were Soviet Germans. Between September 1941 and February 1942, 900,000 people – over 70 percent of the entire Soviet German community – were deported to Kazakhstan and Siberia in mass operations.&lt;ref name="Geyer19"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of mass deportations took place between November 1943 and May 1944, in which Soviet authorities expelled six ethnic groups (the [[Balkars]], [[Chechens]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Karachai]], and [[Kalmyks]]) that together numbered 900,000.&lt;ref name="Geyer20"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also smaller-scale operations involving ethnic cleansing of diaspora minorities during and after World War II, in which tens of thousands of Crimean Bulgarians, Greeks, Iranians, Khemshils, Kurds, and Meskhetian Turks were deported from the Black Sea and Transcaucasian border regions.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt;

Two ethnic groups that were specifically targeted for persecution by Stalin's Soviet Union were the Chechens and the Ingush.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; Unlike the other nationalities that could be suspected of connection to foreign states which shared their ethnic background, the Chechens and the Ingush were completely indigenous people of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; Rather than being accused of collaboration with foreign enemies, these two ethnic groups were considered to have cultures which did not fit in with Soviet culture – such as accusing Chechens of being associated with “banditism” – and the authorities claimed that the Soviet Union had to intervene in order to “remake” and “reform” these cultures.&lt;ref name="Geyer20" /&gt; In practice this meant heavily armed punitive operations carried out against Chechen “bandits” that failed to achieve forced assimilation, culminating in an ethnic cleansing operation in 1944, which involved the arrests and deportation of over 500,000 Chechens and Ingush from the [[Caucasus]] to [[Central Asia]] and [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name="Geyer21"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; The deportations of the Chechens and Ingush also involved the outright massacre of thousands of people, and severe conditions placed upon the deportees – they were put in unsealed train cars, with little to no food for a four-week journey during which many died from hunger and exhaustion.&lt;ref name="Geyer22"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between Nazi and Stalinist deportations was in their purpose: while Nazi Germany sought ethnic cleansing to allow settlement by Germans into the cleansed territory, Stalin's Soviet Union pursued ethnic cleansing in order to remove minorities from strategically important areas.&lt;ref name="Geyer23"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other scholars==
&lt;!-- This section contains statements sourced to scholarly authors who have written on the topic of the comparison between Nazism and Stalinism, but for whom we only have a little information in the article at the moment, so it would not make sense to assign a separate section to each of them. As the material cited to a given author grows beyond two or three paragraphs, consider giving that author a dedicated section. --&gt;

Other historians and political scientists have also made comparisons between Nazism and Stalinism as part of their work.

[[Stanley Payne]], in his work on fascism, said that although the Nazi Party was ideologically opposed to communism, Adolf Hitler and other Nazi leaders frequently expressed recognition that only in Soviet Russia were their revolutionary and ideological counterparts to be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley Payne|title=Fascism: Comparison and Definition|date=15 March 1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=9780299080648|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both placed a major emphasis on creating a "party-army," with the regular armed forces controlled by the party. In the case of the Soviet Union this was done through the [[political commissar]]s, while Nazi Germany introduced a roughly equivalent leadership role for "National Socialist Guidance Officers" in 1943.&lt;ref name="Payne1"&gt;[[#Payne1983|Payne (1983)]]. p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Furet]], in his work on communism, noted that Hitler personally admired Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, and on numerous occasions publicly praised Stalin for seeking to purify the Communist Party of the Soviet Union of Jewish influences, especially by purging Jewish communists such as [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Grigory Zinoviev]], [[Lev Kamenev]] and [[Karl Radek]].&lt;ref name="François Furet 1999. Pp. 191-192"&gt;François Furet. ''Passing of an Illusion: The Idea of Communism in the Twentieth Century''. University of Chicago Press, 1999. {{ISBN|0-226-27340-7}}. Pp. 191-192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Pipes]] draws attention to [[Stalin and antisemitism|Stalin and his antisemitism]] in a parallel with [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi antisemitism]]. He notes that soon after the 1917 October Revolution, the Soviet Union undertook practices to break up Jewish culture, religion and language. In the fall of 1918, the Soviet Communist Party set up the Jewish section [[Yevsektsiya]], with a stated mission of “destruction of traditional Jewish life, the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement, and Hebrew culture.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Pipes]], "Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; By 1919, the Bolsheviks  began to confiscate Jewish properties, Hebrew schools, libraries, books, and synagogues in accordance with newly imposed anti-religious laws, turning their buildings into "Communist centers, clubs or restaurants."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, "Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime", New York: NY, Vintage Books, Random House Inc., 1995, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; After Joseph Stalin rose to power, antisemitism continued to be endemic throughout Russia, although official Soviet policy condemned it. On August 12, 1952, Stalin's personal antisemitism became more visible, as he ordered the execution of the most prominent Yiddish authors in the Soviet Union, in an event known as the "[[Night of the Murdered Poets]]". Shortly before his death, Stalin also organized the anti-Semitic campaign known as the [[Doctors' plot]].

A number of research institutions are focusing on the analysis of fascism/Nazism and Stalinism/communism, and the comparative approach, including the [[Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism]] in Germany, the [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]] in the Czech Republic and the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] in Poland.

In comparing the deaths caused by both Stalin and Hitler's policies, some historians have asserted that archival evidence released after the collapse of the USSR confirms that Stalin did not kill more people than Hitler. American historian [[Timothy D. Snyder]], for example, after assessing such data, says that while the Nazi regime killed approximately 11 million non-combatants (which rises to above 12 million if "foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included"), Stalin's deliberately killed about 6 million (rising to 9 million if foreseeable deaths arising from policies are taken into account).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|title=Hitler vs. Stalin: Who Was Worse?|website=The New York Review of Books|date=27 January 2011|url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2011/01/27/hitler-vs-stalin-who-was-worse/|accessdate=25 May 2018|quote=" The total number of noncombatants killed by the Germans—about 11 million—is roughly what we had thought. The total number of civilians killed by the Soviets, however, is considerably less than we had believed. We know now that the Germans killed more people than the Soviets did . . . All in all, the Germans deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants, a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included. For the Soviets during the Stalin period, the analogous figures are approximately six million and nine million. These figures are of course subject to revision, but it is very unlikely that the consensus will change again as radically as it has since the opening of Eastern European archives in the 1990s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian historian and archival researcher [[Stephen G. Wheatcroft]] posits that "The Stalinist regime was consequently responsible for about a million purposive killings, and through its criminal neglect and irresponsibility it was probably responsible for the premature deaths of about another two million more victims amongst the repressed population, i.e. in the camps, colonies, prisons, exile, in transit and in the POW camps for Germans. These are clearly much lower figures than those for whom Hitler's regime was responsible." Wheatcroft also says that, unlike Hitler, Stalin's "purposive killings" fit more closely into the category of "execution" than "murder", given he thought the accused were indeed guilty of crimes against the state and insisted on documentation, whereas Hitler simply wanted to kill Jews and communists because of who they were, and insisted on no documentation and was indifferent at even a pretence of legality for these actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/WCR-German_Soviet.pdf|title=The Scale and Nature of German and Soviet Repression and Mass Killings, 1930–45|last=Wheatcroft|first=S.

[[Kristen R. Ghodsee]], an ethnographer of post-Cold War Eastern Europe, contends that the efforts to institutionalize the "double genocide thesis", or the moral equivalence between the Nazi Holocaust (race murder) and the victims of communism (class murder), and in particular the recent push at the beginning of the global financial crisis for commemoration of the latter in Europe, can be seen as the response by economic and political elites to fears of a leftist resurgence in the face of devastated economies and extreme inequalities in both the East and West as the result of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] capitalism. She notes that any discussion of the achievements under communism, including literacy, education, women’s rights, and social security is usually silenced, and any discourse on the subject of communism is focused almost exclusively on Stalin's crimes and the "double genocide thesis", an intellectual paradigm summed up as such: "1) any move towards redistribution and away from a completely free market is seen as communist; 2) anything communist inevitably leads to class murder; and 3) class murder is the moral equivalent of the Holocaust." By linking all leftist and socialist ideals to the excesses of Stalinism, Ghodsee concludes, the elites in the West hope to discredit and marginalize all political ideologies that could "threaten the primacy of private property and free markets."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1= Ghodsee|first1=Kristen R.|volume = 4| issue = 2| pages = 115–142|title = A Tale of "Two Totalitarianisms": The Crisis of Capitalism and the Historical Memory of Communism| journal = History of the Present| date = 2014|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kristenghodsee/files/history_of_the_present_galleys.pdf | jstor = 10.5406/historypresent.4.2.0115|authorlink=Kristen R.

The comparison of Stalinism and Nazism remains a neglected field of academic study.&lt;ref name="Geyer5"&gt;[[#Geyer2009|Geyer (2009)]]. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In political discourse==
[[File:Kurt Schumacher.jpg|thumb|right|Leading [[West Germany|West German]] [[social democrat]] [[Kurt Schumacher]] said that the communists were "red-painted Nazis"&lt;ref&gt;Giangreco, D.M and Griffin, Robert E.

Retrieved 24 Aug 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the two movements enabled each other.]]

The comparison of Nazism and Stalinism has long provoked political controversy,&lt;ref name="Kershaw, Ian; Moshé Lewin"&gt;Kershaw pp3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleck&gt;{{cite book|last=Fleck |first=Christian|title=Intellectuals and their publics: perspectives from the social sciences|year=2008|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-7540-2|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it led to [[Historikerstreit|the historians' dispute]] within Germany in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Lévy, Daniel. Sznaider, Natan"&gt;Lévy pp76&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), under the leadership of Chancellor [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]], adopted the view that "red equals brown", i.e. that the communists and Nazis posed an equal danger to [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Adelheid von Saldern, ''The Challenge of Modernity: German Social and Cultural Studies, 1890-1960'', University of Michigan Press (2002), {{ISBN|0-472-10986-3}}, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, [[Kurt Schumacher]] said that the two movements enabled each other. He argued that the [[Communist Party of Germany]], which was staunchly Stalinist, were "red-painted Nazis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lasten diktatorischer Vergangenheit, Herausforderungen demokratischer Gegenwart |last=Richter |first=Michael |editor1-first=Gerhard |editor1-last=Besier |editor2-first=Katarzyna |editor2-last=Stoklosa |series=Mittel- und Ostmitteleuropastudien |year=2006 |publisher=LIT Verlag |location=Münster |page=202 |chapter=Die doppelte Diktatur. Erfahrungen mit Diktatur in der DDR und Auswirkungen auf das Verhältnis zur Diktatur heute |url= |accessdate= |isbn=3-8258-8789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison was mirrored by the [[social fascism]] theory advanced by the Soviet government and the [[Comintern]] (including the Communist Party of Germany), which accused [[social democracy]] of enabling fascism and went as far as to call social democrats "social fascists."&lt;ref&gt;Horst Ehmke, ''Mittendrin: von der grossen Koalition zur deutschen Einheit'', Rowohlt, 1994, {{ISBN|3-87134-089-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1939 [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] was announced, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an editorial arguing that "Hitlerism is brown communism, Stalinism is red fascism."&lt;ref&gt;"Editorial: The Russian Betrayal", ''The New York Times'', Sept. 18, 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

Marxist theories of fascism have seen fascism as a form of reaction to socialism and a feature of capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Dave Renton. ''Fascism: Theory and Practice''. London: Pluto Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern historians have tried to pay more attention to the economic, political and ideological differences between these two regimes than to their similarities.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Henry Rousso. "Stalinism and Nazism. History and Memory Compared". ''Historische Zeitschrift''. 286:3, 2008. Pp. 795–796.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2008 [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]], initiated by the [[Czech government]] and signed by figures such as [[Václav Havel]], called for "a common approach regarding crimes of totalitarian regimes, inter alia Communist regimes" and for
{{quote|reaching an all-European understanding that both the Nazi and Communist totalitarian regimes each to be judged by their own terrible merits to be destructive in their policies of systematically applying extreme forms of terror, suppressing all civic and human liberties, starting aggressive wars and, as an inseparable part of their ideologies, exterminating and deporting whole nations and groups of population; and that as such they should be considered to be the main disasters, which blighted the 20th century.&lt;ref name="declaration-text"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.praguedeclaration.eu/ |title=Prague Declaration - Declaration Text |date=3 June 2008 |publisher=[[Institute for Information on the Crimes of Communism]] |accessdate=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Communist Party of Greece]] opposes the Prague Declaration and has criticized "the new escalation of the [[anti-communist]] hysteria led by the EU council, the European Commission and the political staff of the bourgeois class in the European Parliament."&lt;ref name="CommunistPartyGreece"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://inter.kke.gr/News/news2011/2011-02-03-anticom-euparliament/ |title= Statement-condemnation of the escalation of the anti-communist hysteria by the EU |date= 2011-02-03 |publisher= [[Communist Party of Greece]] |accessdate= 2011-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Communist Party of Britain]] opined that the Prague Declaration "is a rehash of the persistent attempts by reactionary historians to equate Soviet Communism and Hitlerite Fascism, echoing the old slanders of British authors [[George Orwell]] and [[Robert Conquest]]."&lt;ref name="CommunistPartyUK"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://communist-party.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=742%3Acp-contribution-to-international-conference-on-prague-declaration&amp;catid=128%3Aconferences&amp;Itemid=162 |title=CP contribution to International Conference on Prague Declaration |date=13 February 2010 |publisher=[[Communist Party of Britain]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64orFpG5S?url=http://communist-party.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=742%3Acp-contribution-to-international-conference-on-prague-declaration&amp;catid=128%3Aconferences&amp;Itemid=162 |accessdate=2011-05-16 |archivedate=19 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 documentary film ''[[The Soviet Story]]'', commissioned by the [[Union for Europe of the Nations]] group in the [[European Parliament]], published archival records which listed thousands of German Jews who were arrested in the Soviet Union by the [[NKVD]] (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) from 1937 to 1941 and handed over to [[Gestapo]] or SS officials in Germany. These German Jews had originally sought asylum in the USSR. The documentary film accuses Stalin's regime of being an accomplice in Hitler's Holocaust by arresting these asylum seekers and sending them back to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;''The Soviet Story'', Edvins Snore, writer/director, 85-minute documentary, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009, the [[European Union]] has officially commemorated the [[European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism]],&lt;ref name="Buzek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html |title=President Jerzy Buzek on the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yf46Gk7v?url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/president/view/en/press/press_release/2010/2010-August/press_release-2010-August-10.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; proclaimed by the [[European Parliament]] in 2008&lt;ref name="Buzek" /&gt; and endorsed by the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8133749.stm|title=Resolution on Stalin riles Russia|date=3 July 2009|publisher=|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and officially known as the Black Ribbon Day in some countries (including Canada).&lt;ref name="TorontoSun2011"&gt;{{cite news |title=Victims of totalitarianism remembered |author= Daniel Proussalidis |url= http://www.torontosun.com/2011/08/23/victims-of-totalitarianism-remembered |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[President of the European Parliament]] and [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|Christian Democratic Union]] member, [[Hans-Gert Pöttering]], argued that "both totalitarian systems (Stalinism and Nazism) are comparable and terrible."&lt;ref name="eurolt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |title=Baltic States opened Western Europe's eyes on Soviet Union totalitarianism -- EP chairman in Vilnius |date=2009-04-28 |publisher=BNS |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722150204/http://www.euro.lt/en/news/lithuanias-membership-in-the-eu/news/5537/?print=1 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Eastern Europe]]an countries the denial of both Nazi and Communist crimes has been explicitly outlawed, and Czech foreign minister [[Karel Schwarzenberg]] has argued that "there is a fundamental concern here that totalitarian systems be measured by the same standard."&lt;ref name="romea"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php?id=detail&amp;detail=2007_2070 |title=Czech Foreign Minister: Denial of communist crimes like denial of Nazi crimes |publisher=Romea.cz |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yf7qICc8?url=http://www.romea.cz/english/index.php?id=detail&amp;detail=2007_2070 |archivedate=14 May 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[European Commission]] rejected calls for similar EU-wide legislation, due to the lack of consensus among member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EU rejects eastern states' call to outlaw denial of crimes by communist regimes|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/21/european-commission-communist-crimes-nazism|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 May 2011|location=London|first=Leigh |last=Phillips|date=2010-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement adopted by Russia's legislature said that comparisons of Nazism and Stalinism are "blasphemous towards all of the anti-fascist movement veterans, Holocaust victims, concentration camp prisoners and tens of millions of people ... who sacrificed their lives for the sake of the fight against the Nazis' anti-human racial theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rt.com/politics/nuremberg-trials-ww2-russia/ |title=Russian MPs call on world to suppress attempts to revive Nazi ideology |publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]] |date=2010-10-24|accessdate=2015-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British journalist [[Seumas Milne]] posits that the impact of the post-Cold War narrative that Stalin and Hitler were twin evils, and therefore Communism is as monstrous as Nazism, "has been to relativise the unique crimes of Nazism, bury those of colonialism and feed the idea that any attempt at radical social change will always lead to suffering, killing and failure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://m.guardian.co.uk/education/2002/sep/12/highereducation.historyandhistoryofart Seumas Milne: The battle for history].

{{wiktionary}}
The term '''cross-reference''' can refer to either:
* An instance within a [[document]] which refers to related information elsewhere in the same document. In both printed and online dictionaries cross-references are important because they form a network structure of relations existing between different parts of data, dictionary-internal as well as dictionary external.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro Nielsen (1999): "Mediostructures in Bilingual LSP Dictionaries." In: ''Lexicographica. International Annual for Lexicography'' 15, 90–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a cross reference is often denoted by ''See also''.  For example, under the term ''Albert Einstein'' in the index of a book about Nobel Laureates, there may be the cross-reference ''See also: Einstein, Albert''.
* In [[hypertext]], cross-referencing is maintained to a document with either in-context (XRIC) or out-of-context (''XROC'') cross-referencing.  These are similar to [[Key Word in Context|KWIC and KWOC]].
* In programming, "cross-referencing" means the listing of every file name and line number where a given [[identifier#In computer science|named identifier]] occurs within the program's [[source tree]].
* In a [[relational database management system]], a table can have an xref as prefix or suffix to indicate it is a [[cross-reference table]] that joins two or more tables together via [[primary key]].

== Structure of a cross reference ==
In a document, especially those authored in a [[Content management system]],
a cross-reference has two major aspects:
* A visible form that appears when the document is presented to the reader
* A technical mechanism that resides within the system

The visible form contains text, graphics, and other indications that:
* Enable the reader to follow the cross reference to the referenced content
* May enable the reader to understand what is being referred to, or what to expect upon following the reference
* May present to the reader some information from the referenced content

The technical mechanism that resides within the system:
* Identifies what location is being referred to
* Permits the system to present appropriate referencing text when the location containing the reference is presented to a reader
* Permits the system to offer a control (such as a link) that a reader can use when the content is presented in electronic form to access the referenced content

== How cross references contribute to usability of a document or set of documents ==
If the cross reference mechanism is well designed, the reader will be able to follow each cross reference to the referenced content whether the content is presented in print or electronically.

An author working in a content management system is responsible for identifying subjects of interest that cross documents, and creating appropriate systems of cross references to support readers who seek to understand those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rockley|first1=Ann|last2=Cooper|first2=Charles|title=Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy|date=2012|publisher=New Riders|isbn=978-0321815361|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an individual cross reference, an author should ensure that location and content of the target of the cross reference are clearly identified, and the reader can easily determine how to follow the cross reference in each medium in which publication is supported.

[[Content strategy]] practitioners (known as content strategists) specialize in planning content to meet business needs, taking into account the processes for creating and maintaining the content, and the systems that support the content.

[[File:Latin dictionary.jpg|thumb|A multi-volume Latin dictionary by [[Egidio Forcellini]].]]
[[File:Woerterbuchstapel Langenscheidt.jpg|thumb|[[Langenscheidt]] dictionaries]]
A '''dictionary''', sometimes known as a '''wordbook''', is a collection of [[word]]s in one or more specific [[language]]s, often arranged [[Alphabetical order|alphabetically]] (or by [[radical-and-stroke sorting|radical and stroke]] for [[ideographic]] languages), which may include information on [[definition]]s, usage, [[etymologies]], [[pronunciation]]s, translation, etc.&lt;ref name = Web1&gt;Webster's New World College Dictionary, Fourth Edition, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; or a book of words in one language with their equivalents in another, sometimes known as a [[lexicon]].&lt;ref name = Web1/&gt; It is a [[Lexicography|lexicographical]] reference that shows inter-relationships among the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Nielsen, Sandro |year = 2008 |title = The Effect of Lexicographical Information Costs on Dictionary Naming and Use | url = | journal = Lexikos |volume = 18 |issn= 1684-4904 |pages = 170–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broad distinction is made between general and [[specialized dictionaries]]. Specialized dictionaries include words in specialist fields, rather than a complete range of words in the language. Lexical items that describe concepts in specific fields are usually called terms instead of words, although there is no consensus whether [[lexicology]] and [[terminology]] are two different fields of study. In theory, general dictionaries are supposed{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} to be [[Semasiology|semasiological]], mapping word to [[definition]], while specialized dictionaries are supposed to be [[Onomasiology|onomasiological]], first identifying [[concept]]s and then establishing the terms used to designate them. In practice, the two approaches are used for both types.&lt;ref name="Sterkenburg2003"&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, pp. 155–157&lt;/ref&gt; There are other types of dictionaries that do not fit neatly into the above distinction, for instance [[bilingual dictionary|bilingual (translation) dictionaries]], dictionaries of [[synonym]]s ([[thesaurus|thesauri]]), and [[rhyming]] dictionaries. The word dictionary (unqualified) is usually understood to refer to a general purpose [[monolingual dictionary]].&lt;ref name=Sintro&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a contrast between [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']] dictionaries; the former reflect what is seen as correct use of the language while the latter reflect recorded actual use. Stylistic indications (e.g. "informal" or "vulgar") in many modern dictionaries are also considered by some to be less than objectively descriptive.&lt;ref&gt;A Practical Guide to Lexicography, Sterkenburg 2003, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the first recorded dictionaries date back to [[Sumer]]ian times (these were bilingual dictionaries), the systematic study of dictionaries as objects of scientific interest themselves is a 20th-century enterprise, called [[lexicography]], and largely initiated by [[Ladislav Zgusta]].&lt;ref name=Sintro/&gt; The birth of the new discipline was not without controversy, the practical dictionary-makers being sometimes accused by others of "astonishing" lack of method and critical-self reflection.&lt;ref name="Hartmann2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. R. K. Hartmann|title=Lexicography: Dictionaries, compilers, critics, and users|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLlhyvpg7KoC&amp;pg=PA21|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-25366-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The oldest known dictionaries were [[Akkadian Empire]] cuneiform tablets with bilingual [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]–[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] wordlists, discovered in [[Ebla]] (modern [[Syria]]) and dated roughly 2300 [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref name="imlqdg"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573731/Dictionary.html#p3 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbLyr75?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761573731/Dictionary.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early 2nd millennium BCE ''[[Urra=hubullu]]'' glossary is the canonical [[Babylonia]]n version of such bilingual Sumerian wordlists. A [[Chinese dictionary]], the c. 3rd century BCE ''[[Erya]]'', was the earliest surviving monolingual dictionary; although some sources cite the c. 800 BCE [[Shizhoupian]] as a "dictionary", modern scholarship considers it a calligraphic compendium of [[Chinese character]]s from [[Zhou dynasty]] bronzes. [[Philitas of Cos]] (fl. 4th century BCE) wrote a pioneering vocabulary ''Disorderly Words'' (Ἄτακτοι γλῶσσαι, ''{{transl|el|ISO|Átaktoi glôssai}}'') which explained the meanings of rare [[Homer]]ic and other literary words, words from local dialects, and technical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Peter Bing |title= The unruly tongue: Philitas of Cos as scholar and poet |journal= Classical Philology |volume=98 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=330–348 |doi=10.1086/422370}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Apollonius the Sophist]] (fl. 1st century CE) wrote the oldest surviving Homeric lexicon.&lt;ref name = "imlqdg"/&gt; The first [[Sanskrit]] dictionary, the [[Amarakosha|Amarakośa]], was written by [[Amara Sinha]] c. 4th century CE. Written in verse, it listed around 10,000 words. According to the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'', the first [[Japanese dictionaries#Early Japanese lexicography|Japanese dictionary]] was the long-lost 682 CE ''Niina'' glossary of Chinese characters. The oldest existing Japanese dictionary, the c. 835 CE ''[[Tenrei Banshō Meigi]]'', was also a glossary of written Chinese. In ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig]]'', [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] [[Heterogram (linguistics)|heterograms]] are listed together with their translation in [[Middle Persian]] language and phonetic transcription in [[Pazand]] alphabet. A 9th-century CE Irish dictionary, [[Sanas Cormaic]], contained etymologies and explanations of over 1,400 Irish words. In India around 1320, [[Amir Khusro]] compiled the Khaliq-e-bari which mainly dealt with [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rashid|first=Omar|title=Chasing Khusro|url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/books/article3672990.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nouveau Dictionnaire Larousse page.JPG|thumb|The French-language ''[[Petit Larousse]]'' is an example of an illustrated dictionary.]]

[[Arabic]] dictionaries were compiled between the 8th and 14th centuries CE, organizing words in rhyme order (by the last syllable), by alphabetical order of the [[root (linguistics)|radicals]], or according to the alphabetical order of the first letter (the system used in modern European language dictionaries). The modern system was mainly used in specialist dictionaries, such as those of terms from the [[Qur'an]] and [[hadith]], while most general use dictionaries, such as the ''Lisan al-`Arab'' (13th century, still the best-known large-scale dictionary of Arabic) and ''al-Qamus al-Muhit'' (14th century) listed words in the alphabetical order of the radicals. The ''Qamus al-Muhit'' is the first handy dictionary in Arabic, which includes only words and their definitions, eliminating the supporting examples used in such dictionaries as the ''Lisan'' and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Ḳāmūs", J. Eckmann, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd ed., Brill&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vocabolario degli accademici della crusca, prima edizione per giovanni alberti, venezia 1612, 01.jpg|thumb|300px|left|1612 ''Vocabolario dell'[[Accademia della Crusca]]'']]
In medieval Europe, [[glossary|glossaries]] with equivalents for Latin words in [[vernacular]] or simpler Latin were in use (e.g. the [[Leiden Glossary]]). The ''[[Catholicon (1286)|Catholicon]]'' (1287) by [[John of Genoa|Johannes Balbus]], a large grammatical work with an alphabetical lexicon, was widely adopted. It served as the basis for several bilingual dictionaries and was one of the earliest books (in 1460) to be printed. In 1502 [[Ambrogio Calepino]]'s ''Dictionarium'' was published, originally a monolingual Latin dictionary, which over the course of the 16th century was enlarged to become a multilingual glossary. In 1532 [[Robert Estienne]] published the ''Thesaurus linguae latinae'' and in 1572 his son [[Henri Estienne]] published the ''[[Thesaurus linguae graecae]]'', which served up to the 19th century as the basis of Greek lexicography. The first monolingual dictionary written in Europe was the Spanish, written by [[Sebastián Covarrubias]]' ''[[Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española]]'', published in 1611 in Madrid, Spain.&lt;ref&gt;''Tesoro de la lengua castellana o española'', edición integral e ilustrada de Ignacio Arellano y Rafael Zafra, Madrid, Iberoamericana-Vervuert, 2006, pg. XLIX.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1612 the first edition of the ''[[Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca]]'', for [[italian language|Italian]], was published. It served as the model for similar works in French and English. In 1690 in [[Rotterdam]] was published, posthumously, the ''Dictionnaire Universel'' by [[Antoine Furetière]] for [[french language|French]]. In 1694 appeared the first edition of the ''[[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française]]''. Between 1712 and 1721 was published the ''Vocabulario portughez e latino'' written by Raphael Bluteau. The [[Real Academia Española]] published the first edition of the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española]]'' in 1780, but their ''Diccionario de Autoridades'', which included quotes taken from literary works, was published in 1726. The ''Totius Latinitatis lexicon'' by [[Egidio Forcellini]] was firstly published in 1777; it has formed the basis of all similar works that have since been published.

The first edition of ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'' by [[Henry George Liddell]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] appeared in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek until the end of the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the [[Deutsches Wörterbuch]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]]; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the ''Dizionario della lingua italiana'' by [[Niccolò Tommaseo]]. Between 1862 and 1874 was published the six volumes of ''A magyar nyelv szótára'' (Dictionary of Hungarian Language) by Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi. [[Émile Littré]] published the [[Dictionnaire de la langue française (Littré)|Dictionnaire de la langue française]] between 1863 and 1872. In the same year 1863 appeared the first volume of the ''[[Woordenboek der Nederlandsche Taal]]'' which was completed in 1998. Also in 1863 [[Vladimir Ivanovich Dahl]] published the ''[[Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language]]''. The [[Duden]] dictionary dates back to 1880, and is currently the [[prescriptive]] source for the spelling of German. The decision to start work on the ''[[Svenska Akademiens ordbok]]'' was taken in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g3.spraakdata.gu.se/saob/|title=OSA – Om svar anhålles|website=g3.spraakdata.gu.se|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===English dictionaries in Britain===

The earliest dictionaries in the English language were glossaries of French, Spanish or Latin words along with their definitions in English. The word "dictionary" was invented by an Englishman called [[John of Garland]] in 1220 — he had written a book ''[[Dictionarius (Johannes de Garlandia)|Dictionarius]]'' to help with Latin "diction".&lt;ref&gt;Mark Forsyth. The etymologicon. // Icon Books Ltd. London N79DP, 2011. p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; An early non-alphabetical list of 8000 English words was the ''Elementarie'', created by [[Richard Mulcaster]] in 1582.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/dic/mul/elementarie.html|title=1582 - Mulcaster's Elementarie|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/b_history.html A Brief History of English Lexicography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309181613/http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/b_history.html |date=2008-03-09 }}, Peter Erdmann and See-Young Cho, [[Technical University of Berlin|Technische Universität Berlin]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first purely English alphabetical dictionary was ''[[Table Alphabeticall|A Table Alphabeticall]]'', written by English schoolteacher [[Robert Cawdrey]] in 1604. The only surviving copy is found at the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]]. This dictionary, and the many imitators which followed it, was seen as unreliable and nowhere near definitive. [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield]] was still lamenting in 1754, 150 years after Cawdrey's publication, that it is "a sort of disgrace to our nation, that hitherto we have had no… standard of our language; our dictionaries at present being more properly what our neighbors the Dutch and the Germans call theirs, word-books, than dictionaries in the superior sense of that title." &lt;ref&gt;[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/firstdict.html Jack Lynch, “How Johnson's Dictionary Became the First Dictionary” (delivered 25 August 2005 at the Johnson and the English Language conference, Birmingham)] Retrieved July 12, 2008,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1616, John Bullokar described the history of the dictionary with his "English Expositor". ''Glossographia'' by [[Thomas Blount (lexicographer)|Thomas Blount]], published in 1656, contains more than 10,000 words along with their etymologies or histories. [[Edward Phillips]] wrote another dictionary in 1658, entitled "[[The New World of English Words]]: Or a General Dictionary" which boldly [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] Blount's work, and the two denounced {{clarify|date=November 2016}} each other. This created more interest in the dictionaries. [[John Wilkins]]' 1668 [[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|essay on philosophical language]] contains a list of 11,500 words with careful distinctions, compiled by [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John P. Considine|title=Dictionaries in Early Modern Europe: Lexicography and the Making of Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cqBkQFiTbX4C&amp;pg=PA298|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=27 March 2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88674-1|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elisha Coles]] published his "English Dictionary" in 1676.

It was not until [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755) that a more reliable English dictionary was produced. Many people today mistakenly believe that Johnson wrote the first English dictionary: a testimony to this legacy.&lt;ref name = "wblqfm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Papers/firstdict.html|title=Lynch, "How Johnson's Dictionary Became the First Dictionary"|website=andromeda.rutgers.edu|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage, dictionaries had evolved to contain textual references for most words, and were arranged alphabetically, rather than by topic (a previously popular form of arrangement, which meant all animals would be grouped together, etc.). Johnson's masterwork could be judged as the first to bring all these elements together, creating the first "modern" dictionary.&lt;ref name = "wblqfm"/&gt;

Johnson's dictionary remained the English-language standard for over 150 years, until the [[Oxford University Press]] began writing and releasing the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in short [[wikt:fascicle|fascicles]] from 1884 onwards. It took nearly 50 years to complete this huge work, and they finally released the complete ''OED'' in twelve volumes in 1928. It remains the most comprehensive and trusted English language dictionary to this day, with revisions and updates added by a dedicated team every three months. One of the main contributors to this modern dictionary was an ex-army surgeon, [[William Chester Minor]], a convicted murderer who was confined to an asylum for the criminally insane.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Winchester]], ''[[The Surgeon of Crowthorne]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===American English dictionaries===
In 1806, American [[Noah Webster]] published his first dictionary, ''[[s:A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language|A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language]]''. In 1807 Webster began compiling an expanded and fully comprehensive dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language;'' it took twenty-seven years to complete. To evaluate the etymology of words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon), German, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and [[Sanskrit]].

Webster completed his dictionary during his year abroad in 1825 in Paris, France, and at the [[University of Cambridge]]. His book contained seventy thousand words, of which twelve thousand had never appeared in a published dictionary before. As a [[spelling reform]]er, Webster believed that English spelling rules were unnecessarily complex, so his dictionary introduced [[American English]] spellings, replacing "colour" with "color", substituting "wagon" for "waggon", and printing "center" instead of "centre". He also added American words, like "skunk" and "squash", that did not appear in British dictionaries. At the age of seventy, Webster published his dictionary in 1828; it sold 2500 copies. In 1840, the second edition was published in two volumes.

==Types==

In a general dictionary, each word may have multiple meanings. Some dictionaries include each separate meaning in the order of most common usage while others list definitions in historical order, with the oldest usage first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ld/pubs/corereference/internal/chd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425064041/http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ld/pubs/corereference/internal/chd.html |archivedate=2010-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many languages, words can appear in many different forms, but only the [[lemma (morphology)|undeclined or unconjugated]] form appears as the [[headword]] in most dictionaries. Dictionaries are most commonly found in the form of a book, but some newer dictionaries, like [[StarDict]] and the ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' are dictionary software running on [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDAs]] or [[computer]]s. There are also many [[List of online dictionaries|online dictionaries]] accessible via the [[Internet]].

===Specialized dictionaries===
{{main|Specialized dictionary}}
According to the ''Manual of Specialized Lexicographies'', a [[specialized dictionary]], also referred to as a technical dictionary, is a dictionary that focuses upon a specific subject field. Following the description in ''The Bilingual LSP Dictionary'', [[lexicographers]] categorize specialized dictionaries into three types: A [[multi-field dictionary]] broadly covers several subject fields (e.g. a [[business dictionary]]), a [[single-field dictionary]] narrowly covers one particular subject field (e.g. law), and a [[sub-field dictionary]] covers a more specialized field (e.g. constitutional law). For example, the 23-language [[Inter-Active Terminology for Europe]] is a multi-field dictionary, the [[American National Biography]] is a single-field, and the [[African American National Biography Project]] is a sub-field dictionary. In terms of the coverage distinction between "minimizing dictionaries" and "maximizing dictionaries", multi-field dictionaries tend to minimize coverage across subject fields (for instance, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of World Religions]]'' and ''[[Yadgar Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesindhtimes.com/education/the-first-english-to-einglis-and-sindh-dictionary-of-computer-and-internet-terms-published/|title=The first English to Einglish and Sindhi Dictionary of Computer and Internet Terms published - The Sindh Times|first=The Sindh|last=Times|date=24 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011021439/http://www.thesindhtimes.com/education/the-first-english-to-einglis-and-sindh-dictionary-of-computer-and-internet-terms-published/|archive-date=11 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas single-field and sub-field dictionaries tend to maximize coverage within a limited subject field (''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'').

Another variant is the [[glossary]], an alphabetical list of defined terms in a specialized field, such as medicine ([[medical dictionary]]).

===Defining dictionaries===
The simplest dictionary, a [[defining dictionary]], provides a [[core glossary]] of the simplest meanings of the simplest concepts. From these, other concepts can be explained and defined, in particular for those who are first learning a language. In English, the commercial defining dictionaries typically include only one or two meanings of under 2000 words. With these, the rest of English, and even the 4000 most common English [[idiom]]s and [[metaphor]]s, can be defined.

===Prescriptive vs. descriptive===
Lexicographers apply two basic philosophies to the defining of words: [[Prescription and description|''prescriptive'' or ''descriptive'']]. [[Noah Webster]], intent on forging a distinct identity for the American language, altered spellings and accentuated differences in meaning and pronunciation of some words. This is why [[American English]] now uses the spelling ''color'' while the rest of the English-speaking world prefers ''colour''. (Similarly, [[British English]] subsequently underwent a few spelling changes that did not affect American English; see further at [[American and British English spelling differences]].)&lt;ref name="Benson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phil Benson|title=Ethnocentrism and the English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WeuW7oy7-58C&amp;pg=PA8|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large 20th-century dictionaries such as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) and ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary|Webster's Third]]'' are descriptive, and attempt to describe the actual use of words. Most dictionaries of English now apply the descriptive method to a word's definition, and then, outside of the definition itself, and information alerting readers to attitudes which may influence their choices on words often considered vulgar, offensive, erroneous, or easily confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ingrid Tieken-Boon van Ostade|author2=Wim van der Wurff|title=Current Issues in Late Modern English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x91EUnnWwR8C&amp;pg=PA41|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' is subtle, only adding italicized notations such as, ''sometimes offensive'' or ''stand'' (nonstandard). ''[[American Heritage Dictionary|American Heritage]]'' goes further, discussing issues separately in numerous "usage notes." ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary|Encarta]]'' provides similar notes, but is more prescriptive, offering warnings and admonitions against the use of certain words considered by many to be offensive or illiterate, such as, "an offensive term for..." or "a taboo term meaning...".

Because of the widespread use of dictionaries in schools, and their acceptance by many as language authorities, their treatment of the language does affect usage to some degree, with even the most descriptive dictionaries providing conservative continuity. In the long run, however, the meanings of words in English are primarily determined by usage, and the language is being changed and created every day.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Halley, ''The Wordsworth Dictionary of Modern English Grammar'' (2005), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Jorge Luis Borges]] says in the prologue to "El otro, el mismo": "''It is often forgotten that (dictionaries) are artificial repositories, put together well after the languages they define. The roots of language are irrational and of a magical nature.''"

Sometimes the same dictionary can be descriptive in some domains and prescriptive in others. For example, according to [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], the ''Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary'' is "at war with itself": whereas its coverage (lexical items) and glosses (definitions) are descriptive and colloquial, its [[Niqqud|vocalization]] is prescriptive. This internal conflict results in absurd sentences such as ''hi taharóg otí kshetiré me asíti lamkhonít'' (she'll tear me apart when she sees what I've done to the car). Whereas ''hi taharóg otí'', literally 'she will kill me', is colloquial, me (a variant of ma 'what') is archaic, resulting in a combination that is unutterable in real life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (1999). [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/review-of-the-oxford-english-hebrew- Review of the Oxford English-Hebrew Dictionary], ''[[International Journal of Lexicography]]'' 12.4, pp. 325-346.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical dictionaries ===
A [[historical dictionary]] is a specific kind of descriptive dictionary which describes the development of words and senses over time, usually using citations to original source material to support its conclusions.

===Dictionaries for natural language processing===
In contrast to traditional dictionaries, which are designed to be used by human beings, dictionaries for [[natural language processing]] (NLP) are built to be used by computer programs. The final user is a human being but the direct user is a program. Such a dictionary does not need to be able to be printed on paper. The structure of the content is not linear, ordered entry by entry but has the form of a complex network (see [[Diathesis alternation]]). Because most of these dictionaries are used to control [[machine translation]]s or [[cross-lingual information retrieval]] (CLIR) the content is usually multilingual and usually of huge size. In order to allow formalized exchange and merging of dictionaries, an ISO standard called [[Lexical Markup Framework]] (LMF) has been defined and used among the industrial and academic community.

==Pronunciation==
{{Main|International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects|Pronunciation respelling for English}}
In many languages, such as the English language, the pronunciation of some words is not consistently  apparent from their spelling. In these languages, dictionaries usually provide the pronunciation. For example, the definition for the word ''dictionary'' might be followed by the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] spelling {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɪ|k|ʃ|ə|n|ɛr|i}}. American English dictionaries often use their own[[pronunciation respelling]] systems with [[diacritic]]s, for example ''dictionary''  is respelled as "dĭk'''′'''shə-nĕr′ē" in the [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]].{{refn|{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|dictionary}}}} The IPA is more commonly used within the British Commonwealth countries. Yet others use their own pronunciation respelling systems without diacritics: for example, ''dictionary'' may be respelled as {{respell|DIK|shə|nerr|ee}}. Some online or electronic dictionaries provide audio recordings of words being spoken.

==Online dictionaries==

The age of the Internet brought online dictionaries to the desktop and, more recently, to the smart phone. [[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]] in 2013 noted that "Among the top ten lookups on Merriam-Webster Online at this moment are 'holistic, pragmatic, caveat, esoteric' and 'bourgeois.' Teaching users about words they don’t already know has been, historically, an aim of lexicography, and modern dictionaries do this well."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Skinner (journalist)|David Skinner]], [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/17/the-role-of-a-dictionary/?nl=todaysheadlines&amp;emc=edit_th_20130518  The Role of a Dictionary] in "Opinionator: Exclusive Online Commentary from the Times", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There exist a number of websites which operate as online dictionaries, usually with a specialized focus. Some of them have exclusively user driven content, often consisting of [[neologisms]]. Some of the more notable examples include:

==Theory==
Difference theory has roots in the studies of [[John Gumperz]], who examined differences in cross-cultural communication. While difference theory deals with cross-gender communication, the male and female genders are often presented as being two separate cultures, hence the relevance of Gumperz's studies. In her development of the difference theory, Deborah Tannen drew on the work of Daniel Maltz and Ruth Borker, in particular their 1982 paper, ''A Cultural Approach to Male-Female Miscommunication'', which itself drew on the work of Gumperz.&lt;ref&gt;Sunderland, ''Language and Gender: An advanced resource book'', pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Talbot makes reference to the term "gender-specific culture" in her critique of the difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and this idea of genders being culturally separated is embodied by the 1992 publication ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, ''Communication between Men and Women in the Context of the Christian Community''&lt;/ref&gt; Difference theory is often compared with dominance theory and deficit theory, and together with the more contemporary dynamic theory they make up four of the theories most widely referred to and compared in the study of [[language and gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', pp. 130-133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, ''Women, Men and Language'', pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the popularity of Tannen's book ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]'', and the resultant popularisation of difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Talbot98"&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; is generally attributed to the style of Tannen's work, in which she adopts a neutral position on differences in [[genderlect]] by making no value-judgements about use of language by either gender. Talbot comments that this means the book provides explanations for domestic disputes without "pointing the finger" at anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference theory as postulated by Tannen is generally summarised into six categories, each of which pairs contrasting uses of language by males and females.&lt;ref name="Talbot98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Deborah Tannen and difference''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status v. support===
Tannen states that, for men, the world is a competitive place in which conversation and speech are used to build status, whereas for women the world is a network of connections, and that they use language to seek and offer support. In demonstrating this, Tannen uses the example of her husband and herself, who at one point had jobs in different cities. She remarks that whenever someone commented on this, she interpreted it as being an offer of sympathy or support. Her husband, on the other hand, took such comments as being criticisms and attempts to put him down. Tannen remarks that this displays the different approaches that women and men take in terms of status and support. Furthermore, men are also more likely to interrupt to get their point across and hence gain status.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding v. advice===
Women seek comfort and sympathy for their problems, whilst men will seek a solution to the problem.

===Information v. feelings===
Tannen states that men's conversation is message-oriented, i.e. based upon communicating information. For women, conversation is much more important for building relationships and strengthening social links.

===Orders v. proposals===
Men will use direct imperatives ("close the door", "switch on the light") when speaking to others. Women encourage the use of superpolite forms, however ("let's", "would you mind if ...?").

===Conflict v. compromise===
Tannen asserts that most women avoid conflict in language at all costs, and instead attempt to resolve disagreements without any direct confrontation, to maintain positive connection and rapport. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to use confrontation as a way of resolving differences and thereby negotiating status. Tannen supports this view by making reference to the work of [[Walter J. Ong]], whose 1981 publication, ''Fighting for Life'', asserts that "expressed adversativeness" is more an element of male culture than female culture. Tannen stresses that both forms of communication are valid ways of creating involvement and forming bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 149-151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence v. intimacy===
Difference theory asserts that in general men favour independence, while women are more likely to seek intimacy. Tannen demonstrates this with the example of a husband making a decision without consulting his wife. She theorises that he does so because he doesn't want to feel a loss of independence that would come from saying, "Let me consult this with my wife first." Women, by contrast, like to demonstrate that they have to consult with their partner, as this is seen to be proof of the intimacy of the relationship. Tannen asserts that women, seeing the world as a network of connections and relationships, view intimacy as key to achieving consensus and avoiding the appearance of superiority, whereas men, who are more likely to view the world in terms of status, see independence as being key to establishing their status. Tannen also clarifies that while both men and women seek independence and intimacy, men tend to be focused on the former, while women tend to focus on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

General criticisms are that Tannen's observations are largely anecdotal and cannot be said for all conjugal conversations, let alone mixed-gender interactions as a whole.

'''Digital reference''' (or '''virtual reference''') is a service by which a [[library]] reference service is conducted online, and the reference transaction is a [[computer-mediated communication]]. It is the remote, NextNextcomputer-mediated delivery of reference information provided by library professionals to users who cannot access or do not want face-to-face communication. Virtual reference service is most often an extension of a library's existing reference service program. The word "[[reference]]" in this context refers to the task of providing assistance to library users in finding information, answering questions, and otherwise fulfilling users’ information needs. Reference work often but not always involves using [[reference work]]s, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, etc.  This form of reference work expands reference services from the physical reference desk to a "virtual" reference desk where the patron could be writing from home, work or a variety of other locations.

The terminology surrounding virtual reference services may involve multiple terms used for the same definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pace |first=A. |title=Virtual Reference: What's in a Name? |journal=Computers in Libraries |date=April 2003 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred term for remotely delivered, computer-mediated reference services is "virtual reference", with the secondary non-preferred term "digital reference" having gone out of use in recent years. "Chat reference" is often used interchangeably with virtual reference, although it represents only one aspect of virtual reference. Virtual reference includes the use of both synchronous (i.e., IM, videoconferencing) and asynchronous communication (i.e., texting and email). Here, "synchronous virtual reference" refers to any real-time computer-mediated communication between patron and information professional. Asynchronous virtual reference is all computer-mediated communication that is sent and received at different times.&lt;ref name="Kern"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kern |first=M.K. |title=Virtual Reference Best Practices: Tailoring Services to Your Library |place=Chicago |publisher=ALA |year=2009}} {{ISBN|978-0-8389-0975-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The earliest digital reference services were launched in the mid-1980s, primarily by academic and medical libraries, and provided by [[e-mail]]. These early-adopter libraries launched digital reference services for two main reasons: to extend the hours that questions could be submitted to the reference desk, and to explore the potential of campus-wide networks, which at that time was a new technology.

With the advent of the graphical [[World Wide Web]], libraries quickly adopted webforms for question submission. Since then, the percentage of questions submitted to services via webforms has outstripped the percentage submitted via email.

In the early- to mid-1990s, digital reference services began to appear that were not affiliated with any library. These digital reference services are often referred to as "AskA" services. Examples of AskA services are the [[Internet Public Library]], [http://mathforum.org/dr.math/ Ask Dr. Math], and [http://americanart.si.edu/search/search_ajoa.cfm Ask Joan of Art].

Providing remote-based services for patrons has been a steady practice of libraries over the years.  For example, before the widespread use of chat software, reference questions were often answered via phone, fax, email and audio conferencing. Email is the oldest type of virtual reference service used by libraries.&lt;ref name="Kern" /&gt; Library services in America and the UK are just now gaining visibility in their use of virtual reference services using chat software. However, a survey in America revealed that by 2001 over 200 libraries were using chat reference services.&lt;ref name="Chow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=G.G. |title=Librarianship: an introduction |place=London |publisher=Facet |year=2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The rapid global proliferation of information technology (IT) often leaves libraries at a disadvantage in terms of keeping their services current. However, libraries are always striving to understand their user demographics in order to provide the best possible services.&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bro"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brophy |first=P. |title=The library in the twenty-first century |edition=2nd |place=London |publisher=Facet |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, libraries continue to take notes from current [[cyberculture]] and are continually incorporating a diversified range of interactive technologies in their service repertoires. Virtual reference represents only one small part of a larger library mission to meet the needs of a new generation, sometimes referred to as the "Google Generation", of users who have grown up with the internet.&lt;ref name="Row"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rowlands |first=I. |title=The Google generation: the information behaviour of the researcher of the future |journal=Aslib Proceedings |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=290–310 |year=2008 |url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1733495&amp;show=abstract |doi=10.1108/00012530810887953}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, virtual reference may be used in conjunction with embedded [[Web 2.0]] (online social media such as [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], [[blogs]], [[del.icio.us]], [[Flickr]], etc.) applications in a library's suite of online services.&lt;ref name="Xiao"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Xiao |first=N. |title=Web 2.0 as catalyst: Virtually reaching out to users and connecting them to library resources and services |journal=Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship |volume=55 |issue=Fall |year=2008 |url=http://www.istl.org/08-fall/article2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As technological innovations continue, libraries will be watching to find new, more personalized ways of interacting with remote reference users.

The range of cost-per-transaction of reference interactions has been found to be large, due to the differences in librarian salaries and infrastructural costs required by reference interviews.&lt;ref&gt;Murfin, Marjorie E. "Cost Analysis of Library Reference Services," Advances in Library Administration and Organization, 11, 1993, pp. 1–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eakin, Lorraine, &amp; Pomerantz, Jeffrey. "[https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/pla.0.0035 Virtual Reference, Real Money: Modeling Costs in Virtual Reference Services]," portal: Libraries and the Academy, 9, 2009, pp. 133-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of digital reference==

===Webforms===
Webforms are created for digital reference services in order to help the patron be more productive in asking their question.  This document helps the librarian locate exactly what the patron is asking for.  Creation of webforms requires design consideration.  Because webforms substitute for the reference interview, receiving as much information as possible from the patron is a key function.

Aspects commonly found within webforms:

*A return email address to send the answer to the question
*The question being asked
*The type of question
*What sources have been consulted by the patron
*How the patron is planning to use the information
*Location of the patron (are they a library patron?)
*A name to personalize the interaction
*A date by which the information is needed
*The type of sources being requested (print or electronic)&lt;ref&gt;Janes, Joseph. "Introduction to Reference Work in the Digital Age", pages 64-65. Neal-Schuman Publishers Inc., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chat using commercial applications===
Several applications exist for providing chat-based reference. Some of these applications are: [http://www.questionpoint.org/ QuestionPoint], [https://www.omnireference.com/ OmniReference], [http://tutor.com/ Tutor.com], [https://libraryh3lp.com/ LibraryH3lp], [http://aspiringkidz.com/ AspiringKidz.com], and [http://Vienova.com/ Vienova.com]. These applications bear a resemblance to commercial help desk applications. These applications possess functionality such as: chat, co-browsing of webpages, webpage and document pushing, customization of pre-scripted messages, storage of chat transcripts, and statistical reporting.

===Chat using instant messaging===
{{See also|chatbot|virtual assistant (artificial intelligence)}}
[[Instant messaging]] (IM) services are used by some libraries as a low-cost means of offering chat-based reference, since most IM services are free.  Utilizing IM for reference services allows a patron to contact the library from any location via the internet.  This service is like the traditional reference interview because it is a live interaction between the patron and the librarian.  On the other side the reference interview is different because the conversation does not float away but instead is in print on the screen for the librarian to review if needed to better understand the patron.  IM reference services may be for the use of in-house patrons as well as patrons unable to go to the library. If library computers support IM chat programs, patrons may IM from within the library to avoid losing their use of a computer or avoid making embarrassing questions public.

Successful IM reference services will:
*Create a profile to convey information about the library and increase online presence.
*Accept imperfection in conversations without spending time to go back and make corrections.  Most words are recognizable through context.
*Become familiar with and use accepted IM abbreviations such as LOL (Laugh Out Loud).
*Don't panic.  While speed is important it is more important to not feel rushed.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rick. "IM Me", Library Journal 130 (April 1, 2005): 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, IM becomes challenging because of lack of non-verbal cues such as eye contact, and the perceived time pressure. Moreover, formulating the question online without the give and take of nonverbal cues and face to face conversation presents an added obstacle. In addition, to provide effective reference service through IM, it is important to meet higher level of information literacy standards. These standards include evaluating the information and its source, synthesizing the information to create new ideas or products, and understanding the societal, legal, and economic issues surrounding its use.&lt;ref&gt;Desai, Christina M. &amp; Graves, Stephanie J. "Instruction via Instant Messaging reference: what’s happening?", The Electronic Library 24 (2) ( 2006): 174-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software for providing digital reference==
The article [http://slj.reviewsnews.com/index.asp?layout=article&amp;articleid=CA251679 Live, Digital Reference Marketplace] by Buff Hirko contains a comparison of the features of applications for chat-based reference.

See the entries in the [http://www.libsuccess.org/index.php?title=Online_Reference Library Success Wiki's Online Reference Section], including software recommended for web-based chat reference, IM reference, SMS (text messaging) reference, and other types like digital audio or video reference.

===Software features===
Virtual service software programs offered by libraries are often unique, and tailored to the individual library's needs.&lt;ref name="Bro" /&gt; However, each program may have several distinct features. A [[knowledge base]] is a chunk of information that users can access independently. An example of this is a serialized listing of [[frequently asked questions]] (FAQ) that a user can read and use at his or her leisure.

Online chat, or [[instant messaging]] (IM) has become a very popular Web-based feature.  Instant messaging is a real time conversation that utilizes typed text instead of language.  Users may feel a sense of satisfaction with the use of this tool because of their personalized interaction with staff.

The use of electronic mail (email) in responding to reference questions in libraries has been in use for years.  Also, in some cases with the IM feature, a question may be asked that cannot be resolved in online chat.  In this instance the staff member may document the inquiring patron’s email address and will the user a response.

With the increase in use of text messaging ([[Short Message Service]] or SMS), some libraries are also adopting text messaging in their virtual reference services. [[Librarian]]s can use mobile phones, text-to-instant messaging or web-based services to respond to reference questions via text messaging.

[[Co-browsing]], or cooperative browsing, is a virtual reference function that involves interactive control of a user’s web browser. This function enables the librarian to see what the patron has on his or her computer screen. Several types of co-browsing have been offered in mobile devices of late; libraries may have software that incorporates dual modes of co-browsing in a variety of formats. For instance, it is possible to browse on a mobile device within and between documents (such as Word), webpages, and images.&lt;ref name="Hua"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hua |first=Z. |title="Chapter 2.10: A Cooperative Framework for Information Browsing in Mobile Environment". In: Taniar, D. (2008) Mobile Computing: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications |place=London |publisher=Information Science Reference |pages=497–505 |year=2008 |url=http://www.igi-global.com/reference|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The UK==

Virtual reference services are growing in popularity in the UK with more institutions accepting queries via email, instant messaging and other chat based services.&lt;ref name="Barry, E 2010 pp.40-55"&gt;Barry, E et al (2010) Virtual Reference in UK academic libraries: The virtual enquiry project 2008–2009, Library Review, Vol. 59 (1) pp.40-55&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the use of virtual reference within UK academic institutions showed that 25% currently offer a form of virtual reference, with 54% of academic institutions surveyed considering adding this service.&lt;ref name="Barry, E 2010 pp.40-55"/&gt;

UK public libraries were instrumental in some of the first steps towards UK-wide internet collaboration amongst libraries with the EARL Consortium (Electronic Access to Resources in Libraries) in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;Woodhouse, S. (1998) Delivering the New Public Library: the role of the EARL Consortium, INFOCUS 3(1)&lt;/ref&gt; in a time where internet access was a rare commodity for both library staff and the public. Resources were collated and lines of communication opened between libraries across the UK, paving the way for services all over the world to follow suit. There are now a number of area-specific reference services across the UK including Ask A Librarian (UK-wide, established in 1997), Ask Cymru (Welsh and English language service), Enquire (Government funded through the People's Network, also UK-wide),&lt;ref&gt;Berube, L. (2005) People's Network Enquire: virtual reference in England, World Library and Information Congress: 71st IFLA General Conference and Council, August 14th - 18th 2005, Oslo, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; and Ask Scotland. Ask Scotland was created by the Scottish Government's advisory body on libraries, SLIC (Scottish Library and Information Council),&lt;ref&gt;SLIC homepage: http://www.slainte.org.uk/slic/slicindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and funded by the Public Library Quality Improvement Fund (PLQIF) in June 2009. It uses the [[Online Computer Library Center]]'s QuestionPoint software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questionpoint.org/ QuestionPoint.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Library Association's digital reference guidelines==
The definition formulated by the American Library Association's (ALA) 2004 MARS Digital Reference Guidelines Ad Hoc Committee contains three components:

# "Virtual reference is reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time, where patrons employ computers or other Internet technology to communicate with reference staff, without being physically present. Communication channels used frequently in virtual reference include chat, videoconferencing, Voice over IP, co-browsing, e-mail, and instant messaging.
# While online sources are often utilized in provision of virtual reference, use of electronic sources in seeking answers is not of itself virtual reference.
# Virtual reference queries are sometimes followed-up with telephone, fax, in-person and regular mail interactions, even though these modes of communication are not considered virtual."&lt;ref name="MARS"&gt;{{cite journal |author=MARS Digital Reference Guidelines Ad Hoc Committee |year=2004 |title=Guidelines for Implementing and Maintaining Virtual Reference Services |journal=Reference and User Services Quarterly |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=9–14 |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/rusa/resources/guidelines/virtrefguidelines.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 [[QuestionPoint]] and the [[American Library Association]] were in talks about offering a National Ask A Librarian service across the whole United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;http://questionpoint.blogs.com/questionpoint_247_referen/2011/01/a-national-virtual-reference-service-for-the-us.html&lt;/ref&gt; At present the Ask services in the US are run at a local level.

==Other countries==
In Europe some countries offer services in both their own national language and in English. European countries include: Finland,&lt;ref&gt;Finnish National Libraries online reference service: http://www.libraries.fi/en-GB/ask/&lt;/ref&gt; the Netherlands (in Dutch only),&lt;ref&gt;The Netherlands online reference service: http://www2.bibliotheek.nl/home&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;Danish Libraries homepage, with links to a virtual reference form: http://bibliotek.dk/?lingo=eng&lt;/ref&gt; and France.&lt;ref&gt;Public library of Lyon, France: http://www.guichetdusavoir.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries which offer virtual reference services include: Australia,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Australia's Ask a Librarian service: http://www.nla.gov.au/askalibrarian/&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of New Zealand's Ask a Librarian service: http://www.natlib.govt.nz/services/get-advice/ask-a-librarian&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;National Library of Canada's virtual reference services: http://vrl.tpl.toronto.on.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; and the state of Colorado in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ask Colorado, the service from the state of Colorado in the USA: {{cite web|url=http://www.askcolorado.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725045834/http://www.askcolorado.org/ |archivedate=2010-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chasing the Sun==

A collaboration between UK and Australian library services, entitled Chasing the Sun,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.changechampions.com.au/resource/Sue_Rockliff.pdf PDF presentation by Chasing the Sun Co-chair Sue Rockliff]&lt;/ref&gt; has been initiated using [[QuestionPoint]] software so that an all-hours digital reference chat service can be offered.  Targeted at health libraries where reference queries from health professionals could occur at any time of the day or night due to medical emergencies, the collaboration between the two countries means that someone will be on hand to field the query at any time. Although the UK libraries involved are currently based in England the programme may expand to other countries and health services if successful.

A '''ditloid''' is a type of [[word puzzle]],&lt;ref name="Ditloids" /&gt; in which a phrase, quotation, date, or fact must be deduced from the numbers and abbreviated letters in the clue. Common words such as 'the', 'in', 'a', 'an', 'of', 'to', etc. are not normally abbreviated.&lt;ref name="Ditloids"&gt;http://www.ditloids.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=September 2013}} The name 'ditloid' was given by the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper,&lt;ref name=Ditloids /&gt; originating from the clue: 1 = DitLoID ≡ ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich|1 Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''.

==History==
[[Will Shortz]] originated the current form of this puzzle and first published it in the May–June 1981 issue of [[Games Magazine|''Games'' magazine]], calling it the Equation Analysis Test. In its annual 1981 issue of "What's hot and what's not," [[Us Magazine|''Us'' magazine]] named the Equation Analysis Test in the "what's hot" category – the only nonperson so recognized. Shortz reports:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some anonymous person had retyped the puzzle from ''Games'' (word for word, except for my byline),
photocopied it, and passed it along. This page was then rephotocopied ad infinitum, like a chain letter,
and circulated around the country. ''Games'' readers who hadn't seen the original even started sending
it back to ''Games'' as something the magazine ought to consider publishing!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shortz based the puzzle on the Formula Analysis Test - Revised Form published in [[Morgan Worthy]]'s 1975 book ''AHA! A Puzzle Approach to Creative Thinking'' (Chicago: Nelson Hall). Worthy's equations were in a different format, for example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
!style="width:250px;text-align:left"|&lt;u&gt;Puzzle&lt;/u&gt;
!style="text-align:left"|&lt;u&gt;Solution&lt;/u&gt;
|-
|M. + M. + N.H. + V. + C. + R.I = N.E.
|[[Maine]] + [[Massachusetts]] + [[New Hampshire]] + [[Vermont]] + [[Connecticut]] + [[Rhode Island]] = [[New England]]
|-
|"1B. in the H. = 2 in the B."
|"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" (a [[proverb]])
|-
|N. + V. + P. + A. + A. + C. + P. + I. = P. of S.
|[[noun]] + [[verb]] + [[pronoun]] + [[adjective]] + [[adverb]] + [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] + [[preposition]]  + [[interjection]] = [[Parts of Speech]]
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Worthy gives the source of his inspiration and speculates about the perennial popularity
of this puzzle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I got the idea for linguistic equations from graffiti someone had
written in the form of an obscene formula on a restroom wall at the
University of Florida. When the answer suddenly came to me, I realized
the format was a good one for eliciting the "aha effect". After that I
used such items as exercise material when teaching workshops on
creative thinking.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My guess is that one reason a person enjoys linguistic equations is
that the answer hits him or her all at once rather than being solved in
an incremental fashion. It is similar to what happens when we suddenly
see an embedded figure pop into focus; the satisfaction is visceral
rather than just intellectual. My experience was that people often had
the answer to an item come to them when they were not consciously
thinking about the puzzles, but relaxed, such as in the shower or about
to fall asleep.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another factor is that with well-written items, success does not hinge
on obscure information. Ideally, a person should never have to feel, "I
could never have gotten that one no matter how long I worked on it."
There is something ego enhancing about knowing you have the answer
inside and just need to find it.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''Guide to information sources''' (or a '''bibliographic guide''', a '''literature guide''', a '''guide to reference materials''', a '''subject gateway''', etc.) is a kind of '''[[metabibliography]]'''. Ideally it is not just a listing of [[bibliographies]], [[reference work]]s  and other [[information source]]s, but more like a [[textbook]] introducing users to the information sources in a given field (in general).

Such guides may have many different forms: Comprehensive or highly selective, printed or electronic sources, annoteted listings or written chapters etc.

==Functions==
Often used as curriculum tools for [[bibliographic instruction]], the guides help library users find materials or help those unfamiliar with a discipline understand the key sources.

A '''handbook''' is a type of [[reference work]], or other collection of instructions, that is intended to provide ready reference. The term originally applied to a small or portable book containing information useful for its owner,  but the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines the current sense as "any book...giving information such as facts on a particular subject, guidance in some art or occupation, instructions for operating a machine, or information for tourists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://0-www.oed.com.catalogue.libraries.london.ac.uk/view/Entry/83815?redirectedFrom=handbook#eid Oxford English Dictionary Online], accessed 23 March 2017. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A handbook is sometimes referred to as a '''''[[wikt:en:vade mecum#Latin|vade mecum]]''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]], "go with me") or '''pocket reference'''. It may also be referred to as an [[enchiridion (disambiguation)|enchiridion]].

Handbooks may deal with any topic, and are generally compendiums of information in a particular field or about a particular technique. They are designed to be easily consulted and provide quick answers in a certain area. For example, the [[MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers]] is a reference for how to cite works in MLA style, among other things. Examples of [[engineering]] handbooks include  ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'', ''[[Marks Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers]]'', and the ''[[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12783">{{Redirect|Predicativism|the other school of philosophy, also known as predicativism|Ultrafinitism}}
Something that is '''impredicative''', in [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]], is a [[self reference|self-referencing]] [[definition]]. Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.

The opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratified]] (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is [[intuitionistic type theory]], which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.

[[Russell's paradox]] is a famous example of an impredicative construction—namely the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The [[paradox]] is that such a set cannot exist: If it would exist, the question could be  asked whether it contains itself or not — if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should.

The [[greatest lower bound]] of a set {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|glb({{var|X}})}}, also has an impredicative definition: {{math|1={{var|y}} = glb({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and any {{math|{{var|z}}}} less than or equal to all elements of {{math|{{var|X}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|y}}}}. This definition quantifies over the set (potentially [[infinite set|infinite]], depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, one of which being the glb itself. Hence '''predicativism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; would reject this definition.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{quotebox|width=30%
|quote=Norms (containing one variable) which do not define classes I propose to call ''non-predicative'';
those which do define classes I shall call ''predicative''. 
|source={{harv|Russell|1907|loc=p.34}} (Russell used "norm" to mean a proposition: roughly something that can take the values "true" or "false".)
}}

The terms "predicative" and "impredicative" were introduced by {{harvtxt|Russell|1907}}, though the meaning has changed a little since then. 

[[Solomon Feferman]] provides a historical review of predicativity, connecting it to current outstanding research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Feferman, "[https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/predicativity.pdf Predicativity]" (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vicious circle principle]] was suggested by [[Henri Poincaré]] (1905-6, 1908)&lt;ref&gt;dates derived from Kleene 1952:42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets that do not meet the requirement are called ''impredicative''.

The first modern paradox appeared with [[Cesare Burali-Forti]]'s 1897 ''A question on transfinite numbers''&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary before Burali-Forti's (1897) ''A question on transfinite numbers'' in van Heijenoort 1967:104; see also his commentary before Georg Cantor's (1899) ''Letter to Dedekind'' in van Heijenoort 1967:113&lt;/ref&gt; and would become known as the [[Burali-Forti paradox]]. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) "naive" set theory and this become known as [[Cantor's paradox]]. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901&lt;ref&gt;Commentary by van Heijenoort before Bertrand Russell's ''Lettern to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; with his reading of [[Frege]]'s treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''; the offending sentence in Frege is the following:
{{quote|On the other hand, it may be also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege (1879) ''Begriffsschrift'' in van Heijenoort 1967:23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, given {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} the function {{math|{{var|f}}}} is the variable and {{math|{{var|a}}}} is the invariant part. So why not substitute the value {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} for {{math|{{var|f}}}} itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that:
{{quote|You state ... that a function too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let {{math|{{var|w}}}} be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can {{math|{{var|w}}}} be predicated of itself? From each answer its opposite follows. There we must conclude that {{math|{{var|w}}}} is not a predicate. Likewise, there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection does not form a totality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell's 1902 ''Letter to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124-125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Frege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem:
{{quote|Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege's (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:127&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that "The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which uses the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in ''The principles of mathematics'' (1903) and is discussed there in great detail ...".&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijenoort's commentary before Bertrand Russell's (1902) ''Letter to Frege'' 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; Russell, after six years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by "propounding his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a ''predicative'' function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments".&lt;ref&gt;Willard V. Quine's commentary before Bertrand Russell's 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;/ref&gt; But this "axiom" was met with resistance from all quarters.

The rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the [[natural number]]s as classically understood) leads to the position in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] known as predicativism, advocated by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] in his ''Das Kontinuum''. Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite.

[[Ernst Zermelo]] in his 1908 "A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering"{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}} presents an entire section "b. ''Objection concerning nonpredicative definition''" where he argued against "Poincaré (1906, p.&amp;nbsp;307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt; He gives two examples of impredicative definitions &amp;ndash; (i) the notion of [[Dedekind chain]]s and (ii) "in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers {{math|{{var|Z}}}} is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and up to now it has not occurred to anyone to regard this as something illogical".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190–191&lt;/ref&gt; He ends his section with the following observation: "A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition ''definiens'' and ''definiendum'' are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:191&lt;/ref&gt;

Zermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of [[Least upper bound]] in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 ''Das Kontinuum'' (''The Continuum'') to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the "theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set {{math|M}} of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (cf. also Weyl 1919)".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] argued that "impredicative" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of "tallest person in the room" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as: {{math|1={{var|y}} = min({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and {{math|{{var|y}}}} is in {{math|{{var|X}}}}.

Burgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of [[Frege]]'s logic, [[Peano arithmetic]], [[second order arithmetic]], and [[axiomatic set theory]].

(ibid).

He attributes the suggestion of this notion to Russell and more concretely to Ramsey.

'''Indirect self-reference''' describes an object [[self-reference|referring to itself]] ''indirectly''.

For example, define the function f such that f(x) = x(x). Any function passed as an argument to f is invoked with itself as an argument, and thus in any use of that argument is indirectly referring to itself.

This example is similar to the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] expression "((lambda(x)(x x)) (lambda(x)(x x)))", which is expanded to itself by beta reduction, and so its evaluation loops indefinitely despite the lack of explicit looping constructs. An equivalent example can be formulated in [[lambda calculus]].

Indirect self-reference is special in that its self-referential quality is not explicit, as it is in the sentence "this sentence is false." The phrase "this sentence" refers directly to the sentence as a whole. An indirectly self-referential sentence would replace the phrase "this sentence" with an expression that effectively still referred to the sentence, but did not use the pronoun "this."

An example will help to explain this. Suppose we define the [[quine (computing)|quine]] of a phrase to be the quotation of the phrase followed by the phrase itself. So, the quine of:
 is a sentence fragment
would be:
 "is a sentence fragment" is a sentence fragment
which, incidentally, is a true statement.

Now consider the sentence:
 "when quined, makes quite a statement" when quined, makes quite a statement

The quotation here, plus the phrase "when quined," indirectly refers to the entire sentence. The importance of this fact is that the remainder of the sentence, the phrase "makes quite a statement," can now make a statement about the sentence as a whole. If we had used a pronoun for this, we could have written something like "this sentence makes quite a statement."

It seems silly to go through this trouble when pronouns will suffice (and when they make more sense to the casual reader), but in systems of [[mathematical logic]], there is generally no analog of the pronoun. It is somewhat surprising, in fact, that self-reference can be achieved at all in these systems.

Upon closer inspection, it can be seen that in fact, the [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] example above uses a [[quine (computing)|quine]], and f(x) is actually the quine function itself.

Indirect self-reference was studied in great depth by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. Quine]] (after whom the operation above is named), and occupies a central place in the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]].  Among the paradoxical statements developed by Quine is the following:

 "yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation" yields a false statement when preceded by its quotation

'''Microsoft Bookshelf''' was a [[Reference work|reference]] collection introduced in 1987 as part of [[Microsoft]]'s extensive work in promoting [[CD-ROM]] technology as a distribution medium for [[electronic publishing]].  The original [[MS-DOS]] version showcased the massive storage capacity of CD-ROM technology, and was accessed while the user was using one of 13 different word processor programs that Bookshelf supported.  Subsequent versions were produced for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and became a commercial success as part of the [[Microsoft Home]] brand.  It was often bundled with [[personal computer]]s as a cheaper alternative to the [[Microsoft Encarta|Encarta Suite]]. The Encarta Deluxe Suite / Reference Library versions also bundled Bookshelf.

==Content==
Microsoft Bookshelf was discontinued in 2000. In later editions of the Encarta suite (Encarta 2000 and onwards), Bookshelf was replaced with a dedicated ''Encarta Dictionary'', a superset of the printed edition. There has been some controversy over the decision, since the dictionary lacks the other books provided in Bookshelf which many found to be a useful reference, such as the dictionary of quotations (replaced with a quotations section in ''Encarta'' that links to relevant articles and people) and the Internet Directory, although the directory is now a [[wikt:moot point|moot point]] since many of the sites listed in offline directories no longer exist.

The original 1987 edition contained ''[[Roget's Thesaurus|The Original Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases]]'', ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', [[World Almanac]] and Book of Facts, [[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]], [[The Chicago Manual of Style]] (13th Edition), the U.S. ZIP Code Directory, Houghton Mifflin Usage Alert, [[Houghton Mifflin]] Spelling Verifier and Corrector, Business Information Sources, and Forms and Letters.&lt;ref name="Bookshelf 87"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computers for Lawyers|work=Chapter 25|first=Paul|last=Bernstein|publisher=ATLA Press 1992 {{ISBN|0-941916-64-2}}|year=1992|isbn=0-941916-64-2|accessdate=2006-04-18|url=http://www.cyberbarassociation.net/cfl/book/chpt25.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504152218/http://www.cyberbarassociation.net/cfl/book/chpt25.htm|archivedate=2006-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titles in non-US versions of Bookshelf were different. For example, the 1997 UK edition included the Chambers Dictionary, Bloomsbury Treasury of Quotations, and Hutchinson Concise Encyclopedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/software/722/bookshelf-british-reference-collection Bookshelf British Reference Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019005540/http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/software/722/bookshelf-british-reference-collection |date=2009-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Windows release of Bookshelf added a number of new reference titles, including ''The Concise [[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'' and an [[Web directory|Internet Directory]]. Other titles were added and some were dropped in subsequent years.  By 1994, the [[English language|English-language]] version also contained the ''[[Columbia Dictionary of Quotations]]''; ''The Concise [[Columbia Encyclopedia]]''; the ''[[Hammond Intermediate World Atlas]]''; and ''[[The People's Chronology]]''.&lt;ref name="Bookshelf 94"&gt;{{cite web

==Technology==

===Bookshelf 1.0 engine===
Bookshelf 1.0 used a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[hypertext]] engine that Microsoft acquired when it bought the company Cytation in 1986.&lt;ref name="Microsoft 1980s"&gt;{{cite web
 |title=A History of the Personal Computer: The People and the Technology

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also used for Microsoft Stat Pack and Microsoft Small Business Consultant, it was a [[Terminate and Stay Resident]] (TSR) program that ran alongside a dominant program, unbeknownst to the dominant program. Like Apple's similar [[Hypercard]] reader, Bookshelf engine's files used a single [[compound document]], containing large numbers of subdocuments ("cards" or "articles").  They both differ from current browsers which normally treat each "page" or "article" as a separate file.

Though similar to Apple's [[Hypercard]] reader in many ways, the Bookshelf engine had several key differences. Unlike Hypercard files, Bookshelf files required compilation and complex markup codes. This made the files more difficult to pirate, addressing a key concern of early electronic publishers. Furthermore, Bookshelf's engine was designed to run as fast as possible on slow first-generation [[CD-ROM]] drives, some of which required as much as a half-second to move the drive head. Such hardware constraints made Hypercard impractical for high-capacity CD-ROMs.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Bookshelf also had full text searching capability, which made it easy to find needed information.

===Bookshelf 2.0 engine===
Collaborating with [[DuPont]], the Microsoft CD-ROM division developed a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] version of its engine for applications as diverse as [[Document management system|document management]], [[online help]], and a CD-ROM [[encyclopedia]]. In a [[skunkworks project]], these developers worked secretly with Multimedia Division developers so that the engine would be usable for more ambitious multimedia applications. Thus they integrated a multimedia [[markup language]], [[full text search]], and extensibility using [[software componentry|software objects]],&lt;ref name="Viewer 2.0"&gt;{{cite book|
  title=Microsoft Multimedia Viewer How-To Cd: Create Exciting Multimedia With Video, Animation, Music, and Speech for Windows/Book and Cd|
  last=Pruitt|first=Stephen|publisher=Waite Group Pr|isbn=1-878739-60-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are commonplace in modern internet browsing.

In 1992, Microsoft started selling the Bookshelf engine to third-party developers, marketing the product as Microsoft Multimedia Viewer. The idea was that such a tool would help a burgeoning growth of CD-ROM titles that would spur demand for Windows. Although the engine had multimedia capabilities that would not be matched by Web browsers until the late 1990s, Microsoft Viewer did not enjoy commercial success as a standalone product. However, Microsoft continued to use the engine for its [[Encarta]] and [[WinHelp]] applications, though the multimedia functions are rarely used in Windows help files.

===Viewer 3.0===
In 1993, the developers who were working on the next generation viewer were moved to the [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo systems group]] which was charged with delivering [[Bill Gates]]' 'vision' of 'Information at your fingertips'.  This advanced browser was a fully componentized application using what are now known as [[Component Object Model]] objects, designed for hypermedia browsing across large networks and whose main competitor was thought to be [[Lotus Notes]].  Long before Netscape appeared, this team, known as the WEB (web enhanced browser) team had already shipped a network capable hypertext browser capable of doing everything that HTML browsers would not be able to do until the turn of the century.  Nearly all technologies of Cairo shipped.  The WEB browser was not one of them, though it influenced the design of many other common Microsoft technologies.

==Reception==
''[[Byte (magazine)|BYTE]]'' in 1989 listed Microsoft Bookshelf as among the "Excellence" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it "is the first substantial application of CD-ROM technology" and "a harbinger of personal library systems to come".&lt;ref name="byte198901"&gt;{{Cite magazine |date=January 1989 |title=The BYTE Awards |url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1989-01/1989_01_BYTE_14-01_PC_Communications_and_Annual_Awards_and_Digitizing_Tablets#page/n371/mode/2up |magazine=BYTE |page=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum of Comparative Zoology''', full name "The Louis Agassiz Museum of Comparative Zoology", often abbreviated simply to "MCZ", is the [[zoology]] museum located on the grounds of [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. It is one of three natural history research museums at Harvard whose public face is the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]]. Harvard MCZ's collections consist of some 21 million specimens, of which several thousand are on rotating display at the public museum.  The current director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology is [[James Hanken]], the Louis Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard University.

Many of the exhibits in the public museum have not only zoological interest but also historical significance. Past exhibits have included a [[fossil]] [[sand dollar]] which was found by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1834, Captain Cook's [[mamo]], and two [[pheasant]]s that once belonged to [[George Washington]], now on loan to Mount Vernon in Virginia.

The Harvard Museum of Natural History is physically connected to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]]; for visitors, one admission ticket grants access to both museums. The research collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology are not open to the public.

==History==
The Museum of Comparative Zoology was founded in 1859 through the efforts of zoologist [[Louis Agassiz]], and the museum used to be referred to as "The Agassiz" after its founder.&lt;ref&gt;Winsor, Mary P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w6vLeToUzHEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=reading+the+shape+of+nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7qvSLpLfZAhWFPN8KHUbnBN4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=reading%20the%20shape%20of%20nature&amp;f=false Reading the Shape of Nature: Comparative Zoology at the Agassiz Museum] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  Agassiz designed the collection to illustrate the variety and [[Comparative anatomy|comparative relationships]] of [[animal]] life.

The [[Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory]] was created in 1894 when [[Radcliffe College]] rented a space on the fifth floor of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University to convert into a women's laboratory. Prior to this acquisition, Radcliffe science laboratories were taught using inadequate facilities, converting spaces such as bathrooms in old houses into physics laboratories, which Harvard professors often refused to teach in&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=HUL Access/2.0|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/1468-0424.12292/abstract|doi=10.1111/1468-0424.12292/epdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The laboratory space was converted from an office or storage closet, and was sandwiched between other invertebrate storage rooms on the fifth floor.

==Departments==
The museum comprises twelve departments: [[Biological Oceanography]], [[Entomology]], [[Herpetology]], [[Ichthyology]], [[Invertebrate paleontology|Invertebrate Paleontology]], [[Invertebrate zoology|Invertebrate Zoology]], [[Mammalogy]], [[Marine invertebrates]], [[Malacology]], [[Ornithology]], [[Population Genetics]], and [[Vertebrate Paleontology]].  The [[Ernst Mayr|Ernst Mayr Library]] and its archives join in supporting the work of the museum.  The Ernst Mayr Library is a founding member of the [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org Biodiversity Heritage Library].

==Publications==
The museum publishes two journals: the ''Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College'', first published in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/2803|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Breviora'', first published in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breviora|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/3989|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displays==
In contrast to numerous more modern museums, the Harvard Museum of Natural History has many hundreds of [[taxidermy|stuffed animals]] on display, from the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.  Notable exhibits include [[whale]] [[skeleton]]s, the largest [[turtle]] [[Animal shell|shell]] ever found (eight feet long), "the Harvard [[mastodon]]", a {{convert|42|ft|m|sing=on}} long ''[[Kronosaurus]]'' skeleton, the skeleton of a [[dodo]], and a [[coelacanth]] preserved in fluid. The two-story Great Mammal Hall was renovated in 2009 in celebration of the 150th anniversary of founding of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.

New and changing exhibitions in the Harvard Museum of Natural History include "Evolution" (2008); "The Language of Color" (2008 to 2013); "Arthropods: Creatures that Rule" (2006); "New England Forests" (2011); and "Mollusks: Shelled Masters of the Marine Realm" (2012).

In [[Christian]] scribal practice, '''nomina sacra''' (singular: '''''nomen sacrum''''' from [[Latin]] '''''sacred name''''') is the abbreviation of several frequently occurring divine names or titles, especially in [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts of [[Holy Scripture]]. A nomen sacrum consists of two or more letters from the original word spanned by an [[overline]].

Metzger lists 15 such expressions from Greek papyri: the Greek counterparts of ''God'', ''Lord'', ''Jesus'', ''Christ'', ''Son'', ''Spirit'', ''David'', ''Cross'', ''Mother'', ''Father'', ''Israel'', ''Savior'', ''Man'', ''Jerusalem'', and ''Heaven''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Metzger, ''Manuscripts of the Greek Bible'', pp.36-37&lt;/ref&gt; These ''nomina sacra'' are all found in Greek manuscripts of the 3rd century and earlier, except ''Mother'', which appears in the 4th.&lt;ref&gt;''Text of the Earliest New Testament Greek Manuscripts'' - Philip Comfort and David Barrett (1999) pp.34-35&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nomina sacra'' also occur in some form in [[Latin]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] (indicated by the ''[[wikt:՟|pativ]]''), [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old Nubian]], and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] (indicated by the ''[[titlo]]'').

==Origin and development==

[[File:Nomina sacra IC XC 2.jpg|thumb|300px|Nomina sacra IC XC, from the Byzantine Greek ΙΗCΟΥC ΧΡΙCΤΟC (Jesus Christ). Detail from an icon at the Troyan Monastery in Bulgaria. [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Icon_of_Virgin_and_Child_in_Anti-Chamber_of_church_at_monastery.JPG See complete icon]]]
''Nomina sacra'' are consistently observed in even the earliest extant Christian writings, along with the [[codex]] form rather than the [[scroll|roll]], implying that when these were written, in approximately the second century, the practice had already been established for some time. However, it is not known precisely when and how the ''nomina sacra'' first arose.

The initial system of ''nomina sacra'' apparently consisted of just four or five words, called ''nomina divina'': the Greek words for ''Jesus'', ''Christ'', ''Lord'', ''God'', and possibly ''Spirit''. The practice quickly expanded to a number of other words regarded as sacred.&lt;ref&gt;S. D. Charlesworth, "Consensus standardization in the systematic approach to ''nomina sacra'' in second- and third-century gospel manuscripts", ''Aegyptus'' 86 (2006), pp. 37-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the system of ''nomina sacra'' that came to prevail, abbreviation is by ''contraction'', meaning that the first and last letter (at least) of each word are used. In a few early cases, an alternate practice is seen of abbreviation by ''suspension'', meaning that the initial two letters (at least) of the word are used; e.g., the opening verses of Revelation in {{Papyrus link|18}} write {{lang|grc|Ἰησοῦς Χριστός}} (''Jesus Christ'') as {{overline|ΙΗ}} {{overline|ΧΡ}}. Contraction, however, offered the practical advantage of indicating the [[Ancient Greek nouns#Cases|case]] of the abbreviated noun.

It is evident that the use of ''nomina sacra'' was an act of reverence rather than a purely practical space-saving device, as they were employed even where well-established abbreviations of far more frequent words such as ''and'' were avoided, and the ''nomen sacrum'' itself was written with generous spacing. Furthermore, early scribes often distinguished between mundane and sacred occurrences of the same word, e.g. a ''spirit'' vs. the ''Spirit'', and applied ''nomina sacra'' only to the latter (at times necessarily revealing an exegetical choice), although later scribes would mechanically abbreviate all occurrences.

Scholars have advanced a number of theories on the origin of the ''nomina sacra''. An obvious parallel that likely offered some inspiration is the Jewish practice of writing the divine name of God, commonly rendered as Jehovah or Yahweh in English, as the Hebrew [[tetragrammaton]] (transliterated as YHWH) even in Greek Scriptures. The Septuagint manuscript [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 1007|LXX P.Oxy.VII.1007]] uses two Paleo-Hebrew ''yodh's'' with a horizontal line through them for YHWH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earliest Christian Artifacts: Manuscripts and Christian Origins|author=Larry W. Hurtado|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com.gt/books?hl=es&amp;id=w5FpP9ZxqlYC&amp;q=1007#v=snippet&amp;q=1007&amp;f=false|isbn=0802828957}}&lt;/ref&gt; (an abbreviated form of the Name of God translitered as {{overline|YY}}). Pavlos Vasileiadis, a Doctor of Theology at the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], quoting Gerard Gertoux, states that "the subsequent use of the contracted forms of the original nomina sacra κ[ύριο]ς [({{overline|κς}})] and θ[εό]ς [({{overline|θς}})] within Christian manuscripts probably reflects the Jewish practice of replacing the Tetragrammaton by י[הו]ה.",&lt;ref name=VasileiadisOPTH&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aspects of rendering the sacred Tetragrammaton in Greek|author=Pavlos D. Vasileiadis|journal=[[Open Theology]] |volume=1 |year=2014 |pages=56–88 |url=https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/opth.2014.1.issue-1/opth-2014-0006/opth-2014-0006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GertouxYHWHIEUA&gt;{{cite book |last=Gertoux |first=Gerard |title=The Name of God Y.eH.oW.aH which is pronounced as it is written I_Eh_oU_Ah: Its story |publisher=University Press of America |location=Lanham, Md. |year=2002 |isbn=0761822046 |url=https://books.google.com.gt/books/about/The_Name_of_God_Y_eH_oW_aH_which_is_Pron.html?id=bz_9HQAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; transliterated in koine Greek as ιά.&lt;ref name=jewishenciclopediatetra&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Tetragrammaton |author= Crawford Howell Toy |author2=Ludwig Blau |year=1906 |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14346-tetragrammaton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek culture also employed a number of ways of abbreviating even proper names, though none in quite the same form as the ''nomina sacra''. Inspiration for the contracted forms (using the first and last letter) has also been seen in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], where Jesus speaks of himself as "the beginning and the end" and "the first and the last" as well "[[the Alpha and the Omega]]".&lt;ref&gt;Colin H. Roberts, ''Manuscript, Society, and Belief in Early Christian Egypt'' (1979), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek numerals]] have been suggested as the origin of the [[overline]] spanning the whole ''nomen sacrum'', with the suspended form {{overline|ΙΗ}} being simply the ordinary way of writing ''eighteen'', for example.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Hurtado, [http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/books/nomin_s.pdf "The Origin of the Nomina Sacra: A Proposal"], ''JBL'' 117 (1998), pp. 655-673.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Observer's Books''''' were a series of small, pocket-sized books, published by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] in the United Kingdom from 1937 to 2003. They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items.&lt;ref name=OPSCS&gt;{{cite web|title=About the books|url=http://www.observersbooksociety.co.uk/about_books.html|publisher=OPSCS|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cogswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogswell|first=Barry|title=To Have Borne Witness: Memories and Observations Regarding Human Population and Species Loss|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290|year=2014|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4969-0310-5|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds.  

The books were produced with paper [[dust jacket|dust covers]] up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as "Glossies". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear.

The first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around £220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books.

In 1942 a special edition book was brought out on "airplanes" {{sic}}. This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. 

The first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like ''Aircraft'', ''Automobiles'' and ''Railway Locomotives'' proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. 

When Warne was acquired by [[Penguin Books|Penguin books]] in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).

After a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled ''Observer's Book of Observer's Books'' in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of ''Wayside and Woodland'' in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13862">In [[statistics]], '''qualitative comparative analysis''' ('''QCA''') is a [[data analysis]] technique for determining which logical conclusions a [[data set]] supports. The analysis begins with listing and counting all the combinations of variables observed in the data set, followed by applying the rules of [[logical inference]] to determine which descriptive inferences or implications the data supports. The technique was originally developed by [[Charles Ragin]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Ragin
 | first = Charles C.
 | title = The Comparative Method: Moving Beyond Qualitative and Quantitative Strategies 
 | publisher = [[University of California Press]]
 | date = 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of technique==
In the case of categorical variables, QCA begins by listing and counting all types of cases which occur, where each type of case is defined by its unique combination of values of its independent and dependent variables. For instance, if there were four categorical variables of interest, {A,B,C,D}, and A and B were [[dichotomous]] (could take on two values), C could take on five values, and D could take on three, then there would be 60 possible types of observations determined by the possible combinations of variables, not all of which would necessarily occur in real life. By counting the number of observations that exist for each of the 60 unique combination of variables, QCA can determine which descriptive inferences or implications are empirically supported by a data set. Thus, the input to QCA is a data set of any size, from small-N to large-N, and the output of QCA is a set of descriptive inferences or implications the data supports.

In QCA's next step, inferential logic or Boolean algebra is used to simplify or reduce the number of inferences to the minimum set of inferences supported by the data. This reduced set of inferences is termed the "prime implicates" by QCA adherents. For instance, if the presence of conditions A and B is always associated with the presence of a particular value of D, regardless of the observed value of C, then the value that C takes is irrelevant. Thus, all five inferences involving A and B and any of the five values of C may be replaced by the single descriptive inference "(A and B) implies the particular value of D".

To establish that the prime implicants or descriptive inferences derived from the data by the QCA method are causal requires establishing the existence of causal mechanism using another method such as process tracing, formal logic, intervening variables, or established multidisciplinary knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-qualitativecomparatvnlyss.html qualitative comparative analysis - History Of qualitative comparative analysis | Encyclopedia.com: Dictionary Of Sociology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The method is used in [[social science]] and is based on the [[wikt:binary|binary]] logic of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], and attempts to ensure that all possible combinations of variables that can be made across the cases under investigation are considered.

==Motivation==
The technique of listing case types by potential variable combinations assists with case selection by making investigators aware of all possible case types that would need to be investigated, at a minimum, if they exist, in order to test a certain hypothesis or to derive new inferences from an existing data set. In situations where the available observations constitute the entire population of cases, this method alleviates the small N problem by allowing inferences to be drawn by evaluating and comparing the number of cases exhibiting each combination of variables.  The small N problem arises when the number of units of analysis (e.g. countries) available is inherently limited. For example: a study where countries are the unit of analysis is limited in that are only a limited number of countries in the world (less than 200), less than necessary for some (probabilistic) statistical techniques. By maximizing the number of comparisons that can be made across the cases under investigation, causal inferences are according to Ragin possible.&lt;ref name=GOLDTHORPE&gt;J. Goldthorpe, "Current issues in comparative macrosociology" in ''Comparative social research'', 16, 1997, pp. 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique allows the identification of multiple causal pathways and interaction effects that may not be detectable via statistical analysis that typically requires its data set to conform to one model. Thus, it is the first step to identifying subsets of a data set conforming to particular causal pathway based on the combinations of covariates prior to quantitative statistical analyses testing conformance to a model; and helps qualitative researchers to correctly limit the scope of claimed findings to the type of observations they analyze.

==Criticism==
As this is a logical (deterministic) and not a statistical (probabilistic) technique, with "crisp-set" QCA ([[csQCA]]), the original application of QCA, variables can only have two values, which is problematic as the researcher has to determine the values of each variable. For example: GDP per capita has to be divided by the researcher in two categories (e.g. low = 0 and high = 1). But as this variable is essentially a continuous variable, the division will always be arbitrary. A second, related problem is that the technique does not allow an assessment of the effect of the relative strengths of the independent variables (as they can only have two values).&lt;ref name=GOLDTHORPE/&gt; Ragin, and other scholars such as Lasse Cronqvist, have tried to deal with these issues by developing new tools that extend QCA, such as multi-value QCA ([[mvQCA]]) and fuzzy set QCA ([[fsQCA]]). Note: Multi-value QCA is simply QCA applied to observations having categorical variables with more than two values. Crisp-Set QCA can be considered a special case of Multi-value QCA.&lt;ref name="rihoux2006"&gt;{{Citation | last=Rihoux | first=Benoît | title=Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and Related Systematic Comparative Methods: Recent Advances and Remaining Challenges for Social Science Research | journal= International Sociology | year=2006 | volume=21 | page=679 | doi=10.1177/0268580906067836 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Statistical methodologists have argued that QCA's strong assumptions render its findings both fragile and prone to [[type I error]]. Simon Hug argues that deterministic hypotheses and error-free measures are exceedingly rare in social science and uses [[Monte Carlo simulations]] to demonstrate the fragility of QCA results if either assumption is violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Qualitative Comparative Analysis: How Inductive Use and Measurement Error Lead to Problematic Inference|url = http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/252|journal = Political Analysis|date = 2013-04-01|issn = 1047-1987|pages = 252–265|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1093/pan/mps061|first = Simon|last = Hug}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Krogslund, Donghyun Danny Choi, and Mathias Poertner further demonstrate that QCA results are highly sensitive to minor parametric and model-susceptibility changes and are vulnerable to type I error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fuzzy Sets on Shaky Ground: Parameter Sensitivity and Confirmation Bias in fsQCA|url = http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/21|journal = Political Analysis|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1047-1987|pages = 21–41|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/pan/mpu016|first = Chris|last = Krogslund|first2 = Donghyun Danny|last2 = Choi|first3 = Mathias|last3 = Poertner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bear F.

==Response to criticisms==
QCA can be performed probabilistically or deterministically with observations of categorical variables. For instance, the existence of a descriptive inference or implication is supported deterministically by the absence of any counter-example cases to the inference; i.e. if a researcher claims condition X implies condition Y, then, deterministically, there must not exist any counterexample cases having condition X, but not condition Y.  However, if the researcher wants to claim that condition X is a probabilistic 'predictor' of condition Y, in another similar set of cases, then the proportion of counterexample cases to an inference to the proportion of cases having that same combination of conditions can be set at a threshold value of for example 80% or higher.  For each prime implicant that QCA outputs via its logical inference reduction process, the "coverage" — percentage out of all observations that exhibit that implication or inference — and the "consistency" — the percentage of observations conforming to that combination of variables having that particular value of the dependent variable or outcome — are calculated and reported, and can be used as indicators of the strength of such a explorative probabilistic inference. In real-life complex societal processes, QCA enables the identification of multiple sets of conditions that are consistently associated with a particular output value in order to explore for causal predictors.

Fuzzy set QCA aims to handle variables, such as GDP per capita, where the number of categories, decimal values of monetary units, becomes too large to use mvQCA, or in cases were uncertainty or ambiguity or measurement error in the classification of a case needs to be acknowledged.&lt;ref name="rihouxMarx2013"&gt;{{Citation | last=Rihoux | first=Benoît | title=QCA, 25 Years after"The Comparative Method": Mapping, Challenges, and Innovations--Mini-Symposium | journal= Political Research Quarterly | year=2013 | volume=66 | pages=167–235 | doi=10.1177/1065912912468269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fields of use==
QCA has now become used in many more fields than political science which Ragin first developed the method for. Today the method has been used in:

A '''reference work''' is a [[book]] or [[periodical literature|periodical]] (or [[electronic publishing|its electronic equivalent]]) to which one can refer for [[information]]. The information is intended to be found quickly when needed. Reference works are usually ''referred'' to for particular pieces of information, rather than read beginning to end. The writing style used in these works is informative; the authors avoid use of the first person, and emphasize facts. Many reference works are compiled by a team of contributors whose work is coordinated by one or more editors rather than by an individual author. [[index (publishing)|Indices]] are commonly provided in many types of reference work. Updated [[edition (book)|edition]]s are usually published as needed, in some cases [[annual publication|annually]] (e.g. ''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'', ''[[Who's Who]]''). Reference works include [[dictionary|dictionaries]], [[thesaurus]]es, [[encyclopedia]]s, [[almanac]]s, [[bibliography|bibliographies]], and [[Library catalog|catalogs]] (e.g. catalogs of libraries, museums or the works of individual artists).&lt;ref name=Library&gt;{{cite web|last=The University of Santo Tomas Miguel de Benavides Library|title=The Reference Materials|url=http://library.ust.edu.ph/pages/reference.html|accessdate=3 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507153507/http://library.ust.edu.ph/pages/reference.html|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many reference works are available in electronic form and can be obtained as [[application software]], [[CD-ROM]]s, [[DVD]]s, or online through the [[Internet]].

A reference work is useful to its users if they attribute some degree of [[trust (emotion)|trust]].

==Reference book==
In comparison, a '''reference book''' or reference-only book in a [[library]] is one that may only be used in the library and may not be borrowed from the library. Many such books are reference works (in the first sense), which are, usually, used briefly or photocopied from, and therefore, do not need to be borrowed. Keeping reference books in the library assures that they will always be available for use on demand. Some reference-only books are too valuable to permit borrowers to take them out. Reference-only items may be shelved in a reference collection located separately from [[library circulation|circulating]] items. Some libraries consist entirely, or to a large extent, of books which may not be borrowed.

==Electronic resources==
An electronic resource is a piece of information that is stored electronically, which is usually found on a computer, including information that is available on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AllWords.com|title=Electronic Resources|url=http://www.allwords.com/word-electronic+resource.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libraries offer numerous types of electronic resources, such as subject research guides, indices, electronic books and texts, electronic journals, library catalogs, reference sources, statistical sources, sound recordings, and image databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The University of Chicago Library|title=Types of Electronic Resources|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/net/types.html|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Roving reference as a library service practice was first formalized in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A 1999 report from the [[International Federation of Library Associations]] identified several advantages and disadvantages with roving reference in the pre-mobile era. The roving model allowed librarians to engage with "the majority of users who have questions in mind [who] do not approach the reference desk for assistance".&lt;ref name=ifla/&gt; However, libraries reported that some staff were uncomfortable with the practice, and that there were concerns about user privacy.&lt;ref name=ifla/&gt;

Beginning in the 2000s, librarians used laptops or laptop carts to engage in technology-supported roaming reference. Since the development of mobile technologies, roving reference can be facilitated with the use of such technologies, such as [[tablet computer]]s, which allow librarians to readily check the [[online public access catalogue]] or the library's electronic databases while away from their desk.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Annie; Stevens, Mark (2012). "We're Going Mobile: Roving Reference in an Academic Library" Utah Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; This has contributed to the increased popularization of roving-reference programs as supplements for more traditional reference desks. The model has also been extended to service beyond the library building (library outreach), for example in a dormitory or faculty building at an academic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editors=Bowers, Jennifer; Forbes, Carrie|title=Rethinking Reference for Academic Libraries: Innovative Developments and Future Trends|year=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|chapter=Roving Reference|author=Wilkinson, Zara|pages=85&amp;ndash;98|isbn=9781442244535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SDS-PAGE is an electrophoresis method that allows protein separation by mass. The medium (also referred to as ′matrix′) is a polyacrylamide-based discontinuous gel. In addition, SDS ([[sodium dodecyl sulfate]]) is used. About 1.4 grams of SDS bind to a gram of protein,&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Reynolds JA, [[Charles Tanford]] | title=Binding of dodecyl sulfate to proteins at high binding ratios.

SDS acts as a [[surfactant]], covering the proteins' intrinsic charge and conferring them very similar charge-to-mass ratios. The intrinsic charges of the proteins are negligible in comparison to the SDS loading, and the positive charges are also greatly reduced in the basic pH range of a separating gel. Upon application of a constant electric field, the protein migrate towards the anode, each with a different speed, depending on its mass. This simple procedure allows precise protein separation by mass.

SDS tends to form spherical [[micelle]]s in aqueous solutions above a certain concentration called the [[critical micellar concentration]] (CMC). Above the critical micellar concentration of 7 to 10 millimolar in solutions, the SDS simultaneously occurs as single molecules ([[monomer]]) and as micelles, below the CMC SDS occurs only as monomers in aqueous solutions. At the critical micellar concentration, a micelle consists of about 62 SDS molecules.&lt;ref name="TurroYekta1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turro|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Yekta|first2=Ahmad|title=Luminescent probes for detergent solutions.

Exceptions are e.g. proteins that were previously stabilised by covalent [[cross-link]]ing and the SDS-resistant protein complexes, which are stable even in the presence of SDS (the latter, however, only at room temperature). To denature the SDS-resistant complexes a high activation energy is required, which is achieved by heating. SDS resistance is based on a metastability of the protein fold. Although the native, fully folded, SDS-resistant protein does not have sufficient stability in the presence of SDS, the [[chemical equilibrium]] of denaturation at room temperature occurs slowly. Stable protein complexes are characterised not only by SDS resistance but also by stability against [[protease]]s and an increased [[biological half-life]].&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Manning M, Colón W| title=Structural basis of protein kinetic stability: resistance to sodium dodecyl sulfate suggests a central role for rigidity and a bias toward beta-sheet structure. | journal=Biochemistry | year= 2004 | volume= 43 | issue= 35 | pages= 11248–54 | pmid=15366934 | doi=10.1021/bi0491898 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=15366934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The SDS-PAGE method is composed of gel preparation, sample preparation, electrophoresis, protein staining or [[western blot]]ting and analysis of the generated banding pattern.

=== Gel production ===
[[File:Electrophoresis gel combs 2.jpg|thumb|Sample combs with different numbers of pockets, each prong leaves a pocket in the gel when pulled out]]
[[File:Acrylamidgel.JPG|thumb|Polymerised separating and stacking gel before removing the sample comb (white) between the spacers (black), in the stacking gel are small amounts of bromophenol blue for improved visibility, the separating gel is unstained]]
When using different buffers in the gel (discontinuous gel electrophoresis), the gels are made up to one day prior to electrophoresis, so that the [[diffusion]] does not lead to a mixing of the buffers. The gel is produced by [[radical polymerisation]] in a mold consisting of two sealed glass plates with spacers between the glass plates. In a typical mini-gel setting, the spacers have a thickness of 0.75&amp;nbsp;mm or 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm, which determines the loading capacity of the gel. For pouring the gel solution, the plates are usually clamped in a stand which temporarily seals the otherwise open underside of the glass plates with the two spacers. For the gel solution, acrylamide is mixed as gel-former (usually 4% V/V in the stacking gel and 10-12 % in the separating gel), methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker, stacking or separating gel buffer, water and SDS. By adding the catalyst [[TEMED]] and the radical initiator [[ammonium persulfate]] (APS) the polymerisation is started. The solution is then poured between the glass plates without creating bubbles. Depending on the amount of catalyst and radical starter and depending on the temperature, the polymerisation lasts between a quarter of an hour and several hours. The lower gel (separating gel) is poured first and covered with a few drops of a barely water-soluble alcohol (usually buffer-saturated butanol or isopropanol), which eliminates bubbles from the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] and protects the gel solution of the [[radical scavenger]] oxygen. After the polymerisation of the separating gel, the alcohol is discarded and the residual alcohol is removed with [[filter paper]]. After addition of APS and TEMED to the stacking gel solution, it is poured on top of the solid separation gel. Afterwards, a suitable sample comb is inserted between the glass plates without creating bubbles. The sample comb is carefully pulled out after polymerisation, leaving pockets for the sample application. For later use of proteins for [[protein sequencing]], the gels are often prepared the day before electrophoresis to reduce reactions of unpolymerised acrylamide with [[cysteine]]s in proteins.

By using a [[gradient mixer]], gradient gels with a gradient of acrylamide (usually from 4 to 12%) can be cast, which have a larger separation range of the molecular masses.&lt;ref name="Margolis"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Margolis J, Kenrick KG| title=2-dimensional resolution of plasma proteins by combination of polyacrylamide disc and gradient gel electrophoresis. | journal=Nature | year= 1969 | volume= 221 | issue= 5185 | pages= 1056–7 | pmid=5774398 | doi= 10.1038/2211056a0| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=5774398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial gel systems (so-called ''pre-cast gels'') usually use the buffer substance [[Bis-tris methane]] with a pH value between 6.4 and 7.2 both in the stacking gel and in the separating gel.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hachmann|first1=John P.|last2=Amshey|first2=Joseph W.|title=Models of protein modification in Tris–glycine and neutral pH Bis–Tris gels during electrophoresis: Effect of gel pH|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=342|issue=2|year=2005|pages=237–245|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2005.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WiltfangArold1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiltfang|first1=Jens|last2=Arold|first2=Norbert|last3=Neuhoff|first3=Volker|title=A new multiphasic buffer system for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins and peptides with molecular masses 100 000-1000, and their detection with picomolar sensitivity|journal=Electrophoresis|volume=12|issue=5|year=1991|pages=352–366|issn=0173-0835|doi=10.1002/elps.1150120507}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gels are delivered cast and ready-to-use. Since they use only one buffer ([[continuous gel electrophoresis]]) and have a nearly neutral pH, they can be stored for several weeks. The more neutral pH slows the hydrolysis and thus the decomposition of the polyacrylamide. Furthermore, there are fewer acrylamide-modified cysteines in the proteins.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"/&gt; Due to the constant pH in collecting and separating gel there is no stacking effect. Proteins in BisTris gels can not be stained with ruthenium complexes.&lt;ref name="MoebiusDenker2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moebius|first1=Jan|last2=Denker|first2=Katrin|last3=Sickmann|first3=Albert|title=Ruthenium (II) tris-bathophenanthroline disulfonate is well suitable for Tris-Glycine PAGE but not for Bis-Tris gels|journal=Proteomics|volume=7|issue=4|year=2007|pages=524–527|issn=1615-9853|doi=10.1002/pmic.200600642}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gel system has a comparatively large separation range, which can be varied by using [[MES (buffer)|MES]] or [[MOPS]] in the running buffer.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"/&gt;

=== Sample preparation ===
[[File:Disulfide reduction by DTT-2.png|thumb|Disulfide reduction by DTT]]
During sample preparation, the sample buffer, and thus SDS, is added in excess to the proteins, and the sample is then heated to 95&amp;nbsp;°C for five minutes, or alternatively 70°C for ten minutes. Heating disrupts the [[secondary structure|secondary]] and [[tertiary structure]]s of the protein by disrupting [[hydrogen bond]]s and stretching the molecules. Optionally, [[disulfide bridge]]s can be cleaved by reduction. For this purpose, reducing [[thiol]]s such as [[β-mercaptoethanol]] (β-ME, 5% by volume), [[dithiothreitol]] (DTT, 10 millimolar) or [[dithioerythritol]] (DTE, 10 millimolar) are added to the sample buffer. After cooling to room temperature, each sample is pipetted into its own well in the gel, which was previously immersed in electrophoresis buffer in the electrophoresis apparatus.

In addition to the samples, a [[molecular-weight size marker]] is usually loaded onto the gel. This consists of proteins of known sizes and thereby allows the estimation (with an error of ± 10%) of the sizes of the proteins in the actual samples, which migrate in parallel in different tracks of the gel.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian M. Rosenberg|title=Protein Analysis and Purification: Benchtop Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gi-UgCF8G6EC&amp;pg=PA103|date=22 December 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-8176-4412-3|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size marker is often pipetted into the first or last pocket of a gel.

=== Electrophoresis ===
[[File:Gelelektrophoreseapparatur.jpg|thumb|Electrophoresis chamber after a few minutes of electrophoresis. In the first pocket a size marker was applied with bromophenol blue, in the other pockets, the samples were added [[bromocresol green]]]]
For separation, the denatured samples are loaded onto a gel of polyacrylamide, which is placed in an electrophoresis buffer with suitable electrolytes. Thereafter, a [[voltage]] (usually around 100 V, 10-20 V per cm gel length) is applied, which causes a migration of negatively charged molecules through the gel in the direction of the positively charged [[anode]]. The gel acts like a sieve. Small proteins migrate relatively easily through the mesh of the gel, while larger proteins are more likely to be retained and thereby migrate more slowly through the gel, thereby allowing proteins to be separated by molecular size. The electrophoresis lasts between half an hour to several hours depending on the voltage and length of gel used.

The fastest-migrating proteins (with a molecular weight of less than 5 KDa) form the buffer front together with the anionic components of the electrophoresis buffer, which also migrate through the gel. The area of the buffer front is made visible by adding the comparatively small, anionic dye [[bromophenol blue]] to the sample buffer. Due to the relatively small molecule size of bromophenol blue, it migrates faster than proteins. By optical control of the migrating colored band, the electrophoresis can be stopped before the dye and also the samples have completely migrated through the gel and leave it.

The most commonly used method is the discontinuous SDS-PAGE. In this method, the proteins migrate first into a collecting gel with neutral pH, in which they are concentrated and then they migrate into a separating gel with basic pH, in which the actual separation takes place. Stacking and separating gels differ by different [[wiktionary:Pore|pore]] size (4-6 % T and 10-20 % T), [[ionic strength]] and [[pH value]]s (pH 6.8 or pH 8.8). The electrolyte most frequently used is an SDS-containing [[Tris]]-[[glycine]]-[[chloride]] [[Buffering agent|buffer]] system. At neutral pH, glycine predominantly forms the [[zwitterionic]] form, at high pH the glycines lose positive charges and become predominantly anionic. In the collection gel, the smaller, negatively charged chloride ions migrate in front of the proteins (as leading ions) and the slightly larger, negatively and partially positively charged glycinate ions migrate behind the proteins (as initial trailing ions), whereas in the comparatively basic separating gel both ions migrate in front of the proteins. The pH gradient between the stacking and separation gel buffers leads to a stacking effect at the border of the stacking gel to the separation gel, since the glycinate partially loses its slowing positive charges as the pH increases and then, as the former trailing ion, overtakes the proteins and becomes a leading ion, which causes the bands of the different proteins (visible after a staining) to become narrower and sharper - the stacking effect. For the separation of smaller proteins and peptides, the TRIS-[[Tricine]] buffer system of Schägger and von Jagow is used due to the higher spread of the proteins in the range of 0.5 to 50 KDa.&lt;ref name="Schäggervon Jagow1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schägger|first1=Hermann|last2=von Jagow|first2=Gebhard|title=Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=166|issue=2|year=1987|pages=368–379|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/0003-2697(87)90587-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis ===
Protein staining in the gel creates a documentable banding pattern of the various proteins. [[Glycoprotein]]s have differential levels of [[glycosylations]] and adsorb SDS more unevenly at the glycosylations, resulting in broader and blurred bands.&lt;ref name="Cryo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cryo-EM Part A: Sample Preparation and Data Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1mPepNTgxcC&amp;pg=PA28|date=30 September 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-095695-4|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Membrane protein]]s, because of their [[transmembrane domain]], are often composed of the more hydrophobic amino acids, have lower [[solubility]] in aqueous solutions, tend to bind [[lipid]]s, and tend to precipitate in aqueous solutions due to [[hydrophobic effect]]s when sufficient amounts of detergent are not present. This precipitation manifests itself for membrane proteins in a SDS-PAGE in "tailing" above the band of the transmembrane protein. In this case, more SDS can be used (by using more or more concentrated sample buffer) and the amount of protein in the sample application can be reduced. An overloading of the gel with a soluble protein creates a semicircular band of this protein (e. g. in the marker lane of the image at 66 KDa), allowing other proteins with similar molecular weights to be covered. A low contrast (as in the marker lane of the image) between bands within a lane indicates either the presence of many proteins (low purity) or, if using purified proteins and a low contrast occurs only below one band, it indicates a proteolytic degradation of the protein, which first causes degradation bands, and after further degradation produces a homogeneous color ("smear") below a band.&lt;ref name="BurgessDeutscher2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard R Burgess|author2=Murray P. Deutscher|title=Guide to Protein Purification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6Lp4yna4hoC&amp;pg=PA184|date=3 November 2009|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-092317-8|pages=184–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentation of the banding pattern is usually done by photographing or scanning. For a subsequent recovery of the molecules in individual bands, a [[gel extraction]] can be performed.

=== Archiving ===
[[File:Gel_Blue_Coomassie.jpg|thumb|Two SDS gels after completed separation of the samples and staining in a drying frame]]
After protein staining and documentation of the banding pattern, the polyacrylamide gel can be dried for archival storage. Proteins can be extracted from it at a later date. The gel is either placed in a drying frame (with or without the use of heat) or in a vacuum dryer. The drying frame consists of two parts, one of which serves as a base for a wet [[cellophane]] film to which the gel and a one percent [[glycerol]] solution are added. Then a second wet cellophane film is applied bubble-free, the second frame part is put on top and the frame is sealed with clips. The removal of the air bubbles avoids a fragmentation of the gel during drying. The water evaporates through the cellophane film. In contrast to the drying frame, a vacuum dryer generates a vacuum and heats the gel to about 50&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Molecular mass determination ==

The relative mobility (called Rf value or Rm value) is the quotient of the distance of the band of the protein and the distance of the buffer front. The distances of the bands and the buffer front are each measured from the beginning of the separation gel. The distance of the buffer front roughly corresponds to the distance of the bromophenol blue contained in the sample buffer. The relative distances of the proteins of the size marker are plotted semi-logarithmically against their known molecular weights. By comparison with the linear part of the generated graph or by a regression analysis, the molecular weight of an unknown protein can be determined by its relative mobility.

== Applications ==
The SDS-PAGE in combination with a protein stain is widely used in biochemistry for the quick and exact separation and subsequent analysis of proteins. It has comparatively low instrument and reagent costs and is an easy-to-use method. Because of its low [[scalability]], it is mostly used for analytical purposes and less for preparative purposes, especially when larger amounts of a protein are to be isolated.

Additionally, SDS-PAGE is used in combination with the [[western blot]] for the determination of the presence of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins - or for the analysis of [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications of proteins can lead to a different relative mobility (i.e. a ''band shift'') or to a change in the binding of a detection antibody used in the western blot (i.e. a band disappears or appears).

In [[mass spectrometry]] of proteins, SDS-PAGE is a widely used method for sample preparation prior to spectrometry, mostly using [[in-gel digestion]]. In regards to determining the molecular mass of a protein, the SDS-PAGE is a bit more exact than an analytical [[ultracentrifugation]], but less exact than a [[mass spectrometry]] or - ignoring post-translational modifications - a calculation of the protein molecular mass from the [[DNA sequence]].

In medical diagnostics, SDS-PAGE is used as part of the [[HIV test]] and to evaluate [[proteinuria]]. In the HIV test, HIV proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently detected by Western Blot with HIV-specific [[antibodies]] of the patient, if they are present in his [[blood serum]]. SDS-PAGE for proteinuria evaluates the levels of various [[serum protein]]s in the urine, e.g. [[Albumin]], [[Alpha-2-macroglobulin]] and [[IgG]].

== Variants ==
SDS-PAGE is the most widely used method for gel electrophoretic separation of proteins. [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] sequentially combines [[isoelectric focusing]] or BAC-PAGE with a SDS-PAGE. [[Native PAGE]] is used if native protein folding is to be maintained. For separation of membrane proteins, BAC-PAGE or CTAB-PAGE may be used as an alternative to SDS-PAGE. For electrophoretic separation of larger protein complexes, [[agarose gel electrophoresis]] can be used, e.g. the [[SDD-AGE]]. Some [[enzyme]]s can be detected via their [[enzyme activity]] by [[zymography]].

== Alternatives ==
While being one of the more precise and low-cost protein separation and analysis methods, the SDS-PAGE denatures proteins. Where non-denaturing conditions are necessary, proteins are separated by a native PAGE or different [[chromatography|chromatographic]] methods with subsequent [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], for example [[affinity chromatography]] (or even [[tandem affinity purification]]), [[size exclusion chromatography]], [[ion exchange chromatography]].&lt;ref name="Janson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan-Christer Janson|title=Protein Purification: Principles, High Resolution Methods, and Applications|url=|date=3 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00219-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins can also be separated by size in a [[tangential flow filtration]]&lt;ref name="Desai2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohamed A. Desai|title=Downstream Processing of Proteins: Methods and Protocols|url=|year=2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-59259-027-8|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[ultrafiltration]].&lt;ref name="Raja2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ghosh Raja|title=Protein Bioseparation Using Ultrafiltration: Theory, Applications And New Developments|url=|date=11 June 2003|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-1-78326-126-0|pages=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single proteins can be isolated from a mixture by affinity chromatography or by a [[pull-down assay]]. Some historically early and cost effective but crude separation methods usually based upon a series of [[Extraction (chemistry)|extractions]] and [[precipitation]]s using [[kosmotropic]] molecules, for example the [[ammonium sulfate precipitation]] and the [[polyethyleneglycol]] precipitation.

== History ==
In 1948, [[Arne Tiselius]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of the principle of electrophoresis as the migration of charged and dissolved atoms or molecules in an electric field.&lt;ref name="Pederson2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pederson|first1=T.|title=Turning a PAGE: the overnight sensation of SDS-polycrylamide gel electrophoresis|journal=The FASEB Journal|volume=22|issue=4|year=2007|pages=949–953|issn=0892-6638|doi=10.1096/fj.08-0402ufm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of a solid matrix (initially paper discs) in a [[zone electrophoresis]] improved the separation. The discontinuous electrophoresis of 1964 by L. Ornstein and B. J. Davis made it possible to improve the separation by the stacking effect.&lt;ref&gt;Ornstein, L., Davis, B. J.: ''Disc Electrophoresis –1. Background and Theory.'' In: ''Ann NY Acad Sci.'' 121, 1964, pp. 321–349.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cross-linked polyacrylamide hydrogels, in contrast to the previously used paper discs or starch gels, provided a higher stability of the gel and no microbial decomposition. The denaturing effect of SDS in continuous polyacrylamide gels and the consequent improvement in resolution was first described in 1965 by [[David F. Summers]] in the working group of [[James E. Darnell]] to separate poliovirus proteins.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Summers DF, Maizel JV, Darnell JE| title=Evidence for virus-specific noncapsid proteins in poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | year= 1965 | volume= 54 | issue= 2 | pages= 505–13 | pmid=4285933 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.54.2.505| pmc=219696 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=4285933}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current variant of the SDS-PAGE was described in 1970 by Ulrich K. Laemmli and initially used to characterise the proteins in the head of [[bacteriophage T4]].&lt;ref name="Laemmli1970"/&gt;

[[File:HasekuraBookItalian.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Scipione Amati]]'s ''[[History of the Kingdom of Voxu]]'' (1615)  an example of a secondary source.]]
In [[Scholarly method|scholarship]], a '''secondary source'''&lt;ref name=UMD&gt;"[http://lib.guides.umd.edu/c.php?g=327327&amp;p=2195975 Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2&gt;"[http://libguides.jcu.edu.au/secondary Secondary sources]". James Cook University.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[document]] or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a [[primary source]], which is an original source of the information being discussed; a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. 

A secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. In this source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format.  Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis,  interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. 
 
The most accurate [[#Classification|classification]] for any given source is not always obvious.  ''Primary'' and ''secondary'' are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how they are used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121|quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one.

==Classification==
Information can be taken from a wide variety of objects, but this classification system is only useful for a class of sources that are called '''symbolic sources'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OX7d7u_2rF4C&amp;pg=PA121|title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science|last=Kragh|first=Helge|date=1989-11-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521389211|location=|pages=121|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolic sources are sources that are intended to communicate information to someone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Common symbolic sources include written documents such as letters and notes, but not, for example, bits of broken pottery and scraps of food excavated from a [[midden]], regardless of how much information can be extracted from an ancient trash heap, or how little can be extracted from a written document.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kragh|1989|p=121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dalton|Charnigo|2004|p=419 n.18}}.&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Delgadillo|Lynch|1999|p=253}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion, but a secondary source of information found in the old documents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Other examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an [[obituary]]&lt;ref name="Duffin"&gt;{{Citation|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name="Duffin" /&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Henige|first=David|authorlink=David Henige|title=Primary Source by Primary Source? On the Role of Epidemics in New World Depopulation|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=33|issue=3|year=1986|pages=292–312, at 292|doi=10.2307/481816|jstor=481816|publisher=Duke University Press|quote=[T]he term 'primary' inevitably carries a relative meaning insofar as it defines those pieces of information that stand in closest relationship to an event or process ''in the present state of our knowledge''. Indeed, in most instances the very nature of a primary source tells us that it is actually derivative.…[H]istorians have no choice but to regard certain of the available sources as 'primary' since they are as near to truly original sources as they can now secure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered "primary", since it is the closest known thing to an original source, but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered "secondary".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henige|1986|p=292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempts to map or model scientific and scholarly communication need the concepts of primary, secondary and further "levels". One such model is the [[UNISIST model]] of information dissemination. Within such a model these concepts are defined in relation to each other, and the acceptance of this way of defining the concepts are connected to the acceptance of the model.

Some other [[modern language]]s use more than one word for the English word "source". [[German language|German]] usually uses ''Sekundärliteratur'' ("secondary literature") for secondary sources for historical facts, leaving ''Sekundärquelle'' ("secondary source") to [[historiography]]. A ''Sekundärquelle'' is a source which can tell about a lost ''Primärquelle'' ("primary source"), such as a letter quoting from minutes which are no longer known to exist, and so cannot be consulted by the historian.

==Science, technology, and medicine==
In general, secondary sources are self-described as [[Review journal|review article]]s or [[meta-analysis]].

Primary source materials are typically defined as "original research papers written by the scientists who actually conducted the study." An example of primary source material is the Purpose, Methods, Results, Conclusions sections of a research paper (in [[IMRAD]] style) in a scientific journal by the authors who conducted the study.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010&gt;{{cite book|author=Garrard, Judith |title=Health Sciences Literature Review Made Easy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CSbfIcjQUcsC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 September 2012|date= 2010|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-1868-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some fields, a secondary source may include a summary of the literature in the Introduction of a scientific paper, a description of what is known about a disease or treatment in a chapter in a reference book, or a synthesis written to review available literature.&lt;ref name=Garrand2010/&gt; A survey of previous work in the field in a primary peer-reviewed source is secondary source information. This allows secondary sourcing of recent findings in areas where full review articles have not yet been published.

A [[book review]] that contains the judgment of the reviewer about the book is a primary source for the reviewer's opinion, and a secondary source for the contents of the book.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=September 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of the book within a review is a secondary source.

===Library and information science===

In [[library and information science]]s, secondary sources are generally regarded as those sources that summarize or add commentary to [[primary sources]] in the context of the particular information or idea under study.&lt;ref name=UMD/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU_2/&gt;

=== Maths ===

An important use of secondary sources in the field of [[mathematics]] has been to make difficult mathematical ideas and proofs from primary sources more accessible to the public;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Edwards|first=H.M.|authorlink=Harold Edwards (mathematician)|title=Riemann's Zeta Function|year=2001|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|publication-place=Mineola, New York|isbn=0-486-41740-9|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5uLAoued_dIC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22|quote=The purpose of a secondary source is to make the primary sources accessible to you. If you can read and understand the primary sources without reading this book, more power to you. If you read this book without reading the primary sources you are like a man who carries a sack lunch to a banquet}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other sciences [[tertiary source]]s are expected to fulfill the introductory role.

===Humanities and history===
Secondary sources in history and humanities are usually books or [[academic journal|scholarly journals]], from the perspective of a later interpreter, especially by a later scholar. In the humanities, a [[peer review]]ed article is always a secondary source.
The delineation of sources as [[primary sources|primary]] and secondary first arose in the field of [[historiography]], as historians attempted to identify and classify the sources of historical writing.  In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref&gt;Helge (1989), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In  original scholarly writing, historians rely on primary sources, read in the context of the scholarly interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cipolla|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|title=Between Two Cultures: An Introduction to Economic History|year=1992|isbn=978-0-393-30816-7|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GIqRTlepwmoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=cipolla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Leopold von Ranke|Rankean model]] established by German scholarship in the 19th century, historians use [[archive]]s of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick C. Beiser|title=The German Historicist Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQ1k6w0dFIMC&amp;pg=PA254|year=2011|publisher=Oxford U.P.|page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most undergraduate research projects rely on secondary source material, with perhaps snippets of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles Camic|author2=Neil Gross|author3=Michele Lamont|title=Social Knowledge in the Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l7iDZY-MSoC&amp;pg=PA107|year=2011|publisher=U. of Chicago Press|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Law====
In the legal field, source classification is important because the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, the [[headnote]]s of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bouchoux|first=Deborah E.|year=2000|title=Cite Checker: A Hands-On Guide to Learning Citation Form|page=45|publisher=Thomson Delmar Learning|isbn=0-7668-1893-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RJ4vlBrWu0MC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=%22primary+sources%22+%22science+citation%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and [[precedent]]ial, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bouchoux|2000|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Family history====
"A secondary source is a record or statement of an event or circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the event or circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the event, or by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor."&lt;ref&gt;Harland, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, according to this definition, a first-hand account written long after the event "when the fallibility of memory is an important factor" is a secondary source, even though it may be the first published description of that event.

====Autobiographies====
An autobiography can be a secondary source in history or the humanities when used for information about topics other than its subject. For example, many first hand accounts of events in [[World War I]] written in the post-war years were influenced by the then prevailing perception of the war which was significantly different from contemporary opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, particularly the introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Note to anyone who is thinking of making this article self referential: Please do not do this, see the note at top of the recursion article for why --&gt;{{Selfref|For the self-reference template on Wikipedia, see [[Template:Selfref]].}}

[[Image:ouroboros.png|thumb|The [[Ouroboros]], a dragon that continually consumes itself, is used as a symbol for self-reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Soto-Andrade |first1=Jorge |last2=Jaramillo |first2=Sebastian |last3=Gutierrez |first3=Claudio |last4=Letelier |first4=Juan-Carlos |title=Ouroboros avatars: A mathematical exploration of Self-reference and Metabolic Closure |url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/alife/0262297140chap115.pdf |publisher=MIT Press |accessdate=16 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Self-reference''' occurs in [[natural language|natural]] or [[formal language|formal languages]] when a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], idea or [[formula]] refers to itself. The reference may be expressed either directly—through some intermediate sentence or formula—or by means of some [[Semantics encoding|encoding]]. In [[philosophy]], it also refers to the ability of a subject to speak of or refer to itself: to have the kind of thought expressed by the first person nominative singular pronoun, [[I (pronoun)|the word "I"]] in English.

Self-reference is studied and has applications in [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[computer programming]], and [[linguistics]]. Self-referential statements are sometimes [[paradox]]ical, and can also be considered [[Recursion|recursive]].

==In logic, mathematics and computing ==
In classical [[philosophy]], [[paradoxes]] were created by self-referential concepts such as the [[omnipotence paradox]] of asking if it was possible for a being to exist so powerful that it could create a stone that it could not lift. The [[Epimenides paradox]], 'All Cretans are liars' when uttered by an ancient Greek Cretan was one of the first recorded versions. Contemporary philosophy sometimes employs the same technique to demonstrate that a supposed concept is meaningless or ill-defined.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In [[mathematics]] and [[computability theory]], self-reference (also known as [[Impredicativity]]) is the key concept in proving limitations of many systems. [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] uses it to show that no formal consistent system of mathematics can ever contain all possible mathematical truths, because it cannot prove some truths about its own structure. [[The halting problem]] equivalent, in computation theory, shows that there is always some task that a computer cannot perform, namely reasoning about itself. These proofs relate to a long tradition of mathematical paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]] and [[Berry's paradox]], and ultimately to classical philosophical paradoxes.

In [[game theory]] undefined behaviors can occur where two players must model each other's mental states and behaviors, leading to infinite regress.

In [[computer programming]], self-reference occurs in [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]], where a program can read or modify its own instructions like any other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malenfant|first1=J.|last2=Demers|first2=F-N|title=A Tutorial on Behavioral Reflection and its Implementation|url=http://www2.parc.com/csl/groups/sda/projects/reflection96/docs/malenfant/malenfant.pdf|publisher=PARC|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous programming languages support reflection to some extent with varying degrees of expressiveness. Additionally, self-reference is seen in [[recursion]] (related to the mathematical [[recurrence relation]]) in [[functional programming]], where a code structure refers back to itself during computation.&lt;ref name="Drucker2008"&gt;{{cite book |last=Drucker |first=Thomas |title=Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R70M4zsVgREC&amp;pg=PA110 |date=4 January 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-0-8176-4768-1 |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Taming' self-reference from potentially paradoxical concepts into well-behaved recursions has been one of the great successes of [[computer science]], and is now used routinely in, for example, writing [[compilers]] using the 'meta-language' [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. Using a compiler to compile itself is known as [[bootstrapping]]. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible to write (programs which operate on themselves), both with [[Assembly language|assembler]] and with functional languages such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], but is generally discouraged in real-world programming. Computing hardware makes fundamental use of self-reference in [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]], the basic units of digital memory, which convert potentially paradoxical logical self-relations into memory by expanding their terms over time. Thinking in terms of self-reference is a pervasive part of programmer culture, with many programs and acronyms named self-referentially as a form of humor, such as [[GNU]] ('Gnu's not Unix') and [[PINE]] ('Pine is not Elm'). The [[GNU Hurd]] is named for a pair of mutually self-referential acronyms.

[[Tupper's self-referential formula]] is a mathematical curiosity which plots an image of its own formula.

== In life ==
The biology of [[self-replication]] is self-referential, as embodied by [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] replication mechanisms. Models of self-replication are found in the computational [[Game of life]], and have inspired engineering systems such as the [[RepRap]] self-replicating 3d printer.

== In art ==
Self-reference occurs in [[literature]] and [[film]] when an author refers to his or her own work in the context of the work itself. Examples include [[Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'', [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[The Tempest]]'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', [[Denis Diderot]]'s ''[[Jacques le fataliste et son maître]]'', [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[If on a winter's night a traveler]]'', many stories by [[Nikolai Gogol]], ''[[Lost in the Funhouse]]'' by [[John Barth]], [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'' and [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[8½]]''. Perhaps the earliest example is in [[Homer]]'s [[Iliad]], where [[Helen of Troy]] laments: "for generations still unborn/we will live in song" (appearing in the song itself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homer |others=Translated by Robert Fagles |title=Iliad |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=1-101-15281-8 |page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-reference in art is closely related to the concepts of [[fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]] and [[meta-reference]], which often involve self-reference. The short stories of [[Jorge Luis Borges]] play with self-reference and related paradoxes in many ways. [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Krapp's Last Tape]] consists entirely of the protagonist listening to and making recordings of himself, mostly about other recordings. During the 1990s and 2000s filmic self-reference was a popular part of the [[rubber reality]] movement, notably in [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s films [[Being John Malkovich]] and [[Adaptation (film)|Adaptation]], the latter pushing the concept arguably to its breaking point as it attempts to portray its own creation.

Various [[creation myths]] invoke self-reference to solve the problem of what created the creator. For example the [[Egyptian creation myth]] has a god swallowing his own semen to create himself. [[Ouroboros]] is a mythical dragon which eats itself.

The [[surrealist]] painter [[René Magritte]] is famous for his self-referential works. His painting ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'', includes the words "this is not a pipe", the truth of which depends entirely on whether the word ''ceci'' (in English, "this") refers to the pipe depicted&amp;mdash;or to the painting or the word or sentence itself.&lt;ref name="NöthBishara2007"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nöth |first1=Winfried |last2=Bishara |first2=Nina |title=Self-reference in the Media |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBOFIdchEQYC&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2007 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-019464-7 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[M.C. Escher]]'s art also contains many self-referential concepts such as hands drawing themselves.

== In language ==
A word that describes itself is called an ''[[autological word]]'' (or ''[[autological word|autonym]]''). This generally applies to adjectives, for example [[wikt:sesquipedalian|sesquipedalian]] (i.e. "sesquipedalian" is a sesquipedalian word), but can also apply to other parts of speech, such as [[wikt:TLA|TLA]], as a three-letter [[abbreviation]] for "[[three-letter abbreviation]]".

A sentence which inventories its own letters and punctuation marks is called an [[autogram]].

There is a special case of meta-sentence in which the content of the sentence in the metalanguage and the content of the sentence in the object language are the same. Such a sentence is referring to itself. However some meta-sentences of this type can lead to paradoxes. "This is a sentence." can be considered to be a self-referential meta-sentence which is obviously true. However "This sentence is false" is a meta-sentence which leads to a self-referential [[Liar paradox|paradox]]. Such sentences can lead to problems, for example, in law, where statements bringing laws into existence can contradict one another or themselves. [[Kurt Gödel]] claimed to have found such a paradox in the [[US constitution]] at his citizenship ceremony.

Self-reference occasionally occurs in the [[Broadcast media|media]] when it is required to write about itself, for example the [[BBC]] reporting on job cuts at the BBC. Notable encyclopedias may be required to feature articles about themselves, such as [[Wikipedia]]'s article on Wikipedia.

[[Fumblerules]] are a list of rules of good grammar and writing, demonstrated through sentences that violate those very rules, such as "Avoid cliches like the plague" and "Don't use no double negatives". The term was coined in a published list of such rules by [[William Safire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt-usage-english.org/humorousrules.html alt.usage.english.org's ''Humorous Rules for Writing'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = William |last= Safire |authorlink=William Safire |publication-date=1979-11-04 |title=On Language; The Fumblerules of Grammar |periodical=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/04/archives/on-language-the-fumblerules-of-grammar.html?sq=Fumblerules&amp;scp=1&amp;st=p |page=SM4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In meta-disciplines ==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Several academic disciplines are sometime required to study themselves in forms of self-reference, for example [[historiography]] (or "[[meta-history]]") is history's study of its own past; [[meta-sociology]] occurs when sociologists study the power structures in their own academic institutions; and [[meta-mathematics]] is the study of mathematics itself as a formal system, using its own methods. In [[law]], self-reference may become an issue when laws are required to regulate the making of new laws, especially around [[constitutional]] issues. (The game of [[nomic]] begins as a model of this process.) The prefix "[[meta]]" is often used to denote this type of self-reference.

==In popular culture==
* [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s books, especially ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' and ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', play with many self-referential concepts and were highly influential in bringing them into mainstream intellectual culture during the 1980s. [[Hofstadter's law]], which specifies that "It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law"&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Douglas]]. ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]''. 20th anniversary ed., 1999, p. 152. {{ISBN|0-465-02656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a self-referencing adage. Hofstadter also suggested the concept of a 'Reviews of this book', a book containing only reviews of itself, which has since been implemented using [[wiki|wikis]] and other technologies. Hofstadter's '[[strange loop]]' [[metaphysics]] attempts to map [[consciousness]] onto self-reference, but is a minority position in [[philosophy of mind]].
* The subgenre of "[[recursion|recursive]] [[science fiction]]" or [[metafiction]] is now so extensive that it has fostered a fan-maintained bibliography at the [[New England Science Fiction Association]]'s website; some of it is about [[science-fiction fandom]], some about science fiction and its authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesfa.org/Recursion/index.htm "Recursive Science Fiction"] New England Science Fiction Association website, last updated 3 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Stumpers-L''' [[electronic mailing list]], was a resource available for [[librarian]]s and others to discuss reference questions which they were unable to answer using available resources. It was succeeded by the similar '''Project Wombat.'''

== Origins ==

Stumpers-L began in 1992, created by Ann Feeney, a [[library school]] graduate student at [[Rosary College]] in [[River Forest, Illinois|River Forest]], [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]]. It was moved to [[Concordia University, Chicago]], then back to Rosary, which was then renamed [[Dominican University of Illinois|Dominican University]]. From 2002 to 2005 it was maintained by the Dominican University Graduate School of Library and Information Science program.  At the end of 2005 Dominican University ceased hosting the list. A replacement list, known as Project Wombat, commenced in January 2006, and is hosted by [[Project Gutenberg]].

Originally the Stumpers-L archive was a [[gopher protocol|gopher]] resource, but migrated to the [[World Wide Web]] once the web became more universally used in the mid-1990s.

== Topics ==

Typical Stumpers-L topics include:
*"Which words in the [[English language]] end in [[-gry]]?"
*"Who wrote ''[[The Book of Counted Sorrows]]'', and where can I get a copy?"
*"Is there a novel with [[lipogram|no letter 'e']] in it?"
*"Where can I find information on [[Kombucha]]/Manchurian Mushroom Tea?"
*"If the average [[human body]] were broken down into its constituent chemicals, how much would they be worth?"

== Public notice ==
A book of Stumpers-L questions and answers was published in 1998 by [[Random House]], edited by [[Fred Shapiro]] of [[Yale]] and titled ''Stumpers! Answers to Hundreds of Questions That Stumped The Experts'' ({{ISBN|0-375-70174-5}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2007/04/ljarchives/lj-talks-to-fred-r-shapiro/  Roncevic, Mirela. "LJ Talks To... Fred J. Shapiro" ''Library Journal'' April 10, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro was an active member;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2006_09/quotations.html Rotella, Carlo. "Can a book of quotations include Cher, MC Hammer, and 'Get a life'? Ask the man who out-Bartletted Bartlett's" ''Yale Alumni Magazine'' September/October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; other prominent members include Barbara and David P. Mikkelson, the co-editors of ''[[Snopes.com]].

The unofficial mascot of the Stumpers-L list is the [[wombat]].

{{selfref|For Wikipedia's policy on the use of tertiary sources, see [[WP:TERTIARY]].}}
{{Distinguish|Tertiary sector}}
A '''tertiary source''' is an index or textual consolidation of [[Primary source|primary]] and [[secondary source]]s.&lt;ref name="umd"&gt; [http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources |date=2013-07-03 }}". University Libraries, University of Maryland. Retrieve 07/26/2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/genedinfolit/1infobasics/tertiary_information_sources.html|title=Tertiary Information Sources|date=September 2012|publisher=Old Dominion University -- ODU Libraries|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU&gt;"[http://libguides.jcu.edu.au/tertiary Tertiary sources]". James Cook University.&lt;/ref&gt; Some tertiary sources are not to be used for academic [[research]], unless they can also be used as secondary sources, or to find other sources.&lt;ref name=newhaven&gt;"[http://libguides.newhaven.edu/content.php?pid=465151&amp;sid=3809011 Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Resources]". University of New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlap with secondary sources==
Depending on the topic of research, a scholar may use a [[bibliography]], [[dictionary]], or [[encyclopedia]] as either a tertiary or a secondary source.&lt;ref name="umd"&gt; [http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources |date=2013-07-03 }}". University Libraries, University of Maryland. Retrieve 07/26/2013&lt;/ref&gt; This causes difficulty in defining many sources as either one type or the other.

In some [[academic discipline]]s the differentiation between a secondary and tertiary source is relative.&lt;ref name="umd"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU /&gt; 

In the [[UNISIST model|United Nations International Scientific Information System (UNISIST) model]], a secondary source is a bibliography, whereas a tertiary source is a synthesis of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Søndergaard | first1 = T. F. | last2 = Andersen | first2 = J. | last3 = Hjørland | first3 = B. | doi = 10.1108/00220410310472509 | title = Documents and the communication of scientific and scholarly information: Revising and updating the UNISIST model | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 278 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of tertiary sources==
As tertiary sources, encyclopedias, [[textbook]]s, and [[compendium|compendia]] attempt to summarize, collect, and consolidate the source materials into an overview, but may also present subjective, or biased commentary and analysis (which are characteristics of secondary sources).

[[Bibliographic index|Indexes]], bibliographies, [[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]], and [[Database#Research|databases]] may not provide much textual information, but as aggregates of primary and secondary sources, they are often considered tertiary sources. So although tertiary sources are both primary and secondary, they are more towards a secondary source because of commentary and bias.

[[Almanac]]s, [[guide book|travel guides]], [[field guide]]s, and [[timeline]]s are also examples of tertiary sources.

Survey or overview articles are usually tertiary, though [[review articles]] in peer-reviewed [[academic journals]] are secondary (not be confused with film, book, etc. [[review]]s, which are primary-source opinions).

Some usually primary sources, such as [[User guide|user guides and manuals]], are secondary or tertiary (depending on the nature of the material) when written by third parties.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5949">'''Tupper's self-referential formula''' is a [[formula]] that visually represents itself when graphed at a specific location in the (''x'', ''y'') plane.

== History ==

The formula was defined by Jeff Tupper and appears as an example in Tupper's 2001 [[SIGGRAPH]] paper on reliable two-dimensional computer graphing algorithms.
&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/mooncake/papers/SIGGRAPH2001_Tupper.pdf Tupper, Jeff. "Reliable Two-Dimensional Graphing Methods for Mathematical Formulae with Two Free Variables"]&lt;/ref&gt; This paper discusses methods related to the GrafEq formula-graphing program developed by Tupper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peda.com/grafeq/|title=Pedagoguery Software: GrafEq|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the formula is called "[[self-reference|self-referential]]", Tupper did not name it as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Narayanan |first1=Arvind |title=Tupper’s Self-Referential Formula Debunked |url=http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |accessdate=20 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424181239/http://arvindn.livejournal.com/132943.html |archivedate=24 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formula ==

The formula is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;{1\over 2} &lt; \left\lfloor \mathrm{mod}\left(\left\lfloor {y \over 17} \right\rfloor 2^{-17 \lfloor x \rfloor - \mathrm{mod}(\lfloor y\rfloor, 17)},2\right)\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;
or, as plaintext,
{{quotation|1/2 &lt; floor(mod(floor(y/17)*2^(-17*floor(x)-mod(floor(y), 17)),2))}}

where ⌊&amp;nbsp;⌋ denotes the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor function]], and mod is the [[modulo operation]].

Let ''k'' equal the following 543-digit integer:

{{quotation|960 939 379 918 958 884 971 672 962 127 852 754 715 004 339 660 129 306 651 505 519 271 702 802 395 266 424 689 642 842 174 350 718 121 267 153 782 770 623 355 993 237 280 874 144 307 891 325 963 941 337 723 487 857 735 749 823 926 629 715 517 173 716 995 165 232 890 538 221 612 403 238 855 866 184 013 235 585 136 048 828 693 337 902 491 454 229 288 667 081 096 184 496 091 705 183 454 067 827 731 551 705 405 381 627 380 967 602 565 625 016 981 482 083 418 783 163 849 115 590 225 610 003 652 351 370 343 874 461 848 378 737 238 198 224 849 863 465 033 159 410 054 974 700 593 138 339 226 497 249 461 751 545 728 366 702 369 745 461 014 655 997 933 798 537 483 143 786 841 806 593 422 227 898 388 722 980 000 748 404 719}}

If one [[Graph of a function|graphs]] the set of points (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') in 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;106 and ''k''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;17 satisfying the inequality given above, the resulting graph looks like this (the axes in this plot have been reversed, otherwise the picture would be upside-down and mirrored):

The formula is a general-purpose method of decoding a bitmap stored in the constant&amp;nbsp;''k'', and it could actually be used to draw any other image.  When applied to the unbounded positive range 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'', the formula tiles a vertical swath of the plane with a pattern that contains all possible 17-pixel-tall bitmaps.  One horizontal slice of that infinite bitmap depicts the drawing formula itself, but this is not remarkable, since other slices depict all other possible formulae that might fit in a 17-pixel-tall bitmap. Tupper has created extended versions of his original formula that rule out all but one slice.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot3big.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot2.png&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peda.com/selfplot/selfplot.png&lt;/ref&gt;

The constant ''k'' is a simple [[1-bit color|monochrome]] [[bitmap|bitmap image]] of the formula treated as a binary number and multiplied by 17.  If ''k'' is divided by 17, the [[least significant bit]] encodes the upper-right corner (''k'',&amp;nbsp;0); the 17 least significant bits encode the rightmost column of pixels; the next 17 least significant bits encode the 2nd-rightmost column, and so on.

'''Xmas''' is a common [[abbreviation]] of the word ''[[Christmas]]''. It is sometimes pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|m|ə|s}}, but ''Xmas'', and variants such as ''Xtemass'', originated as handwriting abbreviations for the typical pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|m|ə|s}}. The "X" comes from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter ''[[Chi (letter)|Chi]]'', which is the first letter of the Greek word ''Χριστός'', which in English is "[[Christ]]".&lt;ref name=oed-x&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= X n. 10. |encyclopedia= [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230945#eid14045485 |year= 2011|accessdate= 17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "-mas" part is from the Latin-derived [[Old English]] word for ''[[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09790b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Liturgy of the Mass]. Retrieved 20 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abbreviation of Christmas as "Xmas" is the source of disagreement among Christians who observe the holiday. 

The December 1957 ''News and Views'' published by the [[Church League of America]], a conservative organization co-founded in 1937 by George Washington Robnett,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://libweb.uoregon.edu/speccoll/guides/conservative.html |title= Subject Guide to Conservative and Libertarian Materials, in Manuscript Collections |publisher= University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; attacked the use of Xmas in an article titled "X=The Unknown Quantity". The claims were picked up later by [[Gerald L. K. Smith]], who in December 1966 claimed that Xmas was a "blasphemous omission of the name of Christ" and that "'X' is referred to as being symbolical of the unknown quantity."  Smith further argued that Jews introduced Santa Claus to suppress the New Testament accounts of Jesus, and that the United Nations, at the behest of "world Jewry", had "outlawed the name of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link= Morris Kominsky |last= Kominsky |first= Morris |year= 1970 |title= The Hoaxers: Plain Liars, Fancy Liars and Damned Liars |pages= 137–138 |isbn= 0-8283-1288-5}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, a well documented history of use of ''Χ'' (actually a [[Chi (letter)|chi]]) as an abbreviation for "Christ" (Χριστός) and possibly also a symbol of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ancient-symbols.com/christian_symbols.html |title= Christian Symbols and Their Descriptions |publisher= Ancient-symbols.com |date= |accessdate= 8 December 2008}}{{unreliable source?|date= December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/family/xmas.htm |publisher= tlc.howstuffworks.com |title= Why Is There a Controversy Surrounding the Word 'Xmas'? |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}{{unreliable source?|date= December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviation appears on many Orthodox Christian religious icons.

Dennis Bratcher, writing for a website for Christians, states "there are always those who loudly decry the use of the abbreviation 'Xmas' as some kind of blasphemy against Christ and Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crivoice.org/symbols/xmasorigin.html |title=The Origin of "Xmas" |publisher=CRI/Voice |date=2007-12-03 |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are evangelist [[Franklin Graham]] and [[CNN]] journalist [[Roland S. Martin]]. Graham stated in an interview: &lt;blockquote&gt;"for us as Christians, this is one of the most holy of the holidays, the birth of our savior Jesus Christ. And for people to take Christ out of Christmas. They're happy to say merry Xmas. Let's just take Jesus out. And really, I think, a war against the name of Jesus Christ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0512/16/ltm.02.html American Morning: A Conversation With Reverend Franklin Graham], CNN (December 16, 2005). Retrieved on December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Roland Martin likewise relates the use of "Xmas" to his growing concerns of increasing commercialization and secularization of one of Christianity's highest holy days.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Roland (December 20, 2007). [http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/12/20/roland.martin/index.html Commentary: You can't take Christ out of Christmas], CNN. Retrieved on December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bratcher posits that those who dislike abbreviating the word are unfamiliar with a long history of Christians using X in place of "Christ" for various purposes.

The word "[[Christ]]" and its compounds, including "Christmas", have been abbreviated in English for at least the past 1,000 years, long before the modern "Xmas" was commonly used. "Christ" was often written as "Xρ" or "Xt"; there are references in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' as far back as 1021. This X and P arose as the [[uppercase]] forms of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] [[Chi (letter)|χ]] (Ch) and [[rho|ρ]] (R) used in ancient abbreviations for Χριστος (Greek for "Christ").&lt;ref name=oed-x/&gt; The [[labarum]], an amalgamation of the two Greek letters rendered as ☧,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Unicode]] character Chi Rho (U+2627)&lt;/ref&gt; is a symbol often used to represent Christ in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestant]], and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christian Churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christiansymbols.net/monograms_2.php Christian Symbols: Chi-Rho] ''Christian Symbols'', Doug Gray, Retrieved 2009-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') and the ''OED Supplement'' have cited usages of "X-" or "Xp-" for "Christ-" as early as 1485. The terms "Xtian" and less commonly "Xpian" have also been used for "Christian". The ''OED'' further cites usage of "Xtianity" for "Christianity" from 1634.&lt;ref name=oed-x/&gt; According to ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', most of the evidence for these words comes from "educated Englishmen who knew their Greek".&lt;ref name=mwdeu&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;pg=PA968&amp;dq=Xmas+usage&amp;ei=zVZWSa6FJY6syASeyKHRAw "Xmas" article], ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', Merriam-Webster, 1994, p 968, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-132-4}}, retrieved via Google Books, December 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other uses of "X(t)" for "Chris(t)-"====
Other proper names containing the name "Christ" besides those mentioned above are sometimes abbreviated similarly, either as "X" or "Xt", both of which have been used historically,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.all-acronyms.com/XT./Christ/1136835 "Abbreviation: Xt." Date retrieved: 19 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., "Xtopher" or "Xopher" for "Christopher", or "Xtina" or "Xina" for the name "Christina".

In the 17th and 18th centuries, "Xene" and "Exene" were common spellings for the given name Christine. The American singer [[Christina Aguilera]] has sometimes gone by the name "Xtina". Similarly, [[Exene Cervenka]] has been a noted American singer-songwriter since 1977.

This usage of "X" to spell the syllable "kris" (rather than the sounds "ks") has extended to "xtal" for "[[crystal]]", and on [[florist]]s' signs to "xant" for "[[chrysanthemum]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=13693&amp;lastnode_id=0 |title=X |publisher=Everything 2 |date= |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though these words are not etymologically related to "Christ": "crystal" comes from a Greek word meaning "ice" (and not even using the letter χ), and "chrysanthemum" comes from Greek words meaning "golden flower", while "Christ" comes from a Greek word meaning "anointed".

==In popular culture==
In the animated television series ''[[Futurama]]'', which is set in the 31st century, Xmas {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|m|ə|s}} is the official name for the day formerly known as Christmas (which, in the episode "[[Xmas Story]]", is said to have become an "archaic pronunciation").

In the American version of the board game ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', players can draw a card from the [[Chance and Community Chest cards|Community Chest]] which reads: "Xmas fund matures. Collect $100".
