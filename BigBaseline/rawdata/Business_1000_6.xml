'''Additional funds needed''' (AFN) is a [[Financial accounting|financial]] concept used when a business looks to expand its operations. Since a business that seeks to increase its sales level will require more assets to meet that goal, some provision must be made to accommodate the change in assets. To phrase it another way, the business must have some plan to actually finance the new [[assets]] that will be needed to increase sales.

==Calculation==
AFN is a way of calculating how much new [[funding]] will be required, so that the firm can realistically look at whether or not they will be able to generate the additional funding and therefore be able to achieve the higher sales level. Determining the amount of external funding needed is a key part of calculating AFN. 

A simplified version of the AFN equation is as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;code&gt;AFN = Projected increase in assets – spontaneous increase in liabilities – any increase in retained earnings&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

When calculating AFN, consideration must be given to whether the company is already operating at full capacity; if not, they can expand sales some without having to invest in new equipment.

If a negative value is found for AFN, that means that the action would generate extra [[income]] that could be invested elsewhere. 

The AFN equation is as follows: 

AFN = (A*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)ΔS – (L*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)ΔS – MS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(RR)&lt;ref&gt;Brigham, E.F., and M. Ehrhardt. 2008. ''Financial Management: Theory and Practice'', 12th ed. Thomson South-Western, Mason, OH. {{ISBN|978-0-324-42269-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where:

A* = Assets tied directly to sales and will increase

L* = Spontaneous liabilities that will be affected by sales. (NOTE: Not all liabilities will be affected by sales such as long-term debt)

S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Sales during the last year

S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Total sales projected for next year (the new level of sales).

ΔS = The increase in sales between S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

M = Profit margin, or the profit per unit of sales

MS&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Projected [[Net Income]]

RR = The retention ratio from Net Income and is also calculated as (1 – payout ratio)

The relevant ratios within the formula are:

(A*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;): Called the capital intensity ratio

(L*/S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;): Called the spontaneous liabilities ratio

The '''Averch–Johnson effect''' is the tendency of [[Monopoly#Government-granted_monopoly|regulated companies]] to engage in excessive amounts of [[capital accumulation]] in order to expand the volume of their profits. If companies' profits to [[Financial capital|capital]] ratio is regulated at a certain percentage then there is a strong incentive for companies to over-invest in order to increase profits overall. This investment goes beyond any optimal efficiency point for capital that the company may have calculated as higher profit is almost always desired over and above efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Averch |first=Harvey |last2=Johnson |first2=Leland L. |year=1962 |title=Behavior of the Firm Under Regulatory Constraint |journal=[[American Economic Review]] |volume=52 |issue=5 |pages=1052–1069 |doi= |jstor=1812181 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Excessive capital accumulation under rate of return regulation is informally known as ''''gold plating''''.&lt;ref name="Gold plating"&gt;{{cite news|last1=West|first1=Michael|title='Gold plating' rife, assets in for a hiding|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/gold-plating-rife-assets-in-for-a-hiding-20130131-2dmjg.html|accessdate=6 January 2015|agency=The Age|date=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Direktorium LDE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|A meeting of a board of directors of the [[Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company]] in 1852]]
{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2013 }}

A '''board of directors''' is a recognized group of people who jointly oversee the activities of an [[organization]], which can be either a for-profit [[business]], [[nonprofit organization]], or a [[government agency]]. Such a board's powers, duties, and responsibilities are determined by government [[regulations]] (including the jurisdiction's [[corporations law]]) and the organization's own [[constitution]] and [[bylaws]]. These authorities may specify the number of members of the board, how they are to be chosen, and how often they are to meet.

In an organization with voting members, the board is accountable to, and might be subordinate to, the organization's full membership, which usually vote for the members of the board. In a [[stock corporation]], non-executive directors are voted for by the [[shareholder]]s and the board is the highest [[authority]] in the management of the corporation. The board of directors appoints the [[chief executive officer]] of the corporation and sets out the overall strategic direction. In corporations with dispersed ownership, the identification and nomination of directors (that shareholders vote for or against) are often done by the board itself, leading to a high degree of self-perpetuation. In a [[non-stock corporation]] with no general voting membership, the board is the supreme governing body of the institution;{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=9}} its members are sometimes chosen by the board itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scc.virginia.gov/clk/befaq/vanon.aspx#a4 | title = How are the directors selected? | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Commonwealth of Virginia, State Corporation Commission, Business FAQs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/Stat0181.pdf | title = Chapter 181, Nonstock Corporations (Sect. 181.0804) | accessdate = 2011-04-08 | work = Wisconsin Statutes Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Other names include '''board of directors and advisors''', '''[[board of governors]]''', '''board of managers''', '''[[Board of Regents|board of regents]]''', '''board of [[trustees]]''', or '''board of visitors'''. It may also be called "the executive board" and is often simply referred to as "the board".{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481-483}}

==Roles==
{{Business administration}}
Typical duties of boards of directors include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementhelp.org/boards/brdrspon.htm |title=Overview of Roles and Responsibilities of Corporate Board of Directors |accessdate=2008-01-26 |last=McNamara |first=Carter |work=Free Management Library |publisher=Authenticity Consulting, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |title=Basic Role of the Board |accessdate=2008-01-27 |work=Governance Basics |publisher=Institute on Governance (Canada) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230201729/http://www.iog.ca/boardgovernance/html/gov_the.html |archivedate = 30 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* governing the organization by establishing broad policies and setting out strategic objectives;
* selecting, appointing, supporting and reviewing the performance of the [[chief executive]] (of which the titles vary from organization to organization; the chief executive may be titled [[chief executive officer]], [[President (corporate title)|president]] or [[executive director]]);
* terminating the chief executive;
* ensuring the availability of adequate financial resources;
* approving annual budgets;
* accounting to the [[Project stakeholder|stakeholder]]s for the organization's performance;
* setting the salaries, compensation and benefits of senior management;

The legal responsibilities of boards and board members vary with the nature of the organization, and between  jurisdictions. For [[public corporations|companies with publicly trading stock]], these responsibilities are typically much more rigorous and complex than for those of other types.

Typically, the board chooses one of its members to be the ''[[chairman]]'' (often now called the "chair" or "chairperson"), who holds whatever title is specified in the [[by-law]]s or [[articles of association]]. However, in membership organizations, the members elect the president of the organization and the president becomes the board chair, unless the by-laws say otherwise.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}}

==Directors==
The directors of an organization are the persons who are members of its board. Several specific terms categorize directors by the presence or absence of their other relationships to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;This section was developed from numerous definitions in [http://definitions.uslegal.com/i/inside-director/ USLegal.com], [http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html BusinessDictionary.com], [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/executive+director Dictionary.com], The Free Dictionary by Farlex ([http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Inside+Director "inside director"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/executive+director "executive director"]; [http://financial-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/outside+director "outside director"]; [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonexecutive+director "nonexecutive director"]), [http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/executive-director Macmillan Dictionary], and  [http://www.economics-dictionary.com/definition/non-executive-director.html Economics-dictionary.com]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inside director===
An inside director is a director who is also an employee, officer, chief executive, major [[shareholder]], or someone similarly connected to the organization. Inside directors represent the interests of the entity's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], and often have special knowledge of its inner workings, its financial or market position, and so on.

Typical inside directors are:
* A [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) who may also be [[Chairman|chairman of the board]]
* Other executives of the organization, such as its [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) or [[executive vice president]]
* Large shareholders (who may or may not also be employees or officers)
* Representatives of other stakeholders such as labor unions, major lenders, or members of the community in which the organization is located

An inside director who is employed as a manager or executive of the organization is sometimes referred to as an executive director (not to be confused with the title [[executive director]] sometimes used for the CEO position in some organizations). Executive directors often have a specified area of responsibility in the organization, such as finance, marketing, human resources, or production.&lt;ref name=Ivestopedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/executive-director.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outside director===
{{Main|Independent director}}

An outside director is a member of the board who is not otherwise employed by or engaged with the organization, and does not represent any of its stakeholders. A typical example is a director who is [[President (corporate title)|president]] of a firm in a different industry.&lt;ref name="Investopedia 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Outside Director|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/outsidedirector.asp|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside directors are not employees of the company or affiliated with it in any other way.

Outside directors bring outside experience and perspectives to the board. For example, for a company that only serves a domestic market, the presence of CEOs from global multinational corporations as outside directors can help to provide insights on export and import opportunities and international trade options. One of the arguments for having outside directors is that they can keep a watchful eye on the inside directors and on the way the organization is run. Outside directors are unlikely to tolerate "insider dealing" between insider directors, as outside directors do not benefit from the company or organization. Outside directors are often useful in handling disputes between inside directors, or between shareholders and the board. They are thought to be advantageous because they can be objective and present little risk of conflict of interest. On the other hand, they might lack familiarity with the specific issues connected to the organization's governance and they might not know about the industry or sector in which the organization is operating.

===Terminology {{anchor|Classification}}===
*'''Director''' – a person appointed to serve on the board of an organization, such as an institution or business.
*'''Inside director''' – a director who, in addition to serving on the board, has a meaningful connection to the organization
*'''[[Outside director]]''' – a director who, other than serving on the board, has no meaningful connections to the organization
*'''Executive director''' – an inside director who is also an executive with the organization. The term is also used, in a completely different sense, to refer to a CEO
*'''[[Non-executive director]]''' – an inside director who is not an executive with the organization
*'''Shadow or ''de facto'' director''' – an individual who is not a named director but who nevertheless directs or controls the organization
* '''Nominee director''' – an individual who is appointed by a shareholder, creditor or interest group (whether contractually or by resolution at a company meeting) and who has a continuing loyalty to the appointor/s or other interest in the appointing company

Individual directors often serve on more than one board.&lt;ref name=Businessdictionary&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Director |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/executive-director.html|work=Business Dictionary|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice results in an [[interlocking directorate]], where a relatively small number of individuals have significant influence over a large number of important entities. This situation can have important corporate, social, economic, and legal consequences, and has been the subject of significant research.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Process and structure==
[[File:Tetley Board Room 31 August 2018 1.jpg|thumb|right|The board room of [[Tetley's Brewery]] in [[Leeds]], [[England]].]]

{{Globalise/US | section|date=May 2018}}

The process for running a board, sometimes called the [[board process]], includes the selection of board members, the setting of clear board objectives, the dissemination of documents or board package to the board members, the collaborative creation of an [[Agenda (meeting)|agenda]] for the meeting, the creation and follow-up of assigned [[action items]], and the assessment of the board process through standardized assessments of board members, owners, and CEOs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school Board Process] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220142343/http://www.slideshare.net/nasscom/how-to-make-corporate-board-more-effective-prof-krishna-g-palepuharvard-business-school |date=20 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of this process has been slow to develop due to the secretive nature of the way most companies run their boards, however some standardization is beginning to develop. Some who are pushing for this standardization in the USA are the [[National Association of Corporate Directors]], [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] Consulting and The Board Group.

===Board meetings===
[[File:Board room at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication.jpg|thumb|Typical board room setting]]
A board of directors conducts its meetings according to the rules and procedures contained in its governing documents. These procedures may allow the board to conduct its business by [[conference call]] or other [[Videoconferencing|electronic]] means.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#19|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 19)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#19|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may also specify how a [[quorum]] is to be determined.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Most organizations have adopted ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' as its guide to supplement its own rules{{where|date=November 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.parliamentarians.org/about/faq/|title = National Association of Parliamentarians &gt;&gt; FAQ|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |quote = ". . . the 11th edition of Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised is the current edition of the most widely used reference for meeting procedure and business rules in the English-speaking world."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, the rules for conducting board meetings may be less formal if there is no more than about a dozen board members present.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=9-10,487-488}} An example of the informality is that [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|motions]] are not required if it's clear what is being discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief|last = Robert III|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82019-9|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 158|edition = 2nd|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/inbrief.html|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Size ===
Historically, nonprofit boards have not uncommonly had large boards with up to twenty-four members, but a modern trend is to have smaller boards as small as six or seven people.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://perma.cc/NWK6-E3CC|title=For Nonprofit Boards, Smaller is Better|last=White|first=Cyrus|date=|website=perma.cc|publisher=The South Cabin Group LLC|access-date=2016-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that after seven people, each additional person reduces the effectiveness of [[group decision-making]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Non-corporate boards==
The role and responsibilities of a board of directors vary depending on the nature and type of business entity and the laws applying to the entity (see [[types of business entity]]). For example, the nature of the business entity may be one that is traded on a public market (public company), not traded on a public market (a private, limited or closely held company), owned by family members (a family business), or exempt from income taxes (a non-profit, not for profit, or tax-exempt entity). There are numerous types of business entities available throughout the world such as a corporation, limited liability company, cooperative, business trust, partnership, private limited company, and public limited company.

Much of what has been written about boards of directors relates to boards of directors of business entities actively traded on public markets.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, Bowen, William G., The board book: an insider's guide for directors and trustees (2008 W.W. Norton &amp; Co.); Murray, Alan S., Revolt in the boardroom: the new rules of power in corporate America (2007 Collins); Charan, Ram, Boards that deliver: advancing corporate governance from compliance to competitive advantage (2005 Jossey-Bass); Carver, John, Corporate boards that create value: governing company performance from the boardroom (2002 Jossey-Bass); Harvard Business Review on corporate governance (2000 Harvard Business School Press).&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, however, material is becoming available for boards of private and closely held businesses including family businesses.&lt;ref&gt;See specifically Tutelman and Hause, The Balance Point: New Ways Business Owners Can Use Boards (2008 Famille Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[board-only]] organization is one whose board is self-appointed, rather than being accountable to a base of members through elections; or in which the powers of the membership are extremely limited.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Membership organizations===
In [[Voluntary association|membership organizations]], such as a society made up of members of a certain profession or one advocating a certain cause, a board of directors may have the responsibility of running the organization in between meetings of the membership, especially if the membership meets infrequently, such as only at an [[annual general meeting]].{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481–483}} The amount of powers and authority delegated to the board depend on the bylaws and rules of the particular organization. Some organizations place matters exclusively in the board's control while in others, the general membership retains full power and the board can only make recommendations.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=481-483}}

The setup of a board of directors vary widely across organizations and may include provisions that are applicable to corporations, in which the "shareholders" are the members of the organization. A difference may be that the membership elects the officers of the organization, such as the president and the secretary, and the officers become members of the board in addition to the directors and retain those duties on the board.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=484}} The directors may also be classified as officers in this situation.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=572}} There may also be ex-officio members of the board, or persons who are members due to another position that they hold. These ex-officio members have all the same rights as the other board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 2)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#2|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the board may be removed before their term is complete. Details on how they can be removed are usually provided in the bylaws. If the bylaws do not contain such details, the section on disciplinary procedures in ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'' may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 20)|date = |accessdate = 2015-12-24|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170715132111/http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#20|archivedate = 15 July 2017|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporations==
In a [[public company|publicly held company]], directors are elected to represent and are legally obligated as fiduciaries to represent owners of the company—the [[shareholder]]s/stockholders.   In this capacity they establish policies and make decisions on issues such as whether there is [[dividend]] and how much it is, [[Employee stock option|stock options]] distributed to employees, and the hiring/firing and [[Executive pay|compensation of upper management]].

===Governance===
Theoretically, the control of a company is divided between two bodies: the board of directors, and the [[shareholder]]s in [[general meeting]]. In practice, the amount of power exercised by the board varies with the type of company. In small private companies, the directors and the shareholders are normally the same people, and thus there is no real division of power. In large [[public company|public companies]], the board tends to exercise more of a supervisory role, and individual responsibility and management tends to be delegated downward to individual professional executives (such as a finance director or a marketing director) who deal with particular areas of the company's affairs.&lt;ref name=CRI&gt;[http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php Titles Associated with Executive Compensation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917083738/http://www.compensationresources.com/titles-associated-with-executive-compensation.php |date=17 September 2012 }}| Compensation Resources Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of boards of directors in large public companies is that the board tends to have more ''[[de facto]]'' power. Many shareholders grant proxies to the directors to vote their shares at general meetings and accept all recommendations of the board rather than try to get involved in management, since each shareholder's power, as well as interest and information is so small.  Larger institutional investors also grant the board proxies. The large number of shareholders also makes it hard for them to organize. However, there have been moves recently to try to increase [[shareholder activism]] among both institutional investors and individuals with small shareholdings.&lt;ref name=CRI/&gt;

A contrasting view is that in large public companies it is upper management and not boards that wield practical power, because boards delegate nearly all of their power to the top executive employees, adopting their recommendations almost without fail.  As a practical matter, executives even choose the directors, with shareholders normally following management recommendations and voting for them.

In most cases, serving on a board is not a [[career]] unto itself. For major corporations, the board members are usually professionals or leaders in their field. In the case of outside directors, they are often senior leaders of other organizations. Nevertheless, board members often receive remunerations amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars per year since they often sit on the boards of several companies. Inside directors are usually not paid for sitting on a board, but the duty is instead considered part of their larger job description. Outside directors are usually paid for their services. These remunerations vary between corporations, but usually consist of a yearly or monthly salary, additional compensation for each meeting attended, stock options, and various other benefits. such as travel, hotel and meal expenses for the board meetings. [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], for example, pays directors an annual retainer of $46,500, an additional annual retainer of $2,500 if the director is also a chairperson of a committee, a per-meeting-attended fee of $2,000 for meetings attended in person, a $500 fee for each meeting attended via telephone, in addition to stock options and retirement benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/a/aa2203a_2.htm Fees, CEO Evaluation, and Ownership Structure]  By Joshua Kennon, About.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-tier system===
In some European and [[Asia]]n countries, there are two separate boards, an executive board for day-to-day business and a [[supervisory board]] (elected by the shareholders and employees) for supervising the executive board. In these countries, the CEO (chief executive or managing director) presides over the executive board and the chairman presides over the supervisory board, and these two roles will always be held by different people. This ensures a distinction between [[management]] by the executive board and [[governance]] by the supervisory board and allows for clear lines of authority. The aim is to prevent a [[conflict of interest]] and too much power being concentrated in the hands of one person. There is a strong parallel here with the structure of government, which tends to separate the political [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] from the management [[civil service]]. In the United States, the board of directors (elected by the shareholders) is often equivalent to the supervisory board, while the executive board may often be known as the executive committee (operating committee or executive council), composed of the CEO and their direct reports (other C-level officers, division/subsidiary heads).

{{Globalise/UK | section|date=April 2016}}

The development of a separate board of directors to manage/govern/oversee a company has occurred incrementally and indefinitely over legal history. Until the end of the 19th century, it seems to have been generally assumed that the general meeting (of all shareholders) was the supreme organ of a company, and that the board of directors merely acted as an agent of the company subject to the control of the shareholders in general meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.), citing ''[[Isle of Wight Rly Co v Tahourdin]]'' (1884) LR 25 Ch D 320&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by 1906, the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|English Court of Appeal]] had made it clear in the decision of ''[[Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co Ltd v Cuninghame]]'' [1906] 2 Ch 34 that the division of powers between the board and the shareholders in general meaning depended on the construction of the [[Articles of Association (law)|articles of association]] and that, where the powers of management were vested in the board, the general meeting could not interfere with their lawful exercise. The articles were held to constitute a contract by which the members had agreed that "the directors and the directors alone shall manage."&lt;ref&gt;''Per'' Cozens-Hardy LJ at 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The new approach did not secure immediate approval, but it was endorsed by the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in ''Quin &amp; Axtens v Salmon'' [1909] AC 442 and has since received general acceptance. Under English law, successive versions of [[Table A]] have reinforced the norm that, unless the directors are acting contrary to the law or the provisions of the Articles, the powers of conducting the management and affairs of the company are vested in them.

The modern doctrine was expressed in ''[[John Shaw &amp; Sons (Salford) Ltd v Shaw]]'' [1935] 2 KB 113 by [[Frederick Greer, 1st Baron Fairfield|Greer LJ]] as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A company is an entity distinct alike from its shareholders and its directors. Some of its powers may, according to its articles, be exercised by directors, certain other powers may be reserved for the shareholders in general meeting. If powers of management are vested in the directors, they and they alone can exercise these powers. The only way in which the general body of shareholders can control the exercise of powers by the articles in the directors is by altering the articles, or, if opportunity arises under the articles, by refusing to re-elect the directors of whose actions they disapprove. They cannot themselves usurp the powers which by the articles are vested in the directors any more than the directors can usurp the powers vested by the articles in the general body of shareholders.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been remarked{{by whom|date=April 2016}} that this development in the law was somewhat surprising at the time, as the relevant provisions in [[Table A]] (as it was then) seemed to contradict this approach rather than to endorse it.&lt;ref&gt;
See Gower, ''Principles of Company Law'' (6th ed.) at 185.
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Election and removal ===

{{Globalise/US | section|date=May 2018}}

In most legal systems, the appointment and removal of directors is voted upon by the shareholders in general meeting{{efn|For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 303 of the Companies Act 1985.}} or through a [[proxy statement]]. For publicly traded companies in the U.S., the directors which are available to vote on are largely selected by either the board as a whole or a [[nominating committee]].&lt;ref name="Shivdasani1999" /&gt; Although in 2002 the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[NASDAQ]] required that nominating committees consist of independent directors as a condition of listing,&lt;ref&gt;Chhaochharia V, Grinstein Y. (2007). [http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf Corporate governance and firm value: The impact of the 2002 governance rules] {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100611072244/http://faculty.fullerton.edu/jyang/Courses/fin332/Literature/governance%20rule%20result.pdf |date = 11 June 2010 }}. ''The Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt; nomination committees have historically received input from management in their selections even when the CEO does not have a position on the board.&lt;ref name="Shivdasani1999" /&gt; Shareholder nominations can only occur at the general meeting itself or through the prohibitively expensive process of mailing out ballots separately; in May 2009 the SEC proposed a new rule allowing shareholders meeting certain criteria to add nominees to the proxy statement.&lt;ref&gt;SEC. (May 2009). [https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2009/2009-116.htm SEC Votes to Propose Rule Amendments to Facilitate Rights of Shareholders to Nominate Directors].&lt;/ref&gt; In practice for publicly traded companies, the managers ([[inside director]]s) who are purportedly accountable to the board of directors have historically played a major role in selecting and nominating the directors who are voted on by the shareholders, in which case more "gray outsider directors" (independent directors with conflicts of interest) are nominated and elected.&lt;ref name=Shivdasani1999&gt;Shivdasani A, Yermack D. (1999). [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~eofek/PhD/papers/SY_CEO_JF.pdf CEO involvement in the selection of new board members: An empirical analysis]. ''Journal of Finance''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors may also leave office by resignation or death. In some legal systems, directors may also be removed by a resolution of the remaining directors (in some countries they may only do so "with cause"; in others the power is unrestricted).

Some jurisdictions also permit the board of directors to appoint directors, either to fill a vacancy which arises on resignation or death, or as an addition to the existing directors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In practice, it can be quite difficult to remove a director by a resolution in general meeting. In many legal systems, the director has a right to receive special notice of any resolution to remove him or her;{{efn|In the United Kingdom it is 28 days' notice, see sections 303(2) and 379 of the Companies Act 1985.}} the company must often supply a copy of the proposal to the director, who is usually entitled to be heard by the meeting.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 304(1) of the Companies Act 1985. A private company cannot use a written resolution under section 381A – a meeting must be held.}} The director may require the company to circulate any representations that he wishes to make.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see sections 303(2) and (3) of the Companies Act 1985.}} Furthermore, the director's contract of service will usually entitle him to compensation if he is removed, and may often include a generous "[[golden parachute]]" which also acts as a deterrent to removal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

A recent study examines how corporate shareholders voted in director elections in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cai|first=Jay|author2=Garner, Jacqueline |author3=Walkling, Ralph |title = Shareholder Access to the Boardroom: A Survey of Recent Evidence |journal=Journal of Applied Finance |year=2010 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=15–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It found that directors received fewer votes from shareholders when their companies performed poorly, had excess CEO compensation, or had poor shareholder protection. Also, directors received fewer votes when they did not regularly attend board meetings or received negative recommendations from a proxy advisory firm. The study also shows that companies often improve their corporate governance by removing [[poison pill]]s or classified boards and by reducing excessive CEO pay after their directors receive low shareholder support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cai | first1 = J. | last2 = Garner | first2 = J.

Board accountability to shareholders is a recurring issue. In 2010, the ''New York Times'' noted that several directors who had overseen companies which had failed in the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] had found new positions as directors.&lt;ref&gt;Craig S, Lattman P. (2010). [http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/companies-may-fail-but-directors-are-in-demand/?src=me&amp;ref=business Companies May Fail, but Directors Are in Demand]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The SEC sometimes imposes a ban (a "D&amp;O bar") on serving on a board as part of its fraud cases, and one of these was upheld in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law360.com/articles/442382/sec-wins-d-o-bar-against-alleged-hedge-fund-scammer SEC Wins D&amp;O Bar Against Alleged Hedge Fund Scammer]. Law360.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exercise of powers===
The exercise by the board of directors of its powers usually occurs in board meetings. Most legal systems require sufficient notice to be given to all directors of these meetings, and that a [[quorum]] must be present before any business may be conducted. Usually, a meeting which is held without notice having been given is still valid if all of the directors attend, but it has been held that a failure to give notice may negate resolutions passed at a meeting, because the persuasive oratory of a minority of directors might have persuaded the majority to change their minds and vote otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Barber's Case'' (1877) 5 Ch D 963 and ''Re Portuguese Consolidated Copper Mines'' (1889) 42 Ch D 160&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[common law]] countries, the powers of the board are vested in the board as a whole, and not in the individual directors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Breckland Group Holdings Ltd v London and Suffolk Properties]]'' [1989] BCLC 100&lt;/ref&gt; However, in instances an individual director may still bind the company by his acts by virtue of his [[ostensible authority]] (see also: [[Royal British Bank v Turquand|the rule in ''Turquand's Case'']]).

===Duties===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Corporate benefit]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;
{{main|Directors' duties|Fiduciary duties}}

Because directors exercise control and management over the organization, but organizations are (in theory) run for the benefit of the [[shareholder]]s, the law imposes strict duties on directors in relation to the exercise of their duties. The duties imposed on directors are [[fiduciary]] duties, similar to those that the law imposes on those in similar positions of trust: [[agency (law)|agents]] and [[trustee]]s.

The duties apply to each director separately, while the powers apply to the board jointly. Also, the duties are owed to the company itself, and not to any other entity.&lt;ref&gt;''Percival v Wright'' [1902] Ch 421&lt;/ref&gt; This does not mean that directors can never stand in a fiduciary relationship to the individual shareholders; they may well have such a duty in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;For example, if the board is authorised by the shareholders to negotiate with a takeover bidder. It has been held in New Zealand that "depending upon all the surround circumstances and the nature of the responsibility which in a real and practical sense the director has assumed towards the shareholder," ''Coleman v Myers'' [1977] 2 NZLR 225&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Proper purpose" ====
Directors must exercise their powers for a proper purpose. While in many instances an improper purpose is readily evident, such as a director looking to feather his or her own nest or divert an investment opportunity to a relative, such breaches usually involve a breach of the director's duty to act in good faith. Greater difficulties arise where the director, while acting in good faith, is serving a purpose that is not regarded by the law as proper.

The seminal authority in relation to what amounts to a proper purpose is the [[United Kingdom Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] decision in Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=[[Eclairs Group Ltd v JKX Oil &amp; Gas plc]] |court=UKSC |division=|year=2015 |num=71 |date={{date|2015-12-02}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case concerned the powers of directors under the [[articles of association]] of the company to disenfranchise voting rights attached to shares for failure to properly comply with notice served on the shareholders.  Prior to that case the leading authority was ''[[Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Ltd]]'' [1974] AC 821. The case concerned the power of the directors to issue new [[stock|shares]].&lt;ref&gt;Following ''[[Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd]]'' [1967] Ch 254&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that the directors had issued a large number of new shares purely to deprive a particular shareholder of his voting majority. An argument that the power to issue shares could only be properly exercised to raise new capital was rejected as too narrow, and it was held that it would be a proper exercise of the director's powers to issue shares to a larger company to ensure the financial stability of the company, or as part of an agreement to exploit mineral rights owned by the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the mere fact that an incidental result (even if it was a desired consequence) was that a shareholder lost his majority, or a takeover bid was defeated, this would not itself make the share issue improper. But if the sole purpose was to destroy a voting majority, or block a takeover bid, that would be an improper purpose.

Not all jurisdictions recognised the "proper purpose" duty as separate from the "good faith" duty however.{{efn|This division was rejected in British Columbia in ''Teck Corporation v Millar'' (1972) 33 DLR (3d) 288.}}

==== "Unfettered discretion" ====
Directors cannot, without the consent of the company, fetter their [[discretion]] in relation to the exercise of their powers, and cannot bind themselves to vote in a particular way at future board meetings.{{efn|Although as Gower points out, as well understood as the rule is, there is a paucity of authority on the point. But see ''Clark v Workman'' [1920] 1 Ir R 107 and ''Dawson International plc v Coats Paton plc'' 1989 SLT 655.}} This is so even if there is no improper motive or purpose, and no personal advantage to the director.

This does not mean, however, that the board cannot agree to the company entering into a contract which binds the company to a certain course, even if certain actions in that course will require further board approval. The company remains bound, but the directors retain the discretion to vote against taking the future actions (although that may involve a breach by the company of the [[contract]] that the board previously approved).

===="Conflict of duty and interest"====

As fiduciaries, the directors may not put themselves in a position where their interests and duties conflict with the duties that they owe to the company. The law takes the view that good faith must not only be done, but must be manifestly seen to be done, and zealously patrols the conduct of directors in this regard; and will not allow directors to escape liability by asserting that his decision was in fact well founded. Traditionally, the law has divided conflicts of duty and interest into three sub-categories.

=====Transactions with the company=====

By definition, where a director enters into a transaction with a company, there is a conflict between the director's interest (to do well for himself out of the transaction) and his duty to the company (to ensure that the company gets as much as it can out of the transaction). This rule is so strictly enforced that, even where the [[conflict of interest]] or conflict of duty is purely hypothetical, the directors can be forced to disgorge all personal gains arising from it. In ''Aberdeen Ry v Blaikie'' (1854) 1 Macq HL 461 [[Robert Rolfe, 1st Baron Cranworth|Lord Cranworth]] stated in his judgment that:

:"A corporate body can only act by agents, and it is, of course, the duty of those agents so to act as best to promote the interests of the corporation whose affairs they are conducting. Such agents have duties to discharge of a fiduciary nature towards their principal. And it is a rule of universal application that no one, having such duties to discharge, shall be allowed to enter into engagements in which he has, ''or can have'', a personal interest conflicting ''or which possibly may conflict'', with the interests of those whom he is bound to protect... So strictly is this principle adhered to that no question is allowed to be raised as to the fairness or unfairness of the contract entered into..." (''emphasis'' added)

However, in many jurisdictions the members of the company are permitted to ratify transactions which would otherwise fall foul of this principle. It is also largely accepted in most jurisdictions that this principle can be overridden in the company's constitution.

In many countries, there is also a statutory duty to declare interests in relation to any transactions, and the director can be fined for failing to make disclosure.{{efn|In the United Kingdom, see section 317 of the Companies Act 1985.}}

===== Use of corporate property, opportunity, or information =====
Directors must not, without the informed consent of the company, use for their own profit the company's assets, [[corporate opportunity|opportunities]], or information. This prohibition is much less flexible than the prohibition against the transactions with the company, and attempts to circumvent it using provisions in the articles have met with limited success.

In ''[[Regal (Hastings) v Gulliver|Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver]]'' [1942] All ER 378 the House of Lords, in upholding what was regarded as a wholly unmeritorious claim by the shareholders,{{efn|In summary, the facts were as follows: Company A owned a cinema, and the directors decided to acquire two other cinemas with a view to selling the entire undertaking as a [[going concern]]. They formed a new company ("Company B") to take the leases of the two new cinemas. But the lessor insisted on various stipulations, one of which was that Company B had to have a paid up [[share capital]] of not less than £5,000 (a substantial sum at the time). Company A was unable to subscribe for more than £2,000 in shares, so the directors arranged for the remaining 3,000 shares to be taken by themselves and their friends. Later, instead of selling the undertaking, they sold all of the shares in both companies and made a substantial profit. The shareholders of Company A sued asking that directors and their friends to disgorge the profits that they had made in connection with their 3,000 shares in Company B – the very same shares which the shareholders in Company A had been asked to subscribe (through Company A) but refused to do so.}} held that:

: "(i) that what the directors did was so related to the affairs of the company that it can properly be said to have been done in the course of their management and in the utilisation of their opportunities and special knowledge as directors; and (ii) that what they did resulted in profit to themselves."

And accordingly, the directors were required to disgorge the profits that they made, and the shareholders received their windfall.

The decision has been followed in several subsequent cases,&lt;ref&gt;''Industrial Development Consultants v Cooley'' [1972] 1 WLR 443 (corporate information), ''[[Canadian Aero Service v. O'Malley]]'' (1973) 40 DLR (3d) 371 (corporate opportunity) and ''Boardman v Phipps'' [1967] 2 AC 46 (corporate opportunity, which again, the company itself had declined to take up)&lt;/ref&gt; and is now regarded as settled law.

===== Competing with the company =====
Directors cannot compete directly with the company without a conflict of interest arising. Similarly, they should not act as directors of competing companies, as their duties to each company would then conflict with each other.

==== Common law duties of care and skill ====
Traditionally, the level of care and skill which has to be demonstrated by a director has been framed largely with reference to the non-executive director. In ''[[Re City Equitable Fire Insurance Co]]'' [1925] Ch 407, it was expressed in purely subjective terms, where the court held that:

: "a director need not exhibit in the performance of his duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of ''his'' knowledge and experience." (''emphasis'' added)

However, this decision was based firmly in the older notions (see above) that prevailed at the time as to the mode of corporate decision making, and effective control residing in the shareholders; if they elected and put up with an incompetent decision maker, they should not have recourse to complain.

However, a more modern approach has since developed, and in ''[[Dorchester Finance Co Ltd v Stebbing]]'' [1989] BCLC 498 the court held that the rule in ''Equitable Fire'' related only to skill, and not to diligence. With respect to diligence, what was required was:

: "such care as an ordinary man might be expected to take on his own behalf."

This was a dual subjective and objective test, and one deliberately pitched at a higher level.

More recently, it has been suggested that both the tests of skill and diligence should be assessed objectively and subjectively; in the United Kingdom, the statutory provisions relating to directors' duties in the new [[Companies Act 2006]] have been codified on this basis.&lt;ref name="NormanGoddard"&gt;''Norman v [[Theodore Goddard]]'' [1991] BCLC 1027&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Remedies for breach of duty ====
In most jurisdictions, the law provides for a variety of remedies in the event of a breach by the directors of their duties:
# [[injunction]] or [[declaration (law)|declaration]]
# [[damages]] or compensation
# restoration of the company's property
# [[Rescission (contract law)|rescission]] of the relevant [[contract]]
# [[account of profits]]
# [[Termination of employment#Summary termination|summary dismissal]]

====Current trends====
Historically, directors' duties have been owed almost exclusively to the company and its members, and the board was expected to exercise its powers for the [[corporate benefit|financial benefit]] of the company. However, more recently there have been attempts to "soften" the position, and provide for more scope for directors to act as good corporate citizens. For example, in the United Kingdom, the [[Companies Act 2006]] requires directors of companies "to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole" and sets out the following six factors regarding a director's duty to promote success:
* the likely consequences of any decision in the long term
* the interests of the company's employees
* the need to foster the company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others
* the impact of the company's operations on the community and the environment
* the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct
* the need to act fairly as between members of a company

This represents a considerable departure from the traditional notion that directors' duties are owed only to the company. Previously in the United Kingdom, under the [[Companies Act 1985]], protections for non-member stakeholders were considerably more limited (see, for example, s.309 which permitted directors to take into account the interests of employees but which could only be enforced by the shareholders and not by the employees themselves). The changes have therefore been the subject of some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altassets.net/features/arc/2006/nz8451.php Director's duties]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Board and Society====

Most companies have weak mechanisms for bringing the voice of society into the board room. They rely on personalities who weren't appointed for their understanding of societal issues. Often they give limited focus (both through time and financial resource) to issues of corporate responsibility and sustainability. A Social Board &lt;ref&gt;Acre Resources LTD (2018), [https://www.acre.com/resources/the-case-for-a-social-board/ The Case for a Social Board], London, UK&lt;/ref&gt; has society designed into its structure. It elevates the voice of society through specialist appointments to the board and mechanisms that empower innovation from within the organisation. Social Boards align themselves with themes that are important to society.These may include measuring worker pay ratios, linking personal social and environmental objectives to remuneration, integrated reporting, fair tax and B-Corp Certification. 

Social Boards recognise that they are part of society and that they require more than a licence to operate to succeed.They balance short-term shareholder pressure against long-term value creation, managing the business for a plurality of stakeholders including employees, shareholders, supply chains and civil society.

===United States===

====Sarbanes–Oxley Act====

The [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] of 2002 has introduced new standards of accountability on boards of U.S. companies or companies listed on U.S. [[stock exchange]]s. Under the Act, directors risk large fines and prison sentences in the case of accounting crimes. [[Internal control]] is now the direct responsibility of directors. The vast majority of companies covered by the Act have hired internal auditors to ensure that the company adheres to required standards of internal control. The internal auditors are required by law to report directly to an audit board, consisting of directors more than half of whom are outside directors, one of whom is a "financial expert."

The law requires companies listed on the major stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ) to have a majority of independent directors—directors who are not otherwise employed by the firm or in a business relationship with it.

====Size====
According to the Corporate Library's study, the average size of publicly traded company's board is 9.2 members, and most boards range from 3 to 31 members. According to Investopedia, some analysts think the ideal size is seven.&lt;ref name=BoD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/03/111903.asp#ixzz27Kekd83e |title=Evaluating The Board Of Directors|publisher= investopedia.com|date= 29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  State law may specify a minimum number of directors, maximum number of directors, and qualifications for directors (e.g. whether board members must be individuals or may be business entities).&lt;ref name=BoD2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/corporate-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Corporate Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BoD3&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harborcompliance.com/information/nonprofit-governance-by-state.php |title=U.S. Nonprofit Governance by State |publisher= harborcompliance.com|date= 27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Committees====
While a board may have several committees, two—the compensation committee and audit committee—are critical and must be made up of at least three [[independent director]]s and no inside directors. Other common committees in boards are nominating and governance.&lt;ref name=BoD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klgates.com/files/Publication/f44a6446-4d3a-4847-a157-319c05d9667b/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/3900b2fd-2183-44e8-82d7-41bd4366f0f6/CompensationCommitteeStructure.pdf Compensation Committee Structure, Function and Best Practices] Richard E. Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compensation====
Directors of [[Fortune 500]] companies received median pay of $234,000 in 2011. Directorship is a part-time job. A recent National Association of Corporate Directors study found directors averaging just 4.3 hours a week on board work.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/companies/management/story/2011-10-25/director-compensation-rising/50918332/1 | work=USA Today | title=Company directors see pay skyrocket | date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys indicate that about 20% of [[nonprofit foundation]]s pay their board members,&lt;ref name="Schambra"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schambra | first=William A. | title=Board Compensation: To Pay or Not to Pay? | work=Philanthropy magazine |date=Winter 2008 |publisher=Philanthropy Roundtable | url=http://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/topic/philanthropic_freedom/compensating_foundation_directors1 | accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2% of American [[nonprofit organization]]s do.{{sfn|BoardSource|2015|p=52}}&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite |author=[[Internal Revenue Service]] |title=Governance and Related Topics - 501(c)(3) Organizations |date=4 February 2008 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Author |url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/governance_practices.pdf |quote=Charities should generally not compensate persons for service on the board of directors except to reimburse direct expenses of such service. ...

===Criticism===
According to John Gillespie, a former investment banker and co-author of a book critical of boards,&lt;ref&gt;''Money for Nothing: How the Failure of Corporate Boards is Ruining American Business and Costing Us Trillions''&lt;/ref&gt; "Far too much of their time has been for check-the-box and cover-your-behind activities rather than real monitoring of executives and providing strategic advice on behalf of shareholders".&lt;ref name=comp/&gt; At the same time, scholars have found that individual directors have a large effect on major corporate initiatives such as mergers and acquisitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rousseau|first1=Peter|last2=Stroup|first2=Caleb|title=Director Histories and the Pattern of Acquisitions|journal=Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|date=2015|volume=50|issue=4|pages=671–698|doi=10.1017/s0022109015000289}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-border investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stroup|first=Caleb|title=International Deal Experience and Cross-Border Acquisitions|journal=Economic Inquiry|volume=55|pages=73–97|date=November 28, 2015|ssrn=2037512|doi=10.1111/ecin.12365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of [[gender representation on corporate boards of directors]] has been the subject of much criticism in recent years. Governments and corporations have responded with measures such as legislation mandating gender quotas and [[comply or explain]] systems to address the disproportionality of gender representation on corporate boards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Senden|first1=Linda|title=The Multiplicity of Regulatory Responses to Remedy the Gender Imbalance on Company Boards|journal=Utrecht Law Review|date=December 2014|volume=10|issue=5|pages=51–66|doi=10.18352/ulr.300}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the French corporate elite has found that certain social classes are also disproportionately represented on boards, with those from the upper and, especially, upper-middle classes tending to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclean|first=Mairi|last2=Harvey|first2=Charles|last3=Kling|first3=Gerhard|date=2014-06-01|title=Pathways to Power: Class, Hyper-Agency and the French Corporate Elite|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=35|issue=6|pages=825–855|doi=10.1177/0170840613509919|issn=0170-8406|url=http://opus.bath.ac.uk/50376/3/Maclean_Harvey_Kling_OS_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business Technology Management''' (BTM) is an emerging trans-disciplinary research area and professional discipline in [[Outline of academic disciplines#Business administration|Business Administration]].

Building upon other business disciplines, such as [[Management information system|Management Information Systems]] (MIS) and [[Innovation management|Technology and Innovation Management]] (TIM), it seeks to provide an [[integrated framework]] for the strategic use of technology and the [[digital transformation]] of organizations.

BTM is evolving similarly to other research areas in business, e.g., professional disciplines of [[Change Management]] (CM) and [[Management Consulting]], developed from foundations in [[Organizational Behavior]] (OB), [[Strategic Management]] (SM), and [[Operations Management]] (OM).

A new BTM program accreditation standard has been developed by ITAC Talent, a division of the [[IT Association of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://itactalent.ca/talent-initiatives/btm/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; It was mandated by the Government of Canada to develop and update the educational standards of BTM programs in the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3637">[[File:BR Mining Figure1.JPG|thumb|Business rule mining example]]
'''Business rule mining''' is the process of extracting essential intellectual business logic in the form of [[Business rule|Business Rules]] from packaged or [[Legacy software]] applications, recasting them in natural or formal language, and storing them in a source rule repository for further analysis or [[Forward_engineering#MDA_approach|forward engineering]]. The goal is to capture these legacy business rules in a way that the business can validate, control and change them over time. 

== Overview ==
Business rule mining supports a [[Business rules approach]], which is defined as a formal way of managing and automating an organization's business rules so that the business behaves and evolves as its leaders intend. 

It is also commonly conducted as part of an [[Software modernization|application modernization]] project evolving legacy software applications to [[service oriented architecture]] (SOA) solutions, transitioning to packaged software, redeveloping new in-house applications, or to facilitate knowledge retention and communication between business and [[Information technologies|IT]] professionals in a [[Software maintenance|maintenance]] environment.

== Alternative Approaches ==
Alternative approaches to rule mining are manual and automated. 

A manual approach involves the hand-writing of rules on the basis of subject matter expert interviews and the inspection of [[source code]], [[Batch processing|job flows]], [[data structure]]s and observed behavior. 

Manually extracting rules is complicated by the difficulty of locating and understanding highly interdependent logic that has been interwoven into millions of lines of software code.  

An automated approach utilizes repository-based software to locate logical connections inherent within applications and extract them into a predetermined business rules format.

With automation, an effective approach is to apply semantic structures to existing applications.  By overlaying business contexts onto legacy applications, rules miners can focus effort on discovering rules from systems that are valuable to the business.  Effort is redirected away from mining commoditized or irrelevant applications.  

Further, best practices &lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rule_Mining_Best_Practices best practices]&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with various tool-assisted techniques of capturing programs’ semantics speeds the transformation of technical rules to true business rules.  Adding business semantics to the analysis process allows users to abstract technical concepts and descriptors that are normal in an application to a business level that is consumable by a rules analyst. 

System integrators, software vendors, rules mining practitioners, and in-house development teams have developed technologies, proprietary methodologies and industry-specific templates for application modernization and business rule mining.

'''CMD Group''', formerly Reed Construction Data and Construction Market Data, is a provider of [[business information]] for the [[North America]]n construction industry. CMD is owned by [[Warburg Pincus]] (51%) and [[Reed Business Information]] (49%). Its historical roots lie in Construction Market Data, founded in 1982 to publish construction leads and market data. In 2000, London-based [[Reed Elsevier]] purchased this original CMD Group, transitioning the company to Reed Construction Data.

In October 2014 [[private equity firm]] Warburg Pincus in New York purchased a majority stake in the company, and Reed Construction Data changed its name to CMD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hconews.com/articles/2014/10/8/reed-construction-data-rebrands-cmd&lt;/ref&gt; The Norcross, Ga.-based provider of North American construction data said the new name is a nod to the company’s original name: Construction Market Data. The new brand includes an updated logo and website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2014/10/01/reed-construction-data-rebrands-itself-as-cmd.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The company tracks data on hundreds of thousands of projects per year, providing coverage of construction projects in both the United States and Canada. The company provides monthly analysis and data for all aspects of the construction industry. CMD also provides a detailed view of construction activity, including historical data, current-year projections and a five-year forecast. Their research helps customers forecast to find those market segments experiencing the greatest growth and plan tactical marketing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hconews.com/articles/2014/10/8/reed-construction-data-rebrands-cmd&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
In October 2009, Reed Construction Data (which is now Construction Market Data a division of ConstructCONNECT) filed suit in [[United States district court|federal court]] against [[McGraw-Hill Construction]], charging that the company's Dodge Report had unlawfully accessed confidential and trade secret information from Reed since 2002 by using a series of fake companies to pose as Reed customers.
The lawsuit, filed in the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], seeks an unspecified amount in lost profits and punitive damages, trial by jury, and injunctive relief as a result of Dodge’s misuse of proprietary construction project information, and that Dodge allegedly manipulated the information to create misleading comparisons between Dodge’s and Reed’s products and services in an effort to mislead the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reedconstructiondata.com/corporate/press-releases/2009/10/reed-construction-data-files-corporate-espionage-lawsuit-against-mcgraw-hil |title=Reed Construction Data Files Corporate Espionage Lawsuit Against McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge |publisher=Reedconstructiondata.com |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{when|date=March 2013}}

The '''cash break even ratio''' is used in evaluating the [[financial]] performance of an income property to determine what rate of occupancy is required to meet both operating expense and mortgage payments (debt service).

== Formula ==
'''Cash Break Even Ratio''' = (Operating Expenses + Mortgage Payment - Reserves for Replacement) / Potential [[Gross Income]]

It allows both [[lender|lenders]] and [[investor|investors]] to assess a particular income properties ability to meet its operating expenses and provide a measurable level of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]. The ratio does not include reserves for replacement, because it is not an actual cash expense. Additionally, it includes mortgage payment (debt service) which applies to most income properties that use leverage to enhance [[return on investment]] and equity dividend rate ([[cash on cash return]]).

[[File:FEMA - 37677 - Aerial of a Louisiana oil refinary repaired since Katrina.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Oil refinery in [[Louisiana]] - an example of chemical industry]]
The '''chemical industry''' comprises the [[company|companies]] that produce industrial [[chemical]]s. Central to the modern [[world economy]], it converts [[raw materials]] ([[oil]], [[natural gas]], [[air]], [[water]], [[metals]], and [[minerals]]) into more than 70,000 different [[Products Finishing|products]].

The [[plastics industry]] contains some overlap, as most chemical companies produce plastic as well as other chemicals.

==History==
Although chemicals were made and used throughout history, the birth of the heavy chemical industry (production of chemicals in large quantities for a variety of uses) coincided with the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in general.

===Industrial Revolution===
One of the first chemicals to be produced in large amounts through industrial processes was [[sulphuric acid]]. In 1736, the pharmacist [[Joshua Ward]] developed a process for its production that involved heating saltpeter, allowing the sulfur to oxidize and combine with water. It was the first practical production of sulphuric acid on a large scale. [[John Roebuck]] and [[Samuel Garbett]] were the first to establish a large-scale factory in [[Prestonpans|Prestonpans, Scotland]], in 1749, which used leaden condensing chambers for the manufacture of sulfuric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Derry, Thomas Kingston |author2=Williams, Trevor I. | year = 1993 | title = A Short History of Technology: From the Earliest Times to A.D. 1900 | location = New York | publisher = Dover }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sulfuric Acid: Pumping Up the Volume | author = Kiefer, David M. | year = 2001 | publisher = American Chemical Society | url = http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/journals/tcaw/10/i09/html/09chemch.html | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:StRolloxChemical 1831.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Tennant]]'s St. Rollox Chemical Works in 1831, then the biggest chemical enterprise in the world.]]
In the early [[18th century]], cloth was bleached by treating it with stale [[urine]] or [[sour milk]] and exposing it to [[sunlight]] for long periods of time, which created a severe bottleneck in production. Sulfuric acid began to be used as a more efficient agent as well as [[lime (material)|lime]] by the middle of the century, but it was the discovery of [[bleaching powder]] by [[Charles Tennant]] that spurred the creation of the first great chemical industrial enterprise. His powder was made by reacting [[chlorine]] with dry [[slaked lime]] and proved to be a cheap and successful product. He opened a factory in [[Glasgow St Rollox (UK Parliament constituency)|St Rollox]], north of [[Glasgow]], and production went from just 52 tons in 1799 to almost 10,000 tons just five years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Chemical Industries In The UK|publisher = American Chemical Society|url=http://the-environment.org.uk/bristish_isles/history_chemical_industry_UK.html|accessdate = 2013-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Soda ash]] was used since ancient times in the production of [[glass]], [[textile]], [[soap]], and [[paper]], and the source of the [[potash]] had traditionally been [[wood]] ashes in [[Western Europe]]. By the 18th century, this source was becoming uneconomical due to deforestation, and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] offered a prize of 2400 [[French livre|livres]] for a method to produce alkali from sea salt ([[sodium chloride]]). The [[Leblanc process]] was patented in 1791 by [[Nicolas Leblanc]] who then built a Leblanc plant at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]].&lt;ref name="Aftalion11"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Fred | last = Aftalion | title = A History of the International Chemical Industry | location = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1991 | pages = 11–13 | isbn = 0-8122-1297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was denied his prize money because of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name='Aftalion14'/&gt;

However, it was in Britain that the Leblanc process really took off.&lt;ref name='Aftalion14'&gt;{{Cite book | first = Fred | last = Aftalion | title = A History of the International Chemical Industry | location = Philadelphia | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 1991 | pages = 14–16 | isbn = 0-8122-1297-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Losh]] built the first soda works in Britain at the [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]] works on the [[River Tyne]] in 1816, but it remained on a small scale due to large [[tariff]]s on salt production until 1824. When these tariffs were repealed, the British soda industry was able to rapidly expand. [[James Muspratt]]'s chemical works in [[Liverpool]] and Charles Tennant's complex near [[Glasgow]] became the largest chemical production centres anywhere. By the 1870s, the British soda output of 200,000 tons annually exceeded that of all other nations in the world combined.

[[File:Ernest Solvay.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Ernest Solvay]], patented an improved industrial method for the manufacture of [[soda ash]].]]
These huge factories began to produce a greater diversity of chemicals as the [[Industrial Revolution]] matured. Originally, large quantities of alkaline waste were vented into the environment from the production of soda, provoking one of the [[Alkali Act 1863|first pieces of environmental legislation]] to be passed in 1863. This provided for close inspection of the factories and imposed heavy fines on those exceeding the limits on pollution. Methods were soon devised to make useful byproducts from the alkali.

The [[Solvay process]] was developed by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] industrial chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] in 1861. In 1864, Solvay and his brother Alfred constructed a plant in the Belgian town of [[Charleroi]] and in 1874, they expanded into a larger plant in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], France. The new process proved more economical and less polluting than the Leblanc method, and its use spread. In the same year, [[Ludwig Mond]] visited Solvay to acquire the rights to use his process, and he and [[John Tomlinson Brunner|John Brunner]] formed the firm of [[Brunner Mond|Brunner, Mond &amp; Co.]], and built a Solvay plant at [[Winnington]], England. Mond was instrumental in making the Solvay process a commercial success; he made several refinements between 1873 and 1880 that removed byproducts that could slow or halt the mass production of sodium carbonate through use of the process.

===Expansion and maturation===
The late [[19th century]] saw an explosion in both the quantity of production and the variety of chemicals that were manufactured. Large chemical industries also took shape in Germany and later in the United States.

[[File:BASF Werk Ludwigshafen 1866.JPG|thumb|right|The factories of the German firm [[BASF]], in 1866.]]
Production of artificial manufactured [[fertilizer]] for [[agriculture]] was pioneered by Sir [[John Lawes]] at his purpose-built [[Rothamsted Research]] facility. In the 1840s he established large works near [[London]] for the manufacture of [[Monocalcium phosphate|superphosphate of lime]]. Processes for the [[vulcanization of rubber]] were patented by [[Charles Goodyear]] in the United States and [[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] in England in the 1840s. The first synthetic dye was discovered by [[William Henry Perkin]] in [[London]]. He partly transformed [[aniline]] into a crude mixture which, when extracted with alcohol, produced a substance with an intense purple colour. He also developed the first synthetic perfumes. However, it was German industry that quickly began to dominate the field of synthetic dyes. The three major firms [[BASF]], [[Bayer AG|Bayer]] and [[Hoechst AG|Hoechst]] produced several hundred different dyes, and by 1913, the German industry produced almost 90 percent of the world supply of dyestuffs and sold about 80 percent of their production abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aftalion|1991|p=104}}, {{Harvnb|Chandler|2004|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[Herbert Henry Dow|Herbert Henry Dow's]] use of electrochemistry to produce chemicals from [[brine]] was a commercial success that helped to promote the country's chemical industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bromineproduction.html|title=Electrolytic Production of Bromine - National Historic Chemical Landmark - American Chemical Society|website=American Chemical Society|access-date=2016-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[petrochemical]] industry can be traced back to the oil works of [[James Young (Scottish chemist)|James Young]] in Scotland and [[Abraham Pineo Gesner]] in Canada. The first plastic was invented by [[Alexander Parkes]], an English [[metallurgy|metallurgist]]. In 1856, he patented [[Parkesine]], a [[celluloid]] based on [[nitrocellulose]] treated with a variety of solvents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=UK Patent office|title=Patents for inventions|year=1857|publisher=UK Patent office|pages=255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nCoU-2tAx8C&amp;pg=PA255}}&lt;/ref&gt; This material, exhibited at the 1862 London International Exhibition, anticipated many of the modern aesthetic and utility uses of plastics. The industrial production of [[soap]] from vegetable oils was started by [[William Lever]] and his brother [[James Darcy Lever|James]] in 1885 in [[Lancashire]] based on a modern chemical process invented by William Hough Watson that used [[glycerin]] and [[vegetable oil]]s.&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;Jeannifer Filly Sumayku, [http://www.thepresidentpost.com/?p=2621 Unilever: Providing Enjoyable and Meaningful Life to Customers], ''The President Post, 22 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1920s, chemical firms consolidated into large [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s; [[IG Farben]] in Germany, [[Rhône-Poulenc]] in France and [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] in Britain. [[DuPont|Dupont]] became a major chemicals firm in the early 20th century in America.

Currently chemical production is a high-tech industry, where the competitiveness is more based on capacity in investment on research and development than the labour cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Gabriele |last= Centi|title=Resources and energy efficiency :the winning strategy for chemical industry |journal=La Chimica  l'Industria |publisher=Società Chimica Italiana|url=https://www.soc.chim.it/sites/default/files/chimind/pdf/2012_1_64_ca.pdf|issue=  1|date = January 2012|pages=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
"Polymers and plastics, especially [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[polyethylene terephthalate]], [[polystyrene]] and [[polycarbonate]] comprise about 80% of the industry’s output worldwide".&lt;ref name=Chemistry&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry in Daily Life|last=Singh|first=Kirpal|publisher=PHI Learning Private Limited|isbn=978-81-203-4617-8|date=July 2012|page=132|chapter=17.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These materials are often converted to [[fluoropolymer]] tubing products and used by the industry to transport highly corrosive materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fluorotherm.com/technical-information/materials-overview/ptfe-properties/|title=PTFE Properties|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Fluorotherm Polymers, Inc.|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemicals are used in a lot of different consumer goods, but they are also used in a lot of different other sectors; including agriculture manufacturing, construction, and service industries.&lt;ref name=Chemistry /&gt; Major industrial customers include rubber and [[plastic]] products, [[textile]]s, apparel, petroleum refining, [[paper chemicals|pulp and paper]], and primary metals. Chemicals are nearly a $3 trillion global enterprise, and the EU and U.S. chemical companies are the world's largest producers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Sales of the chemical business can be divided into a few broad categories, including basic chemicals (about 35 to 37 percent of the dollar output), life sciences (30 percent), specialty chemicals (20 to 25 percent) and consumer products (about 10 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Technofunc|title=Sectors of Chemical Industry|url=http://www.technofunc.com/index.php/domain-knowledge/chemicals-industry/item/sectors-of-chemical-industry|accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic Chemicals &amp; Commodity Chemicals to Polymers and Specialty Chemicals===

[[File:Slovnaft - new polypropylene plant PP3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|New polypropylene plant PP3 in the [[Slovnaft]] oil refinery ([[Bratislava]], Slovakia)]]
Basic chemicals, or "commodity chemicals" are a broad chemical category including polymers, bulk petrochemicals and intermediates, other derivatives and basic industrials, [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic chemicals]], and [[fertilizer]]s. Typical growth rates for basic chemicals are about 0.5 to 0.7 times GDP.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Product prices are generally less than fifty cents per pound.{Citation needed|date=May 2010}

'''Polymers''', the largest revenue segment at about 33 percent of the basic chemicals dollar value, includes all categories of [[plastics industry|plastics]] and man-made fibers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The major markets for plastics are [[packaging]], followed by home construction, containers, appliances, pipe, transportation, toys, and games. 
* The largest-volume polymer product, [[polyethylene]] (PE), is used mainly in packaging films and other markets such as milk bottles, containers, and pipe.
* [[Polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), another large-volume product, is principally used to make piping for construction markets as well as siding and, to a much smaller extent, transportation and packaging materials.
* [[Polypropylene]] (PP), similar in volume to PVC, is used in markets ranging from packaging, appliances, and containers to clothing and carpeting.
* [[Polystyrene]] (PS), another large-volume plastic, is used principally for appliances and packaging as well as toys and recreation.
* The leading [[synthetic fiber|man-made fibers]] include [[polyester]], [[nylon]], polypropylene, and [[Acrylic fiber|acrylics]], with applications including apparel, home furnishings, and other industrial and consumer use.
The principal raw materials for polymers are bulk petrochemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Chemicals in the bulk '''[[petrochemicals]]''' and intermediates are primarily made from [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG), [[natural gas]], and [[crude oil]]. Their sales volume is close to 30 percent of overall basic chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} 
Typical large-volume products include [[ethylene]], [[propylene]], [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[xylenes]], [[methanol]], [[vinyl chloride monomer]] (VCM), [[styrene]], [[butadiene]], and [[ethylene oxide]]. These basic or commodity chemicals are the starting materials used to manufacture many [[polymer]]s and other more complex organic chemicals particularly those that are made for use in the [[specialty chemicals]] category (see below).

'''Other derivatives''' and basic industrials include [[synthetic rubber]], [[surfactant]]s, [[dye]]s and [[pigment]]s, [[turpentine]], [[resin]]s, [[carbon black]], [[explosive]]s, and rubber products and contribute about 20 percent of the basic chemicals' external sales.

'''[[inorganic chemistry|Inorganic chemicals]]''' (about 12 percent of the revenue output) make up the oldest of the chemical categories. Products include [[salt]], [[chlorine]], [[caustic soda]], [[soda ash]], acids (such as [[nitric acid]], [[phosphoric acid]], and [[sulfuric acid]]), [[titanium dioxide]], and [[hydrogen peroxide]].

'''[[Fertilizers]]''' are the smallest category (about 6 percent) and include [[phosphate]]s, [[ammonia]], and [[potash]] chemicals.

===Life sciences===
Life sciences (about 30 percent of the dollar output of the chemistry business) include differentiated chemical and biological substances, [[pharmaceutical]]s, diagnostics, [[veterinary medicine|animal health products]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[pesticides]]. While much smaller in volume than other chemical sectors, their products tend to have very high prices—over ten dollars per pound—growth rates of 1.5 to 6 times GDP, and research and development spending at 15 to 25 percent of sales. Life science products are usually produced with very high specifications and are closely scrutinized by government agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration. Pesticides, also called "crop protection chemicals", are about 10 percent of this category and include [[herbicides]], [[insecticide]]s, and [[fungicide]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Specialty chemicals===
[[Specialty chemicals]] are a category of relatively high valued, rapidly growing chemicals with diverse end product markets. Typical growth rates are one to three times GDP with prices over a dollar per pound. They are generally characterized by their innovative aspects. Products are sold for what they can do rather than for what chemicals they contain. Products include electronic chemicals, [[industrial gases]], adhesives and sealants as well as coatings, industrial and institutional cleaning chemicals, and catalysts. In 2012, excluding fine chemicals, the $546 billion global speciality chemical market was 33% Paints, Coating and Surface Treatments, 27% Advanced Polymer, 14% Adhesives and Sealants, 13% additives and 13% pigments and inks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher==Marketline|title=Global Specialty Chemicals|url=http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|date=May 2012|accessdate=16 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115071331/http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|archivedate=15 November 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Speciality chemicals]] are sold as effect or performance chemicals. Sometimes they are mixtures of formulations, unlike "[[fine chemicals]]," which are almost always single-molecule products.

===Consumer products===
Consumer products include direct product sale of chemicals such as [[soap]]s, [[detergent]]s, and [[cosmetics]]. Typical growth rates are 0.8 to 1.0 times GDP.

Consumers rarely if ever come into contact with basic chemicals but polymers and speciality chemicals are the materials that they will encounter everywhere in their everyday lives, such as in plastics, cleaning materials, cosmetics, paints &amp; coatings, electronic gadgets, automobiles and the materials used to construct their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=MarketLine|title=Global Speciality Chemicals|url=http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|date=May 2012|access-date=2012-09-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115071331/http://2012e.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fb/Global_Specialty_Chemicals_Profile.pdf|archivedate=2012-11-15|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These speciality products are marketed by chemical companies to the downstream manufacturing industries as [[pesticides]], [[Polymers|speciality polymers]], electronic chemicals, [[surfactants]], construction chemicals, Industrial Cleaners, [[flavours]] and [[fragrances]], speciality coatings, printing inks, water-soluble polymers, [[food additives]], [[paper chemicals]], oil field chemicals, plastic adhesives, [[adhesives]] and [[sealants]], [[Cosmetic ingredients|cosmetic chemicals]], [[Water treatment|water management chemicals]], [[catalysts]], textile chemicals. Chemical companies rarely supply these products directly to the consumer.

Inorganic chemicals tend to be the largest volume, though much smaller in dollar revenue terms due to their low prices. The top 11 of the 100 chemicals in 2000 were [[sulfuric acid]] (44 million tons), [[nitrogen]] (34), [[ethylene]] (28), [[oxygen]] (27), [[Lime (material)|lime]] (22), [[ammonia]] (17), [[propylene]] (16), [[polyethylene]] (15), [[chlorine]] (13), [[phosphoric acid]] (13) and [[diammonium phosphate]]s (12).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n-tTWNufb3wC&amp;pg=PA379&amp;lpg=PA379&amp;dq=The+top+11+of+the+100+chemicals+in+2000+were+sulfuric+acid+(44+million+tons),+nitrogen+(34),+ethylene+(28),+oxygen+(27),+lime+(22),+ammonia+(17),+propylene+(16),+polyethylene+(15),+chlorine+(13),+phosphoric+acid+(13)+and+diammonium+phosphates&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oghc5shn3D&amp;sig=D8nl9Hp1kPzKBtgFXCx7Rk5XXsY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjInJmS3P3YAhVp5IMKHdb7BW4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20top%2011%20of%20the%20100%20chemicals%20in%202000%20were%20sulfuric%20acid%20(44%20million%20tons),%20nitrogen%20(34),%20ethylene%20(28),%20oxygen%20(27),%20lime%20(22),%20ammonia%20(17),%20propylene%20(16),%20polyethylene%20(15),%20chlorine%20(13),%20phosphoric%20acid%20(13)%20and%20diammonium%20phosphates&amp;f=false|title=Chemistry|publisher=PediaPress|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Turbine generator systems1.png|thumb|This is a process diagram of a turbine generator. Engineers working to produce a sustainable process for use in the chemical industry need to know how to design a sustainable process in which the system can withstand or manipulate process-halting conditions such as heat, friction, pressure, emissions, and contaminants.]]

From the perspective of chemical engineers, the chemical industry involves the use of [[chemical process]]es such as [[chemical reaction]]s and [[refining]] methods to produce a wide variety of solid, liquid, and gaseous materials.  Most of these products serve to [[Manufacturing|manufacture]] other items, although a smaller number go directly to consumers.  [[Solvent]]s, [[pesticide]]s, [[lye]], [[sodium carbonate|washing soda]], and [[portland cement]] provide a few examples of product used by consumers.

The industry includes manufacturers of [[inorganic]]- and [[Organic chemistry|organic]]-industrial chemicals, ceramic products, petrochemicals, agrochemicals,  polymers and rubber (elastomers), oleochemicals (oils, fats, and waxes), explosives, fragrances and flavors.  Examples of these products are shown in the Table below.

Although the [[pharmaceutical]] industry is often considered{{Who|date=November 2010}} a '''chemical industry ''', it has many different characteristics that puts it in a separate category.  Other closely related industries include [[petroleum]], [[glass]], [[paint]], [[ink]], [[sealant]], [[adhesive]], and [[food processing]] manufacturers.

Chemical processes such as chemical reactions operate in [[chemical plant]]s to form new substances in various types of reaction vessels.  In many cases the reactions take place in special corrosion-resistant equipment at elevated temperatures and pressures with the use of [[catalyst]]s. The products of these reactions are separated using a variety of techniques including [[distillation]] especially [[fractional distillation]], [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], [[crystallization]], [[adsorption]], [[filtration]], [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]], and [[drying]].

The processes and product or products are usually tested during and after manufacture by dedicated instruments and on-site [[quality control]] [[Laboratory|laboratories]] to ensure safe operation and to assure that the product will meet required [[specification]]s. More organizations within the industry are implementing chemical compliance software to maintain quality products and [[manufacturing]] standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemical and Agrochemical Enterprise Quality Management Software|url=http://www.spartasystems.com/industries/other-industries/chemical-and-agrochemical/|publisher=Sparta Systems, Inc.|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The products are packaged and delivered by many methods, including pipelines, tank-cars, and tank-trucks (for both solids and liquids), cylinders, drums, bottles, and boxes.  Chemical companies often have a [[research-and-development]] laboratory for developing and testing products and processes.  These facilities may include pilot plants, and such research facilities may be located at a site separate from the production plant(s).

==World Chemical Production ==
[[File:Colonne distillazione.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Distillation columns]]
The scale of chemical manufacturing tends to be organized from largest in volume ([[petrochemical]]s and [[commodity chemicals]]), to [[specialty chemicals]], and the smallest, [[fine chemicals]].

The petrochemical and commodity chemical manufacturing units are on the whole single product continuous processing plants. Not all petrochemical or commodity chemical materials are made in one single location, but groups of related materials often are to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material, energy and utility efficiency and other economies of scale.

Those chemicals made on the largest of scales are made in a few manufacturing locations around the world, for example in [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]] along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] of the [[United States]], on [[Teesside]] in the [[Northeast of England]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and in [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]]. The large scale manufacturing locations often have clusters of manufacturing units that share utilities and large scale infrastructure such as [[power stations]], [[Port|port facilities]], road and rail terminals. To demonstrate the clustering and integration mentioned above, some 50% of the United Kingdom's petrochemical and commodity chemicals are produced by the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] on [[Teesside]].
 
Specialty chemical and fine chemical manufacturing are mostly made in discrete batch processes. These manufacturers are often found in similar locations but in many cases they are to be found in multi sector business parks.

===Continents and Countries===
In the U.S. there are 170 major chemical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6trCF6poRSQC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=In+the+U.S.+there+are+170+major+chemical+companies.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLyrPv3P3YAhUC7YMKHX3eD3IQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=In%20the%20U.S.%20there%20are%20170%20major%20chemical%20companies.&amp;f=false|title=CHEMISTRY IN DAILY LIFE|last=SINGH|first=KIRPAL|date=2012-07-07|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120346178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;They operate internationally with more than 2,800 facilities outside the U.S. and 1,700 foreign subsidiaries or affiliates operating. The U.S. chemical output is $750 billion a year.  The U.S. industry records large trade surpluses and employs more than a million people in the United States alone. The chemical industry is also the second largest consumer of energy in manufacturing and spends over $5 billion annually on pollution abatement.

In Europe the chemical, plastics and rubber sectors are among the largest industrial sectors.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Together they generate about 3.2 million jobs in more than 60,000 companies. Since 2000 the chemical sector alone has represented 2/3 of the entire manufacturing trade surplus of the EU.

in 2012 The chemical sector accounted for 12% of the EU manufacturing industry's added value. Europe remains world’s biggest chemical trading region with 43% of the world’s exports and 37%of the world’s imports, although the latest data shows that Asia is catching up with 34% of the exports and 37% of imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, Europe still has a trading surplus with all regions of the world except Japan and China where in 2011 there was a chemical trade balance. Europe’s trade surplus with the rest of the world today amounts to 41.7 billion Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stan|last=Higgins|publisher=Chemical News|title=European Chemicals Industry:A review|url=http://www.nepic.co.uk/WebformFolder/IndiaChemicalNews_Issue3.pdf|date=April 2013|pages=18–20|access-date=2013-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723230317/http://www.nepic.co.uk/WebformFolder/IndiaChemicalNews_Issue3.pdf#|archive-date=2015-07-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the 20 years between 1991 and 2011 the European Chemical industry saw its sales increase 295 billion Euros to 539 billion Euros a picture of constant growth. Despite this the European industry’s share of the world chemical market has fallen from 36% to 20%. This has resulted from the huge increase production and sales in the emerging markets like India and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data suggest that 95% of this impact is from China alone. In 2012 the data from the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC)shows that 5 European countries account for 71% of the EU's chemicals sales. These are Germany, France, United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|publisher=CEFIC|title=Facts and Figures 2012:The European chemicals industry in a worldwide perspective|url=http://www.cefic.org/Documents/FactsAndFigures/2012/Facts-and-Figures-2012-The-Brochure.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2013|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemical industry has shown rapid growth for more than fifty years.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The fastest-growing areas have involved the manufacture of synthetic [[organic polymer]]s used as [[plastics]], [[fibres]] and [[elastomers]]. Historically and presently the chemical industry has been concentrated in three areas of the world, Western Europe, North America and Japan (the Triad). The European Community remains the largest producer area followed by the US and Japan.

The traditional dominance of chemical production by the Triad countries is being challenged by changes in feedstock availability and price, labour cost, energy cost, differential rates of economic growth and environmental pressures. Instrumental in the changing structure of the global chemical industry has been the growth in China, India, Korea, the Middle East, South East Asia, Nigeria, and Brazil.

Just as companies emerge as the main producers of the chemical industry, we can also look on a more global scale to how industrialized countries rank, with regards to the billions of dollars worth of production a country or region could export.  Though the business of chemistry is worldwide in scope, the bulk of the world’s $3.7 trillion chemical output is accounted for by only a handful of industrialized nations. The United States alone produced $689 billion, 18.6 percent of the total world chemical output in 2008.&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanchemistry.com/s_acc/sec_directory.asp?CID=292&amp;DID=747|title=Global Business of Chemistry|publisher=|accessdate=26 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019103305/http://americanchemistry.com/s_acc/sec_directory.asp?CID=292&amp;DID=747#|archive-date=2010-10-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Chemonics was founded in 1975 by Thurston F. (Tony) Teele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20168-2005Apr1.html |title=Obituaries |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=2005-04-02 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Chemonics has been subject to criticism from the [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID) [[Office of Inspector General, U.S. Agency for International Development|Office of Inspector General]] (OIG) for their work on several multimillion-dollar aid contracts.

In 2012 Chemonics came under scrutiny by the OIG for their work in Haiti after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]]. Chemonics was the largest single recipient of post-earthquake funds from USAID, receiving over $196 million in contracts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/haiti-aid-accountability-2013-04.pdf|title = Breaking Open the Black Box|date = April 2013|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = Center for Economic and Policy Research|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which were "no-bid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cleveland.com/world/index.ssf/2010/12/outsourcing_quake_assistance_h.html|title = Outsourcing quake assistance: Haitian contractors get only 1.6% of U.S. aid|last = Mendoza|first = Martha|date = 2010-12-12|work = |access-date = 2015-04-25|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audits specifically cited Chemonics lack of a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan and that "some of the performance indicators Chemonics developed were not well-defined."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/1-521-12-009-p.pdf|title = Audit of USAID's Haiti Recovery Initiative Activities Managed By Office of Transition Initiatives|date = 2012-09-26|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = US Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemonics also spent more than 75 percent of program budgets on material and equipment when an expenditure of only 30 percent was planned.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/1-521-10-009-p.pdf|title = Audit of USAID's Cash-for-Work Activities in Haiti|date = 2010-09-24|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = US Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Inspector General's report also found that local communities were not sufficiently involved with Chemonics' work and stated "Chemonics used contractors from [[Port-au-Prince]] to implement a number of activities in [[Cap-Haitien]] and [[Saint-Marc]]; these contractors brought their own people to do the jobs instead of hiring locals."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When locals were required by USAID, Chemonics' policies "limited the transparency of the selection process and increase the risk of corruption or favoritism by granting decision-making authority to a few individuals."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In November 2006, USAID Afghanistan awarded a $62 million contract to Chemonics, with an expected end date of March 2010. A 2008 audit of the contract by OIG found that Chemonics' "results fell considerably short of intended results" and "buildings constructed by Chemonics’ subcontractors were not acceptable because of significant construction defects."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/audit-reports/5-306-08-009-p.pdf|title = Audit of USAID/Afghanistan's Accelerating Sustainable Agriculture Program|date = 2008-08-08|accessdate = 2015-04-25|website = |publisher = US Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, A Department of Labor investigation into Chemonics’ hiring practices found that the group discriminated against applicants based on race while trying to fill entry-level positions. According to the Guardian, none of the 124 Black Americans who applied for the jobs in Chemonics International’s regional business units were hired. Chemonics agreed to pay $482,243 to job applicants who were subjected to racial discrimination in the company’s hiring process, the Guardian reported.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/nov/21/top-us-government-aid-partner-to-pay-500k-damages-to-african-american-job-applicants?CMP=twt_gu&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chief content officer''' ('''CCO''') is a corporate executive responsible for the digital media creation and multi-channel publication of the organization's content (text, video, audio, animation, etc.).

The CCO is usually an [[executive (management)|executive]] role or [[senior vice president]] position, typically reporting to the [[chief executive officer]] or the [[president (corporate title)|president]] of the organization.

In a [[broadcasting]] [[organisation]], the CCO is generally the highest ranking creative member of the organization. However, the chief content officer position is also common in many other industries, ranging from insurance to video production based on a [[LinkedIn]] study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert|title=Chief Content Officers|url=http://www.pdxseo.net/chief-content-officers-portland-media-marketing-masters/|publisher=PDX SEO|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
Like all other chief officers, the chief content officer is responsible for supervision, coordination, planning and operation in his or her own field of responsibility.&lt;ref name="ContentMarketingInstitute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2011/05/chief-content-officer-job-description-sample-example-tempate/ |title=The Job Description of Chief Executive Officer, Sample Template |work=contentmarketinginstitute.com |accessdate=2015-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCO may also lead a company's [[Brand|branding]] and [[marketing]] efforts (as it relates to content), if these areas are not overseen by a [[chief marketing officer]]. In certain businesses which are involved in media creation such as [[Netflix]], a CCO is responsible for developing original [[Television program|programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richardson|first1=Ben|title=The Rise Of The Chief Content Officer|url=http://www.acuitytraining.co.uk/news-tips/rise-chief-content-officer/|website=Acuity Training|accessdate=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5283">'''Contract management software''' is the range of computer programmes, libraries and data used to support [[contract management]], [[contract lifecycle management]], and [[contractor management]] on projects. It may be used with [[project management software]].

==Advantages and key functions==
Most sophisticated projects involving contractors now use contract management software instead of relying on the manual management of paper contracts. It has become an essential tool for keeping track of multiple activities with cost implications, and can be especially helpful for automating administration, ensuring compliance, monitoring risk, running reports and triggering alerts.&lt;ref name="techtarget.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchfinancialapplications.techtarget.com/definition/contract-management-software|title=What is contract management software? - Definition from WhatIs.com|website=SearchFinancialApplications.techtarget.com|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these types of features, contract management software systems provide a centralized repository for employees to quickly access all contracts worldwide in one place. Having contracts stored in multiple locations can delay and interrupt the contracting process.

Contract management software is produced by many companies, working on a range of scales and offering varying degrees of customizability. Basic functions should include the ability to store contract documents, track changes to contract documents, search documents for a particular criterion, send key date alerts and to report required aspects of the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2489199,00.asp|title=The Best Contract Management Software of 2015|website=PCMAG.com|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other functions include managing a new contract request, capturing related data, following a document through a review and approval process, and collecting [[digital signature]]s.&lt;ref name="techtarget.com"/&gt;

Contract management software may also be an aid to [[project portfolio management]] and [[spend analysis]], and may also monitor [[Key performance indicator|KPIs]].&lt;ref name="8over8.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.8over8.com/hubfs/WhitePapers/8over8-Whitepaper-Contract-Management-Capital-Expenditure_2016.pdf |format=PDF |title=8over8 : White Paper : Contract management for capital expenditure |website=Info.8over8.com |accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leading contract management software provides contract visibility, monitoring, and compliance to automate and streamline the [[Contract lifecycle management|contract lifecycle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cobblestonesoftware.com/hubfs/TOFU%20Offer%20-%208%20Critical%20Stages%20of%20Contract%20Management/8%20Critical%20Stages%20of%20Contract%20Management%20-%20CobbleStone%20Software-1.pdf|title=Whitepaper: 8 Critical Stages of Contract Management|last=|first=|date=|website=www.CobbleStoneSoftware.com|publisher=CobbleStone Software|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; process.

A centralized repository provides a critical advantage allowing for all contract documents to be stored and within one location. Having contracts stored in multiple locations can delay and interrupt the contracting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3099169/it-industry/how-to-stop-making-costly-it-contract-mistakes.html|title=How to stop  making costly IT contract mistakes|first=Sarah K.|last=White|website=Cio.com|accessdate=2016-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contract risk management software (CRMS) for capital projects==
Very large enterprises, such as [[capital expenditure]] (capex) projects, involve multiple parties and high risk and uncertainty. They are unlike traditional operating contracts in that they are subject to shared deadlines in unique situations. As the complexity of these unique projects increases, the relationships between parties become more important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apmg-international.com/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=8156&amp;sID=12573 |title=IACCM White Paper: The Basics of Contract and Commercial Management |website=Apmg-international.com |accessdate=2016-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112040244/http://www.apmg-international.com/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=8156&amp;sID=12573 |archivedate=2017-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires contract management software, or contract risk management software (CRMS), to become more dynamic and responsive.

The terms of these capex contracts necessarily involve assumptions at the start of the process, and are likely to change over the lifetime of the [[Project management|project lifecycle]]. For this reason, CRMS must be capable of recording one single instance of agreed changes to contract terms, and incorporating these changes in an auditable and legally robust way. With multiple decision makers involved, CRMS should also make accountability more transparent and enable faster decisions about variation proposals.&lt;ref name="8over8.com"/&gt;

'''Delivery''' is the process of transporting goods from a source location to a predefined destination. There are different delivery types. [[Cargo]] (physical goods) are primarily delivered via [[roads]] and [[Rail transport|railroads]] on land, shipping lanes on the sea and [[airline]] networks in the air. Certain specialized goods may be delivered via other networks, such as [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] for liquid goods, [[power grids]] for electrical power and [[computer networks]] such as the [[Internet]] or [[broadcasting|broadcast]] networks for electronic information.&lt;ref name="Nishio Kishino 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last=Nishio | first=S. | last2=Kishino | first2=F. | title=Advanced Multimedia Content Processing: First International Conference, AMCP'98, Osaka, Japan, November 9-11, 1998, Proceedings | publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg | series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science | year=2003 | isbn=978-3-540-48962-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dQdrCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196 | page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general process of delivering goods is known as [[distribution (business)|distribution]]. The study of effective processes for delivery and disposition of goods and personnel is called [[logistics]]. Firms that specialize in delivering commercial goods from point of production or storage to [[point of sale]] are generally known as distributors, while those that specialize in the delivery of goods to the consumer are known as [[Package delivery|delivery services]]. [[Mail|Postal]], [[courier]], and [[relocation services]] also deliver goods for commercial and private interests.

==Consumer goods delivery==
[[File:Dairy Crest Milk Float Garage 2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Dairy Crest]] [[Smith Electric Vehicles|Smiths]] Elizabethan electric [[Milk float]] used to deliver fresh milk to people's doorsteps.]]
Most consumer goods are delivered from a point of production ([[factory]] or [[farm]]) through one or more points of storage ([[warehouse]]s) to a point of sale ([[retail store]]), where the consumer buys the good and is responsible for its transportation to point of consumption. There are many variations on this model for specific types of goods and modes of sale. Products sold via catalogue or the Internet may be delivered directly from the manufacturer or warehouse to the consumer's home, or to an [[Packstation|automated delivery booth]]. Small manufacturers may deliver their products directly to retail stores without warehousing.

Some manufacturers maintain [[factory outlet]]s which serve as both warehouse and retail store, selling products directly to consumers at wholesale prices (although many retail stores falsely advertise as factory outlets). Building, construction, landscaping and like materials are generally delivered to the consumer by a contractor as part of another service. Some highly perishable or hazardous goods, such as [[radioisotopes]] used in [[medical imaging]], are delivered directly from manufacturer to consumer.

Home delivery is often available for [[fast food]] and other convenience products, e.g. [[pizza delivery]].&lt;ref name="Haig 2006"&gt;{{cite book | last=Haig | first=M. | title=Brand Royalty: How the World's Top 100 Brands Thrive &amp; Survive | publisher=Kogan Page | series=Kogan Page Series | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7494-4826-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f4AJ0AU58a4C&amp;pg=PA277 | page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes home delivery of [[supermarket]] goods is possible.&lt;ref name="Hill Jones Schilling 2014"&gt;{{cite book | last=Hill | first=C.W.L. | last2=Jones | first2=G.R. | last3=Schilling | first3=M.A. | title=Strategic Management: Theory &amp; Cases: An Integrated Approach | publisher=Cengage Learning | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-305-14272-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d0PAAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SL3-PA59 | page=3-PA59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A milk float is a small [[battery electric vehicle]] (BEV), specifically designed for the delivery of fresh [[milk]]. A new form of delivery is emerging on the horizon of the internet age: Delivery by the crowd e.g. crowd delivery. In this concept an individual not necessarily contracted by the vendor performs the delivery of goods to the destination. Sometimes, private [[courier]] companies will also deliver [[consumer goods]] on a regular basis for companies like [[E-commerce]] businesses.

==Delivery vehicles==
{{See also|Autonomous car}}

[[File:Commercial. Elmhurst Dairy BAnQ P48S1P07599.jpg|thumb|A horse-drawn dairy delivery vehicle in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada in 1942]]
The consumer demand for Supermarkets to deliver to their door created the need for a mixed temperature controlled vehicle on 3.5T chassis. These vehicle bodies were initially built with the traditional GRP sandwich panels but as more damage resistant lightweight materials with better insulation properties have become available companies have been developing Advanced Home Delivery Vehicles. The 2012 Commercial Vehicle Show in the UK saw the new JDC PolyBilt design, one of the latest of these "Plastic" bodies that can also be recycled at the end of its service life unlike the traditional GRP which ends up as landfill.

Vehicles are often specialized to deliver different types of goods. On land, [[semi-trailer]]s are outfitted with various [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] such as box trailers, flatbeds, car carriers, tanks and other specialized trailers, while [[railroad]] [[trains]] include similarly specialized cars. [[Armored car (valuables)|Armored cars]], [[dump truck]]s and [[concrete mixer]]s are examples of vehicles specialized for delivery of specific types of goods. On the sea, [[merchant ships]] come in various forms, such as [[cargo ship]]s, [[oil tankers]] and [[fishing boat]]s. [[Freight aircraft]] are used to deliver cargo.

Often, [[passenger]] vehicles are used for delivery of goods. These include [[buses]], [[van]]s, [[Pickup truck|pick-ups]], [[Automobile|cars]] (e.g., for mail or pizza delivery), [[motorcycles]] and [[bicycles]] (e.g., for newspaper delivery). A significant amount of freight is carried in the cargo holds of passenger ships and aircraft. Everyday travelers, known as a [[casual courier]], can also be used to deliver goods.

Delivery to remote, primitive or inhospitable areas may be accomplished using [[general aviation|small aircraft]], [[snowmobiles]], [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s, [[dog sled]]s, [[pack animal]]s, on foot, or by a variety of other transport methods.

==Periodic deliveries==
Some products are delivered to consumers on a periodic schedule.&lt;ref name="Golden Raghavan Wasil 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last=Golden | first=B.L. | last2=Raghavan | first2=S. | last3=Wasil | first3=E.A. | title=The Vehicle Routing Problem: Latest Advances and New Challenges | publisher=Springer US | series=Operations Research/Computer Science Interfaces Series | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-387-77778-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-3ta5ne3-owC&amp;pg=PA93 | page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, home delivery of many goods was much more common in urban centres of the developed world. At the beginning of the 20th century, perishable farm items such as milk, eggs and ice, were delivered weekly or even daily to customers by local farms. [[Milkmen]] delivered milk and other farm produce. With the advent of home refrigeration and better distribution methods, these products are today largely delivered through the same retail distribution systems as other food products. [[Iceman (occupation)|Icemen]] delivered ice for [[iceboxes]] until the popularization of home refrigerator rendered them obsolete in most places. Similarly, laundry was once picked up and washed at a commercial [[laundry]] before being delivered to middle-class homes until the appearance of the [[washing machine]] and [[Clothes dryer|dryer]] (the lower classes washed their own and the upper classes had live-in servants). Likewise deliveries of coal and wood for home heating were more common until they were replaced in many areas by [[natural gas]], oil, or electric heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view_rew?CONTENT_ID=2786|title=The days of door-to-door delivery|date=11 March 2010|last=Herzog|first=Lawrence|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308202349/http://www.rewedmonton.ca/content_view_rew?CONTENT_ID=2786|archive-date=8 March 2012|work=Edmonton Real Estate Weekly: It's Our Heritage|volume=28|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some products, most notably [[home heating oil]], are still delivered periodically. Human blood may be delivered to hospitals on a periodic schedule.&lt;ref name="Golden Raghavan Wasil 2008"/&gt;

Milk delivery continued until the mid-twentieth century across North America. For example, the last milk delivery by horse-and-wagon in [[Edmonton]] was in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epl.ca/infofile-detail?subject_detail=Milk%20Delivery%20-%20Edmonton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829062550/http://www.epl.ca/infofile-detail?subject_detail=Milk%20Delivery%20-%20Edmonton|archive-date=29 August 2012|title=Infofile Detail - Milk Delivery - Edmonton| publisher=Edmonton Public Library}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milkman joke]]s continue in circulation long after. Related lines of [[Jeannie C. Riley]]'s 1968 hit song "[[Harper Valley PTA]]" say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''There's old Bobby Taylor sitting there, and seven times he's asked me for a date,&lt;br /&gt;And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Economic History Association''' ('''EHA''') was founded in 1940 to "encourage and promote teaching, research, and publication on every phase of [[economic history]] and to help preserve and administer materials for research in economic history". It publishes ''[[The Journal of Economic History]]'' with  the [[Cambridge University Press]], holds an annual meeting that usually takes place in September, and awards prizes and grants.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Publisher Description: Economic History Association|url=https://www.jstor.org/publisher/eha|website=[[JSTOR]]|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also the home to the ''EH.Net Encyclopedia of Economic and Business History''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Encyclopedia |url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia-2/ |work=EH.Net Encyclopedia of Economic and Business History |access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
There are more than 1,000 EHA members worldwide,&lt;ref name="jstor"/&gt; and composed of faculty and graduate students from universities around the world, as well as economists in the private sector and in government.

Michael Haupert of the [[University of Wisconsin-La Crosse]] is the Executive Director, and [[Cormac Ó Gráda]] is the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Economic History Association|url=https://eh.net/eha/about/|website=Economic History Association|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous EHA Presidents include Oxford's [[Robert C. Allen]], Vanderbilt's [[Jeremy Atack]], UC Berkeley's [[Barry Eichengreen]], Yale's [[Naomi Lamoreaux]], as well as [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Economics Nobel Laureates]] [[Robert Fogel]] and [[Douglass North]].

== Prizes and grants ==
The Economic History Association supports research through [[Arthur H. Cole]] grants-in-aid and awards prizes for publications, dissertations, and teaching, as well as fellowships and grants for students of economic history.

It awards several prizes for publications:&lt;ref name="prizes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prizes|url=http://eh.net/eha/prizes/|website=Economic History Association|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arthur Cole Prize: best article published in ''[[The Journal of Economic History]]'' each year

The society also provides grants to support the early stages of dissertation work in economic history and fellowships to support students finishing their dissertations on the topic. Two [[Kenneth Sokoloff]] fellowships are awarded by the EHA each year to students finishing their dissertations in economic history.

== Annual conferences ==
For many years EHA has partnered with the [[American Economic Association]] to arrange sessions at the annual [[Allied Social Sciences Association|ASSA]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eh.net/content/call-papers-eha-sessions-2014-assa Call for papers for EHA sessions at 2014 ASSA]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2018 annual EHA meeting will take place in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]], in September 2018; its theme is "‘From Plague, Famine, and War, Save us, O Lord’ Shocks and Disasters in Economic History".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date = 25 October 2017 |title=Economic History Association 2018 Annual Meeting|url=http://eh.net/eha/economic-history-association-2018-annual-meeting/|website=Economic History Association|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1349">In a [[service-oriented architecture]] business software implementation, the '''enterprise service layer''' ('''ESL''') is the highest level of abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Service Availability: Second International Service Availability Symposium ...b Miroslaw Malek, E. Nett, Neeraj Suri, page 103&lt;/ref&gt;

Any [[application programming interface]] (API) defined at the ESL can cross domain boundaries; it calls directly the [[fomain dervice layer]], which in turn interacts with the [[application service layer]] or the [[RDBMS Service Layer]].  Therefore, any API which must access multiple domains to execute correctly must exist at the enterprise level.&lt;ref&gt;The Definitive Guide to SOA: BEA AquaLogic Service Bus, by Jeff Davies, Ashish. Krishna, David. Schorow, page 214&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ESL is the API of the entire enterprise, all the components in the enterprise can call it directly, and it can sometimes be accessed from outside the service-providing entity.&lt;ref&gt;Service Availability: Second International Service Availability Symposium ...b Miroslaw Malek, E. Nett, Neeraj Suri, page 103&lt;/ref&gt;

ESL exposes a number of API considerably lower than the [[Application Service Layer|ASL]] because it works at a higher level of abstraction than the ASL.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9605">An '''environmental profit and loss account''' ('''E P&amp;L''') is a company's monetary valuation and analysis of its [[environmental impact]]s including its [[business operations]] and its [[supply chain]] from [[Life-cycle assessment#Cradle-to-gate|cradle-to-gate]].
An E P&amp;L internalizes externalities and monetizes the cost of business to nature by accounting for the [[ecosystem services]] a business depends on to operate in addition to the cost of direct and indirect negative impacts on the environment.  The primary purpose of an E P&amp;L is to allow managers and stakeholders to see the magnitude of these impacts and where in the supply chain they occur.

The E P&amp;L analysis provides a metric to measure and monitor the footprint of the company's operations and suppliers all the way to the initial raw materials.  It is a tool to build awareness of the importance of nature to the sustainability of businesses; enhance visibility across a company's supply chain and deepen understanding to focus sustainability efforts and implement better-informed operational decisions; improve specificity for risk management regarding environmental dependencies and impacts; and support a more [[holistic view]] of a company's performance, while bringing clarity and transparency to stakeholders at all levels and identifying new opportunities to enhance the sustainability of a company's products.

== Background ==
Conceived by PUMA Chairman, [[Jochen Zeitz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/11/18/puma-jochen-zeitz-environment-footprint_n_1101126.html|title=Puma Reveals Its £124m Ecological Footprint|date=19 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched by Sportlifestyle company PUMA and its parent company's sustainability initiative (PPR HOME), the first-ever&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/puma-value-environmental-impact-biodiversity|title=Puma world's first major company to put a value on its environmental impact|first=Jo|last=Confino|date=16 May 2011|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; E P&amp;L was conducted on 2010 data and released in two phases. In May 2011 the valuation of PUMA's 2010 [[Greenhouse Gas]] Emissions (GHG) and water usage was announced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13410397|title=Puma reveals environmental impact|first=Richard|last=Anderson|date=16 May 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed in November 2011, by PUMA's overall E P&amp;L,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15756080|title=Puma costs environmental impact|date=16 November 2011|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also included valuation results for other forms of [[air pollution]], [[land conversion]] and waste.

Simultaneously, the PPR Group announced in November 2011 that a Group E P&amp;L would be implemented across its Luxury and Sport &amp; Lifestyle brands by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2011/11/18/gucci-ysl-follow-puma-revealing-environmental-impact-costs|title=Gucci, YSL to Follow Puma in Revealing Environmental Impact Costs|first=Leslie|last=Guevarra|date=18 November 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==
The E P&amp;L and the associated methodology were developed with the support of [[PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP]] and [[Trucost]] PLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.just-style.com/analysis/supply-chain-weighs-on-pumas-first-green-accounts_id111097.aspx|title=Supply chain weighs on Puma's first green accounts|date=17 May 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The E P&amp;L used existing input-output models and developed new valuation methodologies, building on a large volume of work in the fields of environmental and natural resource economics such as [[TEEB]], the UN study on [[The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity]]. 

Kering, the parent company for Puma, has released its Environmental Profit and Loss Accounting methodology in an open source mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/37967-Kering-Open-Sources-Environmental-Profit-and-Loss-Account-Methodology-to-Catalyse-Corporate-Natural-Capital-Accounting|accessdate=13 August 2016|title=Kering Open-Sources Environmental Profit and Loss Account Methodology to Catalyse Corporate Natural Capital Accounting|date=May 19, 2015|author=Kering|via=CSRWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kering.com/sites/default/files/document/kering_epandl_methodology_and_group_results.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2016|title=Kering Environmental Profit &amp; Loss}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novo Nordisk]] is another company that has released its environmental profit and loss account&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2014/02/978-87-93178-02-1.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2016|title=Novo Nordisk’s environmental profit and loss account|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and methodology report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2014/02/978-87-93178-03-8.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2016|title=Methodology report for Novo Nordisk’s environmental profit and loss account|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 annual report of Philips mentioned that the company had an environmental impact of Euro 7.2 billion for that year. This assessment was made through an Environmental Profit and Loss Accounting process. The company mentioned that this monetary value has not considered various practices that has environmental impacts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.philips.com/c-dam/corporate/about-philips/sustainability/downloads/ecovision-methodologies/EPL-Account-methodology-2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engagement ==
The UK government used the PUMA E P&amp;L as a case study for sustainable business in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affair ([[DEFRA]]) Natural Environment White Paper in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalofaccountancy.com/Web/20114243.htm|title=U.K. Government White Paper Calls for Tracking Green Losses, Gains|date=22 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, [[Pavan Sukhdev]] who was the Study Leader of TEEB and the Special Advisor and Head of UNEP's Green Economy Initiative, referred to the PUMA E P&amp;L in his TED presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/pavan_sukhdev_what_s_the_price_of_nature.html|title=Put a value on nature!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sustainability authority, [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]] includes the PUMA E P&amp;L in his "The Future Quotient: 50 Stars in Seriously Long-Term Innovation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111042028/http://www.thecro.com/content/future-quotient|title=The Future Quotient|work=CR Magazine|archivedate=11 January 2012|publisher=|url=http://www.thecro.com/content/future-quotient|author=John Elkington|author2=Charmian Love|author3=Alastair Morton}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the October issue of ''[[The Harvard Business Review]]'' the PUMA E P&amp;L is included in "The Sustainable Economy" by [[Yvon Chouinard]], Jib Ellison, and Rick Ridgeway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peoplesgrocery.org/fmd/files/Sustainable%20Economy%20HBR%20Oct%202011.pdf | title=The Sustainable Economy | work=The Harvard Business Review | date=October 2011 | author1=Yvon Chouinard|author2=Jib Ellison|author3=Rick Ridgeway | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111112041748/http://www.peoplesgrocery.org/fmd/files/Sustainable%20Economy%20HBR%20Oct%202011.pdf | archivedate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Winter 2012 issue, the ''[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]'' published "Connecting Heart to Head" by Ram Nidumolu, [[Kevin Kramer]], &amp; Jochen Zeitz. The PUMA E P&amp;L is included as a business case study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/connecting_heart_to_head|title=Connecting Heart to Head (SSIR)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, Jochen Zeitz spoke at His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales' Accounting For Sustainability Forum about the PUMA E P &amp;L.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPFVIv-32G8|title=Jochen Zeitz, CEO Sport and Lifestyle Group, CSO of PPR and Chairman of the Board of PUMA|first=|last=ThePrincesA4S|date=21 December 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puma's EP&amp;L accounting process has influenced other companies attempting natural capital accounting &lt;ref&gt;https://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/connecting-finance-and-natural-capital-case-study-for-eftec-natural-capital-statements/&lt;/ref&gt;. A smartphone app has been made available, free of cost, to help students of design and fashion, to understand the environmental impacts&lt;ref&gt;https://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/kering-and-parsons-school-of-design-develop-free-epl-app-for-fashion-students/&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Critique ==
An assessment report indicated that preparing an EP&amp;L report can be expensive, while benefits being derived from the process is substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bsl-lausanne.ch/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AssesofPotLimitationsValuExFinal-Report.pdf | title=Assessment of potentials and limitations in valuation of externalities | date=2014 | isbn=978-87-93178-33-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; EP&amp;L Accounting has also been considered as a first step in the process of ensuring that prices reflect the use of environmental goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/ep_l.pdf | title=The Case for Environmental Profit and Loss Accounting | publisher=IUCN | author=Nathalie Olsen Head}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1871">'''Ethnic Business Awards''' is a [[business award]] held in [[Australia]] to recognize the achievement of migrant business owners. Held annually since 1988, they are Australia’s longest running business award on television. 

Founded in 1988 by [[Joseph Assaf]] AM, a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] born Australian who specializes in multicultural marketing and businesses, the awards' goal was to "recognise and reward the contributions of migrants to the [[Australian economy]]". The Awards have drawn significant attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/franchising/looksmart-alterations-abraham-hatoum-ethnic-business-award-2197.html |title=Refugee wins 2010 ethnic business award for Looksmart Alterations &amp;#124; Dynamic Business – Small Business Advice – Forums &amp;#124; Dynamic Business Australia |publisher=Dynamicbusiness.com.au |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/business/a/-/wa/8276646/wa-takes-two-of-three-ethnic-business-awards/ |title=WA takes two of three Ethnic Business Awards - The West Australian |publisher=Au.news.yahoo.com |date=2010-11-08 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a new category, Indigenous in Business was created, offering recognition for "the descendants of those [[Australian aboriginals|first Australians]] – the traditional owners of the land".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/business/a/-/wa/8263037/aboriginal-school-recognised-in-business-awards/ |title=Aboriginal school recognised in business awards - The West Australian |publisher=Au.news.yahoo.com |date=2010-11-05 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4184">'''Funnel analysis''' involves using a series of events that lead towards a defined goal, like from user engagement in a mobile app to a sale in an eCommerce platform or advertisement to purchase in online advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, B. J. and Schuster, S. (2011) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/jansen_buying_funnel_jecr.pdf Bidding on the Buying Funnel for Sponsored Search Campaigns]. Journal of Electronic Commerce Research. 12(1), 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The funnel analyses "are an effective way to calculate conversion rates on specific user behaviors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Apsalar|title=Using Funnel Analysis to Measure User Conversion Rates|url=http://apsalar.com/blog/2013/01/using-funnel-analysis-to-measure-user-conversion-rates/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This can be in the form of a sale, registration, or other intended action from an audience. The origin of the term funnel analysis comes from the nature of a [[funnel]] where individuals will enter the funnel, yet only a small number of them will perform the intended goals.

For more emphasis, it makes sense why a funnel in analytics is called a funnel. An actual funnel, like the ones from a kitchen or garage, gets narrower along its length, allowing less volume to pass through it. An analytics funnel represents a very similar idea, just in regards to users on an eCommerce platform, application or online game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CoolaData|title=Funnel Analysis|url=http://www.cooladata.com/documentation-posts-sub-categories/coolasql/coolasql-queries/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726000550/http://www.cooladata.com/documentation-posts-sub-categories/coolasql/coolasql-queries/|archivedate=2014-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real world applications==

An example of how a company would use funnel analytics is by focusing on drawing actionable insights from funnels. Funnel analysis can be used to determine conversion and user fallout rates in a given funnel. An analysis to determine the steps that lead to a desired goal in order to improve future interactions in the same funnel can be done for further success. To illustrate further, looking at how many users actually make it to the end of the funnel, for example to make a purchase or register, compared with how many do not.

By continuously monitoring and analyzing funnels, it is possible to assess if changes to an application or platform are having a positive effect on conversion. For instance, one might find that only 10% of users who come to a platform and enter the registration funnel actually reach the goal of completing registration. Using the funnel analytics process, it is then possible to tweak settings or features within the funnel in order to see what makes that number improve. Or when creating a marketing campaign, there is a chance to analyze how well the campaign is working by monitoring a funnel that brings users from the initial event all the way to purchasing a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CoolaData|title=Funnels|url=http://www.cooladata.com/blog/funnels/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funnel analysis helps determine the point in which users are dropping off. The next step is to understand why they’re dropping off, in order to reduce drop off rates and in turn increase overall conversion.

[[File:Millennium Development Goals, UN Headquarters, New York City, New York - 20080501.jpg|thumb|A poster at [[United Nations Headquarters]] showing [[Millennium Development Goals]]]]

A '''goal''' is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envisions, [[Planning|plans]] and commits to achieve.&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 1990"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Locke |first1=Edwin A. |authorlink1=Edwin A. Locke |last2=Latham |first2=Gary P. |date=1990 |title=A theory of goal setting &amp; task performance |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |isbn=978-0139131387 |oclc=20219875}}&lt;/ref&gt; People endeavor to reach goals within a finite time by setting [[Time limit|deadline]]s.

A goal is roughly similar to a [[purpose]] or aim, the anticipated result which guides reaction, or an [[Intrinsic value (ethics)#End|end]], which is an [[object (philosophy)|object]], either a [[physical object]] or an [[abstract object]], that has [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]].

==Goal setting==
{{Main|Goal setting}}

Goal-setting theory was formulated based on [[empirical research]] and has been called one of the most important theories in organizational psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miner, J. B.|first=|date=2003|title=The rated importance, scientific validity, and practical usefulness of organizational behavior theories: A quantitative review|url=|journal=AOM Learning and Education|volume=2|issue=3|pages=250–268|via=|doi=10.5465/amle.2003.10932132}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin A. Locke]] and Gary P. Latham, the fathers of goal-setting theory, provided a comprehensive review of the core findings of the theory in 2002.&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Locke |first1=Edwin A. |authorlink1=Edwin A. Locke |last2=Latham |first2=Gary P. |date=September 2002 |origyear=2002 |title=Building a practically useful theory of goal setting and task motivation: a 35-year odyssey |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |volume=57 |issue=9 |pages=705–717 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.57.9.705|citeseerx=10.1.1.126.9922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Locke and Latham found that specific, difficult goals lead to higher performance than either easy goals or instructions to "do your best", as long as [[feedback]] about progress is provided, the person is committed to the goal, and the person has the ability and knowledge to perform the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stajkovic |first1=Alexander D. |last2=Locke |first2=Edwin A. |authorlink2=Edwin A. Locke |last3=Blair |first3=Eden S. |date=September 2006 |title=A first examination of the relationships between primed subconscious goals, assigned conscious goals, and task performance |journal=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=91 |issue=5 |pages=1172–1180 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.5.1172 |pmid=16953778}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Locke and Latham, goals affect performance in the following ways:&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 2002" /&gt;
# goals direct attention and effort toward goal-relevant activities,
# difficult goals lead to greater effort,
# goals increase persistence, with difficult goals prolonging effort, and
# goals indirectly lead to [[arousal]], and to discovery and use of task-relevant knowledge and strategies.

A positive relationship between goals and performance depends on several factors. First, the goal must be considered important and the individual must be committed. Participative goal setting can help increase performance, but participation itself does not directly improve performance.&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 2002" /&gt; [[Self-efficacy]] also enhances goal commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stajkovic |first1=Alexander D. |last2=Luthans |first2=Fred |date=September 1998 |title=Self-efficacy and work-related performance: a meta-analysis |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=124 |issue=2 |pages=240–261 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.240}}&lt;/ref&gt; For goals to be effective, people need feedback that details their progress in relation to their goal.&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 2002" /&gt;

Some [[Coaching|coaches]] recommend establishing specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bounded ([[SMART criteria|SMART]]) objectives, but not all researchers agree that these [[SMART criteria]] are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grant |first=Anthony M |title=An integrated model of goal-focused coaching: an evidence-based framework for teaching and practice |date=September 2012 |journal=International Coaching Psychology Review |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=146–165 (147) |url=http://coachingconsultinginternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/An-integrated-model-of-goal-focused-coaching-Grant-ICPR-2012.pdf |quote=Whilst the ideas represented by the acronym SMART are indeed broadly supported by goal theory (e.g. Locke, 1996), and the acronym SMART may well be useful in some instances in coaching practice, I think that the widespread belief that goals are synonymous with SMART action plans has done much to stifle the development of a more sophisticated understanding and use of goal theory within in the coaching community, and this point has important implications for coaching research, teaching and practice. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129080651/http://coachingconsultinginternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/An-integrated-model-of-goal-focused-coaching-Grant-ICPR-2012.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMART framework does not include goal difficulty as a criterion; in the goal-setting theory of Locke and Latham, it is recommended to choose goals within the 90th percentile of difficulty, based on the average prior performance of those that have performed the task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Locke, E. A., Chah, D., Harrison, S. &amp; Lustgarten, N.|first=|date=1989|title=Separating the effects of goal specificity from goal level|url=|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=43|issue=2|pages=270–287|via=|doi=10.1016/0749-5978(89)90053-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Locke Latham 2002" /&gt;

Goals can be long-term, intermediate, or short-term. The primary difference is the time required to achieve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creek |first1=Jennifer |last2=Lougher |first2=Lesley |chapter=Goal setting |title=Occupational therapy and mental health |year=2008 |edition=4th |publisher=Churchill Livingstone Elsevier |location=Edinburgh; New York |isbn=9780443100277 |oclc=191890638 |pages=111–113 (112) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=4YnQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112 |quote=Client goals are usually set on two or three levels. Long-term goals are the overall goals of the intervention, the reasons why the client is being offered help and the expected outcome of intervention... Intermediate goals may be clusters of skills to be developed, attitudes to be changed or barriers to be overcome on the way to achieving the main goals... Short-term goals are the small steps on the way to achieving major goals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Short-term goals===
Short-term goals expect accomplishment in a short period of time, such as trying to get a bill paid in the next few days. The definition of a short-term goal need not relate to any specific length of time. In other words, one may achieve (or fail to achieve) a short-term goal in a day, week, month, year, etc. The time-frame for a short-term goal relates to its context in the overall time line that it is being applied to. For instance, one could measure a short-term goal for a month-long project in days; whereas one might measure a short-term goal for someone's lifetime in months or in years. Planners usually define short-term goals in relation to long-term goals.

==Personal goals==
Individuals can [[personal goal setting|set personal goals]]. A student may set a goal of a high mark in an exam. An athlete might run five miles a day. A traveler might try to reach a destination-city within three hours. Financial goals are a common example, to save for retirement or to save for a purchase.

Managing goals can give returns in all areas of [[personal life]]. Knowing precisely what one wants to achieve makes clear what to concentrate and improve on, and often subconsciously prioritizes that goal. However, successful goal adjustment (goal disengagement and goal re-engagement capacities) is also a part of leading a healthy life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wrosch|first=Carsten|last2=Scheier|first2=Michael F.|last3=Miller|first3=Gregory E.|date=2013-12-01|title=Goal Adjustment Capacities, Subjective Well-Being, and Physical Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4145404/|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=7|issue=12|pages=847–860|doi=10.1111/spc3.12074|issn=1751-9004|pmc=4145404|pmid=25177358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goal setting]] and planning ("goal work") promotes long-term [[Vision statement|vision]], intermediate [[Mission statement|mission]] and short-term [[motivation]]. It focuses intention, [[Desire (emotion)|desire]], acquisition of knowledge, and helps to organize resources.

Efficient goal work includes recognizing and resolving all [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], inner conflict or limiting [[belief]] that might cause one to sabotage one's efforts. By setting clearly defined goals, one can subsequently measure and take pride in the accomplishment of those goals. One can see progress in what might have seemed a long, perhaps difficult, grind.

===Achieving personal goals===
Achieving complex and difficult goals requires focus, long-term diligence and effort (see [[Goal pursuit]]). Success in any field requires forgoing excuses and justifications for poor performance or lack of adequate planning; in short, success requires emotional maturity. The measure of belief that people have in their ability to achieve a personal goal also affects that achievement.

Long-term achievements rely on short-term achievements. [[Emotion]]al control over the small moments of the single day makes a big difference in the long term.

===Personal goal achievement and happiness===
There has been a lot of research conducted looking at the link between achieving desired goals, changes to self-efficacy and integrity and ultimately changes to [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Emmons |first=Robert A |chapter=Striving and feeling: personal goals and subjective well-being |editor1-last=Gollwitzer |editor1-first=Peter M. |editor1-link=Peter Gollwitzer |editor2-last=Bargh |editor2-first=John A |editor2-link=John Bargh |title=The psychology of action: linking cognition and motivation to behavior |year=1996 |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |location=New York |pages=313–337 |isbn=978-1572300323 |oclc=33103979 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1LQVSI9hfMC&amp;pg=PA313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goal efficacy refers to how likely an individual is to succeed in achieving their goal. Goal integrity refers to how consistent one's goals are with core aspects of the self. Research has shown that a focus on goal efficacy is associated with well-being factor happiness (subjective well-being) and goal integrity is associated with the well-being factor [[meaning (psychology)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McGregor |first1=Ian |last2=Little |first2=Brian R |title=Personal projects, happiness, and meaning: on doing well and being yourself |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |date=February 1998 |volume=74 |issue=2 |pages=494–512 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.2.494 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13739275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple studies have shown the link between achieving long-term goals and changes in subjective well-being; most research shows that achieving goals that hold personal meaning to an individual increases feelings of subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brunstein |first=Joachim C |title=Personal goals and subjective well-being: a longitudinal study |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |date=November 1993 |volume=65 |issue=5 |pages=1061–1070 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.5.1061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=Andrew J |last2=Sheldon |first2=Kennon M |title=Avoidance personal goals and the personality–illness relationship |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |date=November 1998 |volume=75 |issue=5 |pages=1282–1299 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.5.1282|citeseerx=10.1.1.433.3924 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sheldon |first1=Kennon M |last2=Kasser |first2=Tim |title=Pursuing personal goals: skills enable progress but not all progress is beneficial |journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] |date=December 1998 |volume=24 |issue=12 |pages=1319–1331 |doi=10.1177/01461672982412006 |url=http://web.missouri.edu/~sheldonk/pdfarticles/PSPB98skills.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The self-concordance model is a model that looks at the sequence of steps that occur from the commencement of a goal to attaining that goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sheldon |first1= Ken M |last2= Eliott |first2= Andrew J |title= Goal striving, need satisfaction and longitudinal well-being: the self-concordance model |journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |date= March 1999 |volume= 76 |issue= 3 |pages= 482–497 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.76.3.482 |url= http://web.missouri.edu/~sheldonk/pdfarticles/JPSP99.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It looks at the likelihood and impact of goal achievement based on the type of goal and meaning of the goal to the individual.{{cn|date=February 2016}} Different types of goals impact both goal achievement and the sense of [[subjective well-being]] brought about by achieving the goal. The model breaks down factors that promote, first, striving to achieve a goal, then achieving a goal, and then the factors that connect goal achievement to changes in subjective well-being.

===Self-concordant goals===
Goals that are pursued to fulfill intrinsic values or to support an individual's self-concept are called self-concordant goals. Self-concordant goals fulfill basic needs and align with what [[psychoanalyst]] [[Donald Winnicott]] called an individual's "[[True Self]]". Because these goals have personal meaning to an individual and reflect an individual's self-identity, self-concordant goals are more likely to receive sustained effort over time. In contrast, goals that do not reflect an individual's internal drive and are pursued due to external factors (e.g. social pressures) emerge from a non-integrated region of a person and are therefore more likely to be abandoned when obstacles occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gollwitzer |first1= Peter M. |authorlink= Peter Gollwitzer |chapter= Action phases and mind-sets |editor1-last= Higgins |editor1-first= E Tory |editor2-last= Sorrentino |editor2-first= Richard M |title= Handbook of motivation and cognition: foundations of social behavior |year= 1990 |publisher= [[Guilford Press]] |location= New York |pages= 53–92 |volume= 2 |isbn= 978-0898624328 |oclc= 12837968 |chapterurl= http://www.psych.nyu.edu/gollwitzer/90Goll_ActionPhasesMindSets.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who attain self-concordant goals reap greater well-being benefits from their attainment. Attainment-to-well-being effects are mediated by need satisfaction, i.e., daily activity-based experiences of [[autonomy]], competence, and relatedness that accumulate during the period of striving. The model is shown to provide a satisfactory fit to 3 longitudinal data sets and to be independent of the effects of [[self-efficacy]], implementation intentions, avoidance framing, and [[life skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sheldon |first1= Kennon M |last2= Elliot |first2= Andrew J |title= Goal striving, need satisfaction, and longitudinal well-being: the self-concordance model |journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume= 76 |issue= 3 |date= March 1999 |pages= 482–497 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.76.3.482 |url= http://web.missouri.edu/~sheldonk/pdfarticles/JPSP99.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, [[self-determination theory]] and research surrounding this theory shows that if an individual effectively achieves a goal, but that goal is not self-endorsed or self-concordant, well-being levels do not change despite goal attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Ryan |first= Richard M |title= Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being |journal= [[American Psychologist]] |date= January 2000 |volume= 55 |issue= 1 |pages= 68–78 |doi= 10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.68 |url= http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/SDT/documents/2000_RyanDeci_SDT.pdf|citeseerx= 10.1.1.529.4370 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goal management in organizations==
In [[organization]]s, goal management consists of the process of recognizing or inferring goals of individual [[team]]-members, abandoning goals that are no longer relevant, identifying and resolving conflicts among goals, and prioritizing goals consistently for optimal team-collaboration and effective operations.

For any successful [[commerce|commercial]] [[system]], it means deriving [[Profit (economics)|profits]] by making the best quality of [[good (accounting)|goods]] or the best quality of [[Service (economics)|services]] available to end-users ([[customer]]s) at the best possible [[cost]].{{cn|date=May 2017}} Goal management includes:
* assessment and dissolution of non-rational blocks to success
* [[time management]]
* frequent reconsideration (consistency checks)
* [[Feasibility study| feasibility]] checks
* adjusting [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] and main-goal targets

[[Jens Rasmussen (human factors expert)]] and Morten Lind distinguish three fundamental categories of goals related to technological system management:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Rasmussen |first1= Jens |authorlink1= Jens Rasmussen (human factors expert) |last2= Lind |first2= Morten |chapter= A model of human decision making in complex systems and its use for design of system control strategies |title= Proceedings of the 1982 American Control Conference: Sheraton National Hotel, Arlington, Virginia, June 14–16, 1982 |publisher= [[American Automatic Control Council]] |date= 1982 |location= New York |oclc= 761373599 |chapterurl= http://www.risoe.dk/rispubl/reports_INIS/RISOM2349.pdf}} Cited in: {{cite book |last= Wrench |first= Jason S |year= 2013 |chapter= Communicating within the modern workplace: challenges and prospects |editor-last= Wrench |editor-first= Jason S |title= Workplace communication for the 21st century: tools and strategies that impact the bottom line |location= Santa Barbara, CA |publisher= [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]] |pages= 1–38 |isbn= 978-0313396311 |oclc= 773022358 |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=xtg672jRCfAC&amp;pg=PA4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizational goal-management aims for individual employee goals and objectives to align with the vision and strategic goals of the entire organization. Goal-management provides organizations with a mechanism{{which?|date=May 2017}} to effectively communicate corporate goals and strategic objectives to each person across the entire organization.{{cn|date=May 2017}} The key consists of having it all emanate from a pivotal source and providing each person with a clear, consistent organizational-goal message so that every employee understands how their efforts contribute to an enterprise's success.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

An example of goal types in [[business management]]:
* Consumer goals: this refers to supplying a product or service that the market/consumer wants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Osterwalder |first1= Alexander |author-link1= Alexander Osterwalder |last2= Pigneur |first2= Yves |author-link2= Yves Pigneur |last3= Clark |first3= Tim |title= Business model generation: a handbook for visionaries, game changers, and challengers |year= 2010 |location= Hoboken, NJ |publisher= [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn= 9780470876411 |oclc= 648031756 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L3TnC7ZAWAsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Product goals: this refers to supplying an outstanding [[value proposition]] compared to other products - perhaps due to factors such as quality, design, reliability and novelty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Barnes |first1= Cindy |last2= Blake |first2= Helen |last3= Pinder |first3= David |title= Creating &amp; delivering your value proposition: managing customer experience for profit |year= 2009 |location= London; Philadelphia |publisher= [[Kogan Page]] |isbn= 9780749455125 |oclc= 320800660 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8d73CPt_khwC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Operational goals: this refers to running the organization in such a way as to make the best use of [[management skills]], technology and resources
* Secondary goals: this refers to goals which an organization does not regard as priorities{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Goal displacement==
Goal displacement occurs when the original goals of an entity or organization are replaced over time by different goals. In some instances, this creates problems, because the new goals may exceed the capacity of the mechanisms put in place to meet the original goals. New goals adopted by an organization may also increasingly become focused on internal concerns, such as establishing and enforcing structures for reducing common employee disputes.&lt;ref name="Kirst-Ashman"&gt;Karen Kirst-Ashman, ''Human Behavior, Communities, Organizations, and Groups in the Macro Social Environment'' (2007), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the original goals of the organization become displaced in part by repeating behaviors that become traditional within the organization. For example, a company that manufactures widgets may decide to do seek good publicity by putting on a fundraising drive for a popular charity, or having a tent at a local county fair. If the fundraising drive or county fair tent is successful, the company may choose to make this an annual tradition, and may eventually involve more and more employees and resources in the new goal of raising the most charitable funds, or having the best county fair tent. In some cases, goals are displaced because the initial problem is resolved or the initial goal becomes impossible to pursue. A famous example is the [[March of Dimes]], which began as an organization to fund the fight against [[polio]], but once that disease was effectively brought under control by the [[polio vaccine]], transitioned to being an organization for combating [[birth defect]]s.&lt;ref name="Kirst-Ashman"/&gt;

'''Go-shi Gaisha''' {{nihongo||合資会社}} is a [[Japan]]ese concept of an "[[unlimited liability]]" incorporation, but its structure is similar to the [[limited partnership]]. Unlike the other business types ([[Gōdō gaisha]] and [[Kabushiki gaisha]]) there is no limit on what a general partner ("mugen sekinin shain") of the company is legally responsible for.

==Structure==
In a Go-shi Gaisha, partners are divided into two categories: 1) a [[general partner]] who has unlimited liability similar to a partner in a general partnership and 2) a limited partner who has limited liability only up to the amount he has invested in the partnership (limited partner). All partners are still directly liable to creditors of the partnership, and thus partners can still be sued individually (direct liability).

'''HeadBlade''' is a [[head shaving]] [[razor]] brand produced by '''The HeadBlade Company'''. Founded by Todd Greene, a 1989 graduate of [[Bowdoin College]], HeadBlade is headquartered in Gardena, California.

== Products ==

HeadBlade’s first commercial product was the HeadBlade Classic, introduced in 1999. The unorthodox design of the Classic was made as a response to the difficulties of head shaving with a regular razor.

The HeadBlade Classic went on to win the IDSA Silver Award for Design Excellence, as well as a spot in [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine’s]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,91439,00.html|title=Best Design 2000|date=2000-12-10|work=Time|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Ten Best Designs of 2000.” In 2005, the Classic was also added to the Permanent Collection at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/collection/works/89541|title=Todd Greene. "HeadBlade" Razor. 1997-99 {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company began to grow, HeadBlade expanded into a variety of hair care products, including HeadSlick, a specially designed shaving cream, HeadShed Scrub, an exfoliating solution and HeadLube, a scalp moisturizing lotion. Greene also continued improving on the design of his original product.
[[File:Headblade moto.jpg|thumb|The HeadBlade MOTO]]
In 2006, seven years after first introducing the Classic, HeadBlade released the HeadBlade Sport. The Sport kept the same general shape and function as the classic, but added an improved rubber grip to the finger ring and upper pad. Inspired by sport car design, it also added hardened rubber wheels and an improved axel to increase the mobility of the razor. 

In 2012, HeadBlade came out with the HeadBlade ATX. With a design inspired by an all terrain vehicle, the ATX changed the position of the blade to the back of the razor, encouraging action by “pulling” the blade along the head rather than “pushing” it. This was done in order to reduce the learning curve for people who were accustomed to regular razors.

The latest HeadBlade model is the HeadBlade MOTO, which was released in late 2016. The MOTO was awarded a [[Red Dot Design Award]] in 2017 for it’s industrial design and it’s ease of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.headblade.com/blog/headblade-wins-coveted-red-dot-2017-award/|title=HeadBlade Wins coveted Red Dot 2017 Award!!|date=2017-04-05|work=HeadBlade|access-date=2017-08-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Japanese management culture''' refers to working philosophies or methods in Japan. It included concepts and philosophies such as [[Just-in-time manufacturing|Just in Time]], [[Kaizen]] and [[Total Quality Management]].
&lt;!--
== Japanese management studies in India ==
While Japanese management has always been a subject of great interest worldwide, particularly concepts and philosophies such as Just in Time, [[Kaizen]] and [[Total Quality Management]], in recent times there has been considerable interest in India for Japanese management. This is mainly due to the growing bi-lateral economic co-operation &lt;ref&gt;[http://wwno fqegc d in Japan. The popularity for Japanese management studies in India has grown due to the demand for skilled professionals who can deal effectively with Japanese companies in Japan or implement the management culture of the Japanese company in India. 

Currently, there is one full-time diploma program in Japanese Management&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/getahead/2008/aug/13iycu1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; offered by the RV-Nihongo Bashi Centre of Japanese Management Studies in Bangalore. The Institution is a joint venture between the RV Group of Institutions from Karnataka, India and Singapore-based Nihongo Bashi.One of the key features of this program is the emphasis on preparing students to the "Asian" / Japanese way of doing business, with considerable importance to the development of Emotional Quotient (EQ).--&gt;

==Managerial style==
The Japanese term "hourensou" (also rendered as “[[Ho-Ren-So]]”) refers to frequent reporting, touching base and discussing -- important attributes that are said to characterize collaboration and information flow within effective Japanese corporate culture. Hou’ stands for ‘Houkoku’, the Japanese word for ‘reporting’. ‘Ren’ comes from ‘Renraku’, the word for ‘informing’. ‘Sou’ is derived from ‘Soudan’, the word for ‘consulting’. refers to "getting your hands dirty", to identify or solve immediate problems and leaders are not exempt from this.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/japanese-versus-western-leadership/| title=JAPANESE CULTURE AND LEADERSHIP STYLE| accessdate=2 May 2017| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of these principles are often mistaken by western managers "micromanagement."&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/japanese-versus-western-leadership/| title=JAPANESE CULTURE AND LEADERSHIP STYLE| accessdate=2 May 2017| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, these principles are used as tools to shepherd processes.

Mohammed Ala and William Cordeiro (1999) described the Japanese decision-making process of “ringiseido.” “Ringiseido” provides the opportunity for equal ranking managers or employees of a group within a company to partake in an individual’s idea. The process adheres to the Japanese cultural desire of harmony among people. The physical action of “ringiseido” is referred to as the “ringi decision-making process.” It fosters an environment of support and agreement for a decision once a higher ranking manager has reviewed and accepted the recommended decision.&lt;ref&gt;Ala, Mohammad; Cordeiro, William P., Can We Learn Management Techniques From the Japanese Ringi Process? ''Business Forum'' January 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The term of “ringi” has two meanings. The first meaning being of “rin," ‘submitting a proposal to one’s supervisors and receiving their approval,’ and "gi" meaning ‘deliberations and decisions.’ Corporate policy is not clearly defined by the executive leadership of a Japanese company. Rather, the managers at all levels below executives must raise decisions to the next level except for routine decisions. The process of “ringi decision-making” is conducted through a document called a “ringisho.”&lt;ref&gt;Ala, Mohammad; Cordeiro, William P., Can We Learn Management Techniques From the Japanese Ringi Process? ''Business Forum'' January 1, 1999 (p.&amp;nbsp;22-23).&lt;/ref&gt;

The “ringisho” is created and circulated by the individual who created the idea. As the “ringisho” reaches a peer for review, the peer places his or her “personal seal (hanko) right side up” to agree, “upside down” to disagree, and sideways to indicate being undecided. Once all peers have reviewed the “ringisho” the peers’ manager reviews the “ringisho” and places his or her hanko on it. The upper level manager’s decision is final and the “ringisho” is sent back to the originator who either initiates the idea or re-evaluates, based on the “hanko” of the upper level manager.&lt;ref&gt;Ala, Mohammad; Cordeiro, William P., Can We Learn Management Techniques From the Japanese Ringi Process? ''Business Forum'' January 1, 1999 (p.&amp;nbsp;22-23).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leadership values ==
Tony Kippenberger (2002) elaborates on the leadership values that are deeply rooted in the Japanese business culture. These values were created by [[Konosuke Matsushita]], the prominent deceased entrepreneur of Matsushita’s Electric Company, who cared deeply for the employees of his company as if they were family. Matsushita firmly believed that a business as large as his was responsible to help all of society prosper, and not simply for those that owned and ran the company to prosper. 

In 1933 Matsushita, during the great depression, created seven “guiding principles":&lt;ref&gt;*Kippenberger, T. (2002). ''[http://www.capstonepub.com/default.aspx Leadership styles]''. Oxford, United Kingdom: Capstone Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Service to the public – by providing high-quality goods and services at reasonable prices, we contribute to the public’s well-being;
*Fairness and honesty – we will be fair and honest in all our business dealings and personal conduct;
*Teamwork for the common cause – we will pool abilities, based on mutual trust and respect;
*Uniting effort for improvement – we will constantly strive to improve our corporate and personal performances;
*Courtesy and humility – we will always be cordial and modest and respect the rights and needs of others;
*Accordance with natural laws – we will abide by the laws of nature and adjust to the ever-changing conditions around us; and
*Gratitude for blessings – we will always be grateful for all the blessings and kindness we have received.”

The “guiding principles” were “remarkable for their time.” The seven principles are used by Matsushita’s company today and serve as principles for other Japanese companies. Because the “guiding principles” are such powerful statements and an extension of the Japanese cultural into business, the principles have been renamed  the “Seven Spirits of Matsushita" to honor Matsushita.&lt;ref&gt;*Kippenberger, T. (2002). ''[http://www.capstonepub.com/default.aspx Leadership styles]''. Oxford, United Kingdom: Capstone Publishing. p.71-72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smaller companies==
In smaller companies, an entirely different corporate culture developed. Similar to the ''Meister'' system of Germany, new recruits are placed under skilled senior specialists and spend years learning every technique that they have. They are trained to develop deeper understanding of specific areas of skills instead of the broader and less deep training that those in a larger corporation receive. They learn to produce work of high quality using few simple tools and few or no advanced industrial tools.

==Japanese women in management==
As the modern cultures of the world continue to advance, cultural concepts either lose presence or evolve with the modern concepts. Japan is experiencing such an evolution in regard to women in the workplace and in management roles. While a main reason for this evolution is the adoption of western influence on Japanese society, Japan is being forced to support this evolution because it is grappling with a declining population and lower birth rate which will lead to a smaller workforce. 

According to “Cloud, or Silver Linings?” published in the ''Economist'' (2007), it was reported that in 2006 Japan’s birth rate was 1.32 and has been below 2.1 since the 1970s. A birthrate of 2.1 is necessary to successfully maintain current population numbers. The article described that the OECD has proven there is a “positive correlation between fertility and female employment.” Thus, if an effort is made to support females work ambitions and family desires, then women will be more willing and likely to want to have children and families and not have to sacrifice their career in the process. Japanese officials are not taking this information lightly.

'''''Lex mercatoria''''' (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] for "merchant law"), often referred to as "the Law Merchant" in English, is the body of [[commercial law]] used by merchants throughout Europe during the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] period. It evolved similar to English [[common law]] as a system of custom and best practice, which was enforced through a system of merchant courts along the main trade routes. It functioned as the international law of commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Sealy and Hooley (2008) 14&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasised contractual freedom and alienability of property, while shunning [[legal technicality|legal technicalities]]{{clarification needed|date=August 2018}} and deciding cases ''[[ex aequo et bono]]''. A distinct feature was the reliance by merchants on a legal system developed and administered by them{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. States or local authorities seldom interfered, and did not interfere a lot in internal domestic trade{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. Under ''lex mercatoria'' trade flourished and states took in large amounts of taxation{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}.

In the last years new theories had changed the understanding of this medieval treatise considering it as proposal for legal reform or a document used for instructional  purposes{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}. These theories consider that the treatise cannot be described as a body of laws applicable in its time, but the desire of a legal scholar to improve and facilitate the litigation between merchants. The text is composed by 21 sections and an annex. The sections described procedural matters such as the presence of witnesses and the relation between this body of law and common law. It has been considered as a false statement to define this as a system exclusively based in custom, when there  are structures and elements from the existent legal system, such as Ordinances and even concepts proper of the Romano-canonical procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lex Mercatoria and Legal Pluralism: A Late Thirteenth Century Treatise and Its Afterlife|last = Basil, Bestor, Coquillette and Donahue|first = |publisher = Ames Foundation|year = 1998|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''lex mercatoria'' was originally a body of rules and principles laid down by merchants to regulate their dealings. It consisted of rules and customs common to merchants and traders in Europe, with some local variation. It originated from the need for quick and effective [[jurisdiction]], administered by specialised [[courts]]. The guiding spirit of the merchant law was that it ought to derive from commercial practice, respond to the needs of the merchants, and be comprehensible and acceptable to the merchants who submitted to it. International commercial law today owes some of its fundamental principles to the ''lex mercatoria''. This includes choice of [[arbitration]] institutions, procedures, applicable law and arbitrators, and the goal to reflect customs, usage and good practice among the parties.

Goods and services flowed freely during the medieval merchant law, thus generating more wealth for all involved. It is debated whether the law was uniform in nature, was spontaneous as a method of dispute resolution, or applied equally to everyone who subordinated to it. The ''lex mercatoria'' was also a means for local communities to [[protectionism|protect]] their own markets. Local kings or lords extracted taxes and set trade restrictions. In 1303 [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] issued the [[Carta Mercatoria]], a charter to foreign merchants in England, which guaranteed them freedom to trade, with certain protections and exemption under the law. Although the charter was revoked by Edward II, due to complaints by English merchants, foreign merchants retained most of their rights in practice, but these would vary widely with the march of time, events and changes to state policy.

==Administration==
The ''lex mercatoria'' was the product of customs and practices among traders, and could be enforced through the local courts. However, the merchants needed to solve their disputes rapidly, sometimes on the hour, with the least costs and by the most efficient means. Public courts did not provide this. A trial before the courts would delay their business, and that meant losing money. The ''lex mercatoria'' provided quick and effective justice. This was possible through informal proceedings, with liberal procedural rules. The ''lex mercatoria'' rendered proportionate judgements over the merchants’ disputes, in light of "fair price", good commerce, and equity.

Judges were chosen according to their commercial background and practical knowledge. Their reputation rested upon their perceived expertise in merchant trade and their fair-mindedness. Gradually, a professional judiciary developed through the merchant judges. Their skills and reputation would however still rely upon practical knowledge of merchant practice. These characteristics serve as important measures in the appointment of international commercial arbitrators today.

The ''lex mercatoria'' owed its origin to the fact that the civil law was not sufficiently responsive to the growing demands of commerce, as well as to the fact that trade in pre-medieval times was practically in the hands of those who might be termed cosmopolitan merchants, who wanted a prompt and effective jurisdiction. It was administered for the most part in special courts, such as those of the guilds in Italy, or the fair courts of Germany and France, or as in England, in courts of the Staple or [[Court of Piepowders|Piepowder]].

==Legal concepts==
The ''lex mercatoria'' was composed of such usages and customs as were common to merchants and traders in all parts of Europe, varied slightly in different localities by special peculiarities. Less procedural formality meant speedier dispensation of justice, particularly when it came to documentation and proof. Out of practical need, the medieval ''lex mercatoria'' originated the “writing obligatory”. By this, creditors could freely transfer the debts owed to them. The “writing obligatory” displaced the need for more complex forms of proof, as it was valid as a proof of debt, without further proof of; transfer of the debt; [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]]; or a formal bargain for sale. The ''lex mercatoria'' also strengthened the concept of party autonomy: whatever the rules of the ''lex mercatoria'' were, the parties were always free to choose whether to take a case to court, what evidence to submit and which law to apply.

==Reception==
Merchant law declined as a cosmopolitan and international system of merchant justice towards the end of medieval times. This was to a large extent due to the adoption of national commercial law codes. It was also connected with an increasing modification of local customs to protect the interests of local merchants. The result of the replacement of ''lex mercatoria'' codes with national governed codes was the loss of autonomy of merchant tribunals to state courts. The main reason for this development was the protection of state interests.

The nationalisation of the ''lex mercatoria'' did not neglect the practises of merchants or their trans-border trade. Some institutions continued to function, and state judges also were appointed for their merchant expertise, just as modern commercial arbitrators. The laws of the merchants were not eradicated, but simply codified. National codes built on the principles laid down by trade commercial practise and to a large extent they embodied ''lex mercatoria'' substantial rules. This was for example the case in France. The Code Commercial was issued in 1807, where ''lex mercatoria'' rules were preserved to govern formation, performance and termination of contracts. In effect, the nation states reconstituted the ''lex mercatoria'' in their image.

==Common law development==
{{See also|United Kingdom commercial law}}
English courts applied merchant customs only if they were "certain" in nature, "consistent with law" and "in existence since [[time immemorial]]." English judges also required that merchant customs were proven before the court. But even as early as 1608, Chief Justice [[Edward Coke]] described ''lex mercatoria'' as "a part of the common law," and [[William Blackstone]] would later concur.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Brown Scott]], [https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=o2ItplkkogIC&amp;pg=PA259&amp; ''Law, the State, and the International Community''], p. 259, Columbia University Press, (1939)&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition continued especially under [[William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield|Lord Mansfield]], who is said to be the father of English commercial law. Precepts of the ''lex mercatoria'' were also kept alive through [[Equity (law)|equity]] and the [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] courts in maritime affairs. In the US, traditions of the ''lex mercatoria'' prevailed in the general principles and doctrines of [[Uniform Commercial Code|commercial jurisprudence]].

The history of the ''lex mercatoria'' in England is divided into three stages: the first prior to the time of Coke, when it was a special kind of law – as distinct from the common law – administered in special courts for a special class of the community (i.e. the mercantile); the second stage was one of transition, the ''lex mercatoria'' being administered in the common law courts, but as a body of customs, to be proved as a fact in each individual case of doubt; the third stage, which has continued to the present day, dates from the presidency over the king's bench of [[Lord Mansfield]] (q.v.), under whom it was moulded into the mercantile law of to-day. To the ''lex mercatoria'' modern English law owes the fundamental principles in the law of partnership, negotiable instruments and trade marks.

[[Image:William Murray of Mansfield.jpg|thumb|left|Lord Mansfield was a champion of fusing ''lex mercatoria'' with the [[common law]].]]
[[Sir John Holt]] (Chief Justice 1689 to 1710) and [[Lord Mansfield]] (Chief Justice, 1756 to 1788) were the leading proponents of incorporating the ''lex mercatoria'' into the common law.  Holt did not complete the task, possibly out of his own conservatism (see ''[[Clerke v Martin]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1702) 2 Ld Raym 757&lt;/ref&gt;) and it was Lord Mansfield that became known as the 'founder of the commercial law of this country" (Great Britain).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lickbarrow v Mason]]'' (1787) 2 Term Rep 63, 73, Buller J&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst sitting in [[Guildhall]], Lord Mansfield created,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a body of substantive commercial law, logical, just, modern in character and at the same time in harmony with the principles of the common law. It was due to Lord Mansfield's genius that the harmonisation of commercial custom and the common law was carried out with an almost complete understanding of the requirements of the commercial community, and the fundamental principles of the old law and that that marriage of idea proved acceptable to both merchants and lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;CM Schmitthoff, 'International Business Law, A New Law Merchant' in ''Current Law and Social Problems'' (1961) 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*[[Statute of Merchants 1285]] (11 Edw I and 13 Edw I) aka "Statute of Acton Burnell"

==International commercial law and arbitration==
''Lex mercatoria'' precepts have been reaffirmed in new international mercantile law. National trade barriers are torn down in order to induce commerce. The new commercial law is grounded on commercial practice directed at market efficiency and privacy. Dispute resolution has also evolved, and functional methods like international commercial arbitration is now available. These developments have also attracted the interest of empirical sociology of law &lt;ref&gt;cf. Volkmar Gessner/Ali Cem Budak, eds., Emerging Legal Certainty: Empirical Studies on the Globalization of Law. Ashgate: Dartmouth 1998&lt;/ref&gt;The principles of the medieval ''lex mercatoria'' – efficiency, party autonomy, and choice of arbitrator – are applied, and arbitrators often render judgements based on customs. The new merchant law encompasses a huge body of [[international commercial law]].

==Present and future commercial law==
In summary, nation states somewhat fragmented the medieval ''lex mercatoria'' but it is far from destroyed. Local interests triumphed in the medieval ages, just as national interests do today. A modern variant of the ''lex mercatoria'' is the evolving law and dispute resolution in cyberspace. Internet traders are the fastest growing body of merchants in history. Parties can solve domain-name disputes online expeditiously and quickly. In a virtual court documents are filed and examined online, arguments are made online and decisions are published online – seldom challenged before traditional courts of law. ICANN's UDRP (and its proposals for Rapid Suspension) and Nominet's DRS are examples of this. The medieval, the modern and cyberspace merchant laws face comparable issues of enforceability. They solve the problems somewhat differently, but the reaction of the market is the main incentive to comply with a ruling.

Further, ''lex mercatoria'' is sometimes used in international disputes between commercial entities. Most often those disputes are decided by arbitrators which sometimes are allowed (explicitly of implied) to apply ''lex mercatoria'' principles.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of such arbitral awards: [http://www.trans-lex.org/000011 Collected by Trans-Lex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, some legal practitioners assume that there is a whole set of legal principles named "''lex mercatoria''" in international or transnational commercial law. The most recent and constantly updated set of rules are the ''[[TransLex Principles]]'' collected and formulated by [[Klaus Peter Berger]] ([[University of Cologne]]) and his [[Center for Transnational Law]].

What remains of ''lex mercatoria'' precepts today is a qualified faith in self-regulation by merchants, and a reluctance to surrender the efficiencies of merchant practice to state confinement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6343">{{about |the managerial practice of leaving office door open|the economic policy in China|Open Door Policy}}
An '''open door policy''' (as related to the [[business]] and [[corporate]] fields) is a communication policy in which a [[manager]], [[CEO]], MD, president or supervisor leaves their [[office]] door "open" in order to encourage openness and transparency with the employees of that company. As the term implies, employees are encouraged to stop by whenever they feel the need to meet and ask questions, discuss suggestions, and address problems or concerns with management. An open door policy is typically intended to foster an environment of [[collaboration]], high performance, and mutual respect between upper management and employees. 

{{quote|An open door policy means, literally, that every manager's door is open to every employee. The purpose of an open door policy is to encourage open communication, feedback, and discussion about any matter of importance to an employee.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.thebalance.com/open-door-policy-1918203 What Does an Open Door Policy at Work Mean?] - The Balance&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Benefits ==
Open door policies exist to encourage employees to offer suggestions and ideas, provide or solicit feedback, seek personal or professional counsel, or address concerns within the company. The policy establishes an environment of trust and mutual respect between the employer and employee. The practice is viewed as a [[morale]] booster by letting employees feel as if they are able to openly speak with their employer about issues face-to-face, rather than through [[e-mail]] or [[voicemail]]. In essence, an open door policy serves to empower employees, knowing that their voice is heard and issues are quickly addressed and resolved.&lt;ref name=hp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/diversity/open-door.html |title=HP Diversity: Open Door Policy |publisher=Hp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2011-11-30/business/bs-twp-infotek-corp-20111204_1_employee-benefits-open-door-policy-infotek |title=Baltimore's Top Workplaces: InfoTeK Corp.: Open-door policy - Baltimore Sun |publisher=Articles.baltimoresun.com |date=2011-11-30 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trust in the company tends to improve and grow, when employees understand that they are welcome to confide in senior management, when immediate supervisors are unavailable.&lt;ref name=sba&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/open-door-policy-business-143.html |title=Open Door Policy in Business &amp;#124; Small Business - Chron.com |publisher=Smallbusiness.chron.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
While open door policies intend to encourage and instill a sense of transparency and openness, some employees hesitate to speak their mind or be honest, for fear of intimidation, criticism, and censure. Management personnel may tend to communicate the willingness to hear suggestions, while belittling the suggestions when unaccompanied by solutions. 

Open door policies have also been seen as a way for companies to discourage the formation of [[labor unions]]. Formal, written policies may encourage openness, however, the response received in attempts to engage are often seen as threats to the authority or management style of the individual working in a supervisory or management capacity.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505125_162-44440188/is-your-open-door-policy-silencing-your-staff/ |title=Is Your 'Open Door' Policy Silencing Your Staff? |publisher=CBS News |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, in essence, allows employees to forgo meeting with their immediate supervisors, choosing rather to engage in communication with their senior managers to discuss their employment or personal issues. 

A process of open communication and transparency allows employees to bypass their supervisors to engage with senior management. This may inadvertently lead to tension and strife between employees and middle management. Supervisors may either see this as an implication that they are the primary issue of concern, or they may feel threatened, suspecting the employee of undermining him in an attempt to cause problems between him and senior management.&lt;ref name=sba/&gt;

== Other uses ==
In other examples, commonly in college dorms,{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} an open door policy means everyone's door must remain open. The idea remains the same, that having the door(s) open will make for a more comfortable and social school or work environment. 

Government officials at the local, state, and federal level often implement an open door policy for the purpose of meeting with constituents. In Salt Lake City, mayor [[Ralph Becker (mayor)|Ralph Becker]] maintains an open door policy every Wednesday to meet with residents one-on-one to discuss issues, concerns, and suggestions involving the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityweekly.net/utah/event-108072-open-door-meetings-w.html |title=Open Door Meetings with Mayor Ralph Becker at City &amp; County Building |publisher=Cityweekly.net |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democratic Caucus of Orange County, New York has maintained an open door policy for over ten years, where all individuals, regardless of political affiliation are welcome to attend the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120121/OPINION/201210303/-1/SITEMAP&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, in an effort to introduce a more open and transparent government, Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] of New York extended an open door policy to members of the public. A lottery was introduced that allowed for 300 New Yorkers to visit [[Gracie Mansion]] following the inaugural festivities. The following week, for the first time in the history of the State of New York, a lottery was held to open the State of the State Address to additional members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.ny1.com/content/news_beats/politics/131531/cuomo-extends-open-door-policy-to-governor-s-mansion/ |title=Cuomo Extends Open Door Policy To Governor's Mansion |publisher=NY1.com |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1321">{{distinguish|Operating system}}
An '''operational system''' is a term used in [[data warehousing]] to refer to a system that is used to process the day-to-day transactions of an organization. These systems are designed in a manner that processing of day-to-day transactions is performed efficiently and the integrity of the transactional data is preserved.
== Synonyms ==
Sometimes operational systems are referred to as [[operational database]]s, [[transaction processing system]]s, or [[online transaction processing]] systems (OLTP). However, the use of the last two terms as synonyms may be confusing, because operational systems can be [[batch processing]] systems as well.

Any enterprise must necessarily maintain a lot of data about its operation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8808">{{Strategy}}
'''PEST analysis''' (political, economic, socio-cultural and technological) describes a framework of macro-environmental factors used in the [[environmental scanning]] component of [[strategic management]]. It is part of an external analysis when conducting a strategic analysis or doing [[market research]], and gives an overview of the different macro-environmental factors to be taken into consideration. It is a  strategic tool for understanding market growth or decline, business position, potential and direction for operations. 

Variants that build on the PEST framework include:
* '''PESTEL''' or '''PESTLE''', which adds legal and environmental factors. Popular in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cipd.co.uk/subjects/corpstrtgy/general/pestle-analysis.htm PESTLE analysis history and application], CIPD. Retrieved 2009-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''SLEPT''', adding legal factors.
* '''STEPE''', adding ecological factors.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, J. [http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/jrichardson/STEPE.htm A Brief Intellectual History of the STEPE Model or Framework (i.e., the Social, Technical, Economic, Political, and Ecological)], accessed 18 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''STEEPLE''' and '''STEEPLED''', adding ethics and demographic factors.
* '''DESTEP''', adding demographic and ecological factors.
* '''SPELIT''', adding legal and intercultural factors. Popular in the United States since the mid-2000s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Spelit-Power-Matrix-Organizational-Environment/dp/141967191X/], SPELIT Power Matrix. Retrieved 2015-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is also '''STEER''', which considers sociocultural, technological, economic, ecological, and [[Regulatory compliance|regulatory]] factors, but does not specifically include political factors.&lt;ref name="CarrJr.2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence P. Carr|author2=Alfred J. Nanni Jr.|title=Delivering Results: Managing What Matters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VxE5rnqJq4cC&amp;pg=PA44|date=28 July 2009|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-0621-2|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
The basic PEST analysis includes four factors:
* '''Political''' factors are basically how the [[government]] intervenes in the economy. Specifically, political factors have areas including [[tax policy]], [[labour law]], [[environmental law]], [[trade restriction]]s, [[tariffs]], and political stability. Political factors may also include goods and services which the government aims to provide or be provided ([[merit good]]s) and those that the government does not want to be provided ([[demerit good]]s or merit bads). Furthermore, governments have a high impact on the [[health]], [[education]], and [[infrastructure]] of a nation.
* '''Economic''' factors include [[economic growth]], [[interest rate]]s, [[exchange rate]]s,  [[inflation rate]]. These factors greatly affect how businesses operate and make decisions. For example, interest rates affect a firm's [[cost of capital]] and therefore to what extent a business grows and expands. Exchange rates can affect the costs of exporting goods and the supply and price of imported goods in an economy.
* '''Social''' factors include the cultural aspects and health consciousness, population growth rate, age distribution, career attitudes and emphasis on safety. High trends in social factors affect the demand for a company's products and how that company operates. For example, the ageing population may imply a smaller and less-willing workforce (thus increasing the cost of labour). Furthermore, companies may change various management strategies to adapt to social trends caused from this (such as recruiting older workers).
* '''Technological''' factors include technological aspects like [[R&amp;D]] activity, [[automation]], technology incentives and the rate of [[technological change]]. These can determine [[barrier to entry|barriers to entry]], minimum efficient production level and influence the [[outsourcing]] decisions. Furthermore, technological shifts would affect costs, quality, and lead to [[innovation]].

Expanding the analysis to PESTLE or PESTEL adds:

* '''Legal''' factors include [[discrimination law]], [[consumer law]], [[antitrust law]], [[employment law]], and [[health and safety law]]. These factors can affect how a company operates, its costs, and the demand for its products.
* '''Environmental''' factors include ecological and environmental aspects such as weather, climate, and [[climate change]], which may especially affect industries such as tourism, farming, and insurance. Furthermore, growing awareness of the potential impacts of climate change is affecting how companies operate and the products they offer, both creating new markets and diminishing or destroying existing ones.

Other factors for the various offshoots include:

* '''Demographic''' factors include gender, age, ethnicity, knowledge of languages, disabilities, mobility, home ownership, employment status, religious belief or practice, culture and tradition, living standards and income level.
* '''Regulatory''' factors include acts of parliament and associated regulations, international and national standards, local government by-laws, and mechanisms to monitor and ensure compliance with these.

More factors discussed in the SPELIT Power Matrix include:

* '''Inter-cultural''' factors considers collaboration in a global setting.
* Other specialized factors discussed in chapter 10 of the SPELIT Power Matrix include the '''Ethical, Educational, Physical, Religious, and Security''' environments. The security environment may include either personal, company, or national security.
* Other business-related factors that might be considered in an environmental analysis include '''Competition, Demographics, Ecological, Geographical, Historical, Organizational, and Temporal (schedule).'''&lt;ref&gt;Schmieder-Ramirez, J. and Mallette, L.,  [http://insciencepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ISP_Education-Applications-Developments-Book.pdf Using the SPELIT Analysis Technique for Organizational Transitions], Chapter 28 of "Education Applications and Developments" edited by Mafalda Carmo, Science Press, 2015 Retrieved 2015-08-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applicability of the factors ==
The model's factors will vary in importance to a given company based on its industry and the goods it produces. For example, consumer and [[Business-to-business|B2B]] companies tend to be more affected by the social factors, while a global defense contractor would tend to be more affected by political factors. Additionally, factors that are more likely to change in the future or more relevant to a given company will carry greater importance. For example, a company which has borrowed heavily will need to focus more on the economic factors (especially interest rates).

Furthermore, conglomerate companies who produce a wide range of products (such as Sony, Disney, or BP) may find it more useful to analyze one department of its company at a time with the PESTEL model, thus focusing on the specific factors relevant to that one department. A company may also wish to divide factors into geographical relevance, such as local, national, and global.

== Use of PEST analysis with other models ==
The PEST factors, combined with external micro-environmental factors and internal drivers, can be classified as opportunities and threats in a [[SWOT analysis]]. A graphical method for PEST analysis called "PESTLEWeb" was developed at [[Henley Business School]] in the UK; research showed that PESTLEWeb diagrams are considered by users to be more logical, rational, and convincing than traditional PEST analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Rob|title=A Graphical Method for Exploring the Business Environment|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~kell0956/docs/PESTLEWeb.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Rob|title=Is there a better way to analyse the business environment?|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~kell0956/docs/pestleweb_thesis.pdf|accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|title=Predictive Inference: An Introduction|page={{Page needed|date=September 2016}}|date=September 2016|publisher=Chapman &amp;  Hall|location=New York|year=1993|isbn=0-412-03471-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most often the event one wants to predict is in the future, but predictive modelling can be applied to any type of unknown event, regardless of when it occurred. For example, predictive models are often used to detect crimes and identify suspects, after the crime has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finlay|first1=Steven|title=Predictive Analytics, Data Mining and Big Data. Myths, Misconceptions and Methods|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-1137379276|pages=237|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases the model is chosen on the basis of [[detection theory]] to try to guess the probability of an outcome given a set amount of input data, for example given an [[email]] determining how likely that it is [[e-mail spam|spam]].

Models can use one or more [[classifier (mathematics)|classifiers]] in trying to determine the probability of a set of data belonging to another set, say spam or 'ham'.

Depending on definitional boundaries, predictive modelling is synonymous with, or largely overlapping with, the field of [[machine learning]], as it is more commonly referred to in academic or research and development contexts. When deployed commercially, predictive modelling is often referred to as [[predictive analytics]].

Predictive modelling is often contrasted with causal modelling/analysis.  In the former, one may be entirely satisfied to make use of indicators of, or proxies for, the outcome of interest.  In the latter, one seeks to determine true cause-and-effect relationships.  This distinction has given rise to a burgeoning literature in the fields of research methods and statistics and to the common statement that "correlation is not the same as causation."

==Models ==
[[File:Artificial Neural Network.jpg|alt=Artificial Neural Network|thumb|301x301px|An image of the interconnectedness of nodes in an artificial neural network.]]
Nearly any [[regression model]] can be used for prediction purposes.  Broadly speaking, there are two classes of predictive models: [[Parametric model|parametric]] and [[Non-parametric models|non-parametric]]. A third class, [[Semi-parametric model|semi-parametric]] models, includes features of both. Parametric models make "specific assumptions with regard to one or more of the population parameters that characterize the underlying distribution(s)",&lt;ref name=Sheskin&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheskin|first=David J.|title=Handbook of Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Procedures|date=April 27, 2011|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=1439858012|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; while non-parametric regressions make fewer assumptions than their parametric counterparts.&lt;ref name=Marascuilo&gt;{{cite book|last=Marascuilo|first=Leonard A.|title=Nonparametric and distribution-free methods for the social sciences|date=December 1977|publisher=Brooks/Cole Publishing Co|isbn=0818502029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinary Least Squares===
[[Ordinary least squares]] is a method that minimizes the sum of squared distances between observed and predicted values.

===Generalized Linear Models (GLM)===
The [[generalized linear model]] (GLM) is a flexible family of models that are unified under a single method.  [[Logistic regression]] is a notable special case of GLM. Other types of GLM include [[Poisson regression]], gamma regression, and [[multinomial regression]].

===Logistic regression===
[[Logistic regression]] is a technique in which unknown values of a discrete variable are predicted based on known values of one or more continuous and/or [[discrete variable]]s. [[Logistic regression]] differs from [[Ordinary least squares|ordinary least squares (OLS) regression]] in that the dependent variable is binary in nature. This procedure has many applications. In [[biostatistics]], the researcher may be interested in trying to model the probability of a patient being diagnosed with a certain type of cancer based on knowing, say, the incidence of that cancer in his or her family. In business, the marketer may be interested in modelling the probability of an individual purchasing a product based on the price of that product. Both of these are examples of a simple, binary logistic regression model.  The model is "simple" in that each has only one independent, or predictor, variable, and it is "binary" in that the dependent variable can take on only one of two values: cancer or no cancer, and purchase or does not purchase.

===Generalized additive models===
[[Generalized additive model]] is a smoothing method for multiple predictors that allows for non-parametric predictions.

===Robust regression===
[[Robust regression]] includes a number of modelling approaches to handle high leverage observations or violation of assumptions. Models can be both parametric (e.g. regression with Huber, White, Sandwich variance estimators) and non-parametric(e.g. quantile regression).&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=Rand R.|title=Fundamentals of Modern Statistical Methods|date=March 18, 2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=1441955240|pages=200–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiparametric regression===
[[Semiparametric regression]] includes the proportional odds model and the Cox proportional hazards model where the response is a rank.

==Presenting and using the results of a predictive model==
Predictive models can either be used directly to estimate a response (output) given a defined set of characteristics (input), or indirectly to drive the choice of decision rules.&lt;ref name=Steyerberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Steyerberg|first=Ewout W.|title=Clinical Prediction Models|date=October 21, 2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=1441926488|page=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the methodology employed for the prediction, it is often possible to derive a formula that may be used in a '''spreadsheet software'''.  This has some advantages for end users or decision makers, the main one being familiarity with the software itself, hence a lower barrier to adoption.
  
'''Nomograms''' are useful graphical representation of a predictive model.  As in spreadsheet software, their use depends on the methodology chosen.  The advantage of nomograms is the immediacy of computing predictions without the aid of a computer.

'''Point estimates''' tables are one of the simplest form to represent a predictive tool.  Here combination of characteristics of interests can either be represented via a table or a graph and the associated prediction read off the y-axis or the table itself.
 
'''Tree-based methods''' (e.g. CART, survival trees) provide one of the most graphically intuitive ways to present predictions. However, their usage is limited to those methods that use this type of modelling approach which can have several drawbacks.&lt;ref name=Breiman&gt;{{cite journal|last=Breiman|first=Leo|title=Bagging predictors|journal=Machine Learning|date=August 1996|volume=24|issue=2|pages=123–140|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018054314350|doi=10.1007/bf00058655}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trees can also be employed to represent decision rules graphically.

'''Score charts''' are graphical tabular or graphical tools to represent either predictions or decision rules.

A new class of '''modern tools''' are represented by web-based applications.  For example, Shiny is a web-based tool developed by Rstudio, an R IDE.  With a Shiny app, a modeller has the advantage to represent any which way he or she chooses to represent the predictive model while allowing the user some control.  A user can choose a combination of characteristics of interest via sliders or input boxes and results can be generated, from graphs to confidence intervals to tables and various statistics of interests. However, these tools often require a server installation of Rstudio.

==Applications==

===Uplift modelling===
[[Uplift modelling]] is a technique for modelling the ''change in probability'' caused by an action. Typically this is a marketing action such as an offer to buy a product, to use a product more or to re-sign a contract. For example, in a
retention campaign you wish to predict the change in probability that a customer will remain a customer if they are contacted. A model of the change in probability allows the retention campaign to be targeted at those customers on whom the change in probability will be beneficial. This allows the retention programme to avoid triggering unnecessary [[churn rate|churn]] or [[customer attrition]] without wasting money contacting people who would act anyway.

===Archaeology===
Predictive modelling in [[archaeology]] gets its foundations from [[Gordon Willey]]'s mid-fifties work in the Virú Valley of Peru.&lt;ref&gt;Willey, Gordon R. (1953) "Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the Virú Valley, Peru", Bulletin 155. Bureau of American Ethnology&lt;/ref&gt; Complete, intensive surveys were performed then [[Covariance|covariability]] between cultural remains and natural features such as slope, and vegetation were determined.  Development of quantitative methods and a greater availability of applicable data led to growth of the discipline in the 1960s and by the late 1980s, substantial progress had been made by major land managers worldwide.

Generally, predictive modelling in archaeology is establishing statistically valid causal or covariable relationships between natural proxies such as soil types, elevation, slope, vegetation, proximity to water, geology, geomorphology, etc., and the presence of archaeological features.  Through analysis of these quantifiable attributes from land that has undergone archaeological survey, sometimes the "archaeological sensitivity" of unsurveyed areas can be anticipated based on the natural proxies in those areas.  Large land managers in the United States, such as the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Department of Defense (DOD),&lt;ref&gt;Heidelberg, Kurt, et al.  "An Evaluation of the Archaeological Sample Survey Program at the Nevada Test and Training Range",  SRI Technical Report 02-16, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey H. Altschul, Lynne Sebastian, and Kurt Heidelberg, "Predictive Modeling in the Military: Similar Goals, Divergent Paths", Preservation Research Series 1, SRI Foundation, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous highway and parks agencies, have successfully employed this strategy.  By using predictive modelling in their cultural resource management plans, they are capable of making more informed decisions when planning for activities that have the potential to require ground disturbance and subsequently affect archaeological sites.

===Customer relationship management===
Predictive modelling is used extensively in analytical [[customer relationship management]] and [[data mining]] to produce customer-level models that describe the likelihood that a customer will take a particular action. The actions are usually sales, marketing and customer retention related.&lt;ref&gt;http://forteconsultancy.wordpress.com/2010/05/17/wondering-what-lies-ahead-the-power-of-predictive-modeling/&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a large consumer organization such as a mobile telecommunications operator will have a set of predictive models for product [[cross-sell]], product deep-sell (or [[upselling]]) and [[churn rate|churn]]. It is also now more common for such an organization to have a model of savability using an [[uplift modelling|uplift model]]. This predicts the likelihood that a customer can be saved at the end of a contract period (the change in churn probability) as opposed to the standard churn prediction model.

===Auto insurance===
Predictive modelling is utilised in [[vehicle insurance]] to assign risk of incidents to policy holders from information obtained from policy holders. This is extensively employed in [[usage-based insurance]] solutions where predictive models utilise telemetry-based data to build a model of predictive risk for claim likelihood.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Black-box auto insurance predictive models utilise [[GPS]] or [[accelerometer]] sensor input only.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Some models include a wide range of predictive input beyond basic telemetry including advanced driving behaviour, independent crash records, road history, and user profiles to provide improved risk models.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Health care===
In 2009 [[Parkland Health &amp; Hospital System]] began analyzing electronic medical records in order to use predictive modeling to help identify patients at high risk of readmission. Initially the hospital focused on patients with congestive heart failure, but the program has expanded to include patients with diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, and pneumonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/hospital-uses-data-analytics-and-predictive-modeling-identify-and-allocate-scarce-resources |title=Hospital Uses Data Analytics and Predictive Modeling To Identify and Allocate Scarce Resources to High-Risk Patients, Leading to Fewer Readmissions |date=2014-01-29 | accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Banerjee et. al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banerjee |first1=Imon |title=Probabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients (PPES-Met) Utilizing Free-Text Clinical Narratives |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=8 |issue=10037 (2018) |doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27946-5 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-27946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a deep learning model - Probabilistic Prognostic Estimates of Survival in Metastatic Cancer Patients (PPES-Met) for estimating short-term life expectancy (&gt;3 months) of the patients by analyzing free-text clinical notes in the electronic medical record, while maintaining the temporal visit sequence.The model was trained on a large dataset (10,293 patients) and validated on a separated dataset (1818 patients). It achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89. To provide explain-ability, they developed an interactive graphical tool that may improve physician understanding of the basis for the model’s predictions. The high accuracy and explain-ability of the PPES-Met model may enable the model to be used as a decision support tool to personalize metastatic cancer treatment and provide valuable assistance to the physicians.

=== Algorithmic trading ===
Predictive modeling in trading is a modeling process wherein we predict the probability of an outcome using a set of [[explanatory variable|predictor variables]]. Predictive models can be built for different assets like stocks, futures, currencies, commodities etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.quantinsti.com/blog/predictive-modeling-algorithmic-trading/|title=Implementing Predictive Modeling in R for Algorithmic Trading|date=2016-10-07|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictive modeling is still extensively used by trading firms to devise strategies and trade. It utilizes mathematically advanced software to evaluate indicators on price, volume, open interest and other historical data, to discover repeatable patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://systemtradersuccess.com/predictive-model-based-trading-systems-2/|title=Predictive-Model Based Trading Systems, Part 1 - System Trader Success|date=2013-07-22|newspaper=System Trader Success|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable failures of predictive modeling===
Although not widely discussed by the mainstream predictive modeling community, predictive modeling is a methodology that has been widely used in the financial industry in the past and some of the major failures contributed to the [[financial crisis of 2008]]. These failures exemplify the danger of relying exclusively on models that are essentially backward looking in nature. The following examples are by no mean a complete list:

1) Bond rating. S&amp;P, Moody's and Fitch quantify the [[probability of default]] of bonds with discrete variables called rating. The rating can take on discrete values from AAA down to D. The rating is a predictor of the risk of default based on a variety of variables associated with the borrower and historical [[macroeconomic]] data. The rating agencies failed with their ratings on the US$600 billion mortgage backed Collateralized Debt Obligation ([[Collateralized debt obligation|CDO]]) market. Almost the entire AAA sector (and the super-AAA sector, a new rating the rating agencies provided to represent super safe investment) of the CDO market defaulted or severely downgraded during 2008, many of which obtained their ratings less than just a year previously.

2) So far, no statistical models that attempt to predict equity market prices based on historical data are considered to consistently make correct predictions over the long term. One particularly memorable failure is that of [[Long Term Capital Management]], a fund that hired highly qualified analysts, including a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] winner, to develop a sophisticated statistical model that predicted the price spreads between different securities. The models produced impressive profits until a major debacle that caused the then [[Federal Reserve]] chairman [[Alan Greenspan]] to step in to broker a rescue plan by the [[Wall Street]] broker dealers in order to prevent a meltdown of the bond market.

=== Possible fundamental limitations of predictive model based on data fitting===

1) History cannot always accurately predict the future: Using relations derived from historical data to predict the future implicitly assumes there are certain lasting conditions or constants in a complex system. This almost always leads to some imprecision when the system involves people.

2) The issue of unknown unknowns: In all data collection, the collector first defines the set of variables for which data is collected. However, no matter how extensive the collector considers his/her selection of the variables, there is always the possibility of new variables that have not been considered or even defined, yet are critical to the outcome.

3) Self-defeat of an algorithm: After an algorithm becomes an accepted standard of measurement, it can be taken advantage of by people who understand the algorithm and have the incentive to fool or manipulate the outcome. This is what happened to the CDO rating described above. The CDO dealers actively fulfilled the rating agencies' input to reach an AAA or super-AAA on the CDO they were issuing, by cleverly manipulating variables that were "unknown" to the rating agencies' "sophisticated" models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1865">A '''product defect''' is any characteristic of a product which hinders its usability for the purpose for which it was designed and manufactured. 

==Definition==
Product defects arise most prominently in legal contexts, where the term is applied to "anything that renders the product not reasonably safe".&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Patricia A. Robinson, ''Writing and Designing Manuals and Warnings'' (2009), p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; The field of law that addresses injuries caused by defective products is called [[products liability]].

A wide range of circumstances can render a product defective. The product may have a '''design defect''', resulting from the product having been poorly designed or tested, so that the design itself yields a product that can not perform its desired function. Even if the design is correct, the product may have a '''manufacturing defect''' if it was incorrectly manufactured, for example if the wrong materials are used. A product may also be considered legally defective if it lacks appropriate instructions for its use, or appropriate warnings of dangers accompanying normal use or misuse of the product.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

A product that is defective in some way that does not render it dangerous might still be sold, with a [[discounts and allowances|discounted]] price reflecting the defect. For example, where a clothing manufacturer discovers that a line of shirts have been made with slightly uneven sleeves, the manufacturer may choose to sell these shirts at a discount, often through at [[outlet store]] and with the [[Label#Textile labeling|label]] cut off to indicate that the quality is not intended to reflect on the brand.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Ruppel Shell, ''Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture'' (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Recruitee''' is [[Software as a service]] (Saas) that functions as an [[applicant tracking system]] (ATS). It includes a careers site editor for [[employer branding]], a plugin for [[sourcing (personnel)]], [[job board]] integration, email and calendar [[synchronization]]. Within 4 months after its public launch in August 2015, Recruitee attracted over 1000 [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs) and recruiting agencies worldwide.

== History ==

In 2011, Perry Oostdam met Pawel Smoczyk on [[Founder2be]], a [[social network]] that helps aspiring [[entrepreneurs]] find their [[co-founder]]. Working remotely from the [[Netherlands]] and [[Poland]], they put together their first product - a mobile activation [[game]] called GeoRun.&lt;ref name="recruitee founders"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@PerryDam/the-u-turn-of-our-startup-ae50e6599b03/  |title=The U-turn of Our Startup|date=9 December 2015 |publisher=[[Medium.com]]|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Oostdam and Smoczyk pivoted the business and built Recruitee out of their own frustration with the hassles of [[Recruitment|hiring]].&lt;ref name="recruitee pivot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.saas-invaders.co/perry-oostdam-the-story-of-a-successful-pivot/ |author=Tom Benattar |title=Perry Oostdam - The Story of A Successful Pivot|date=11 September 2015 |publisher=SaaS Invaders|accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe hiring should be a team effort, not only for founders and HR alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinchliffe|first1=Tim|title=Recruitee: Smart Hiring on the Cloud co-Founder Interview|url=http://sociable.co/business/recruitee-smart-hiring/|website=Sociable.co|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recruitee Makes Hiring Easy On the Cloud|url=http://thestartupmag.com/recruitee-makes-hiring-easy-cloud/|website=Startup Magazine|accessdate=3 October 2016|date=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its launch, Recruitee quickly became popular and got an undisclosed amount of seed funding in September 1, 2015. Its board members include Dutch entrepreneurs Robert Pijselman and Luc Brandts.&lt;ref name="fjfdfb advisory board"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamwire.com/2015/09/recruitee-com-seed-funding/122314/ |author=Sujata Sangwan |title=Hiring Platform Recruitee.com Raises Seed Round of Funding|date=8 September 2015 |publisher=iamWire|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Recruitee announced a partnership with Rockstart, an accelerator in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="talent pool partner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstart.com/blog/introducing-talent-pool/|author=Catherine |title=Introducing Talent Pool|date=20 November 2015|publisher=Rockstart|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitee set up a Talent Pool that let applicants apply to job openings from all startups that are and were affiliated with Rockstart.

Recruitee's current clients include [[Vice (magazine)]], Usabilla, and [[Vlisco]].&lt;ref name="clients"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.co/recruitee-recruiting-software-to-hire-the-best-talent-2016-02 |title=Recruitee: A Recruiting Software to Hire the Best Talent|date=5 February 2016|publisher=Tech Cocktail|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Users can customize the hiring pipeline for each job opening. Users can [[drag and drop]] candidates' profiles to different stages as they move along the [[Recruitment|hiring process]].&lt;ref name="engadget review"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2016/08/08/this-is-the-hiring-tool-all-modern-teams-should-have/ |author=Diogo Costa |title=This is the Hiring Tool All Modern Teams Should Have|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can post job openings to free and paid [[job board]]s from Recruitee.

[[File:HP garage front.JPG|thumb|David Packard's garage in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded their company.]]

The '''rules of the garage''' are a set of eleven rules that attempt to encapsulate the work ethos that [[William Redington Hewlett|Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]] when they founded [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Since Hewlett-Packard was one of the earliest success stories of the information technology sector, it also used to more broadly describe the work ethos of [[Silicon Valley]].

== Etymology ==
The Rules were first articulated in 1999 by then HP CEO Carly Fiorina - during her tenure as then HP CEO - and they were later used in a Hewlett-Packard ad campaign.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2009/01/rules-of-the-ga/ |title=Rules of the Garage, And Then Some |work=Wired |first=John C |last=Abell |date=January 3, 2009 |accessdate=May 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name was a reference to [[HP Garage|David Packard's garage]] in Palo Alto, in which Packard and Bill Hewlett first founded the company after graduating from nearby [[Stanford University]] in 1935.&lt;ref name="isbn1-59184-152-6"&gt;{{cite book |title=Bill &amp; Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company |publisher=Portfolio |location=New York |first=Michael S |last=Malone |year=2007 |pages=39–41 |isbn=1-59184-152-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Eleven "Rules of the Garage" ==
The eleven rules are:&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt;
# Believe you can change the world.
# Work quickly, keep the tools unlocked, work whenever.
# Know when to work alone and when to work together.
# Share — tools, ideas. Trust your colleagues.
# No Politics. No bureaucracy. (These are ridiculous in a garage.)
# The customer defines a job well done.
# Radical ideas are not bad ideas.
# Invent different ways of working.
# Make a contribution every day. If it doesn’t contribute, it doesn’t leave the garage.
# Believe that together we can do anything.
# Invent.

To become a professional [[securities broker]] in the United States, an individual must take and pass the [[General Securities Representative Exam]] (Series 7) and in most states, the [[Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination]] (Series 63). To take the test, you must be sponsored by "a member firm, a self-regulatory organization (SRO), or an exchange." This requirement, as well as the administration of the test, is under the jurisdiction of FINRA, the [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]].&lt;ref name="Investo"&gt;{{cite web |title = Investopedia FAQs | url =http://www.investopedia.com/professionals/FAQs/series7/260304_1.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For individuals who are interested only in managing their own investments, several options exist to obtain a [[stock market]] education:

* Traditional classroom setting
* Non-traditional classroom settings
* Self-education
* Mentor/[[apprentice]]ship relationship

== Traditional classroom settings ==
Many colleges and universities offer courses of study in business, economics, and finance. However, the coursework is aimed at preparing the student for the professional world. They are not designed or intended to teach a student how to trade in the stock market, although the introductory/basic courses would provide a good basic foundation of knowledge. Those intending to follow the professional stockbroker career path usually begin their education by obtaining a degree in business, economics, or finance.

Some of the core subjects covered by an [[undergraduate|undergraduate education]] during the course of a financial/business college education are:

* Basic marketing
* Business communication
* [[Business ethics]]
* Financial accounting
* [[Macroeconomics]]
* Mathematics
* [[Microeconomics]]
* Real estate
* [[financial risk management|Risk management]]
* [[Statistics]]
&lt;ref name="Florida"&gt;{{cite web |title = Florida State University, College of Business undergraduate course requirements | url =http://cob.fsu.edu/fin/fin_ba_curriculum.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calif"&gt;{{cite web |title = University of California, Haas School of Business undergraduate course requirements |url = http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/core.html |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100202052836/http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/Undergrad/core.html |archivedate = 2010-02-02 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-traditional classroom settings ==
Non-traditional classroom settings are offered by:

* Non-profit organizations that offer stock market educational material
* Stock market organizations that offer stock market educational material
* For-profit businesses

For-profit financial education companies exist that offer programs of study (also referred to as "systems" or "courses" &amp;ndash; the terminology varies) on stock market education. Unlike colleges that prepare students for working in the financial arena, these companies educate students with a more narrow focus &amp;ndash; how to trade [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] for the purpose of personal investing. Examples of such companies are [[thinkorswim]] (formerly Investools), Invested Central, [[Trading Advantage]], Global Finance School, and Rich Dad's Education (based on the "[[Rich Dad, Poor Dad]]" book by [[Robert Kiyosaki]]). These types of companies offer both classroom settings for learning and [[distance education]] programs.

Another aspect that differentiates for-profit stock market education companies from traditional colleges is the commercialization factor. For-profit stock market education companies frequently develop other products &amp;ndash; such as software and newsletters &amp;ndash; that they market to their students. Colleges and universities, frequently founded for the purpose of providing education and established as non-profit organizations, do not follow this business model.

== Mentor/apprentice relationship ==
Also referred to as "personal coaches," [[mentor]]s work one-on-one with a student, In this situation, the student receives more personal attention from the instructor than from a classroom or distance learning education. Some mentors offer their services for a fee.&lt;ref name="Mentor_1"&gt;{{cite web |title = Boris Gurevich, Ph.D. #1 Education Partner with InteractiveBrokers, AskTradeMentor.com | url =http://www.AskTradeMentor.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mentor_2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Chicago School of Trading | url =http://www.thechicagoschooloftrading.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-taught ==
The following resources exist in libraries and on the Internet for an individual to learn about investing in the stock market:

* A [[stock market simulator]] allows one to trade without using real funds (also referred to as "[[paper trading]]"). These simulators are offered by organizations associated with the stock market (such as the [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]]) and the types of [[for-profit education]] companies mentioned in [[#Non-traditional_classroom_settings|Non-traditional classroom settings]].
* Articles
** Financial magazines like ''[[Money (magazine)]]'',''[[Kiplinger]]'' and ''[[Forbes]]'' provide investing articles, though their target market is aimed at more general investors. Magazines that focus on trading derivatives are ''Active Trader'' and ''Tradersworld''. Magazines with an online presence also offer access to some, if not all, of their articles online.
** Web sites devoted to the stock market or trading arena post articles online or send them via email to subscribers. These web sites can be free, non-profit, or for-profit.
* Books written by investors and traders.
* Online forums that discuss subjects related to the stock market and trading derivatives.
* Non-profit organizations that offer stock market educational material:    
** [[American Association of Individual Investors]]   
** [[Alliance for Investor Education]]    
** BetterInvesting Community    
** Investor Protection Trust   
** National Endowment for Financial Education    
** [[North American Securities Administrators Association]]    
** Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Investor Education and Assistance
* Stock market organizations that offer stock market educational material:    
** [[American Stock Exchange]]    
** [[Chicago Board Options Exchange]] (CBOE)    
** [[Council for Economic Education]]    
** [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]]    
** [[NASDAQ Educational Foundation]]    
** [[New York Stock Exchange]]

== Stock market subjects to learn ==
Whether an individual chooses a traditional or non-traditional education to learn how the stock market works, the following basic subjects are covered:

* How the stock market [[stock exchange]] works
* Live trading on various trading terminals
* Risks Management which can be managed by learning Derivatives( [[Futures contract]] and [[Option contract]] and Portfolio Management
* Money Management
* Behavioral Finance
* How to interpret financial or economic news
* What to look for in a broker or brokerage firm

'''More advanced topics would include:'''

* Trading strategies
* [[Fundamental analysis]]
* [[Technical analysis]]

{{Taxation}}
'''Tax assessment''', or '''assessment''', is the job of determining the value, and sometimes determining the use, of [[property]], usually to calculate a [[property tax]].  This is usually done by an office called the '''assessor''' or '''tax assessor'''.

==United States==
In [[local government in the United States]], an assessor, also called a '''tax assessor''', is an appointed or elected official charged with determining the value of each taxable property in a [[county (United States)|county]], [[municipality]], or [[civil township|township]]; this information is then used by the local governments to determine the necessary rates of taxation to support the community's annual public budgets.  In Florida, this official is known as the '''property appraiser'''.  In Vermont&lt;!---and possibly other New England states---&gt;, this office is known as a '''lister'''.

The '''Tulane Corporate Law Institute''' is an annual two-day [[M&amp;A]] and [[corporate law]] conference that takes place in [[New Orleans Central Business District|downtown New Orleans]] every spring.  It attracts the most high-profile lawyers and bankers from around the United States, as well as judges, journalists, and others who follow the dealmaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The event typically takes place on a Thursday and Friday in late March or early April, at a prominent [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] hotel.  

==History==
In the late 1980s, [[Delaware Supreme Court]] Justice Andrew G.T. Moore (author of ''[[Smith v. Van Gorkom]]'' and ''[[Revlon v. MacAndrews]]'') and a group of New Orleans corporate practitioners were among those who undertook an aggressive goal: to establish a new annual platform for a gathering of the nation's
leading corporate jurists and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.tulane.edu/uploadedFiles/Life_After_Law_School/CLE/PDFs_for_Events_and_Conferences/CLI-BROCHURE-WEB.pdf | title=20th Annual Tulane Corporate Law Institute Brochure|year=2008|publisher= Tulane}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 20 years later, the Tulane Corporate Law Institute remains a critical meeting place for national leaders in the fields of law and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The second day of the 22nd annual meeting (on April 16, 2010), coincided with [[Goldman_Sachs#SEC_Fraud_Lawsuit.2C_April_2010|the unexpected release of an SEC fraud complaint against Goldman Sachs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/16/s-e-c-inquiry-may-widen-khuzami-hints/#more-210215 | work=The New York Times | title=S.E.C.

The '''Wells Print Shop''' was located at 27 Cuna Street in [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. It operated as part of the [[Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board]]'s 18th century museum village, San Agustín Antiguo, demonstrating the colonial printmaking process.&lt;mapframe latitude="29.8949" longitude="-81.3152" zoom="15" width="250" height="200" align="right"&gt;

== William Wells ==
[[William Charles Wells]] was born in 1757 in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], the son of a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] printer, publisher, and bookseller. He was formally trained as a doctor, receiving a degree in medicine from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1780. When the British left Charleston in 1782, William and his brother John moved to St. Augustine where they established a print shop. In St. Augustine the Wells brothers are most well known for publishing the ''East Florida Gazette'', the first newspaper in Florida. After the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]] returned Florida to the Spanish, William Wells went to England and practiced medicine for the rest of his life. He died in London in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 1986|title=Two Noteworthy Acquisitions for the WHL in 1985-86|url=|journal=Waring Library Society Newsletter|volume=9|pages=3-4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''East Florida Gazette'' ==
The Wells brothers' publication began on February 1, 1783 and lasted a little over one year, with the last issue published on March 22, 1784. London's Public Record Office only contains three issues of the newspaper, those from March 1, May 3, and May 17, 1783. The St. Augustine Historical Society resurrected the name "East Florida Gazette" with its newsletter, which is indexed on the Historical Society Research Library's online catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.saintaugustinehistoricalsociety.org/research-library/|title=St. Augustine Historical Society - Research Library|website=www.saintaugustinehistoricalsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Wells Print Shop.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Wells Print Shop, 1971]]
The Historic St. Augustine Preservation Board reconstructed the Wells Print Shop in 1968 on Cuna Street. The original Wells printing press owned by William and John was located on Treasury Lane. The all-wooden shop was constructed using board-and-[[batten]] building method, which the British settlers in St. Augustine preferred for its quick construction and ease of repair. The building is 220 square feet. 

Inside the print shop was a replica of the type of printing press used towards the end of the 18th century. The press was operated daily to demonstrate the printing process to visitors, but the Preservation Board also used it to make reproductions of historic St. Augustine maps and replicas of the ''East Florida Gazette,'' which were sold as souvenirs. 

Today the site once occupied by the Wells Print Shop operates as a jewelry store.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myersjewelryandgifts.com/|title=Myers Jewelry and Gifts|website=www.myersjewelryandgifts.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3392">A '''work card''' is like an [[Identity Card]] which verifies that a person has been given work, or is eligible to perform work in a given profession or jurisdiction. The work card is not a [[Visa (document)|work visa]], although it may be used in conjunction with a work visa, [[United States Permanent Resident Card|permanent resident card]] or other documentation.

Work cards are often used in countries with high [[unemployment]] to certify that the individual meets certain legal requirements (such as head of household, or with dependent children) making him or her eligible for work.

Work cards are also used in certain industries like [[construction]] (where specialized training and safety skills are required)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | publisher = Ontario Ministry of Labour | title = Workers Performing Specialized Construction Work | date = August 2006 | url = http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/about/ontque/fs_specialized.html | accessdate = 2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[gambling]] (where background and credit checks are required to reduce the incidence of crime).&lt;ref&gt;"ACLU Still Critical of State's Work Card Proposal," ''Gambling Magazine,'' September 10, 2002; "County Rethinks Work Card Requirements," ''Gambling Magazine,'' April 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work cards are used in some employment situations, such as [[prostitution]], so that government officials may track the number of workers in a given industry. Frequent renewal of work cards may also be required to ensure that workers undergo regular health check-ups, or to gather information on working conditions or the incident of crime (such as assault against the prostitute, or a prostitute's criminal background).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.elko.nv.us/codes/City_Municipal_Code/Title_4/9/13.html "Section 4-9-13: Work Permit Registration Requirements." Municipal Code, City of Elko, Nevada.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Work cards are increasingly used in the [[European Union]] (EU) to verify an individual's citizenship in a member-nation, and the kind of work which that individual may engage in. For example, citizens of states with provisional membership in the EU must obtain both an EU work card and a work card from nation in which they wish to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | publisher = Westmoreland Gazette | title = Employees Need a Work Card Permit | date = 2007-01-19 | url = http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/search/1134882.Employees_need_a_work_card_permit/ | accessdate = 2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where a union has won the [[closed shop]], a work card may be issued by a [[trade union]].  The work card will permit the non-union worker to work in the industry or for the employer with union permission.&lt;ref&gt;Lahane, "The Union Work Permit," ''Political Science Quarterly,'' September 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;
