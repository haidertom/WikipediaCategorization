'''17th century philosophy''' is generally regarded as seeing the start of [[modern philosophy]], and the shaking off of the medieval approach, especially [[scholasticism]]. It succeeded the [[Renaissance]] and preceded the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. It is often considered to be part of [[early modern philosophy]].

==History==
The period is usually taken to start in the seventeenth century with the work of [[René Descartes]], who set much of the agenda as well as much of the methodology for those who came after him.  The period is typified in Europe by the great system-builders &amp;mdash;  philosophers who present unified systems of [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], [[logic]], and [[ethics]], and often [[politics]] and the physical sciences too. [[Immanuel Kant]] classified his predecessors into two schools: the [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[Empiricism|empiricists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/k/kantmeta.htm#H1 "Immanuel Kant: Metaphysics"] ([[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]])&lt;/ref&gt; and [[early modern philosophy]] is often characterised in terms of a conflict between these schools.

The three main rationalists are normally taken to have been [[Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. Building upon their English predecessors [[Francis Bacon]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]], the three main empiricists were [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].  The former were distinguished by the belief that, in principle (though not in practice), all knowledge can be gained by the power of our reason alone; the latter rejected this, believing that all knowledge has to come through the senses, from experience.  Thus the rationalists took [[mathematics]] as their model for knowledge, and the empiricists took the [[physical sciences]]. 

This period also saw the birth of some of the classics of [[political philosophy]], especially [[Thomas Hobbes]]' ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes)|Leviathan]]'', and [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]''.

The seventeenth century in Europe saw the culmination of the slow process of detachment of philosophy from [[theology]].  Thus, while philosophers still talked about &amp;ndash; and even offered arguments for the existence of &amp;ndash; a [[deity]], this was done in the service of philosophical argument and thought.  (In the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the "Age of Reason", [[18th-century philosophy]] was to go still further, leaving theology and [[religion]] behind altogether.)

An agathist accepts that [[evil]] and misfortune will ultimately happen, but that the eventual outcome leads towards the good.&lt;ref&gt;''There's A Word for It! A Grandiloquent Guide to Life'' by Charles Harrington Lester, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, an agathist may see the world as essentially good but a place in which bad things can and do happen to good people.{{cn|date=June 2014}}

==In theology==
Agathism is offered as an [[apologetic]] in [[theodicy]] to address the problem of reconciling a benevolent [[God]] with the [[existence of evil]] in the world. A form of agathism is found in [[Muslim]] thought and in some [[Christian]] beliefs. The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] believes that even the punishment of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] in [[hell]] is not eternal, but that the wicked perish.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In [[theology|theologies]] which hold human history to be a narrative authored by God, agathism forms the basis for the development of [[Messianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Tischner on Agathology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Axiological Impressions in The Controversy Over the Existence of Man&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Tischner Institute Journal of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apophantic''' ({{lang-el|ἀποφαντικός}}, "declaratory", from ἀποφαίνειν ''apophainein'', "to show, to make known") is a term [[Aristotle]] coined to mean a specific type of declaratory statement that can determine the truth or falsity of a [[logical proposition]] or phenomenon. It was adopted by [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] as part of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Munday, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/b_and_t_glossary.html#a "Glossary of Terms in ''Being and Time''"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; Marcuse defines it as "the logic of judgment".&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, [http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/pubs/64onedim/odm5.html "One Dimensional Man: Part II, Chapter 5"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aristotle's usage, the Greek term ἀποφαντικὸς λόγος (apophantic speech) describes a statement that, by examining a proposition in itself, can determine what is true about a statement by establishing whether or not the predicate of a sentence may logically be attributed to its [[Subject (grammar)|subject]]. For example, logical propositions may be divided into ones that are semantically determinate, as in the sentence "All [[penguins]] are [[birds]]," and those that are semantically indeterminate, as in the sentence "All [[bachelors]] are unhappy." In the first proposition, the subject is ''penguins'' and the predicate is ''birds'', and the set of all birds is a category into which the subject of penguins should [[Logical truth|necessarily]] be put. In the second proposition, the subject is ''bachelors'' and the predicate is ''unhappy''.  This is a subjective, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] connection that does not necessarily follow. An apophantic conclusion would, by examining the two statements—and not any evidence supporting or denying them—make a judgment between them that identifies "All penguins are birds" as more truthful than "All bachelors are unhappy." One would reach this conclusion simply because of the propositions' nature, and not because any penguins or bachelors had been consulted.

In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[Martin Heidegger]] argues that apophantic judgements are the most reliable means of obtaining truth, as they do not rely upon subjective comparisons.&lt;ref&gt;Roderick Munday, [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/b_and_t_glossary.html#a "Glossary of Terms in ''Being and Time''"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; Before Heidegger, however, his former teacher Husserl had already centralized the role of apophantic judgment in his phenomenological 'transcendental logic', during the course lectures on passive synthesis in the mid 1920s.

The concept appears in the Arabic Aristotelian tradition as ''jâzim'', or 'truth-apt'.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/arabic-islamic-language/ "Arabic and Islamic Philosophy of Language and Logic"], Retrieved 2012-05-27&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="890">An '''aporime''' is a problem difficult to resolve, and which has never been resolved, though it may not be, in itself, impossible.

The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|ἄπορον}}'', which signifies something very difficult and impracticable, being formed from the privative ''α'', and ''{{lang|grc|πόρος}}'', "passage". When a question was proposed to any of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers, especially of the sect of [[Academists]], if he could not give a solution, his answer was ''{{lang|grc|ἀποροῶ}}'', q.d. "I do not conceive it; I cannot see through it; I am not able to clear it up."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">An '''aretology''' (from ancient Greek [[arete (moral virtue)|aretê]], "excellence, virtue") in the strictest sense is a narrative about a divine figure's miraculous deeds. In the [[Greco-Roman world]], aretologies represent a religious branch of [[rhetoric]] and are a prose development of the [[hymn]] as praise poetry. [[Asclepius]], [[Isis]], and [[Serapis]] are among the deities with surviving aretologies in the form of [[epigraphy|inscriptions]] and [[papyri]].&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Pernot, ''Rhetoric in Antiquity,'' translated by W.E. Higgins (Catholic University of America Press, 2005), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek ''aretologos'' (ἀρετολόγος, "virtue-speaker") was a temple official who recounted aretologies and may have also interpreted dreams.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Walter, ''The Warrior Saints in Byzantine Art and Tradition'' (Ashgate, 2003), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, an aretology is also a "catalogue of virtues" belonging to a person; for example, [[Cicero]]'s list and description of the virtues of [[Pompey the Great|Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great")]] in the speech ''[[Pro Lege Manilia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Rees, "Panegyric," in "''A Companion to Roman Rhetoric'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Aretology became part of the Christian rhetorical tradition of [[hagiography]].&lt;ref&gt;Walter, ''The Warrior Saints,'' p. 17; Alistair Stewart-Sykes, ''From Prophecy to Preaching: A Search for the Origins of the Christian Homily'' (Brill, 2001), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more expanded sense, aretology is [[moral philosophy]] which deals with [[virtue]], its nature, and the means of arriving at it.{{cn|date=December 2012}} It is the title of an ethical tract by [[Robert Boyle]] published in the 1640s.&lt;ref&gt;John T. Harwood, ''The Early Essays and Ethics of Robert Boyle'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1991), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artificial philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] branch conceived by author Louis Molnar&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267156955_A_Step_Beyond_AI_Artificial_Philosophy "article: Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications", ResearchGate, (retrieved November 25, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; to consider what a being bestowed with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) might consider about its own [[existence]] once it reaches a higher state of [[consciousness]]. The author reasons in his dissertation that at some point, either through [[Computer_programming|programming]] or organic [[self-development]], [[robot]]s will not see themselves as extensions of those that created them, and that their saying "Who am I?" will not lead them to think of themselves as one with [[human]]s.

The term assemblage, in a philosophical sense, originally stems from the French word ''agencement'', whose meaning translates narrowly to English as "arrangement", "fitting, or "fixing".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=J.|title=Agencement/Assemblage|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/026327640602300219|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=23|issue=2-3|pages=108–109|doi=10.1177/026327640602300219}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Agencement'' asserts the inherent implication of the connection between specific concepts and that the arrangement of those concepts is what provides sense or meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, I., 2015.

Deleuze Studies, 9(3), pp.382-392.&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblage, on the other hand, can be more accurately described as the integration and connection of these concepts and that it is both the connections ''and'' the arrangements of those connections that provide context for assigned meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, I., 2015. Assemblage theory and its discontents. Deleuze Studies, 9(3), pp.382-392.&lt;/ref&gt; 

John Phillips argued in 2006 that Deleuze and Guattari rarely used the term assemblage at all in a philosophical sense, and that through narrow, literal English translations, the terms became misleadingly perceived as analogous. The translation of ''agencement'' as assemblage that "give[s] rise to the connotations based on analogical impressions, which liberate elements of a vocabulary from the arguments that once helped form it." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Deleuze and Guattari&lt;!--linked from 'Gilles Deleuze' and 'Template:Deleuze-Guattari'--&gt; ==
In ''[[A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]'', Deleuze and Guattari draw from [[dynamical systems theory]], which explores the way material systems self-organize, and extend the theory to include social, linguistic, and philosophical systems in order to create assemblage theory.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008"&gt;Smith, D., &amp; Protevi, J. (2008). Gilles Deleuze. plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved 1 March 2016, from http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/deleuze/#ThoPla&lt;/ref&gt; In assemblage theory, assemblages (or relationships) are formed through the processes of coding, stratification, and territorialization&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307  &lt;/ref&gt;. Any one philosophical context never operates in isolation. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Deleuze and Guattari use the term "constellation" when they talk about assemblage.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A constellation, like any assemblage, is made up of imaginative contingent articulations among myriad heterogeneous elements.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise"&gt;Wise, J., &amp; Slack, J. (2014). Culture and Technology. New York, NY: Lang, Peter New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This process of ordering matter around a body is called coding.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; According to Deleuze and Guattari, assemblages are coded by taking a particular form; they select, compose, and complete a territory.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; In composing a territory, there exists the creation of hierarchical bodies in the process of stratification.&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; Drawing from the constellation metaphor, Deleuze and Guattari argue that the constellation includes some heavenly bodies but leaves out others; the included bodies being those in close proximity given the particular gathering and angle of view.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; The example constellation thus defines the relationships with the bodies in and around it, and therefore demonstrates the social complexity of assemblage.

Territorialization is another process of assemblage theory, and is viewed as the ordering of the bodies that create the "assemblage".&lt;ref name="Stanford2008" /&gt; Assemblages territorialize both forms of content and forms of expression. Forms of content, also known as material forms, include the assemblage of human and nonhuman bodies, actions, and reactions. Forms of expression include incorporeal enunciations, acts, and statements.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; Within this ordering of the bodies, assemblages do not remain static; they are further characterized by processes of [[deterritorialization]] and reterritorialization. Deterritorialization occurs when articulations are disarticulated and disconnected through components "exiting" the assemblage; once again exemplfying the idea that these forms do not and can not operate alone&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; Reterritorialization describes the process by which new components "enter" and new articulations are forged, thus constituting a new assemblage.&lt;ref name="SlackandWise" /&gt; In this way, these axes of content/expressive and the processes of territorialization exist to demonstrate the complex nature of  assemblages.

== DeLanda ==
[[Manuel DeLanda]] detailed the concept of assemblage in his book ''[[A New Philosophy of Society]]'' (2006) where, like Deleuze and Guattari, he suggests that social bodies on all scales are best analyzed through their individual components. Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda’s approach examines relations of exteriority, in which assemblage components are self-subsistent and retain autonomy outside of the assemblage in which they exist &lt;ref name="Karaman2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karaman | first1 = O | year = 2008 | title = A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory And Social Complexity by Manuel DeLanda | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8330.2008.00646.x | journal = Antipode | volume = 40 | issue = 5| pages = 935–937 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLanda details Deleuze and Guattari's (1987) assemblage theory of how assemblage components are organized through the two axes of material/expressive and territorializing/deterritorializing.&lt;ref name="Karaman2008" /&gt; DeLanda's additional contribution is to suggest that a third axis exists: of genetic/linguistic resources that also defines the interventions involved in the coding, decoding, and recoding of the assemblage.&lt;ref name="Karaman2008" /&gt; Like Deleuze and Guattari, DeLanda suggests that the social does not lose its reality, nor its materiality, through its complexity.&lt;ref name="UT2016" /&gt; In this way, assemblages are effective in their practicality; assemblages, though fluid, are nevertheless part of historically significant processes.

'''''At the Existentialist Cafe: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails''''' is a 2016 book written by [[Sarah Bakewell]] that covers the philosophy and history of the 20th century movement [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakewell|first1=Sarah|title=At the Existentialist Cafe: Freedom, Being, and Apricot Cocktails|date=2016|publisher=Other Books|location=New York, New York|edition=1st|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary==
Bakewell structures ''At the Existentialist Cafe'' by focusing each chapter on a particular philosopher or time period within the existentialist movement first starting by introducing the early existentialists [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Dostoevsky]], and [[Kafka]] and then moving onto the lives and philosophies of [[Heidegger]], [[Husserl]], [[Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir|Beauvoir]], [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Karl Jaspers]], and [[Merleau-Ponty]].

'''Axiology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:ἀξία|ἀξία]]}}, ''axia'', "value, worth"; and {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'') is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] study of [[value (ethics)|value]]. It is either the collective term for [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/axiology ''Random House Unabridged Dictionary'' Entry on Axiology.]&lt;/ref&gt;, philosophical fields that depend crucially on notions of worth, or the foundation for these fields, and thus similar to [[value theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]. The term was first used by Paul Lapie, in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lapie|first=Paul|title=Logique de la volonté|year=1902|publisher=F. Alcan|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infotaste.com/axiology-and-aesthetics/|title=Axiology and aesthetics - article|website=www.infotaste.com|}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eduard von Hartmann]], in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=von Hartmann|first=Eduard|title=Grundriss der Axiologie|year=1908|publisher=Hermann Haacke}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel L. Hart. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2105883 Axiology—Theory of Values]. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Axiology studies mainly two kinds of values: [[ethics]] and [[aesthetics]]. Ethics investigates the concepts of "right" and "good" in individual and social conduct. Aesthetics studies the concepts of "beauty" and "harmony." '''Formal axiology,''' the attempt to lay out principles regarding value with [[mathematical rigor]], is exemplified by [[Robert S. Hartman]]'s [[science of value]].

==History==
Between the 5th and 6th century BC, it was important in Greece to be knowledgeable if you were to be successful. Philosophers began to recognize that differences existed between the laws and morality of society. [[Socrates]] believed that knowledge had a vital connection to virtue, making morality and democracy closely intertwined. [[Socrates]]' student, [[Plato]] furthered the belief by establishing virtues which should be followed by all. With the fall of the government, values became individual, causing skeptic schools of thought to flourish, ultimately shaping a pagan philosophy that is thought to have influenced and shaped Christianity. During the medieval period, [[Thomas Aquinas]] made the distinction between natural and supernatural (theological) virtues. This concept led philosophers to distinguish between judgments based on fact and judgments based on values, creating division between science and philosophy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated70"&gt;Arneson, P. (2009). Axiology. In S. Littlejohn, &amp; K. Foss (Eds.), Encyclopedia of communication theory. (pp. 70-74). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Revolution sidebar}}
'''Bourgeois revolution''' is a term used in [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory to refer to a [[Social revolution|social revolution]] that aims to destroy a [[feudal system]] or its vestiges, establish the rule of the [[bourgeoisie]], and create a bourgeois state.&lt;ref name="ada2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Bourgeois+Revolution |title=Bourgeois Revolution |website=TheFreeDictionary.com |access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In colonised or subjugated countries, bourgeois revolutions often take the form of a war of national [[independence]]. The [[English Revolution#Marxist theory|English]], [[French Revolution|French]], and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions are considered the archetypal bourgeois revolutions, in that they attempted to clear away the remnants of the medieval feudal system, so as to pave the way for the rise of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="ada2" /&gt; The term is usually used in contrast to "[[proletarian revolution]]", and is also sometimes called a "'''bourgeois-democratic revolution'''".

According to one version of the [[two-stage theory]], bourgeois revolution was asserted to be necessary step in the move toward [[socialism]]. In this view, countries that had preserved their feudal structure, like [[Russian Empire|Russia]], would have to establish capitalism via a bourgeois revolution before being able to wage a proletarian revolution. At the time of the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Mensheviks]] asserted this theory, arguing that a revolution led by bourgeoisie was necessary to modernise society, establish basic freedoms, and overcome feudalism, which would establish the conditions necessary for socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/s/t.htm |title=Glossary of Terms: St |website=www.marxists.org |access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chee Soo''' (born '''Clifford Soo''', also known as '''Clifford Gibbs''', 4 June 1919 – 29 August 1994) was an author of books about the philosophy of [[Taoism]] and in particular [[Lee-style t'ai chi ch'uan]], [[Qigong]], [[Ch'ang Ming]], [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] and [[Feng Shou]] 'Hand of the Wind' [[Kung Fu]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born on 4 June 1919 in All Souls, [[Marylebone]], London, Chee Soo was the son of Ah Chee Soo, a Chinese seaman and a pastry chef at the Westminster restaurant. His English mother was Beatrice Annie Alice Gibbs. They lived in Westminster. Although he enlisted in the [[British Army]] under the name Clifford Gibbs, his mother's maiden name, in later life he took his father's name and was known as Chee Soo. In a 1977 [[LBC]] radio interview Chee Soo described meeting a Chinese Martial Arts teacher from [[Shandong]] called [[Chan Kam Lee]] in Hyde Park when he was fourteen years old. Chee Soo said he was invited to Chan Lee's class in the summer of 1934, and this was the beginning of his martial arts training. Chee Soo said that Chan Kam Lee adopted him as a nephew, and taught him the arts whenever his work and time permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0010200177004 |title=Clifford Chee talks to Brian Hayes · British Universities Film &amp; Video Council |website=Bufvc.ac.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military career===
In 1937 Chee Soo joined the 2nd Battalion of the [[2nd Royal Tank Regiment|Royal Tank Regiment]] part of the 7th Armoured division known as the [[British 7th Armoured Division|Desert rats]]. During the Second World War, he was promoted to Lance-Corporal and Corporal in 1941, then to "Acting Serjeant" in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/namesearch/?FirstName=Clifford&amp;Surname=Gibbs&amp;RecordType=Ww2&amp;RecordDateStartYear=1939&amp;RecordDateEndYear=1945 |accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Military Medal]] after the [[Battle of Beda Fomm]] in Libya in February 1941, part of [[Operation Compass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/chee_soo_military_medal.png |format=PNG |title=4 Armd Bds, 7 Arm Div., Gibbs, Clifford |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his regiment were transferred to Burma he was captured by the Japanese on 19 April 1942 during the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]] and forced to work on the [[Burma Railway|Death Railway]] as a [[Prisoner of war|POW]] where he contracted Malaria, he was later classified as a war crimes witness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1939 the Second World War broke out, and Chee Soo did his share of fighting as a Tank Commander in the Second Battalion of the Royal Tank Corps, in France, in North Africa — where he won the Military Medal, and in Burma where, after a hectic battle, he was finally taken prisoner by the Japanese. He went through many periods of beatings, torture, starvation and very hard work as a member of a working party in the mountains between India and Burma. Finally, three years later, as the Japanese started to retreat from the advancing Allies, he managed to escape into the Shan Mountains of West Burma and made his way over very rugged terrain and through many jungles, till finally one month afterwards he was able to make contact with the Allies again. Three months after recuperation and treatment (for he then weighed only 84 lbs), he was flown back to England, where he was able to enjoy a long leave with his wife. After that, he was discharged from the forces and took a course in book-keeping, stock control, commercial history and sales promotion.
Chee Soo claimed that he managed to make contact with Chan Lee again after the war was finished, and the class in Holborn was restarted. In 1950, Chee Soo formed his own class in Manor Road School, West Ham, East London.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo page 139 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author [[Rupert Croft-Cooke]] who was Chee's friend from 1938 provides us with some biographical details of this period in Chee Soo's life in his book 'The Dogs of Peace'.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Clifford Gibbs had got his rather grand name from Dr Barnardo's Homes, for he had been reared in one of these, the son of a Chinese father and English mother, neither of whom he had ever seen. I had known him before the war and was as proud as he was of the Military Medal he had earned as a Corporal in the Royal Armoured Corps in North Africa. He had been sent to Burma and taken prisoner by the Japanese, and suffered unspeakable tortures and humiliations because of his race, separated as he was from his fellow British. He had survived and, inwardly as inscrutable as a Conrad character, a little like Wang in Victory, he had married a blonde English girl and had an exquisite baby daughter whose godfather I became at a Sunday afternoon service in an East End Anglican church.
Clifford, who went about life methodically, was severely industrious and found the means of saving for his family even in those days of grudging wages. But he had a humorous cheerful side to his character and enlivened my flat during his weekly visits between office hours and his return to Durban Street, E.15. He was an expert wrestler and had earned the Judo black belt. Only from the depths of his character emerged sometimes the exotic or oriental; in speech and manner he was very much an Englishman, and it was strange to hear from his curved lips words that might have been used by any London ex-soldier. I am glad to have had his friendship throughout those years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Croft-Cooke]] – ''The Dogs of Peace'', W.H.Allen and Co 1973 {{ISBN|0-491-00864-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teaching the Taoist Arts===
Chee Soo said that after the death of his teacher Chan Kam Lee, he went on to become the President of the International Taoist Society {{Citation needed|reason=This claim is sourced only from Chee Soo himself, and needs backing up with independent sources that don't originate from Chee Soo, his writings, or coverage based on them. Assuming that such a prominent International society existed, there would be records that could be cited, so it's not unreasonable to ask for them.|date=March 2017}} and taught a variety of martial arts ranging from self-defence techniques to healing and spiritual disciplines based on Chinese Medicine, ch'i kung and meditation.

Chee Soo's daughter Lavinia Soo-Warr adds that Chee Soo began learning [[Judo]] and [[Kendo]] in London after World War 2, and followed this up with training in [[Aikido]] with [[Kenshiro Abbe]] after his arrival in London in 1955. This history states that Chee Soo "switched back to the Chinese arts", possibly influenced by his negative experiences as a Japanese prisoner-of-war during WW2. Lavinia states that Chee Soo began teaching a small group in Dunstable in "Ch'i Shu". This is probably the Aikido-influenced system which Chee Soo demonstrates and is called "Qi Shu" or "Chinese Aikido" in contemporary Movietone footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage footage of Chee Soo Doing Qi Shu (Chinese Aikido)| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glhigfam4X4 | access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history says that later "as the Chi'Shu and Kung Fu systems became more popular, he introduced Taijiquan and the Chang Ming Diet", which suggests that Chee Soo was not teaching Tai Chi up to this point. Lavinia's history says that Chee Soo changed his teachings fundamentally "at least three times" during his teaching career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factual History of Chee Soo (English name, Clifford Gibbs) and Li Style Taijiquan| first=Lavinia | last=Soo-Warr | url=http://www.peterwarr.co.uk/wu-kung/articles-lavinia.asp | access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chee Soo, Chan Lee died in the winter of 1953–4 off the coast of China, near Canton, when the ship he was travelling in sank in a severe storm, and he was asked to take over the leadership of the association.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the association has grown in The British Isles, Australia, South Africa, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Mauritius and New Zealand.

Chee Soo taught 'The Eight Strands of the Brocade', comprising :
*Ch'ang Ming 	—	Taoist long life health diet therapy
*Ts'ao Yao 	—    	Taoist herbal therapy
*Anmo          	—    	Taoist massage
*Tao Yin         –    	Taoist respiration therapy
*Tien Chen	—    	Taoist Acupressure (Spot Pressing)
*Chen Tuan	—    	Taoist diagnosis techniques
*Chili Nung	—    	(The way of occlusion)

There are two associations which are affiliated to the Chinese Cultural Arts Association and the International Wu Shu Association.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Cultural Arts Association teach :
*T'ai chi ch'uan	—	The Supreme Ultimate
*K'ai Men	—	(Taoist Yoga or the Taoist form of Ch'i Kung)
*I Fu Shou	—	(Sticky Hands)
*Li Kung	        —	(Taoist development of Li energy)
*Mo Kun	        —	(Taoist Wand for Li energy control)
*Mo Hsiang 	—	(Taoist Meditation)
*T'ai Chi Dance 
*T'ai Chi Stick
*T'ai Chi Sword

The International Wu Shu Association teach:
*Feng Shou 	—	(‘Hand of the Wind' Kung fu, very soft, very gentle, and very fast, and suitable for women and men of all ages &lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;).
*Chi Shu		—	(A form of self defence with throws &amp; breakfalls similar to [[Aikido]], which Chee Soo studied after World War 2 )
*Tao Shu (Sword)
*Kan Shu (Stick/Spear)&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chee avengers.jpg|thumb|Chee Soo, Diana Rigg and Film Stunt arranger Ray Austin worked together on "The Avengers" cult TV series]]
Chee Soo was also involved as a fight choreographer with the cult TV series [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]] during the 1960s as is evidenced by publicity photographs of him with [[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]] (himself a Black Belt third dan Kung Fu Master and pupil of Soo's) and [[Diana Rigg]] probably taken around 1967. He brought Kung Fu before a western audience years before Bruce Lee had even been heard of.&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Guinness world record]] site states that "In 1965, Dame Diana Rigg (UK) became the first western actress to perform kung fu on Television when the combat choreographers Ray Austin (UK) and Chee Soo (UK/China) worked elements of the martial art into her fight scenes on The Avengers. Certificate presentation was done on [[The New Paul O'Grady Show]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-6000/first-western-actress-to-perform-kung-fu-on-television/ |title=First western actress to perform kung fu on television |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=1 May 2008 |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s he ran a Chinese Health and Herbal clinic in London.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan – Gordon and Cremonesi 1976 page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a British [[Movietone News]] documentary filmed on 21 May 1970 at Guildford in Surrey – UK, Chee Soo had over 2000 students studying [[Wushu (term)|Wu Shu]] in Britain as part of the British Wu Shu Association, and was one of only three men outside of Beijing qualified to teach Wu Shu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.movietone.com/N_search.cfm?ActionFlag=back2ResultsView&amp;start=1&amp;pageStart=1&amp;totalRecords=1&amp;V_DateType=1&amp;V_DECADE=1929&amp;V_FromYear=1928&amp;V_QualifySubject=&amp;V_storyNumber=95962&amp;V_TermsToOmit=&amp;V_ToYear=1980&amp;V_searchType=1&amp;V_MainSubject=&amp;V_Year=1928&amp;V_resultsPerPage=10 | title=Chinese Martial Arts | publisher=movietone.com | id=Story number: 95962 | date=21 May 1970 | accessdate=23 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928101121/http://www.movietone.com/N_search.cfm?ActionFlag=back2ResultsView&amp;start=1&amp;pageStart=1&amp;totalRecords=1&amp;V_DateType=1&amp;V_DECADE=1929&amp;V_FromYear=1928&amp;V_QualifySubject=&amp;V_storyNumber=95962&amp;V_TermsToOmit=&amp;V_ToYear=1980&amp;V_searchType=1&amp;V_MainSubject=&amp;V_Year=1928&amp;V_resultsPerPage=10 | archivedate=28 September 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chee Soo appeared in a [[BBC]] [[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]] TV interview on 21 September 1973 where he demonstrated Kung fu self-defence techniques and inner power live in the studio with presenter [[Bob Wellings]]. Chee Soo talked about the history of Kung Fu and the difference between Northern and Southern kung fu styles in China and how it differs from Karate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/BBC%20TV%20interview%20Nationwide%201973.PNG |format=PNG |title=Nationwide |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Chee Soo was filmed by the BBC at his Feng shou kung fu class in Seymour Hall in London and subsequently appeared in a documentary broadcast for schools entitled '''Scene:Looking for a fight'''. His soft style kung fu self-defence class was contrasted with boxing and hard style kung fu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/BBC%20TV%20Looking%20for%20a%20fight%201975.PNG |format=PNG |title=Scene Looking for a Fight |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 he was interviewed by [[Brian Hayes (broadcaster)|Brian Hayes]] on [[LBC]] radio and talked about Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan, meeting his teacher Chan Kam Lee and [[Reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0010200177004 |title=Clifford Chee talks to Brian Hayes · British Universities Film &amp; Video Council |website=Bufvc.ac.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings===
According to an interview with Marilyn Soo who is Chee Soo's widow, during the 1980s he moved to Coventry and spent his time writing and teaching courses in Lee-style t'ai chi ch'uan and Feng Shou Kung Fu at the Alderman Callow School in Coventry (now called [[The Westwood Academy]]) and other locations around Britain, as well as visiting some of his students overseas in places like Australia and around Europe. Chee Soo was the author of five books published during his lifetime and one book published posthumously about Taoist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Tao of My Thoughts pages 127–150&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Ebbw Vale on 29 August 1994 as a result of an [[Abdominal aortic aneurysm|abdominal aneurism]] caused by [[Deep vein thrombosis]] probably aggravated by several [[Deep vein thrombosis#Travelers|long haul plane flights]] during the previous two years.&lt;ref&gt;Tao of My Thoughts page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Chee Soo's books were first published in hardback by Gordon and Cremonesi from 1976, then by Aquarian Press (Thorsons/HarperCollins) from 1983 who published reprints throughout the 1980s which topped the best sellers listings for several years. They have been translated into various languages including Portuguese (Brazilian), Polish, German, French (distributed in Canada, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Portugal), Indonesian, Spanish, and Italian and published throughout the world. His books are now published by Seahorse Books.

A '''closed-circle''' argument is one that is [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]].

[[Psychoanalytic]] theory, for example, is held up by the proponents of [[Karl Popper]] as an example of an [[ideology]] rather than a [[science]]. A patient regarded by his psychoanalyst as "[[in denial]]" about his [[sexual orientation]] may be viewed as confirming he is [[homosexual]] simply by denying that he is; and if he has had sex with women, he may be accused of trying to buttress his denials. In other words, there is no way the patient could convincingly demonstrate his heterosexuality to his analyst. This is an example of what Popper called a "closed circle": The proposition that the patient is homosexual is not falsifiable.

Closed-circle theory is sometimes used to denote a [[relativism|relativist]], [[anti-realism|anti-realist]] philosophy of science, such that different groups may have different self-consistent truth claims about the natural world.

'''Concepts''' are mental representations, abstract objects or abilities that make up the fundamental building blocks of [[thought]]s and [[belief]]s. They play an important role in all aspects of [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1 of Laurence and Margolis' book called Concepts: Core Readings. {{ISBN|9780262631938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carey, S. (1991). Knowledge Acquisition: Enrichment or Conceptual Change? In S. Carey and R. Gelman (Eds.), ''The Epigenesis of Mind: Essays on Biology and Cognition'' (pp. 257-291). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], there are at least three prevailing ways to understand what a concept is:&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab at Stanford University|accessdate=6 November 2012|author=Eric Margolis|author2=Stephen Lawrence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Concepts as [[mental representation]]s, where concepts are entities that exist in the mind (mental objects)
* Concepts as [[skill|abilities]], where concepts are abilities peculiar to cognitive agents (mental states)
* Concepts as [[Fregean]] senses (see [[sense and reference]]), where concepts are [[abstract objects]], as opposed to mental objects and mental states

Concepts can be organized into a hierarchy, higher levels of which are termed "superordinate" and lower levels termed "subordinate". Additionally, there is the "basic" or "middle" level at which people will most readily categorize a concept.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a basic-level concept would be "chair", with its superordinate, "furniture", and its subordinate, "easy chair".

[[File:Generalization process using trees PNG version.png|thumb|right|alt=Diagram|When the mind makes a generalization such as the concept of ''tree'', it extracts similarities from numerous examples; the simplification enables [[Hierarchy (thinking)|higher-level thinking]].]]

A concept is [[wikt:instantiate#Verb|instantiated (reified)]] by all of its actual or potential instances, whether these are things in the real world or other [[idea]]s.

Concepts are studied as components of human cognition in the [[cognitive science]] disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[psychology]] and [[philosophy]], where an ongoing debate asks whether all cognition must occur through concepts. Concepts are used as formal tools or models in [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[databases]] and [[artificial intelligence]] where they are sometimes called [[class (set theory)|classes]], [[database schema|schema]] or [[category (mathematics)|categories]]. In [[wikt:informal#Adjective|informal]] use the word ''concept'' often just means any [[idea]].

== Concepts in the representational theory of mind ==

Within the framework of the [[representational theory of mind]], the structural position of concepts can be understood as follows: Concepts serve as the building blocks of what are called ''mental representations'' (colloquially understood as ''ideas in the mind''). Mental representations, in turn, are the building blocks of what are called ''propositional attitudes'' (colloquially understood as the stances or perspectives we take towards ideas, be it "believing", "doubting", "wondering", "accepting", etc.). And these propositional attitudes, in turn, are the building blocks of our understanding of thoughts that populate everyday life, as well as folk psychology. In this way, we have an analysis that ties our common everyday understanding of thoughts down to the scientific and philosophical understanding of concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerry Fodor]], ''Concepts: Where Cognitive Science Went Wrong''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nature of concepts ==
{{main article|Abstract object}}

A central question in the study of concepts is the question of what concepts ''are''. Philosophers construe this question as one about the [[ontology]] of concepts – what they are really like. The ontology of concepts determines the answer to other questions, such as how to integrate concepts into a wider theory of the mind, what functions are allowed or disallowed by a concept's ontology, etc. There are two main views of the ontology of concepts: (1) Concepts are abstract objects, and (2) concepts are mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Platonism|Platonist]] views of the mind construe concepts as abstract objects,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concepts and Cognitive Science|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|location=in Concepts: Core Readings|isbn=978-0-262-13353-1|pages=3–83|author=Stephen Lawrence|author2=Eric Margolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is debate as to the relationship between concepts and [[natural language]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; However, it is necessary at least to begin by understanding that the concept "dog" is philosophically distinct from the things in the world grouped by this concept – or the reference class or [[Extension (semantics)|extension]].&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Concepts that can be equated to a single word are called "lexical concepts".&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt;

Study of concepts and conceptual structure falls into the disciplines of [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

In the simplest terms, a concept is a name or label that regards or treats an abstraction as if it had concrete or material existence, such as a person, a place, or a thing. It may represent a natural object that exists in the real world like a tree, an animal, a stone, etc. It may also name an artificial (man-made) object like a chair, computer, house, etc. Abstract ideas and knowledge domains such as freedom, equality, science, happiness, etc., are also symbolized by concepts. It is important to realize that a concept is merely a symbol, a representation of the abstraction. The word is not to be mistaken for the thing. For example, the word "moon" (a concept) is not the large, bright, shape-changing object up in the sky, but only ''represents'' that celestial object. Concepts are created (named) to describe, explain and capture reality as it is known and understood.

=== A priori concepts ===
{{Main article|A priori and a posteriori|Category (Kant)}}

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] declared that human minds possess pure or ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' concepts. Instead of being abstracted from individual perceptions, like empirical concepts, they originate in the mind itself. He called these concepts [[category (Kant)|categories]], in the sense of the word that means [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], attribute, characteristic, or [[quality (philosophy)|quality]]. But these pure categories are predicates of things ''in general'', not of a particular thing. According to Kant, there are twelve categories that constitute the understanding of phenomenal objects. Each category is that one predicate which is common to multiple empirical concepts. In order to explain how an ''a priori'' concept can relate to individual phenomena, in a manner analogous to an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' concept, Kant employed the technical concept of the [[schema (Kant)|schema]]. He held that the account of the concept as an abstraction of experience is only partly correct. He called those concepts that result from abstraction "a posteriori concepts" (meaning concepts that arise out of experience). An empirical or an ''a posteriori'' concept is a general representation (''Vorstellung'') or non-specific thought of that which is common to several specific perceived objects ([[Logic]], I, 1., §1, Note 1)

A concept is a common feature or characteristic. Kant investigated the way that empirical ''a posteriori'' concepts are created.
{{Quotation|The logical acts of the understanding by which concepts are generated as to their form are:

# ''comparison'', i.e., the likening of mental images to one another in relation to the unity of consciousness;
# ''reflection'', i.e., the going back over different mental images, how they can be comprehended in one consciousness; and finally
# ''abstraction'' or the segregation of everything else by which the mental images differ ...

In order to make our mental images into concepts, one must thus be able to compare, reflect, and abstract, for these three logical operations of the understanding are essential and general conditions of generating any concept whatever. For example, I see a fir, a willow, and a linden. In firstly comparing these objects, I notice that they are different from one another in respect of trunk, branches, leaves, and the like; further, however, I reflect only on what they have in common, the trunk, the branches, the leaves themselves, and abstract from their size, shape, and so forth; thus I gain a concept of a tree.|Logic, §6}}

===Embodied content===
{{Main article|Embodied cognition}}

In [[cognitive linguistics]], abstract concepts are transformations of concrete concepts derived from embodied experience. The mechanism of transformation is structural mapping, in which properties of two or more source domains are selectively mapped onto a blended space (Fauconnier &amp; Turner, 1995; see [[conceptual blending]]). A common class of blends are [[metaphors]]. This theory contrasts with the rationalist view that concepts are perceptions (or ''recollections'', in [[Plato]]'s term) of an independently existing world of ideas, in that it denies the existence of any such realm. It also contrasts with the empiricist view that concepts are abstract generalizations of individual experiences, because the contingent and bodily experience is preserved in a concept, and not abstracted away. While the perspective is compatible with Jamesian pragmatism, the notion of the transformation of embodied concepts through structural mapping makes a distinct contribution to the problem of concept formation.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Ontology===
{{Main article|Ontology}}

[[Plato]] was the starkest proponent of the realist thesis of universal concepts. By his view, concepts (and ideas in general) are innate ideas that were instantiations of a transcendental world of pure forms that lay behind the veil of the physical world. In this way, universals were explained as transcendent objects. Needless to say this form of realism was tied deeply with Plato's ontological projects. This remark on Plato is not of merely historical interest. For example, the view that numbers are Platonic objects was revived by [[Kurt Gödel]] as a result of certain puzzles that he took to arise from the phenomenological accounts.&lt;ref&gt;'Godel's Rationalism', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel/#GodRat Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gottlob Frege]], founder of the analytic tradition in philosophy, famously argued for the analysis of language in terms of sense and reference. For him, the sense of an expression in language describes a certain state of affairs in the world, namely, the way that some object is presented. Since many commentators view the notion of sense as identical to the notion of concept, and Frege regards senses as the linguistic representations of states of affairs in the world, it seems to follow that we may understand concepts as the manner in which we grasp the world. Accordingly, concepts (as senses) have an ontological status (Morgolis:7).

According to [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]], in the introduction to his ''The History of the Calculus and its Conceptual Development'', concepts in calculus do not refer to perceptions. As long as the concepts are useful and mutually compatible, they are accepted on their own. For example, the concepts of the [[derivative]] and the [[integral]] are not considered to refer to spatial or temporal perceptions of the external world of experience. Neither are they related in any way to mysterious [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] in which quantities are on the verge of nascence or evanescence, that is, coming into or going out of existence. The abstract concepts are now considered to be totally autonomous, even though they originated from the process of abstracting or taking away qualities from perceptions until only the common, essential attributes remained.

== Mental representations ==
{{Main article|Mental representation}}

In a [[physicalism|physicalist]] [[philosophy of mind|theory of mind]], a concept is a mental representation, which the brain uses to denote a class of things in the world. This is to say that it is literally, a symbol or group of symbols together made from the physical material of the brain.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carey|first=Susan|title=The Origin of Concepts|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-536763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Big Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gregory|title=The Big Book of Concepts|year=2002|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0-262-13409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts are mental representations that allow us to draw appropriate inferences about the type of entities we encounter in our everyday lives.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Concepts do not encompass all mental representations, but are merely a subset of them.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; The use of concepts is necessary to cognitive processes such as [[categorization]], [[memory]], [[decision making]], [[learning]], and [[inference]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Concepts are thought to be stored in long term [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] memory,&lt;ref&gt;Eysenck. M. W., (2012) Fundamentals of Cognition (2nd) Psychology Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to [[episodic memory]] of the particular objects and events which they abstract, which are stored in [[hippocampus]].  Evidence for this separation comes from hippocampal damaged patients such as [[patient HM]].  The abstraction from the day's hippocampal events and objects into cortical concepts is often considered to be the computation underlying (some stages of) sleep and dreaming. Many people (beginning with Aristotle) report memories of dreams which appear to mix the day's events with analogous or related historical concepts and memories, and suggest that they were being sorted or organised into more abstract concepts.  ("Sort" is itself another word for concept, and "sorting" thus means to organise into concepts.)

== Notable theories on the structure of concepts ==

=== Classical theory ===
{{Main article|Definitionism}}

The classical theory of concepts, also referred to as the empiricist theory of concepts,&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; is the oldest theory about the structure of concepts (it can be traced back to Aristotle&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;), and was prominently held until the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; The classical theory of concepts says that concepts have a definitional structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Adequate definitions of the kind required by this theory usually take the form of a list of features. These features must have two important qualities to provide a comprehensive definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Features entailed by the definition of a concept must be both ''[[necessity and sufficiency|necessary]]'' and ''[[necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]]'' for membership in the class of things covered by a particular concept.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; A feature is considered necessary if every member of the denoted class has that feature. A feature is considered sufficient if something has all the parts required by the definition.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; For example, the classic example ''[[bachelor]]'' is said to be defined by ''unmarried'' and ''[[man]]''.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; An entity is a bachelor (by this definition) if and only if it is both unmarried and a man. To check whether something is a member of the class, you compare its qualities to the features in the definition.&lt;ref name="Origin of Concepts" /&gt; Another key part of this theory is that it obeys the ''[[law of the excluded middle]]'', which means that there are no partial members of a class, you are either in or out.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;

The classical theory persisted for so long unquestioned because it seemed intuitively correct and has great explanatory power. It can explain how concepts would be acquired, how we use them to categorize and how we use the structure of a concept to determine its referent class.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; In fact, for many years it was one of the major activities in [[philosophy]] – [[formal concept analysis|concept analysis]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concept analysis is the act of trying to articulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the membership in the referent class of a concept.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  For example, Shoemaker's classic "[[Time Without Change]]" explored whether the concept of the flow of time can include flows where no changes take place, though change is usually taken as a definition of time.

==== Arguments against the classical theory ====
Given that most later theories of concepts were born out of the rejection of some or all of the classical theory,&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; it seems appropriate to give an account of what might be wrong with this theory. In the 20th century, philosophers such as Wittgenstein and Rosch argued against the classical theory. There are six primary arguments&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; summarized as follows:
*It seems that there simply are no definitions – especially those based in sensory primitive concepts.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*It seems as though there can be cases where our ignorance or error about a class means that we either don't know the definition of a concept, or have incorrect notions about what a definition of a particular concept might entail.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
* [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s argument against analyticity in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]] also holds as an argument against definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*Some concepts have fuzzy membership. There are items for which it is vague whether or not they fall into (or out of) a particular referent class. This is not possible in the classical theory as everything has equal and full membership.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;
*[[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]] found typicality effects which cannot be explained by the classical theory of concepts, these sparked the prototype theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; See below.
*Psychological experiments show no evidence for our using concepts as strict definitions.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

=== Prototype theory ===
{{Main article|Prototype theory}}

Prototype theory came out of problems with the classical view of conceptual structure.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Prototype theory says that concepts specify properties that members of a class tend to possess, rather than must possess.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], [[Eleanor Rosch|Rosch]], Mervis, [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Anglin, and [[Michael Posner (psychologist)|Posner]] are a few of the key proponents and creators of this theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Roger|title=A New Paradigm of Reference|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc|isbn=0-12-497750-2|pages=159–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein describes the relationship between members of a class as ''family resemblances''. There are not necessarily any necessary conditions for membership, a dog can still be a dog with only three legs.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This view is particularly supported by psychological experimental evidence for prototypicality effects.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Participants willingly and consistently rate objects in categories like 'vegetable' or 'furniture' as more or less typical of that class.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="new paradigm" /&gt; It seems that our categories are fuzzy psychologically, and so this structure has explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; We can judge an item's membership to the referent class of a concept by comparing it to the typical member – the most central member of the concept. If it is similar enough in the relevant ways, it will be cognitively admitted as a member of the relevant class of entities.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; Rosch suggests that every category is represented by a central exemplar which embodies all or the maximum possible number of features of a given category.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; According to Lech, Gunturkun, and Suchan explain that categorization involves many areas of the brain, some of these are; visual association areas, prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and temporal lobe.

=== Theory-theory ===
Theory-theory is a reaction to the previous two theories and develops them further.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; This theory postulates that categorization by concepts is something like scientific theorizing.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encycl" /&gt; Concepts are not learned in isolation, but rather are learned as a part of our experiences with the world around us.&lt;ref name="Big Book" /&gt; In this sense, concepts' structure relies on their relationships to other concepts as mandated by a particular mental theory about the state of the world.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; How this is supposed to work is a little less clear than in the previous two theories, but is still a prominent and notable theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; This is supposed to explain some of the issues of ignorance and error that come up in prototype and classical theories as concepts that are structured around each other seem to account for errors such as whale as a fish (this misconception came from an incorrect theory about what a whale is like, combining with our theory of what a fish is).&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt; When we learn that a whale is not a fish, we are recognizing that whales don't in fact fit the theory we had about what makes something a fish. In this sense, the Theory–Theory of concepts is responding to some of the issues of prototype theory and classic theory.&lt;ref name="concepts core readings" /&gt;

== Ideasthesia ==
According to the theory of [[ideasthesia]] (or "sensing concepts"), activation of a concept may be the main mechanism responsible for creation of phenomenal experiences. Therefore, understanding how the brain processes concepts may be central to solving the mystery of how conscious experiences (or [[qualia]]) emerge within a physical system e.g., the sourness of the sour taste of lemon.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. {{doi|10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question is also known as the [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevan Harnad (1995). Why and How We Are Not Zombies. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 1: 164–167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Chalmers (1995). Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 2 (3): 200–219.&lt;/ref&gt; Research on ideasthesia emerged from research on [[synesthesia]] where it was noted that a synesthetic experience requires first an activation of a concept of the inducer.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research expanded these results into everyday perception.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.'' 20(1–2): pp. 84–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a lot of discussion on the most effective theory in concepts. Another theory is semantic pointers, which use perceptual and motor representations and these representations are like symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Blouw, P., Solodkin, E., Thagard, P., &amp; Eliasmith, C. (2016). Concepts as semantic pointers: A framework and computational model. Cognitive Science, 40(5), 1128–1162. {{doi|10.1111/cogs.12265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "concept" is traced back to 1554–60 (Latin ''[[Wikt:conceptus|conceptum]]'' – "something conceived").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706200201/http://bartleby.com/61/49/C0544900.html |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }} The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.{{Dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Credo ut intelligam''''' (alternatively spelled '''''Credo ut intellegam''''') is [[Latin]] for "I believe so that I may understand" and is a maxim of [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (''Proslogion'', 1), which is based on a saying of [[Augustine of Hippo]] (''crede, ut intelligas'', "believe so that you may understand"; ''Tract. Ev. Jo.'', 29.6) to relate [[faith]] and [[reason]]. In Anselm's writing, it is placed in juxtaposition to its converse, ''intellego ut credam'' ("I think so that I may believe"), when he says ''Neque enim quaero intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam'' ("I do not seek to understand in order that I may believe, but rather, I believe in order that I may understand"). It is often associated with Anselm's other famous phrase ''[[fides quaerens intellectum]]'' ("faith seeking understanding").
Augustine understood the saying to mean that we must believe in something in order to know anything about God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald H. Nash|Nash, Ronald H.]],"Faith and Reason," p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term has been used pejoratively to describe uncritical acceptance of questionable concepts.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Tallis|Tallis, Raymond]], "The Shrink from Hell", ''The Times Higher Education Supplement'' October 1997 p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''distinction without a difference''' is a type of [[logical fallacy]] where an author or speaker attempts to describe a distinction between two things where no discernible difference exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophical Writing: An Introduction |author=Martinich, A. P. |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |date=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0pJ2Do2Rg8MC |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is particularly used when a word or phrase has [[connotation]]s associated with it that one party to an argument prefers to avoid.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1576">The '''Eretrian school of philosophy''' was originally the '''School of [[Elis]]''' where it had been founded by [[Phaedo of Elis]]; it was later transferred to [[Eretria]] by his pupil [[Menedemus]]. It can be referred to as the '''Elian–Eretrian School''', on the assumption that the views of the two schools were similar. It died out after the time of Menedemus (3rd century BC), and, consequently, very little is known about its tenets. Phaedo had been a pupil of [[Socrates]], and [[Plato]] named a dialogue, ''[[Phaedo]]'', in his honor, but it is not possible to infer his doctrines from the dialogue. Menedemus was a pupil of [[Stilpo]] at [[Megara]] before becoming a pupil of Phaedo; in later times, the views of his school were often linked with those of the [[Megarian school]]. Menedemus' friend and colleague in the Eretrian school was [[Asclepiades of Phlius]].

Like the Megarians they seem to have believed in the individuality of "the Good," the denial of the plurality of [[virtue]], and of any real difference existing between the Good and the True. [[Cicero]] tells us that they placed all good in the [[mind]], and in that acuteness of mind by which the [[truth]] is discerned.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''Academica'', ii. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They denied that truth could be inferred by negative categorical [[proposition]]s, and would only allow positive ones, and of these only simple ones.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ii, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2398">'''Fictionalism''' is the view in [[philosophy]] according to which statements that appear to be descriptions of the world should not be construed as such, but should instead be understood as cases of "make believe", of pretending to treat something as literally true (a "useful fiction"). Two important strands of fictionalism are [[modal fictionalism]] developed by [[Gideon Rosen]], which states that [[possible worlds]], regardless of whether they exist or not, may be a part of a useful discourse, and [[Philosophy of mathematics#Fictionalism|mathematical fictionalism]] advocated by [[Hartry Field]], which states that talk of numbers and other mathematical objects is nothing more than a convenience for doing science. Also in [[meta-ethics]], there is an equivalent position called moral fictionalism (championed by [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]]). Many modern versions of fictionalism are influenced by the work of [[Kendall Walton]] in aesthetics.

Fictionalism consists in at least the following three theses:
# Claims made within the [[domain of discourse]] are taken to be [[truth-apt]]; that is, true or false
# The domain of discourse is to be interpreted at face value—not reduced to meaning something else 
# The aim of discourse in any given domain is not truth, but some other virtue(s) (e.g., simplicity, explanatory scope).

They are traditionally accounted a kind of sainthood and their [[spirit tablets]] are prominently placed in [[Confucian temple]]s, two upon the east and two upon the west side of the Hall of the Great Completion (''Dacheng Dian'').

The Four Sages are:
* [[Yan Hui]], Confucius's favourite [[disciples of Confucius|disciple]]
* [[Zengzi]] or Zeng Shen, another disciple of Confucius and author of the ''[[Great Learning]]''
* [[Zisi]] or Kong Ji, Confucius's grandson, student of Zengzi, and author of the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'' 
* [[Mencius]] or Master Meng, student of Zisi and author of the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]].''

Within a traditional Confucian temple, Yan Hui's tablet is placed first to the east of Confucius.&lt;ref name="Legge"/&gt;

The families of the descendants of the Four Sages [[w:zh:四氏|四氏]] still hold hereditary offices in the Republic of China (Taiwan) such as the [[Sacrificial Official to Confucius]], "Sacrificial Official to [[Mencius]]", "Sacrificial Official to [[Zengzi]]", and "Sacrificial Official to [[Yan Hui]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://news.xinhuanet.com/tw/2009-07/24/content_11764658.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.sina.com.cn/o/2009-07-23/101716000328s.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.rfi.fr/actucn/articles/115/article_15023.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.xuite.net/ahhsiang/TYDA/20446373-【文史雜記】大成至聖先師奉祀官&lt;/ref&gt; They use [[Generation_name#Generation_poem|generation poems]] for their names given to them by the Ming and Qing Emperors.&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20031203183333/ 孔姓 (The Kong family, descendents of Confucius)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903010033/http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20031203183333/ |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20040216142301 孟姓 (The Meng family, descendents of Mencius)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116060231/http://www.ndcnc.gov.cn/datalib/2004/HundredName/DL/DL-20040216142301 |date=January 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rationality Debate'''—also called the '''Great Rationality Debate'''—is the question of whether humans are [[rationality|rational]] or not. This issue is a topic in the study of [[cognition]] and is important in fields such as [[economics]] where it is relevant to the theories of [[market efficiency]].

Many studies in [[experimental psychology]] have shown that humans often [[reason]] in a way that is inaccurate or imperfect—that they do not naturally chose the ideal method or solution.{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=356}} An example of a problem which causes difficulty and debate is the [[St. Petersburg paradox]].{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=360}} This is a lottery which is constructed so that the [[expected value]] is infinite but unlikely so that most people will not pay a large fee to play. [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] explained that, in this case, mathematicians refined their formulae to model this pragmatic behaviour.{{sfn|Gigerenzer|1991|p=21}} [[Keith Stanovich]] characterizes this as a [[Panglossian]] position in the debate—that humans are fundamentally rational and any variance between the [[normative]] position and empirical outcomes may be explained by such adjustments.{{sfn|Stanovich|West|Toplak|2011|p=361}}

==Areas of inquiry==
Henology stands in contradistinction to several other philosophical disciplines. The term "henology" refers to the discipline that centers around The One, as in the philosophies of [[Plato]] and [[Plotinus]]. It is sometimes used in contradistinction to disciplines that treat [[Being]] as its starting point (as in [[Aristotle]] and [[Avicenna]]) and also to those that seek to understand [[Knowledge]] and [[Truth]] (as in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[René Descartes|Descartes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wyller|first1=Egil A.|title=Henologische Perspektiven II: zu Ehren Egil A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18737">{{main|Creativity}}
The ways in which societies have perceived the [[concept]] of [[creativity]] have changed throughout history, as has the [[terminology|term]] itself.  The [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] concept of art (in Greek, "''techne''" — the root of "technique" and "technology"), with the exception of poetry, involved not freedom of action but subjection to ''rules''.  In [[ancient Rome|Rome]], the Greek concept was partly shaken, and [[visual art]]ists were viewed as sharing, with poets, [[imagination]] and [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]].

Under [[medieval]] [[Christianity]], the [[Latin]] "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''" ("creation from nothing"); thus "''creatio''" ceased to apply to human activities.  The Middle Ages, however, went even further than antiquity, when they revoked poetry's exceptional status:  it, too, was an art and therefore craft and not creativity.

[[Renaissance]] men sought to give voice to their sense of their freedom and creativity.  The first to apply the word "creativity," however, was the 17th-century Polish poet [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] — but he applied it only to poetry.  For over a century and a half, the idea of ''human'' creativity met with resistance, because the term "creation" was reserved for creation "from nothing."

In the 19th century, art took its revenge:  now not only was art recognized as creativity, but ''it alone'' was.  When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[sciences]] and in [[nature]], this was taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts that were proper to art.

==Term and concept==
[[File:Head Platon Glyptothek Munich 548.jpg|thumb|85px|[[Plato]]]]
The [[ancient Greeks]] had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator."  The expression "''poiein''" ("to make") sufficed.  And even that was not extended to art in general, but only to ''poiesis'' (poetry) and to the ''poietes'' (poet, or "maker") who ''made'' it.  [[Plato]] asks in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?" and answers, "Certainly not, he merely [[mimesis|imitates]]."  To the ancient Greeks, the concept of a creator and of creativity implied freedom of action, whereas the Greeks' concept of art involved subjection to laws and rules.  Art (in Greek, "''techne''") was "the making of things, according to rules."  It contained no creativity, and it would have been — in the Greeks' view — a bad state of affairs if it ''had''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''A History of Six Ideas:  an Essay in Aesthetics'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

This understanding of art had a distinct premise:  [[Nature]] is [[perfection|perfect]] and is subject to laws, therefore man ought to discover its laws and submit to them, and not seek freedom, which will deflect him from that ''optimum'' which he can attain.  The artist was a [[discovery (observation)|discoverer]], not an [[inventor]].&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole exception to this Greek view — a ''great'' exception — was poetry.  The poet made new things — brought to life a new world — while the artist merely ''imitated''.  And the poet, unlike the artist, was ''not'' bound by laws.  There were no terms corresponding to "creativity" or "creator," but in reality the poet was understood to be one who creates.  And only he was so understood.  In music, there was no freedom:  melodies were prescribed, particularly for ceremonies and entertainments, and were known tellingly as "''nomoi''" ("laws").  In the [[visual arts]], freedom was limited by the [[Body proportions|proportions]] that [[Polyclitus (sculptor)|Polyclitus]] had established for the human frame, and which he called "the canon" (meaning, "measure").  [[Plato]] argued in ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' that, to execute a good work, one must contemplate an eternal model.  Later the [[Roman Republic|Roman]], [[Cicero]], would write that art embraces those things "of which we have knowledge" ("''quae sciuntur''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 245"/&gt;

Poets saw things differently.  Book I of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' asks, "Why forbid the singer to please us with singing ''as he himself will?''"  [[Aristotle]] had doubts as to whether poetry was imitation of reality, and as to whether it required adherence to truth:  it was, rather, the realm of that "which is neither true nor false."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 245–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, these Greek concepts were partly shaken.  [[Horace]] wrote that not only poets but painters as well were entitled to the privilege of daring whatever they wished to ("''quod libet audendi''").  In the declining period of antiquity, [[Philostratus]] wrote that "one can discover a similarity between poetry and art and find that they have [[imagination]] in common."  [[Callistratos]] averred that "Not only is the art of the poets and [[prose|prosaist]]s inspired, but likewise the hands of [[sculptor]]s are gifted with the blessing of divine [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]]."  This was something new:  [[classical Greece|classical Greeks]] had not applied the [[concept]]s of [[imagination]] and inspiration to the [[visual arts]] but had restricted them to poetry.  [[Latin]] was richer than Greek:  it had a term for "creating" ("''creatio''") and for "''creator''," and had ''two'' expressions — "''facere''" and "''creare''" — where Greek had but one, "''poiein''."  Still, the two Latin terms meant much the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental change, however, came in the Christian period:  "''creatio''" came to designate [[God]]'s act of "creation from nothing" ("''creatio ex nihilo''").  "''Creatio''" thus took on a different meaning than "''facere''" ("to make"), and ceased to apply to human functions.  As the 6th-century Roman official and literary figure [[Cassiodorus]] wrote, "things made and created differ, for we can make, who cannot create."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside this new, [[religion|religious]] interpretation of the expression, there persisted the ancient view that art is not a domain of creativity. This is seen in two early and influential Christian writers, [[Pseudo-Dionysius]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]. Later [[medieval]] men such as [[Hraban the Moor]], and [[Robert Grosseteste]] in the 13th century, thought much the same way.  The [[Middle Ages]] here went even further than [[classical antiquity|antiquity]]; they made no exception of poetry:  it too had its rules, was an art, and was therefore [[craft]] and not creativity.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 247"/&gt;

All this changed in modern times.  [[Renaissance]] men had a sense of their own independence, freedom and creativity, and sought to give voice to this sense of independence and creativity.  The philosopher [[Marsilio Ficino]] wrote that the artist "thinks up" ("''excogitatio''") his works; the theoretician of architecture and painting, [[Leon Battista Alberti]], that he "preordains" ("''preordinazione''"); [[Raphael]], that he shapes a painting according to his idea; [[Leonardo da Vinci]], that he employs "shapes that do not exist in nature"; [[Michelangelo]], that the artist realizes his vision rather than imitating nature; [[Giorgio Vasari]], that "nature is conquered by art"; the Venetian art theoretician, [[Paolo Pino]], that painting is "inventing what is not"; [[Paolo Veronese]], that painters avail themselves of the same liberties as do poets and madmen; [[Federico Zuccari]] (1542–1609), that the artist shapes "a new world, new paradises"; [[Cesare Cesariano]] (1483–1541), that architects are "demi-gods."  Among musicians, the [[Flanders|Flemish]] composer and musicologist [[Johannes Tinctoris]] (1446–1511) demanded novelty in what a composer did, and defined a composer as "one who produces ''new'' songs."&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 247–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still more emphatic were those who wrote about poetry:  [[G.P. Capriano]] held (1555) that the poet's invention springs "from nothing."  [[Francesco Patrizi]] (1586) saw poetry as "fiction," "shaping," "transformation."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at long last, someone ventured to use the word, "creation."  He was the 17th-century Polish poet and theoretician of poetry, [[Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski]] (1595–1640), known as "the last Latin poet."  In his treatise, ''De perfecta poesi'', he not only wrote that a poet "invents," "after a fashion builds," but also that the poet "''creates anew''" ("''de novo creat''").  Sarbiewski even added:  "in the manner of God" ("''instar Dei''").&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

Sarbiewski, however, regarded creativity as the exclusive privilege of poetry; creativity was not open to visual artists.  "Other arts merely imitate and copy but do not create, because they assume the existence of the material from which they create or of the subject."  As late as the end of the 17th century, [[André Félibien]] (1619–75) would write that the painter is "so to speak [a] creator."  The Spanish [[Jesuit]] [[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–58) wrote similarly as Sarbiewski:  "Art is the completion of nature, as it were ''a second Creator''..."&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 248"/&gt;

By the 18th century, the concept of creativity was appearing more often in art theory.  It was linked with the concept of [[imagination]], which was on all lips. [[Joseph Addison]] wrote that the imagination "has something in it like creation."  [[Voltaire]] declared (1740) that "the true poet is creative."  With both these authors, however, this was rather only a ''comparison'' of poet with creator.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, pp. 248–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers took a different view.  [[Denis Diderot]] felt that imagination is merely "the memory of forms and contents," and "creates nothing" but only combines, magnifies or diminishes.  It was precisely in 18th-century France, indeed, that the idea of man's creativity met with resistance.  [[Charles Batteux]] wrote that "The human mind ''cannot create'', strictly speaking; all its products bear the stigmata of their model; even monsters invented by an imagination unhampered by laws can only be composed of parts taken from nature."  [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues]] (1715–47), and [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]] (1715–80) spoke to a similar effect.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"&gt;Tatarkiewicz, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their resistance to the idea of human creativity had a triple source.  The expression, "creation," was then reserved for creation ''ex nihilo'' ({{lang-la|from nothing}}), which was inaccessible to man.  Second, creation is a mysterious act, and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] psychology did not admit of mysteries.  Third, artists of the age were attached to their rules, and creativity seemed irreconcilable with rules.  The latter objection was the weakest, as it was already beginning to be realized (e.g., by [[Houdar de la Motte]], 1715) that rules ultimately are a ''human invention''.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

In the 19th century, art took its compensation for the resistance of preceding centuries against recognizing it as creativity.  Now not only was art regarded as creativity, but ''it alone'' was so regarded. When later, at the turn of the 20th century, there began to be discussion as well of creativity in the [[science]]s (e.g., [[Jan Łukasiewicz]], 1878–1956) and in [[nature]] (e.g., [[Henri Bergson]]), this was generally taken as the transference, to the sciences and to nature, of concepts proper to art.&lt;ref name="Tatarkiewicz, p. 249"/&gt;

The start of the ''scientific'' study of creativity is sometimes taken as [[J. P. Guilford]]'s 1950 address to the [[American Psychological Association]], which helped popularize the subject.&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cocreativity.com/handouts/guilford.pdf | title=Guilford's structure of the intellect | publisher=The Co-Creativity Institute | accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other students of creativity have taken a more pragmatic approach, teaching practical [[creativity techniques]]. Three of the best-known are [[Alex Osborn]]'s "[[brainstorming]]" (1950s to present), [[Genrikh Altshuller]]'s Theory of Inventive Problem-Solving ([[TRIZ]], 1950s to present), and [[Edward de Bono]]'s "[[lateral thinking]]" (1960s to present).

The [[feminist philosophy]] journal [[Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|''Hypatia'']] became involved in a dispute in April 2017 that led to the [[online shaming]] of one of its authors, Rebecca Tuvel, a Canadian [[Academic tenure|untenured]] [[assistant professor]] of philosophy at [[Rhodes College]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017&gt;[[Rogers Brubaker|Brubaker, Rogers]] (18 May 2017). [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/18/opinion/the-uproar-over-transracialism.html "The Uproar Over 'Transracialism'"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The journal had published a [[Scholarly peer review|peer-reviewed]] article by Tuvel in which she compared aspects of the situation of [[Caitlyn Jenner]], a [[trans woman]], to that of [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies as black. When the article was criticized on [[social media]], scholars associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and urged the journal to retract it.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017&gt;Singal, Jesse (2 May 2017). [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/05/transracialism-article-controversy.html "This Is What a Modern-Day Witch Hunt Looks Like"], ''New York'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy exposed a rift within the journal's editorial team and more broadly within [[feminism]] and academic [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

In the article—"In Defense of Transracialism", published in ''Hypatia''{{'}}s spring 2017 issue on 25 April—Tuvel argued that "[s]ince we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tuvel|first=Rebecca|date=Spring 2017|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12327/pdf|title=In Defense of Transracialism|work=Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy|volume=32|issue=2|pages=(263–278), 264|doi-access=free|doi=10.1111/hypa.12327|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510220050/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hypa.12327/full|archive-date=10 May 2017|dead-url=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, a small group on [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]]  began criticizing the article and attacking Tuvel. From 29 April an open letter, naming a member of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editorial board as its point of contact, urged that the article be retracted. The article's publication had sent a message, the letter said, that "white [[Cisgender|cis]] scholars may engage in speculative discussion of these themes" without engaging "theorists whose lives are most directly affected by [[transphobia]] and [[racism]]".&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

===Jenner and Dolezal===
Tuvel began writing the article after noticing the contrast, in 2015, between the reception given to [[Caitlyn Jenner]]'s coming out as a [[trans woman]] in April and that given in June to [[Rachel Dolezal]], a white woman who identifies and had been [[Passing (racial identity)|passing]] as black. Jenner became one of ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' magazine's Women of the Year and appeared on the cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', while Dolezal lost her position as president of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] chapter in [[Spokane]], Washington, and became, in her view, unemployable.&lt;ref&gt;Engber, Daniel (30 May 2017).

Woman's Story Stirs Up a Furor"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvel was not interested in the details of the cases but in their structure. She set about writing an argument in support of the position: "Since we should accept transgender individuals' decisions to change sexes, we should also accept transracial individuals' decisions to change races."{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

===Arguments===

Tuvel suggests that "[g]enerally, we treat people wrongly when we block them from assuming the personal identity they wish to assume." As an example, she offers [[conversion to Judaism]]. Assuming there is no reason to block the conversion, such as the rabbi doubting the seriousness of the commitment, transition to the new identity will be accepted. Self-identification and social recognition of the new identity are the two components needed for a successful change.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}}

Tuvel then argues for "an account of race that allows for racial membership on the basis of social treatment and&amp;nbsp;... self-identification".{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} She maintains that [[Race (human categorization)|race]] is a malleable [[Social constructionism|social construct]] and that, while [[ancestry]]—a feature external to the body—is a highly valued determinant of [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|race in America]], its value varies elsewhere. [[Race and ethnicity in Brazil|In Brazil]], for example, Tuvel suggests that Dolezal's exposure to [[African-American culture|black culture]], self-identification as black, and living as someone society had accepted as black, would be enough to deem her black. From a genetic standpoint, there is no matter of fact, no "real race", Tuvel writes.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=266–267}}

Four objections to [[Transracial (identity)|transracialism]] are addressed and rejected. The first is that a claim to be black cannot be accepted without the experience of having grown up with the suffering anti-black [[racism]] causes; Tuvel quotes the journalist [[Touré (journalist)|Touré]], who called this the "one thing that binds black people"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}; Schwartz, Ian (16 June 2015). [http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/06/16/toure_roasts_rachel_dolezal_the_one_thing_that_binds_black_people_is_the_experience_of_racism.html "Toure Roasts Rachel Dolezal: "The One Thing That Binds Black People Is The Experience Of Racism"], ''RealClear Politics''.&lt;/ref&gt; That trans women are not raised with the suffering caused by [[sexism]] is not reason enough, Tuvel argues, to reject their identification as women. Following this argument, Dolezal's experience of racism while living as a black woman would be sufficient exposure.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}

The second objection holds that Dolezal cannot identify as black because of the importance placed on ancestry (in America, at least). No matter the genetic facts, there is [[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] agreement that ancestry matters; it is crucial because it is regarded as crucial. Tuvel argues that this position—espoused by [[Cressida Heyes]], the associate editor who posted the apology—holds the possibility of change "hostage to the status quo". How racial categorization does operate is not necessarily how it should operate.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268–269}}

Third, there is an objection that the black community is harmed when a white individual seeks to enter that category; several commentators compared Dolezal's passing as black to the harmful practice of [[blackface]]. Tuvel distinguishes between what she calls problematic and unproblematic identification. Dolezal's self-identification is not based on a change in physical appearance alone; there is nothing obviously insulting about it; her change does not appear to be temporary; there are no questionable ends; and there is no reinforcement of harmful stereotypes. It is therefore an example of unproblematic identification, Tuvel argues.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=269–270}}

A fourth objection holds that Dolezal is engaged in a "wrongful exercise of white privilege". This argument holds that a white person can restore their [[white privilege]] whenever they need it; a black person is denied this ease of movement.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}} Tuvel quotes the writer Tamara Winfrey Harris: "I will accept Ms. Dolezal as black like me only when society can accept me as white like her."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270}}; Harris, Tamara Winfrey (16 June 2015). [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/opinion/rachel-dolezals-harmful-masquerade.html "Black Like Who? Rachel Dolezal’s Harmful Masquerade"], ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvel writes that the same argument applies to trans women, especially before surgery; that someone could return to [[male privilege]] should not preclude their transition. She argues further than the exercise of privilege is a separate issue. That more men than women get jobs as philosophy professors does not mean we should get rid of philosophy professors; instead, we should address the inequality. Similarly, if society comes to accept transracialism, it could be made easier for all races to transition. Tuvel adds that it is hard to see how Dolezal could be accused of exercising white privilege by choosing to give it up.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=270–271}}

Finally, Tuvel asks whether, if we accept her position, we are obliged to accept any and all self-identification, such as individuals who [[Otherkin|identify as nonhuman]]. She repeats that two components are necessary for a successful change: self-identification and social acceptance of the new identity. It is reasonable to ask that social acceptance depend on it being possible for individuals to imagine what it is like to exist and be treated as a member of the category they seek to join. Without that, there is "too little commonality to make the group designation meaningful".{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=272}}

Botts was unable to attend, but she submitted a couple of paragraphs in reply to Tuvel and the panel members, arguing that the contemporary understanding of race in the United States in the 21st century is that it is an "identity marker based in ancestry", which unlike gender is not changeable; she called race "externally derived" and gender "internally derived".

She was told her comments were "unforgivable", and that her suggestions were "doing violence" and triggering [[PTSD]].&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt;

According to Oliver, several people associated with ''Hypatia'' joined in the criticism and apologized individually for the article. A friend of Oliver's described one of the Facebook apologies as "like something ISIS makes its captors read in a hostage video before beheading them". Dissenters were shut down or afraid to speak up. Several people who wrote sympathetically to Tuvel in private attacked her in public. Others who posted criticism acknowledged privately that they had not read the article.  A "senior feminist philosopher" telephoned Tuvel to remind her that she had to appeal to the "right people" to get tenure. Oliver writes: "Through every medium imaginable, senior feminist scholars were pressuring, even ''threatening'', Tuvel that she wouldn't get tenure and her career would be ruined if she didn’t retract her article."&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt; Tuvel said that people were "absolutely vicious" toward her.&lt;ref name=Sosis/&gt;

Nora Berenstain, [[assistant professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of Tennessee]], wrote on Facebook on 29 April that the paper contained "egregious levels of liberal white ignorance and discursive transmisogynistic violence".&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;{{efn|Berenstain said that the term "violence" referred to "structural violence", which she described as "a range of systemic harms that go beyond direct interpersonal physical contact".&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;}} Criticizing Tuvel for failing to cite women-of-color philosophers or black trans women, Berenstain objected to Tuvel's parenthetical reference to Jenner's former name ([[deadnaming]]), and her use of the terms "transgenderism", "biological sex" and "male genitalia". The paper's references to surgery, Berenstain wrote, objectified trans bodies, and its reference to "a male-to-female (mtf) trans individual who could return to male privilege" promoted "the harmful transmisogynistic ideology that trans women have (at some point had) male privilege".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

===Open letter===
====Signatories and objections{{anchor|Letter}}====
An open letter requesting a [[retraction]] began to circulate on 29 April 2017; its point of contact was Alexis Shotwell of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editorial board.&lt;ref name=letter/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=editorialboardJune2017/&gt; The letter had 130 signatories by 9&amp;nbsp;am on 1 May,&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; 520 later that day,&lt;ref name=letter/&gt; and 830 by the afternoon of 2 May.&lt;ref name=Piper2May2017&gt;Piper, Greg (2 May 2017). [https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/32415/ "Sorry for comparing transgenders to Rachel Dolezal, feminist journal tells outrage mob"], ''The College Fix''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Singal, the top five signatories were Elise Springer ([[Wesleyan University|Wesleyan]]), Alexis Shotwell ([[Carleton University|Carleton]]), Dilek Huseyinzadegan ([[Emory University|Emory]]), [[Lori Gruen]] (Wesleyan), and Shannon Winnubst ([[Ohio State University|Ohio State]]).&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; [[Lisa Guenther]] (Vanderbilt) also signed it;&lt;ref name=Guenther2May2017&gt;{{cite news|last=Guenther|first=Lisa|author-link=Lisa Guenther|date=2 May 2017|title=This article&amp;nbsp;...|url=https://www.facebook.com/lisa.guenther.982/posts/1038183326316452|publisher=Facebook|archiveurl=https://archive.is/amyBC|archivedate=3 May 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gruen and Guenther were members of Tuvel's dissertation committee in 2014.&lt;ref name=PhDcommittee/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guenther2May2017/&gt;

Delivered on 2 May to ''Hypatia''{{'}}s editor-in-chief,&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt; the letter urged the journal to retract the article; avoid deadnaming; open its editorial procedures to scrutiny; release a statement about how it plans to improve its review process; and undertake to involve in future "people targeted by transphobia and racism and scholars who specialize in the related relevant subfields of philosophy".&lt;ref name=letter/&gt; It alleged that the article had fallen "short of scholarly standards":

{{quote|1.  It uses vocabulary and frameworks not recognized, accepted, or adopted by the conventions of the relevant subfields; for example, the author uses the language of “transgenderism” and engages in [[deadnaming]] a trans woman;

2.  It mischaracterizes various theories and practices relating to religious identity and conversion; for example, the author gives an off-hand example about conversion to Judaism;

3.  It misrepresents leading accounts of belonging to a racial group; for example, the author incorrectly cites [[Charles W. Mills|Charles Mills]] as a defender of voluntary racial identification;

4.  It fails to seek out and sufficiently engage with scholarly work by those who are most vulnerable to the intersection of racial and gender oppressions (women of color) in its discussion of “transracialism”. We endorse Hypatia's stated commitment to "actively reflect and engage the diversity within feminism, the diverse experiences and situations of women, and the diverse forms that gender takes around the globe," and we find that this submission was published without being held to that commitment.&lt;ref name=letter&gt;"Open letter to Hypatia", Google Docs.

====Rebuttal====
{{Feminism sidebar}}
According to Justin Weinberg, [[associate professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of South Carolina]], and Jesse Singal of ''New York'' magazine, most of the letter's claims were false or arguable.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; Regarding the term ''transgenderism'', [[GLAAD]] does caution against its use. The [[deadnaming]] consisted of Tuvel including Jenner's previous name in parentheses, a name that Jenner herself refers to, Singal wrote.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;{{efn|[[Caitlyn Jenner]] (2017): "Transgender guidelines suggest that I no longer be referred to as Bruce in any circumstance. Here are my guidelines: I will refer to the name Bruce when I think it appropriate and the name Caitlyn when I think it appropriate. Bruce existed for sixty-five years, and Caitlyn is just going on her second birthday. That's the reality."&lt;ref&gt;Jenner, Caitlyn (2017). ''The Secrets of My Life''. New York: Grand Central Publishing, vii.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Weinberg argued that it was unclear why the conversion example was deemed objectionable; it consisted of a paragraph explaining that, barring (for example) objections from the rabbi that the prospective convert is not committed to Judaism, those who wish to become Jews can do so.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=264}} Weinberg also argued that Tuvel had not identified Charles Mills as a "defender of voluntary racial identification"; he wrote that this allegation was "just plain false".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;{{efn|Tuvel (2017): "Charles Mills identifies at least five categories generally relevant to the determination of racial membership, including 'self-awareness of ancestry, public awareness of ancestry, culture, experience, and self-identification' (Mills 1998, 50). If ancestry is a less emphasized feature in some places (for example, in Brazil), then Dolezal's exposure to black culture, experience living as someone read as black, and her self-identification could be sufficient to deem she is black in those places. And because there is no fact of the matter about her 'actual' race from a genetic standpoint, these features of Dolezal's experience would be decisive for determining her race in that particular context. The crucial point here is that no 'truth' about Dolezal's 'real' race would be violated."{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017|loc=268}}}}

The criticism that Tuvel had not cited enough women of color may be a fair point, according to Singal, but hardly sufficient to demand a retraction.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Weinberg argued that Tuvel's critics had failed to point out a particular work that was both directly relevant and that had been omitted.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017&gt;Justin Weinberg (1 May 2017).

===Associate editors' apology===
On 30 April 2017—two days before the open letter was delivered to ''Hypatia''—[[Cressida Heyes]], then one of ''Hypatia''{{'}}s 10 associate editors,&lt;ref name=editorialboardJune2017/&gt; posted a 1,000-word apology on her Facebook page from "We, the members of Hypatia's Board of Associate Editors". The post was later removed or made private. On 1 May it was reposted to ''Hypatia''{{'}}s Facebook page, this time ending with "Sincerely, A Majority of the Hypatia's Board of Associated Editors".&lt;ref name=Heyes30April2017&gt;{{cite web |last1=Heyes |first1=Cressida |author-link=Cressida Heyes|title=To our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy |url=https://www.facebook.com/cressida.heyes/posts/10154548425035895 |publisher=Personal Facebook page|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6qKlW3Fnc |archivedate=9 May 2017 |date=30 April 2017|dead-url=yes}}{{pb}}
{{cite web |last1= |first1=|title=To our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy |url=https://www.facebook.com/hypatia.editorialoffice/posts/1852550825032876 |publisher=Hypatia Facebook page|archiveurl=https://archive.is/TbVNM |archivedate=13 May 2017 |date=1 May 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; The apology stated: "We, the members of Hypatia's Board of Associate Editors, extend our profound apology to our friends and colleagues in feminist philosophy, especially transfeminists, queer feminists, and feminists of color, for the harms that the publication of the article on transracialism has caused":

&lt;blockquote&gt;To compare ethically the lived experience of trans people (from a distinctly external perspective) primarily to a single example of a white person claiming to have adopted a black identity creates an equivalency that fails to recognize the history of racial appropriation, while also associating trans people with racial appropriation. We recognize and mourn that these harms will disproportionately fall upon those members of our community who continue to experience marginalization and discrimination due to racism and cisnormativity.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It continued that "clearly, the article should not have been published", and blamed the review process, which had exposed Tuvel to criticism that was "both predictable and justifiable". The associate editors had been asked but declined to name the anonymous reviewers.&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt;

==Reception==
===Author's statement===
Tuvel issued a statement, on 1 May 2017, in response to the associate editors' apology:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I wrote this piece from a place of support for those with non-normative identities, and frustration about the ways individuals who inhabit them are so often excoriated, body-shamed, and silenced. When the case of Rachel Dolezal surfaced, I perceived a transphobic logic that lay at the heart of the constant attacks against her. My article is an effort to extend our thinking alongside transgender theories to other non-normative possibilities.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Citing scholars who have adopted sympathetic positions on transracialism, including [[Adolph L. Reed Jr.]] and [[Melissa Harris-Perry]], she argued that failing to examine the issues would "reinforce gender and racial essentialism". She apologized for the parenthetical reference to Jenner's previous name,&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; which was removed from the article at her request on 4&amp;nbsp;May.{{sfnp|Tuvel|2017}} She also acknowledged that "[a] valid reproach is that my article discusses the lives of vulnerable people without sufficiently citing their own first-person experiences and views." Expressing concern about the personal attacks and hate mail she had received, including from commentators who had not read the article, she wrote that commentators had warned her that failing to retract the article would "be devastating for&amp;nbsp;... [her] personally, professionally, and morally". She argued that "critical thought is in danger", and that "the last place one expects to find such calls for censorship rather than discussion is amongst philosophers".&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=McKenzie1May2017&gt;McKenzie, Lindsay (1 May 2017).

===Early response from ''Hypatia''===
[[Sally Scholz]], the journal's editor-in-chief, offered her support to Tuvel on 6 May, writing that "it is utterly inappropriate for editors to repudiate an article they have accepted for publication (barring issues of plagiarism or falsification of data)." The board of associate editors was a policy board with no role in the journal's management, she wrote, and it had acted independently in drafting and posting the letter.{{efn|[[Sally Scholz|Sally J. Scholz]] (6 May 2017): "As Editor of an academic journal that espouses pluralism and diversity, I believe that Hypatia should publish on a wide array of topics employing a wide array of methodologies. I believe that a community of scholars should contest concepts and engage in dialogue within the pages of the journal to advance our collective project of educating—students and ourselves. I believe that an academic journal is not a blog or a discussion board.{{pb}}"I firmly believe, and this belief will not waver, that it is utterly inappropriate for editors to repudiate an article they have accepted for publication (barring issues of plagiarism or falsification of data). In this respect, editors must stand behind the authors of accepted papers. That is where I stand. Professor Tuvel's paper went through the peer review process and was accepted by the reviewers and by me.{{pb}} "The Associate Editorial board acted independently in drafting and posting their statement. That board is a policy board and plays no role in the day to day management of the Journal.{{pb}} "Since April 30, I have been working with the publisher, Wiley, to respond responsibly and appropriately. We have consulted with the corporation which owns ''Hypatia'' and, together, we are proceeding to refer the situation to Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) for guidance."&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;}} Scholz's position was supported by [[Miriam Solomon]], president of Hypatia Inc.'s board of directors. Scholz, the board and the publisher, John Wiley &amp; Sons, referred the matter to the [[Committee on Publication Ethics]].&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

On 18 May the board issued a statement with a mixed message.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Charlotte (18 May 2017). [http://www.weeklystandard.com/finally-a-meek-and-halfhearted-defense-of-rebecca-tuvel-from-hypatia/article/2008107 "Finally, a (Meek and Halfhearted) Defense of Rebecca Tuvel from Hypatia"], ''The Weekly Standard''.&lt;/ref&gt; Signed by [[Elizabeth S. Anderson|Elizabeth Anderson]], [[Leslie Francis]] (treasurer), Heidi Grasswick (secretary), Solomon (president), and [[Lisa Tessman]] (chair), it acknowledged the "intensity of experience and convictions around matters of intersectionality", and the "egregious history of treatment of women of color feminists and feminists from other marginalized social positions" within academic philosophy. Dismissing the view that objections to the article were too minor to have triggered such a strong response, the board wrote that such a view from "outsiders" reflects "ignorance of the cumulative history of marginalization, disrespect, and misrepresentation of oppressed groups".&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, Lindsay (18 May 2017). [http://www.chronicle.com/article/Journal-s-Board-Disavows/240116 "Journal's Board Disavows Apology for 'Transracialism' Article, Making Retraction Unlikely"], ''The Chronicle of Higher Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; The statement continued that the associate editors had apologized without adequate consultation with the editor-in-chief and on their own behalf only. Condemning the personal attacks on Tuvel, the directors said they stood behind the editor-in-chief and that the article would not be retracted "barring discovery of misconduct or plagiarism". The associate editors' apology remained on ''Hypatia''{{'}}s Facebook page; on 25 May 2017 it was updated to say that it did not represent the views of the editor or board of directors.&lt;ref name=Anderson18May2017/&gt;

===Early academic reaction===
The academic community came out in support of Tuvel, particularly on two popular philosophy blogs, Justin Weinberg's ''[[Daily Nous]]'' and [[Brian Leiter]]'s ''Leiter Reports''.&lt;ref name=Weinberg1May2017/&gt; Leiter wrote that he had "never seen anything like this in academic philosophy".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Mark Newman, chair of the [[Rhodes College]] philosophy department where Tuvel teaches, expressed the department's "complete and unconditional support" for her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Leiter |first1=Brian |author-link=Brian Leiter|title=Philosophy Department at Rhodes College speaks out in support of Prof. Tuvel |url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |website=Leiter Reports |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725134940/http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2017/05/philosophy-department-at-rhodes-college-speaks-out-in-support-of-prof-tuvel.html |archivedate=25 July 2018 |date=4 May 2017|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of harm had been "twisted beyond all recognition" by the associate editors' letter, according to José Luis Bermúdez, professor of philosophy at [[Texas A&amp;M University]].&lt;ref&gt;Bermúdez, José Luis (5 May 2017). [https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2017/05/05/real-damage-done-flare-over-philosophers-journal-article-essay "Defining 'Harm' in the Tuvel Affair"], ''Inside Higher Ed''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] called the episode "a bizarre and ugly attack".&lt;ref name=Singal2May2017/&gt; Several commentators blamed social media's [[call-out culture]] for the speed with which the dispute unfolded.&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oliver7May2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walters5May2017/&gt; In the view of [[Suzanna Danuta Walters]], editor-in-chief of the feminist journal ''[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]'', the associate editors had undermined "the whole process of peer review and the principles of scholarly debate".&lt;ref name=Walters5May2017/&gt; Dan Kaufman, professor of philosophy at [[Missouri State University]], blamed the profession's "increasing obsession with identity politics" and "purity-purges".&lt;ref&gt;Sosis, Cliff (25 January 2018). [http://www.whatisitliketobeaphilosopher.com/#/dan-kaufman/ "Interview with Dan Kaufman"], ''What Is It Like to Be a Philosopher?''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogers Brubaker]], author of ''Trans: Gender and Race in an Age of Unsettled Identities'' (2016), described as "epistemological insiderism" the idea that certain issues can be covered only by particular categories of scholar, and that as a white cisgender woman Tuvel had no standing to argue about transgender or transracial issues. For Brubaker, acknowledging himself as a white cisgender man, this position means not only that certain topics are too easily closed off to particular scholars, but that scholars with [[lived experience]] are expected to focus on those topics.&lt;ref name=Brubaker18May2017/&gt;

[[File:Sally Haslanger, May 2013 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sally Haslanger]]]]
Systemic [[sexism]] within the discipline was cited. There had been tension for some time between ''Hypatia'' and women-of-color philosophers, who believed the journal did not take their work seriously, according to [[Tina Fernandes Botts]]. Botts was critical of the ''Hypatia'' peer-review process that had allowed the paper to be published. "What you do when someone submits the paper is you find people who are experts in that area to review it," she told ''The Chronicle of Higher Education'', "to make sure that it is situated within contemporary scholarly discussions. Obviously they didn’t do that."&lt;ref name=McKenzie6May2017/&gt;

[[Sally Haslanger]], later appointed co-chair of ''Hypatia''{{'s}} governance task force, complained about poor working conditions and the narrow focus of philosophy journals; she wrote that there are days she can "hardly stand the arrogance, the ignorance, the complacency, in short, the bullshit, of the profession". The situation was not Tuvel's fault; she had been unfairly targeted, in Haslanger's view. Of 13,000 professional philosophers in the United States in 2013, she wrote, only 55 were black women and 30 percent of those were PhD students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sally Haslanger|Haslanger, Sally]] (4 May 2017).

===''Hypatia'' resignations and task force===
The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) reported in July 2017 that the associate editors' apology had been inappropriate, and that, when responding to an external complaint about a journal article, an internal inquiry should be held prior to a public response. The associate editors apparently refused to accept the report's conclusions.&lt;ref name=Zamudio-Suaréz21July2017/&gt; On 20 July ''Hypatia'' announced the resignation of Scholz, the editor-in-chief, and Shelley Wilcox, editor of Hypatia Reviews Online. They also announced that a task force would restructure the journal's governance, and that anyone holding an editorial or non-board position with ''Hypatia'' would be "required to sign a statement of adherence" to COPE guidelines.&lt;ref name=Weinberg21July2017&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weinberg |first1=Justin |title=Hypatia’s Editor and Reviews Editor Resign; Authority of Associate Editors 'Temporarily Suspended' |url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |work=Daily Nous |date=21 July 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180726135550/http://dailynous.com/2017/07/21/hypatias-editor-reviews-editor-resign-authority-associate-editors-temporarily-suspended/ |archivedate=26 July 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=resignation&gt;{{cite web |title=Board of Directors' Statement (July 20, 2017) |url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |website=Hypatia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724105806/http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/statements/board-directors-statement-july-20-2017/ |date=20 July 2017|archivedate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=interim&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuation of Interim Editorial Team|url=http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|publisher=Hypatia News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043838/http://www.hypatiaphilosophy.org/Editorial/index.html|date=20 July 2017|archivedate=1 December 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberg3Aug2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Further Developments at Hypatia|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/08/03/further-developments-at-hypatia/|work=Daily Nous|date=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a statement from the associate editors, the board asked them, on 17 July, to resign or it would suspend the journal's governance documents, thereby removing the associate editors' authority to choose the next editor. Eight of the associate editors resigned. In a resignation letter, they argued that feminist philosophy had an ethical commitment to transform philosophy into "a discipline that honors the perspectives and welcomes the scholarly contributions of historically marginalized groups, including people of color, trans* people, disabled people, and queer people".&lt;ref name=Weinberg24July2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weinberg|first1=Justin|title=Hypatia's Associate Editors Resign|url=http://dailynous.com/2017/07/24/hypatias-associate-editors-resign/|work=Daily Nous|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Flaherty|first1=Colleen|title=(Another) Shake-Up at 'Hypatia'|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/07/24/divisions-within-hypatias-editorial-board-lead-resignations-top-editors|work=Inside Higher Ed|date=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zamudio-Suaréz21July2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zamudio-Suaréz|first1=Fernanda|title=Months After 'Transracialism' Flap, Controversy Still Rages at Feminist Philosophy Journal|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Months-After/240722|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fallen tree2.jpg|right|thumb|A fallen tree in a forest]]

"'''If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?'''" is a philosophical [[thought experiment]] that raises questions regarding [[observation]] and [[perception]].

==History==
Philosopher [[George Berkeley]], in his work, ''[[A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710), proposes, "But, say you, surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park [...] and nobody by to perceive them.&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', 1734. section 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [...] The objects of sense exist only when they are perceived; the trees therefore are in the garden [...] no longer than while there is somebody by to perceive them."&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge'', 1734. section 45.&lt;/ref&gt; (It is worth noting that the quote from section 45 is arguably a statement of an ''objection'' to Berkeley's view, and not a proclamation of it.) Nevertheless, Berkeley never actually wrote about the question.&lt;ref&gt;Whether Berkeley thought objects continued to exist when unperceived by finite minds, and if so, in what manner, is the subject of serious debate among Berkeley scholars.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some years later, a similar question is posed. It is unknown whether the source of this question is Berkeley or not. In June 1883 in the magazine ''The Chautauquan'', the question was put, "If a tree were to fall on an island where there were no human beings would there be any sound?" They then went on to answer the query with, "No. Sound is the sensation excited in the ear when the air or other medium is set in motion."&lt;ref&gt;''The Chautauquan'', June 1883, Volume 3, Issue 9, p. 543&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to imply that the question is posed not from a philosophical viewpoint, but from a purely scientific one. The magazine ''[[Scientific American]]'' corroborated the technical aspect of this question, while leaving out the philosophic side, a year later when they asked the question slightly reworded, "If a tree were to fall on an uninhabited island, would there be any sound?" And gave a more technical answer, "Sound is vibration, transmitted to our senses through the mechanism of the ear, and recognized as sound only at our nerve centers. The falling of the tree or any other disturbance will produce vibration of the air. If there be no ears to hear, there will be no sound."&lt;ref&gt;''Scientific American'', April 5, 1884, pg 218.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]] is reported to have asked his fellow physicist and friend [[Niels Bohr]], one of the founding fathers of [[quantum mechanics]], whether he realistically believed that 'the moon does not exist if nobody is looking at it.' To this Bohr replied that however hard he (Einstein) may try, he would not be able to prove that it does, thus giving the entire riddle the status of a kind of an infallible [[conjecture]]—one that cannot be either proved or disproved.

The current phrasing appears to have originated in the 1910 book ''Physics'' by [[Charles Riborg Mann]] and [[George Ransom Twiss]]. The question "When a tree falls in a lonely forest, and no animal is near by to hear it, does it make a sound? Why?" is posed along with many other questions to quiz readers on the contents of the chapter, and as such, is posed from a purely physical point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Charles Riborg and George Ransom Twiss. ''Physics''. Scott, Foresman and Co., 1910, p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphysics==

===The possibility of unperceived existence ===
{{Main|George Berkeley}}
'''Can something exist without being perceived?''' – e.g. "''is sound only sound if a person hears it?''" The most immediate philosophical topic that the riddle introduces involves the existence of the tree (and the sound it produces) outside of human perception. If no one is around to see, hear, touch or smell the tree, how could it be said to exist? What is it to say that it exists when such an existence is unknown? Of course, from a scientific viewpoint, it exists.&lt;ref name=plymouth&gt;[http://www.plymouth.edu/department/history-philosophy/philosophy/what-is/ "What is Philosophy? – Analysis", Plymouth State University, Philosophy Department]&lt;/ref&gt; It is human beings that are able to perceive it.&lt;ref name=plymouth/&gt; George Berkeley in the 18th century developed [[subjective idealism]], a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory to respond to these questions, coined famously as "to be is to be perceived". Today meta-physicists are split. According to [[substance theory]], a substance is distinct from its properties, while according to [[bundle theory]], an object is merely its [[sense data]]. The definition of sound, simplified, is a hearable noise. The tree will make a sound, even if nobody heard it, because it could have been heard. 

The answer to this question depends on the definition of sound. Since sound does not exist without our hearing of it, sound does not exist if we do not hear it. However, when a tree falls, the motion disturbs the air and sends off air waves. This physical phenomena which can be measured by instruments other than our ears exists regardless of human perception (seeing or hearing ) of it. Putting together, although the tree falling on the island sends off air waves, it does not produce sound if no human is within the distance where the air waves are strong enough for a human to perceive them.

===Knowledge of the unobserved world===
{{Main|Observer-expectancy effect}}
'''Can we assume the unobserved world functions the same as the observed world?''' – e.g., "''does observation affect outcome?''"&lt;br&gt;
A similar question does not involve whether or not an unobserved event occurs ''predictably'', like it occurs when it is observed. The [[anthropic principle]] suggests that the observer, just in its existence, may impose on the reality observed.
However, most people, as well as scientists, assume that the observer doesn't change whether the tree-fall causes a sound or not, but this is an impossible claim to prove. However, many scientists would argue that a truly unobserved event is one which realises no effect (imparts no information) on any other (where 'other' might be e.g., human, sound-recorder or rock), it therefore can have no legacy in the present (or ongoing) wider physical universe.  It may then be recognized that the unobserved event was absolutely identical to an event which did not occur at all. Of course, the fact that the tree is known to have changed state from 'upright' to 'fallen' implies that the event must be observed to ask the question at all – even if only by the supposed deaf onlooker.
The British philosopher of science [[Roy Bhaskar]], credited with developing [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]] has argued, in apparent reference to this riddle, that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
If men ceased to exist sound would continue to travel and heavy bodies to fall to the earth in exactly the same way, though ex hypothesi there would be no-one to know it&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar, R. (2008 [1975]), ''A Realist Theory of Science'', London: Verso, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This existence of an unobserved real is integral to Bhaskar's ontology, which contends (in opposition to the various strains of positivism which have dominated both natural and social science in the twentieth century) that 'real structures exist independently of and are often out of phase with the actual patterns of events'.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskar, R. (2008[1975]), ''A Realist Theory of Science'', London: Verso, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; In social science, this has made his approach popular amongst contemporary Marxists — notably [[Alex Callinicos]] – who postulate the existence of real social forces and structures which might not always be observable.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, D. (2002), "Marxism", in Marsh D. Stoker, G. (Eds.), ''Theory and Methods in Political Science'', Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, D, &amp; Furlong, P. (2002), “Ontology and Epistemology in Political Science”, in Marsh D. Stoker, G. (Eds.), ''Theory and Methods in Political Science'', Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Callinicos, A. (2006), The Resources of Critique, Cambridge: Polity, pp. 155–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The dissimilarity between sensation and reality===
{{Main|Qualia}}
'''What is the difference between what something is, and how it ''appears''?''' – e.g., ''"sound is the variation of [[pressure]] that propagates through matter as a wave''"&lt;br&gt;
Perhaps the most important topic the riddle offers is the division between perception of an object and how an object really is. If a tree exists outside of perception then there is no way for us to know that the tree exists. So then, what do we mean by 'existence', what is the difference between perception and reality? Also, people may also say, if the tree exists outside of perception (as [[common sense]] would dictate), then it will produce [[sound wave]]s. However, these sound waves will not actually ''sound'' like anything. Sound as it is mechanically understood will occur, but sound as it is understood by sensation will not occur. So then, how is it known that 'sound as it is mechanically understood' will occur if that sound is not perceived?

==In popular culture==

Canadian songwriter, [[social activist]] and [[environmentalist]] [[Bruce Cockburn]] poses the question in the chorus of his 1989 song "If a Tree Falls" and frames it with his lyrics as a pressing question regarding the cause and effect of [[deforestation]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

Washington-state-based wilderness conservatory [[Northwest Trek]] used a shortened form of the quote in its mid-1970s television advertisement, as such: "There is no sound unless someone is there to see it or hear it. Experience it at Northwest Trek."{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The quote also forms the bridge of the protagonist's solo number "Waving Through A Window" in the musical ''[[Dear Evan Hansen]]'', in line with the tree motif essential to the plot. The song itself discusses a feeling of isolation through fear of failing in social interactions, as a part of the main character's [[social anxiety disorder]].{{huh|date=July 2018}}{{cn|date=July 2018}}

'''Inductionism''' is the [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]] where laws are "[[induction (philosophy)|induced]]" from sets of data.  As an example, one might measure the strength of electrical forces at varying distances from charges and induce the [[inverse square law]] of [[electrostatics]].

The '''internal measurement''' is one of the measurement theories. From,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Kouichirou Matsuno
|year=2000
|title=What is Internal Measurement? (in Japanese)
|publisher=Seidosha
|location=Japan
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; we introduce the definition of the internal measurement. 
The experience consists of "unremitting measurements". These "unremitting measurements" appear only in the experience. In the experience, if any individual has a relation to another individual then this is a "measurement which identifies another individual", where this measurement enable if the individual can specify the effects from another individual. Moreover, a "measurement which identifies another individual" is unremitting in the experience. As above a measurement such that if any individual measure another individual then this measurement inherent in "unremitting measurements" is called the internal measurement. This theory is found by Kouichirou Matsuno and 
is developed by [[Yukio-Pegio Gunji]].  

There is a likeness between internal measurement and [[endophysics]]. 
However, they have slight difference, that is, internal measurement have before-after logical asymmetry.

'''Jindřich Zelený''' (13 November 1922 &amp;ndash; 11 September 1997) (translation: '''Henry Green''') was a [[Czech (people)|Czech]] philosopher and the author of several books.

==Early years==
He was born in [[Bítovany]], [[Czech Republic]] in 1922 and attended school in [[Chrudim]] and [[Hradec Králové]]. In 1948, Zeleny received a Ph.D. in philosophy and sociology from [[Charles University in Prague]].&lt;ref name="Sobotka"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=cs&amp;u=http://www.phil.muni.cz/fil/scf/komplet/zeleny.html&amp;ei=EHgoSp7pJI_EMfS8jIsF&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522Jind%25C5%2599ich%2BZelen%25C3%25BD%2522%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26sa%3DN|title=Henry Green|last=Sobotka|first=M.|year=1997|work=Reminiscence on the south-west, FC .|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Zelený taught at Charles University, VŠPHV, University of Economics, and [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]] (CSAV) FU. In 1981, he was admitted to the CSAV.&lt;ref name="Sobotka" /&gt;

Most of his work is published in the [[Czech language]].  However, ''The logic of Marx'', translated into [[English language]] and edited by [[Terrell Carver]], was published in 1980. ''Die Wissenschaftslogik bei Marx und "Das Kapital"'' was published 1968 in the [[German language]].

==Later years==
Zelený retired from teaching in 1990, and died in [[Prague]] in 1997.&lt;ref name="Sobotka" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1106">'''League of peace''' ([[Latin]]: '''''foedus pacificum''''') is an expression coined by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his work "[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch]]". The league of peace should be distinguished from a [[peace treaty]] (''pactum pacis'') because a peace treaty prevents or terminates only one war, while the league of peace seeks to end all wars forever. This league does not hold any power of the state, but only exists for "the maintenance and security of the freedom of the state and of other states in league with it, without there being any need for them to submit to civil laws and their compulsion, as men in a state of nature must submit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/kant/kant1.htm|title=Immanuel Kant Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch 1795|accessdate=2007-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert-subject|Philosophy/Eastern|date=November 2008}}
'''''Li''''' （理, pinyin ''[[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones|lǐ]]''）is a concept found in [[neo-Confucian]] [[Chinese philosophy]]. 
It refers to the underlying reason and order of nature as reflected in its organic forms.

It may be translated as "rational [[principle]]" or "law." It was central to [[Zhu Xi]]'s integration of [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. Zhu Xi held that ''li'', together with ''[[qi]]'' (氣: vital, material force), depend on each other to create structures of nature and matter. The sum of ''li'' is the ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]''.

This idea resembles the [[Buddhist]] notion of ''li'', which also means "principle." Zhu Xi maintained, however, that his notion is found in ''[[I Ching]]'' (''Book of Changes''), a classic source of [[Chinese philosophy]].
Zhu Xi's school came to be known as the School of ''Li'', which is comparable to [[rationalism]]. To an even greater extent than Confucius, Zhu Xi had a naturalistic world-view. His world-view contained two primary ideas: qi and li. Zhu Xi further believed that the conduct of the two of these took places according to Tai Ji.

Holding to Confucius and Mencius' conception of humanity as innately good, Zhu Xi articulated an understanding of ''li'' as the basic pattern of the universe, stating that it was understood that one couldn't live without ''li'' and live an exemplary life. In this sense, ''li'' according to Zhu Xi is often seen as similar to the [[Tao|Dao]] in [[Taoism|Daoism]] or to [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] and also to the [[Dharma]] in [[Hinduism]] . [[Wang Yangming]], a philosopher who opposed Zhu Xi's ideas, held that ''li'' was to be found not in the world but within oneself. Wang Yangming was thus more of an [[idealist]] with a different [[epistemic]] approach.

==Sources==
The philosophical concept of ''li'' is inherently difficult to define and is easily mistranslated into various simplifications of the core idea.
Many philosophers have tried to better explain it, [[Alan Watts]] being one of the prominent 20th century authors on the subject.
{{Quotation|

The ''tao'' is a certain kind of order, and this kind of order is not quite what we call order when we arrange everything geometrically in boxes, or in rows. That is a very crude kind of order, but when you look at a plant it is perfectly obvious that the plant has order. We recognize at once that it is not a mess, but it is not symmetrical and it is not geometrical looking. The plant looks like a Chinese drawing, because they appreciated this kind of non-symmetrical order so much that it became an integral aspect of their painting. In the Chinese language this is called ''li'', and the character for ''li'' means the markings in jade. It also means the grain in wood and the fiber in muscle. We could say, too, that clouds have ''li'', marble has ''li'', the human body has ''li''. We all recognize it, and the artist copies it whether he is a landscape painter, a portrait painter, an abstract painter, or a non-objective painter. They all are trying to express the essence of ''li''. The interesting thing is, that although we all know what it is, there is no way of defining it. Because ''tao'' is the course, we can also call ''li'' the watercourse, and the patterns of ''li'' are also the patterns of flowing water. We see those patterns of flow memorialized, as it were, as sculpture in the grain in wood, which is the flow of sap, in marble, in bones, in muscles. All these things are patterned according to the basic principles of flow. In the patterns of flowing water you will find all kind of motifs from Chinese art, immediately recognizable, including the S-curve in the circle of yang-yin{{sic}}.

So ''li'' means then the order of flow, the wonderful dancing pattern of liquid, because Lao-tzu likens ''tao'' to water:

The great ''tao'' flows everywhere, to the left and to the right, 
It loves and nourishes all things, but does not lord it over them.

A '''necessary evil''' is an unsavoury thing (an [[evil]]) that someone believes must be done or accepted because it is [[Need|necessary]] to achieve a better outcome—especially because possible alternative courses of action or inaction are expected to be worse. It is the "lesser evil" in the [[lesser of two evils principle]], which provides that when given two bad choices, the one that is not as bad as the other is better than the one that is the greater threat.

==History==
The ''Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins'' asserts that "[t]he idea of a necessary evil goes back to Greek", describing the first necessary evil as [[marriage]], and further stating that, "The first example in English, from 1547, refers to a woman."&lt;ref&gt;Julia Cresswell, ''Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins'' (2010), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Fuller]], in his 1642 work, ''[[The Holy State and the Profane State]]'', made another of the earliest recorded uses of the phrase when he described the [[court jester]] as something that "...some count a necessary evil in a Court".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Fuller]], ''[[The Holy State and the Profane State]]'' (1642), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Common Sense]]'', [[Thomas Paine]] described [[government]] as at best a "necessary evil".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Van Ingram, ''Philosophy and Other Bad Habits'' (2011), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evil as a concept is defined by the fact of acts done, considered to be contrary to morality, in other words, [[sin|sinful]], and the execution of any act by an individual, the defining value of the act, is harm is done (in an [[Archaism|archaic]] sense, this indicates acts causing repulsion or discomfort), &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/evil dictionary definition] [[Merriam-Webster]] Accessed February 11, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; additionally, the act is classified as, ''profoundly immoral''. &lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/evil dictionary definition] [[Oxford Dictionaries]] Accessed February 11, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

This being true, the use of the term "evil" in the phrase does not necessarily indicate that the thing being characterized as a "necessary evil" is something that is generally considered an "evil" in the sense of being [[immorality|immoral]] or the enemy of the good. In Fuller's use of the phrase, for example, there is no implication that court jesters are evil people, or having one serves an evil end. The term is most typically used to identify something that is merely an inconvenience or annoyance. Where an author suggests that, "[P]aperwork is a necessary evil, despised but handled with the understanding that a mistake – even a trivial one – could be costly."&lt;ref&gt;Sim B. Sitkin, Laura B. Cardinal, Katinka M. Bijlsma-Frankema, ''Organizational Control'' (2010), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; it is understood that the author is not deeming "[[wikt:paperwork|paperwork]]" to be wicked, immoral, or evil in senses comparable to those.Some thinkers specifically reject the idea of anything that is actually "evil" being necessary. This may manifest as an admonition for moral people to avoid participating in the activities that are perceived as evil:

{{quote|The concept of "necessary evil" is an idea that must be thoroughly rejected. Evil is not necessary, and to accept it as such is to perpetuate it. Evil must be opposed, rejected, and avoided at all costs. It should never be viewed as something that we must unavoidably and inevitably participate in. We trivialize evil when we refer to it as "necessary."&lt;ref&gt;Gebre Menfes Kidus, ''Mystery and Meaning: Christian Philosophy and Orthodox Meditations'' (2011), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alternately, this may manifest as a call to eliminate systems that contain aspects perceived as evil, and replace them with systems that avoid these aspects. For example, speaking of [[political parties]] in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], one author wrote:

{{quote|To say of anything that it is a necessary evil (it is often said of examinations, as of parties) is to give away all morality. It is almost a contradiction in terms. That which is necessary can hardly be evil. If that which is bad is unavoidable, then the game of morality is up. We are involved in a vicious circle from which there is no escape except in the denial of one premiss [sic] or of the other. Either the thing is not necessary, or it is not evil. A non-moral system might have no difficulty in admitting the conception of a necessary evil, but unfortunately it would also exclude the conception of evil altogether. Whatever may be argued philosophically on the point, the idea of a necessary evil is a fallacy as urged in excuse of party, for those who urge it are saying what they would deny if expressed in other terms.&lt;br&gt;

They would certainly say that it was wrong to charge a man with evil conduct who had done only what it was impossible for him to avoid doing. In that case they would say it was not evil; it was only unfortunate or sad. For the same reason party, if necessary, is not evil. But they do not want to say that, for they are convinced that party is an evil. Therefore they must take the alternative and admit that it is not necessary; and their excuse for party is gone.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Hodge, "Ex Parte" ''[[The Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century and After]]'' (1924), Vol. 95, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Italian physician [[Philip Mazzei]], in his correspondence with [[Thomas Jefferson]] in the 1770s, qualified a necessary evil as a restriction without which even greater evils would arise:

{{quote|Necessary Evils are those which cannot be avoided without incurring greater; Among the necessary Evils are the Laws themselves; because they prohibit us to do certain things, or oblige us to do certain others; and consequently they deprive us of a Portion of Liberty, which is the greatest Good. But what would be the Consequence if we had no Laws?&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mazzei, reported in Margherita Marchione and Stanley J. Idzerda, eds., ''Philip Mazzei: Selected Writings and Correspondence'' (1983), p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Oxford Franciscan school''' was the name given to a group of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers that, in the context of the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], gave special contribution to the development of [[science]] and [[scientific method]]ology during the [[High Middle Ages]]. This group includes such names as [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Duns Scotus]] and [[William of Ockham]] as well as [[Thomas of York (Franciscan)|Thomas of York]], [[John Peckham]], and [[Richard of Middleton]].

[[Robert Grosseteste]], was the founder of the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[Franciscan]] school. He was the first scholastic philosophers to fully understand [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] vision of the dual path of [[scientific reasoning]]. Concluding from particular observations into a universal law, and then back again: from universal laws to prediction of particulars. Grosseteste called this "resolution and composition". Further, Grosseteste said that both paths should be verified through experimentation in order to verify the principles. These ideas established a tradition that carried forward to [[Padua]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] in the 17th century.

Under the tuition of Grosseteste and inspired by the writings of [[Arab]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] who had preserved and built upon [[Aristotle]]'s portrait of [[Induction (philosophy)|induction]], Bacon described a repeating cycle of ''observation'', ''hypothesis'', ''experimentation'', and the need for independent ''verification''. He recorded the manner in which he conducted his experiments in precise detail so that others could reproduce and independently test his results — a cornerstone of the [[scientific method]], and a continuation of the work of researchers like [[Al Battani|Albatenius]].

A '''philosopher''' is someone who practices [[Philosophy|philosophy]], which involves [[reason|rational]] inquiry into areas that are outside either [[theology]] or [[science]].&lt;ref name="RussellHistory10"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=10|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "philosopher" comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|φιλόσοφος}} (''philosophos'') meaning "lover of wisdom". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker [[Pythagoras]] (6th century BC).&lt;ref name="tufts"&gt;{{LSJ|filo/sofos|φιλόσοφος|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Classics|classical]] sense, a philosopher was someone who lived according to a certain way of life, focusing on resolving [[Meaning of life|existential questions]] about the [[human condition]], and not someone who discourses upon theories or comments upon authors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''The Inner Citadel''. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, these particular brands of philosophy are [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] ones and those who most arduously commit themselves to this lifestyle may be considered philosophers. A philosopher is one who challenges what is thought to be common sense, doesn’t know when to stop asking questions, and reexamines the old ways of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Perry |first= Prof. Ralph Barton |year= 1914 |chapter= Philosophy I: General Introduction: Philosophy and Common Sense |editors= William Allan Neilson, et al.  |title= Lectures on the Harvard Classics |url= https://archive.org/details/harvardclassics51eliouoft |website= Internet Archive |publisher= P.

In a modern sense, a philosopher is an intellectual who has contributed in one or more branches of philosophy, such as [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], [[epistemology]], [[logic]], [[metaphysics]], [[social theory]], and [[political philosophy]]. A philosopher may also be one who worked in the [[humanities]] or other sciences which have since split from philosophy proper over the centuries, such as [[the arts]], [[history]], [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[theology]], and [[politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Shook|editor-first1=John R. |title=Dictionary of Modern American philosophers |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001/acref-9780199754663-miscMatter-0004 |date=2010 |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=9780199754663 |page=Introduction |doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754663.001.0001 |oclc=686766412 |subscription=yes |quote=The label of "philosopher" has been broadly applied in this Dictionary to intellectuals who have made philosophical contributions regardless of an academic career or professional title. The wide scope of philosophical activity across the timespan of this dictionary would now be classed among the various humanities and social sciences which gradually separated from philosophy over the last one hundred and fifty years. Many figures included were not academic philosophers but did work at the philosophical foundations of such fields as pedagogy, rhetoric, the arts, history, politics, economics, sociology,turtles , psychology, linguistics, anthropology, religion, and theology. Philosophy proper is heavily represented, of course, encompassing the traditional areas of metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, logic, ethics, social/political theory, and aesthetics, along with the narrower fields of philosophy of science, philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of law, applied ethics, philosophy of religion, and so forth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Hatnote|This section is about the history of philosophers as an occupation. For a history of philosophy in general, see [[History of philosophy]].}}

===Ancient Greece and Rome===
The separation of philosophy and science from theology began in Greece during the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="RussellHistory11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|author-link=Bertrand Russell|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin Ltd|location=Great Britain|page=11|via=Internet Archive|url=https://archive.org/details/westernphilosoph035502mbp|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thales]], an astronomer and mathematician, was considered by Aristotle to be the first philosopher of the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek tradition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], Metaphysics Alpha, 983b18.&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Pythagoras]] coined the word, the first known elaboration on the topic was conducted by [[Plato]]. In his ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', he concludes that Love is that which lacks the object it seeks. Therefore, the philosopher is one who seeks wisdom; if he attains wisdom, he would be a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. Therefore, the philosopher in antiquity was one who lives in the constant pursuit of wisdom, and living in accordance to that wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;That is to say philosophically – [[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 27: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements arose as to what living philosophically entailed. These disagreements gave rise to different [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic schools of philosophy]]. In consequence, the ancient philosopher thought in a tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 5: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Theologie, exegese, revelation' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; As the ancient world became schism by philosophical debate, the competition lay in living in manner that would transform his whole way of living in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 30: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, Dictionnaire des philosophes antiques, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the last of these philosophers was [[Marcus Aurelius]], who is widely regarded as a philosopher in the modern sense, but personally refused to call himself by such a title, since he had a duty to live as an [[List of Roman emperors|emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Meditations#THE EIGHTH BOOK]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transition====
According to the [[Classicist]] [[Pierre Hadot]], the modern conception of a philosopher and philosophy developed predominately through three changes:

The first is the natural inclination of the philosophical mind. Philosophy is a tempting discipline which can easily carry away the individual in analyzing the universe and abstract theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 31: Introduction: ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'' by Arnold I. Davidson. Citing Hadot, 'Presentation au College International de Philosophie,' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The second is the historical change through the Medieval era. With the rise of Christianity, the philosophical way of life was adopted by its theology. Thus, philosophy was divided between a way of life and the conceptual, logical, physical and metaphysical materials to justify that way of life. Philosophy was then the servant to theology.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase.

The third is the sociological need with the development of the university. The modern university requires professionals to teach. Maintaining itself requires teaching future professionals to replace the current faculty. Therefore, the discipline degrades into a technical language reserved for specialists, completely eschewing its original conception as a way of life.&lt;ref name='Hadot32'/&gt;

===Medieval era===
In the fourth century, the word philosopher began to designate a man or woman who led a monastic life. [[Gregory of Nyssa]], for example, describes how his sister [[Macrina the Younger|Macrina]] persuaded [[Emmelia of Caesarea|their mother]] to forsake "the distractions of material life" for a life of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;''Readings in World Christian History'' (2013), pp. 147, 149&lt;/ref&gt;

Later during the [[Middle Ages]], persons who engaged with [[alchemy]] was called a philosopher – thus, the [[Philosopher's Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=philosopher&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern era===
{{rquote|right|''Generally speaking, university philosophy is mere fencing in front of a mirror. In the last analysis, its goal is to give students opinions which are to the liking of the minister who hands out the Chairs... As a result, this state-financed philosophy makes a joke of philosophy. And yet, if there is one thing desirable in this world, it is to see a ray of light fall onto the darkness of our lives, shedding some kind of light on the mysterious enigma of our existence.''|[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]}}

Many philosophers still emerged from the Classical tradition, as saw their philosophy as a way of life. Among the most notable are [[René Descartes]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. With the rise of the university, the modern conception of philosophy became more prominent. Many of the esteemed philosophers of the eighteenth century and onward have attended, taught, and developed their works in university. Early examples include: [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Hadot]], ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', trans. Michael Chase. Blackwell Publishing, 1995. p. 271: ''Philosophy as a Way of Life''&lt;/ref&gt;

After these individuals, the Classical conception had all but died with the exceptions of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. The last considerable figure in philosophy to not have followed a strict and orthodox academic regime was [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]]. Wittgenstein: A Very Short Introduction. Oxford University Press, 2001. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern academia===
In the modern era, those attaining advanced degrees in philosophy often choose to stay in careers within the educational system. According to a 1993 study by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (as reported by the [[American Philosophical Association]]), 77.1% of the 7,900 holders of a PhD in philosophy who responded were employed in educational institutions ([[academia]]). Outside academia, philosophers may employ their writing and reasoning skills in other careers, such as medicine{{vague|date=November 2015}}, [[bioethics]], business, publishing, [[free-lance writing]], media, and law.&lt;ref name=APA-nonacademic&gt;{{cite web|author=APA Committee on Non-Academic Careers|title=A non-academic career?|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?page=nonacademic|edition=3rd|date=June 1999|publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]]|accessdate=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key thinkers===
====French social thought====
Some known [[French people|French]] social thinkers are [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Claude Henri Saint-Simon]], Auguste Comte, and [[Émile Durkheim]].

====British social thought====
[[United Kingdom|British]] social thought, with thinkers such as [[Herbert Spencer]], addressed questions and ideas relating to [[political economy]] and [[social evolution]]. The political ideals of [[John Ruskin]] were a precursor of [[social economy]] (''[[Unto This Last]]'' had a very important impact on [[Mohandas K. Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s philosophy).

====German social thought====
Important [[Germany|German]] philosophers and social thinkers included [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Georg Simmel]], and [[Martin Heidegger]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5841">In philosophy, testimony includes any words or utterances that are presented as evidence for the claims they express. This definition may be distinguished from the legal notion of testimony in that the speaker does not have to make a declaration of the truth of the facts.

The role of [[testimony]] in acquiring belief and knowledge has been a relatively neglected philosophical issue. [[CAJ (Tony) Coady]]&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|1]]&lt;/sup&gt; believes that this is because traditional [[epistemology]] has had a distinctly [[Individualism|individualist]] flavour.

However, it seems that many of the beliefs that we hold have been gained through accepting testimony. For example, one may only know that [[Kent]] is a county of [[England]] or that [[David Beckham]] earns $30 million per year because one has learned these things from other people. A more striking example is the belief about one's own birthdate. If you know your birthdate, the evidence for your belief was almost certainly received through testimony.

One of the problems with acquiring knowledge through testimony is that it does not seem to live up to the standards of knowledge (see [[Knowledge#Knowledge in philosophy and the problem of justification|knowledge in philosophy]] ). As Owens notes&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|2]]&lt;/sup&gt;, it does not seem to live up to the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideal of rationality captured in the motto of the [[Royal Society]] – ‘Nullius in verba (no man's word)’. Crudely put, the question is: 'How can testimony give us knowledge when we have no reasons of our own?'

Coady suggests that there are two approaches to this problem:
*'''Reductivism''', which seeks to ‘reduce’ or re-describe our behaviour such that it is not at odds with the traditional view of knowledge
and
*'''Anti-reductivism''', which seeks to fit our behaviour in with a different concept of knowledge. For example, we may compare it to an account of how [[perception]] gives us knowledge or how [[memory]] gives us knowledge directly.

[[David Hume|Hume]] is one of the few early philosophers to offer anything like a sustained account of testimony, this can be found in his ''‘An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding’'' in the section on miracles. The basic idea is that our [[Theory of justification|justification]] for believing what people tell us comes from our experience of the ‘...constant and regular conjunction’&lt;sup&gt;[[#Notes|3]]&lt;/sup&gt; between the state of affairs as people describe it and the actual state of affairs (i.e. our observation that they match). On Coady's schema he is a reductivist.

Coady offers an anti-reductivist account of testimony. He claims that testimony is like perception, we don't have to have reasons for believing it, only an absence of reasons not to believe it. On Coady's account we are justified in being credulous. Proponents of anti-reductivism in the history of philosophy include [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Thomas Reid]].

Perhaps also significant is that [[Bertrand Russell]] argued that [[knowledge by acquaintance]] played an important part in epistemology.

The '''[[positivism]] dispute''' (German: ''Positivismusstreit'') was a political-philosophical dispute between the [[Critical rationalism|critical rationalists]] ([[Karl Popper]], [[Hans Albert]]) and the [[Frankfurt School]] ([[Theodor Adorno]], [[Jürgen Habermas]]) in 1961, about the methodology of the [[social sciences]]. It grew into a broad discussion within German [[sociology]] from 1961 to 1969. The naming itself is controversial, since it was the Frankfurt School proponents who accused the critical rationalists of being positivists—while the latter considered themselves as opponents of positivism. On the political level, it was a dispute between the leftist Frankfurt School proponents supporting revolution, and the allegedly bourgeois critical rationalists supporting reform as the method to be preferred to change society.

==Overview==
The debate began in 1961 in [[Tübingen]], [[West Germany]]  at the Conference of the German Society of Sociology.  The speakers at the conference were invited to discuss the differences between social and natural sciences and the status of [[values]] in the social sciences.

In 1963, the debate was heated by Jürgen Habermas in the ''Festschrift für Adorno'' (writings in honour of Adorno). The debate became more intensely critical at the Sociology Day in [[Heidelberg]] when [[Herbert Marcuse]] joined the discussion. A spirited literary debate between Habermas and Hans Albert sprung up and positivism became the centre of the debate.

The participants also discussed the question of whether Popper's and Albert's critical rationalism had exacerbated ethical problems. The Frankfurt School believed this should be impossible, because as a theory of science critical rationalism is seen to be restricted to the field of knowledge.

The famous dispute inspired a collection of essays which were published in 1969. This book was translated into several languages, including English in 1976 (see below). This collection revived the debate and introduced these ideas to a broader audience.

==Elements of the dispute==
The dispute has its foundation in the value judgment dispute (''[[Werturteilsstreit]]'') in German sociology and economics around the question of whether or not the social sciences is a normative obligatory statement in politics and its measures applied in political actions, and whether or not their measures can be justified scientifically. Consequently, the positivism dispute is also called the Second ''Werturteilsstreit''.

The precursor of the debate about positivism can be traced back to [[Max Horkheimer]]'s essay "''Der neueste Angriff auf die Metaphysik''" ("The Latest Attack on Metaphysics") published in 1937 that criticizes the [[logical positivism]] of the [[Vienna Circle]]. The prolonged criticism of positivism&lt;ref&gt;Critical theorists used the term "positivism" as an encompassing term to refer to various philosophical schools that they thought had been founded on the same methodological basis; these schools included the Vienna Circle, logical positivism, [[Philosophical realism|realism]], and [[logical atomism]] (see [[Andrew Arato]] and Eike Gebhardt (eds), [https://books.google.com/books/about/Essential_Frankfurt_School_Reader.html?id=lMKWPss41rgC&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Essential Frankfurt School Reader''], Continuum, 1978, p. 373).&lt;/ref&gt; led to the formation of two camps: on one side we find "critical rationalism" advanced by Karl Popper and on the other side there is the "critical theory" advanced in the Frankfurt School. This view was strengthened by the fact that Popper's main work, ''[[Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', was published in the main book series of the Vienna Circle. Popper, however, considered himself an opponent of positivism, and his main work was a sharp attack on it.

Both camps accept that sociology cannot avoid a value judgement that inevitably influences subsequent conclusions. In critical rationalism the scientific approach should be maintained in sociology and wherever the use of an induction method is not possible it should be avoided. This leads to a sociology having a firm ground in observations and assured deductions that cannot be ignored in politics.

For critical rationalism, sociology is best conceived as a set of empirical questions subject to scientific investigation. Frankfurt School "critical theory," by contrast, denies that sociology can be severed from its "metaphysical" heritage; empirical questions are necessarily rooted in substantive philosophical issues. Drawing on concepts from Hegelian and Marxian traditions, critical theory conceives of society as a concrete totality, a social environment in which various "psycho-social agencies" (family, authorities, peers, mass media) shape individual consciousness.

According to the Frankfurt school, it is important to discover the society's fabrics to allow for individuals to overcome being cornered. Critical rationalism considers this goal to be impossible and any attempts (changing society out of possibly non-scientific deductions) to be dangerous. The Frankfurt school counters critical rationalism as being itself cornered, disallowing itself from asking scientific questions when just some methods are not available. Looking back in history "It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but their social existence that determines their consciousness" ([[Karl Marx]]). The social existence determines the mindset of scientists as well. All the hypotheses generated by scientists (which would need to be falsified) are limited to this society's thinkable. While critical rationalism provides methods that are supposed to have an influence on society it is this totality that makes the reforms advocated by Popper ineffective for noticeable changes.

Popper, in contrast, held that the Frankfurt school view was [[historicism|historicist]] ideology failing to see that any attempt to cause a total change of society (i.e., revolution) leads to violence, and that society should better be changed step by step (by reforms) to solve specific problems and abolish specific evils. According to Popper, individuals, including scientists, are free to decide, and are perhaps restricted by their social existence, but not totally determined by it. Changes may then look ineffective and very slow, but will accumulate over time. Popper thinks it is the lesser evil compared to violent revolutions, since such reforms can be undone if they turn out to only make things worse, while revolutions usually lead to lengthy periods of tyranny. Thus, for Popper, the method of reforms should be preferred.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51340">{{C. S. Peirce articles}}
"'''Pragmaticism'''" is a term used by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] for his pragmatic philosophy starting in 1905, in order [[stipulative definition|to distance himself and it]] from [[pragmatism]], the original name, which had been used in a manner he did not approve of in the "literary journals". Peirce in 1905 announced his coinage "pragmaticism", saying that it was "ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers" (''Collected Papers'' (CP) 5.414). Today, outside of philosophy, "pragmatism" is often taken to refer to a compromise of aims or principles, even a ruthless search for mercenary advantage. Peirce gave other or more specific reasons for the distinction in a surviving draft letter that year and in later writings. Peirce's pragmatism, that is, pragmaticism, differed in Peirce's view from other pragmatisms by its commitments to the spirit of strict logic, the immutability of truth, the reality of infinity, and the difference between (1) actively willing to control thought, to doubt, to weigh reasons, and (2) willing not to exert the will, willing to believe.&lt;ref name=NA&gt;Peirce (1908), "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, CP 6.452-485, EP 2:434-450, and elsewhere. See the discussion of pragmatism toward the end. Depending on the edition, it may appear in Section V or in an "additament" afterward.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view his pragmatism is, strictly speaking, not itself a whole philosophy, but instead a general method for the clarification of ideas. He first publicly formulated his pragmatism as an aspect of scientific logic along with [[Founders of statistics|principles of statistics]] and modes of inference in his "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" series of articles in 1877-8.

==Pragmatic maxim==

Whether one chooses to call it "[[pragmatism]]" or "pragmaticism"—and Peirce himself was not always consistent about it even after the notorious renaming—his conception of pragmatic philosophy is based on one or another version of the so-called "[[pragmatic maxim]]".  Here is one of his more emphatic statements of it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pragmaticism was originally enounced in the form of a maxim, as follows:  Consider what effects, that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings, you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have.  Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object (CP 5.438).&lt;ref&gt;See p. 481 in Peirce, C.&amp;nbsp;S. (1905), "Issues of Pragmaticism", The ''Monist'', vol. 15, pp. 481-499, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA481-IA20 Eprint], ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/details/monistquart15hegeuoft Eprint]. Reprinted ''Collected Papers'' (CP) v. 5, paragraphs 438-463, see 438, and in ''Charles S. Peirce: Selected Writings'', pp. 203-226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1909 ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'', the entry for pragmaticism, written, it now appears, by John Dewey,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce had primary responsibility in the ''Century Dictionary'' for terms in logic, philosophy and other fields, see B:139. "Pragmatism" and presumably "pragmaticism" were among the words in Peirce's charge in the ''Century Dictionary'' - see under "[http://www.pep.uqam.ca/listsofwords.pep?l=P P] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002082422/http://www.pep.uqam.ca/listsofwords.pep?l=P |date=2011-10-02 }}" in the list of words at [http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep PEP-UQÀM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706211228/http://www.pep.uqam.ca/short.pep |date=2011-07-06 }}, the Peirce Edition Project's branch at Université du Québec à Montréal (UQÀM), which is working on [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings]] v. 7: Peirce's work on the ''Century Dictionary''. However, [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph M. Ransdell]] reported that PEP-UQÀM's director François Latraverse informed him that [[John Dewey]] actually wrote the ''Supplement''s definitions of "pragmatic", "pragmatism", etc. See [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.science.philosophy.peirce/6 Ransdell's 2006 January 13 post] to peirce-l.&lt;/ref&gt; was

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''pragmaticism''' (prag-mat'''′''' i-sizm), ''&lt;abbr title=noun&gt;n.&lt;/abbr&gt;'' [''pragmatic'' + ''ism''.] A special and limited form of pragmatism, in which the pragmatism is restricted to the determining of the meaning of concepts (particularly of philosophic concepts) by consideration of the experimental differences in the conduct of life which would conceivably result from the affirmation or denial of the meaning in question. &lt;blockquote style="margin-top:0;font-size:94%"&gt;He [the writer] framed the theory that a conception, that is, the rational purport of a word or other expression, lies exclusively in its conceivable bearing upon the conduct of life.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. To serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition, he begs to announce the birth of the word "''pragmaticism''." &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''C.&amp;nbsp;S.&amp;nbsp;Peirce'', in The Monist, April, 1905, p.&amp;nbsp;166. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Pragmatism's origin==

Pragmatism as a philosophical movement originated in 1872 in discussions in [[The Metaphysical Club]] among Peirce, [[William James]], [[Chauncey Wright]], [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]], [[Francis Ellingwood Abbot]], [[Nicholas St. John Green]], and [[Joseph Bangs Warner]].  The first use in print of the name ''pragmatism'' appears to have been in 1898 by James, who credited Peirce with having coined the name during the early 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;As Brent (B:86) points out, in a letter November 10, 1900 (CP 8:253) to James, Peirce wrote:{{quote|Now, however, I have a particular occasion to write. Baldwin, arrived at J in his dictionary, suddenly calls on me to do the rest of the logic, in the utmost haste, and various questions of terminology come up. &lt;br&gt;Who originated the term ''pragmatism'', I or you? Where did it first appear in print? What do you understand by it?}}
to which James replied (CP 8:253 footnote 8) on a post card dated November 26, 1900, Widener Library (Cambridge, Massachusetts) VB2a:{{quote|You invented 'pragmatism' for which I gave you full credit in a lecture entitled 'Philosophical conceptions and practical results' of which I sent you 2 (unacknowledged) copies a couple of years ago.}}
As Brent also points out (B:88), Peirce — or as Peirce scholars recently say, Dewey ([[#Dewey|see above]]) — in the 1909 ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'' [[s:The Century Dictionary/Volume 12/P|definition of pragmatism]] (''Wikisource''), wrote: {{quote|In an article for "The Monist" for 1905, Mr. Peirce says that he "has used it continually in philosophical conversation since, perhaps, the mid-seventies." The term was publicly introduced in print by Professor William James in 1898 in an address upon "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Realities," in which authorship of the term and of the method is credited to Mr. Peirce.}}
James, William (1898), "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results", delivered before the Philosophical Union of the University of California at Berkeley, August 26, 1898, and first printed in the ''University Chronicle'' 1, September 1898, pp. 287-310. ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalcon00jameuoft#page/n4/mode/1up Eprint]. On [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalcon00jameuoft#page/290/mode/1up p. 290]:: {{quote|I refer to Mr. Charles S. Peirce, with whose very existence as a philosopher I dare say many of you are unacquainted. He is one of the most original of contemporary thinkers; and the principle of practicalism or pragmatism, as he called it, when I first heard him enunciate it at Cambridge in the early 70s is the clue or compass by following which I find myself more and more confirmed in believing we may keep our feet upon the proper trail.}}
James credited Peirce again the 1901-1902 Gifford Lectures that were published as ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'' (p. 444), and then in the 1906 lectures that were published in 1907 as ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', see Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

James, among others, regarded Peirce's 1877-8 "Illustrations of the Logic of Science" series, especially "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) as [[pragmatism]]'s foundation.&lt;ref&gt;See James (1897), ''Will to Believe'' (which James dedicated to Peirce), see p. 124 and footnote via ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=wRMXL4uYEegC&amp;pg=PA124 Eprint]: {{quote|Indeed, it may be said that if two apparently different definitions of the reality before us should have identical consequences, those two definitions would really be identical definitions, made delusively to appear different merely by the different verbiage in which they are expressed.¹&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;¹ See the admirably original "Illustrations of the Logic of Science," by C. S. Peirce, especially the second paper, "How to make our Thoughts clear," {{sic}} in the Popular Science Monthly for January, 1878.}} See also James's 1907 ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce (CP 5.11-12), like James&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1907) ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method of thinking and resolving dilemmas. Peirce differed from James and the early [[John Dewey]], in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.

In a 1906 manuscript,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., "The Founding of Pragmatism", manuscript written 1906, published in ''The Hound &amp; Horn: A Harvard Miscellany'' v. II, n. 3, April–June 1929, pp. 282–5, see 283–4, reprinted 1934 as "Historical Affinities and Genesis" in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, paragraphs 11–13, see 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce wrote that, in the Metaphysical Club decades earlier, Nicholas St. John Green&lt;blockquote&gt;often urged the importance of applying [[Alexander Bain|Bain]]'s definition of belief, as "that upon which a man is prepared to act." From this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism.&lt;/blockquote&gt; James and Peirce, inspired by crucial links among belief, conduct, and [[disposition]], agreed with Green. [[John Shook]] has said, "Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a phenomenalist and [[Fallibilism|fallibilist]] [[empiricism]] as a vital alternative to rationalistic speculation."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Shook|Shook, John]] (undated), "The Metaphysical Club", the ''Pragmatism Cybrary''. [http://www.pragmatism.org/research/metaphysical_club.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatism is regarded as a distinctively [[United States|American]] philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} As advocated by James, [[John Dewey]], [[F. C. S. Schiller]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and others, it has proved durable and popular. But Peirce did not seize on this fact to enhance his reputation, and even coined the word "pragmaticism" to distinguish his philosophical position.

==Clarification of ideas in inquiry==

Pragmatism starts with the idea that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is about conceptions of objects. His pragmatism is a method for fruitfully sorting out conceptual confusions caused, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needful) formal yet not practical differences. It equates any conception of an object with a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of those conceived effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. Those conceivable practical implications are the conception's meaning. The meaning is the consequent form of conduct or practice that would be implied by accepting the conception as true. Peirce's pragmaticism, in the strict sense, is about the conceptual elucidation of conceptions into such meanings — about how to make our ideas clear. Making them true, in the sense of proving and bearing them out in fruitful practice, goes beyond that. A conception's truth is its correspondence to the real, to that which would be found by investigation taken far enough. A conception's actual confirmation (if it occurs) is neither its meaning nor its truth ''per se'', but an actual upshot.

In "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]",&lt;ref&gt;See also "The Logic of Relatives," The ''Monist'', Vol. 7, 1897, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA161 161]-217 (via ''Google Books''). Reprinted in CP, v. 3, paragraphs 456-552.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce discusses three grades of clearness of conception: &lt;br&gt;
:1. Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.
:2. Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its definition's parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea ''distinct'', that is, clarified by analysis of just what elements make the given idea applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce calls such a definition "nominal" (CP 5.553).
:3. Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's effects as conceived of, such as can lead to fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduces that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]].

By way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Presuppositions of logic|presuppositions of reasoning]] in general. To reason is to presuppose (and at least to hope), as a principle of the reasoner's self-regulation, that the truth is independent of our vagaries of opinion and is discoverable. In clearness's second grade (the "nominal" grade), he defines truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object, and the real as the object (be it a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law) to which a true sign corresponds, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite [[Community of inquiry|community of inquirers]] think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defines truth — not as actual consensus, such that to inquire would be to poll the experts — but as that which ''would'' be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.&lt;ref name=Induction&gt;"That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead", in Peirce, C.&amp;nbsp;S. (1878 April), "The Probability of Induction", p. 718 (''Internet Archive'' ''[https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up Eprint]) ''in ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 705-18. Reprinted (''Chance, Love, and Logic'', pp. 82-105), (CP 2.669-93), (''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'', pp. 174-89), (W 3:290-305), (EP 1:155-69).&lt;/ref&gt; (Peirce held that one cannot have absolute theoretical assurance of having actually reached the truth, and later said that the confession of inaccuracy and one-sidedness is an essential ingredient of a true abstract statement.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1902), "''Logical''" in "Truth and Falsity and Error", ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'' v. 2, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Truth%20is%20that%20concordance%22 p. 718]. Reprinted CP v. 5, paragraphs 565-566.&lt;/ref&gt;) Peirce argues that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability. For more on Peirce's theory of truth, see the Peirce section in [[Pragmatic theory of truth#Peirce|Pragmatic theory of truth]]. Peirce's discussions and definitions of truth have influenced several epistemic truth theorists and been used as foil for [[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]] and [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] theories of truth.

Peirce said that a conception's meaning consists in "[[Pragmatic maxim#2|all general modes of rational conduct]]" implied by "acceptance" of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism, since a conception is general, does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth, nor does it equate its meaning, much less its truth (if it is true), with the conceived or actual benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true in what it purports. If it is true, its truth is not transitory but instead immutable and independent of actual trends of opinion. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to "vulgar" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and [[Machiavelli]]an search for mercenary or political advantage. Rather, Peirce's pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental [[Pragmatic maxim#6|reflection]]&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), CP 5.13 note 1&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification&lt;ref&gt;See CP 1.34 [http://www.textlog.de/4220.html Eprint] (in "The Spirit of Scholasticism"), where Peirce attributes the success of modern science not so much to a novel interest in verification as to the improvement of verification.&lt;/ref&gt; to test the truth of putative knowledge.

Peirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of ''definitions and the clearness of ideas'', is a department within his theory of inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.cspeirce.com/homepage/ransdell.htm Joseph Ransdell]'s comments and his tabular list of titles of Peirce's proposed list of memoirs in 1902 for his Carnegie application, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/intro/l75intro.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; which he variously called "Methodeutic" and "Philosophical or Speculative Rhetoric". He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work.

Peirce called his pragmatism "the logic of [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1903), "Pragmatism — The Logic of Abduction", CP v. 5, paragraphs 195-205, especially paragraph 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; that is, the logic of inference to explanatory hypotheses. As a method conducive to hypotheses as well as predictions and testing, pragmatism leads beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives, namely:

:* [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] from self-evident truths, or ''[[rationalism]]'';

:* [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] from experiential phenomena, or ''[[empiricism]]''.

His approach is distinct from [[foundationalism]], empiricist or otherwise, as well as from [[coherentism]], by the following three dimensions:

:* Active process of theory generation, with no prior assurance of truth;

:* Subsequent application of the contingent theory in order to clarify its logical and practical implications;

:* Testing and evaluation of the provisional theory's utility for the ''[[anticipation]]'' of future experience, and that in dual senses of the word: ''[[prediction]]'' and ''control''. Peirce's appreciation of these three dimensions serves to flesh out a [[physiognomy]] of inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization ''simpliciter'', which is merely the relabeling of phenomenological patterns.  Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the [[scientific method]] was proposed as an [[epistemology]] for philosophical questions.

A theory that proves itself more successful than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth employed by scientists.

In "[http://www.peirce.org/writings/p107.html The Fixation of Belief]", Peirce characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to settle disturbances or conflicts of belief, irritating, inhibitory doubts, belief being that on which one is willing to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry not only as a special kind of inquiry in a broader spectrum, but also, like inquiry generally, as based on actual doubts, not mere verbal doubts (such as [[hyperbolic doubt]]), which he held to be fruitless, and it let him also frame it, by the same stroke, as requiring that proof rest on propositions free from actual doubt, rather than on ultimate and absolutely indubitable propositions. He outlined four methods, ordered from least to most successful in achieving a secure fixation of belief:
# The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) — which brings comforts and decisiveness, but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views, as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well fail to avoid noticing when another's opinion is as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.
# The method of authority — which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to suppress doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.
# The method of the ''a priori'' — which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of "what is agreeable to reason." Thereby it depends on fashion in paradigms and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The method of science — the only one whereby inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong ([[fallibilism]]), and purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", 1898, Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published CP 1.616-48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., comm.), 105-22, reprinted in EP 2:27-41.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn should not be bound to the other methods and to practical ends; reason's "first rule" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1899), "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], CP v. 1, paragraphs 135-40. [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; What recommends the scientific method of inquiry above all others is that it is deliberately designed to arrive, eventually, at the ultimately most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can eventually be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce shows how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.

==Pragmaticism's name==

[[Image:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William James]]&lt;br&gt;1842–1910]] [[Image:FCSSchiller Slosson1917.jpg|thumb|upright|[[F. C. S. Schiller]]&lt;br&gt;1863–1937]]  It is sometimes stated that James' and other philosophers' use of the word ''pragmatism'' so dismayed Peirce that he renamed his own variant ''pragmaticism''. [[Susan Haack]] has disagreed,&lt;ref&gt;1998, ''Manifesto of a Passionate Moderate'', Chicago IL: University of Chicago Press, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; pointing out the context in which Peirce publicly introduced the latter term in 1905. Haack's excerpt of Peirce begins below at the words "But at present...," and continues with some ellipses. The fuller excerpt below supports her case further:
{{quote|[The] word "pragmatism" has gained general recognition in a generalised sense that seems to argue power of growth and vitality. The famed psychologist, [[William James|James]], first took it up, seeing that his "radical empiricism" substantially answered to the writer's definition of pragmatism, albeit with a certain difference in the point of view. Next, the admirably clear and brilliant thinker, Mr. [[F. C. S. Schiller|Ferdinand C. S. Schiller]], casting about for a more attractive name for the "anthropomorphism" of his ''Riddle of the Sphinx'', lit, in that most remarkable paper of his on ''Axioms as Postulates'', upon the same designation "pragmatism," which in its original sense was in generic agreement with his own doctrine, for which he has since found the more appropriate specification "humanism," while he still retains "pragmatism" in a somewhat wider sense. So far all went happily. But at present, the word begins to be met with occasionally in the literary journals, where it gets abused in the merciless way that words have to expect when they fall into literary clutches. Sometimes the manners of the British have effloresced in scolding at the word as ill-chosen, —ill-chosen, that is, to express some meaning that it was rather designed to exclude. So then, the writer, finding his bantling "pragmatism" so promoted, feels that it is time to kiss his child good-by and relinquish it to its higher destiny; while to serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition, he begs to announce the birth of the word "pragmaticism", which is ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, on p [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 p. 165]-166 in "What Pragmatism Is", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 2, April 1905, pp. 161-81, reprinted CP 5.411-37, see 5.414.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Then, in a surviving draft letter to Calderoni, dated by the CP editors as ''circa'' that same year 1905, Peirce said regarding his above-quoted discussion:
{{quote|In the April number of the ''Monist'' I proposed that the word 'pragmatism' should hereafter be used somewhat loosely to signify affiliation with [[F. C. S. Schiller|Schiller]], [[William James|James]], [[John Dewey|Dewey]], [[Josiah Royce|Royce]], and the rest of us, while the particular doctrine which I invented the word to denote, which is your first kind of pragmatism, should be called 'pragmaticism.' The extra syllable will indicate the narrower meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Signor Calderoni (c. 1905), CP 8.205. See under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/pragmaticism.html Pragmaticism] in the CDPT.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Indeed in the ''Monist'' article Peirce had said that the coinage "pragmaticism" was intended "to serve the precise purpose of expressing the original definition". Of course this does not mean that Peirce regarded his fellow pragmatist philosophers as word-kidnappers. To the contrary he had said, regarding James's and Schiller's uses of the word "pragmatism": "So far, all went happily." So it would seem that Peirce intended the coinage "pragmaticism" for two distinguishable purposes: (1) protection from literary journals and word-kidnappers, and (2) reference strictly to his own form of pragmatism, as opposed even to other pragmatisms that had not moved him to the new name. In the letter to Calderoni, Peirce did not reject all significant affiliation with fellow pragmatists, and instead said "the rest of us". Nor did he reject all such affiliation in later discussions.

However, in the following year 1906, in a manuscript "A Sketch of Logical Critics",&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 451-62, see pp. 457-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce wrote:
{{quote|I have always fathered my pragmati&lt;/em&gt;ci&lt;/em&gt;sm (as I have called it since James and Schiller made the word [pragmatism] imply "the will to believe," the mutability of truth, the soundness of Zeno's refutation of motion, and pluralism generally), upon Kant, Berkeley, and Leibniz....}}
(Peirce proceeded to criticize J.&amp;nbsp;S. Mill but acknowledged probable aid from Mill's ''Examination''.)

Then, in 1908, in his article "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]",&lt;ref name=NA/&gt; mentioning both James and the journalist, pragmatist, and literary author [[Giovanni Papini]], Peirce wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1871, in a Metaphysical Club in Cambridge, Mass., I used to preach this principle as a sort of logical gospel, representing the unformulated method followed by Berkeley, and in conversation about it I called it "Pragmatism." In December 1877 and January 1878 I set forth the doctrine in the ''Popular Science Monthly'', and the two parts&lt;ref&gt;Peirce refers to "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" and "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]".&lt;/ref&gt; of my essay were printed in French in the ''Revue Philosophique'', volumes vi. and vii. Of course, the doctrine attracted no particular attention, for, as I had remarked in my opening sentence, very few people care for logic. But in 1897 Professor James remodelled the matter, and transmogrified it into a doctrine of philosophy, some parts of which I highly approved, while other and more prominent parts I regarded, and still regard, as opposed to sound logic. About the time Professor Papini discovered, to the delight of the Pragmatist school, that this doctrine was incapable of definition,&lt;ref&gt;See for example "What Pragmatism Is Like", a translation published in October 1907 in ''Popular Science Monthly'' v. 71, pp. 351–8. ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=DKkWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA351 Eprint]. The original Italian: "Introduzione al pragmatismo", ''Leonardo'' series 3, ''anno'' 5, n. 1, February 1907, pp. 26-37, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=DublAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA26 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; which would certainly seem to distinguish it from every other doctrine in whatever branch of science, I was coming to the conclusion that my poor little maxim should be called by another name; and accordingly, in April 1905, I renamed it ''Pragmaticism''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peirce proceeded in "A Neglected Argument" to express both deep satisfaction and deep dismay with his fellow pragmatists. He singled [[F. C. S. Schiller]] out by name and was vague about which among the others he most particularly referred to. Peirce wrote "It seems to me a pity they should allow a philosophy so instinct with life to become infected with seeds of death...."
{|
|-
| vAlign=top | Peirce remained allied with them about:
* the reality of generals and habits, to be understood, as are [[hypostatic abstraction]]s, in terms of potential concrete effects even if unactualized;
* the falsity of necessitarianism;
* the character of consciousness as only "visceral or other external sensation".
| vAlign=top | but was dismayed with their "angry hatred of strict logic" and saw seeds of philosophical death in:
* their view that "truth is mutable";
* their view that infinity is unreal; and
* "such confusions of thought as of active willing (willing to control thought, to doubt, and to weigh reasons) with willing not to exert the will (willing to believe)".
|}
There has been some controversy over Peirce's relation to other pragmatists over the years and over the question of what is owed to Peirce, with visible crests in titles such as literary essayist [[Edward Dahlberg]]'s "Cutpurse Philosopher"&lt;ref&gt;In ''Alms for Oblivion'', University of Minnesota Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; about James, in which Dahlberg claimed that Peirce had "tombstone reticences" about making accusations, and Kenneth Laine Ketner's and [[Walker Percy]]'s ''A Thief of Peirce'',&lt;ref&gt;University Press of Mississippi, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Percy described himself as "a thief of Peirce" (page 130). Meanwhile, Schiller, James's wife Alice, and James's son Henry James III believed that James had a habit of overstating his intellectual debts to others such as Peirce.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Gerald E., ''William James: His Life and Thought'', Yale University Press, 2001. See pp. 491-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another manuscript "A Sketch of Logical Critic" dated by the CP editors as 1911,&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt of it appears as "Achilles and the Tortoise" in CP 6.177-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce discussed one of [[Zeno's paradoxes]], that of Achilles and the Tortoise, in terms of James's and others' difficulties with it. Peirce therein expressed regret at having used a "contemptuous" manner about such difficulties in his 1903 Harvard lectures on pragmatism (which James had arranged), and said of James, who had died in August 1910: "Nobody has a better right to testify to the morality of his attitude toward his own thoughts than I, who knew and loved him for forty-nine or fifty years. But owing to his almost unexampled incapacity for mathematical thought, combined with intense hatred for logic — probably for its pedantry, its insistence on minute exactitude — the ''gêne'' of its barbarous formulations, etc. rendered him an easy victim to Zeno and the Achilles....",&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.182.&lt;/ref&gt; called James "about as perfect a lover of truth as it is possible for a man to be...."&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.183.&lt;/ref&gt; and said: "In speaking, then, of William James as I do, I am saying the most that I could of any man's intellectual morality; and with him this was but one of a whole diadem of virtues."&lt;ref&gt;From CP 6.184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question "'''Why is there anything at all?'''", or, "'''Why is there something rather than nothing?'''" has been raised or commented on by philosophers including [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/philosophicalwor00leibuoft "Principles of Nature and Grace"], 1714, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalwor00leibuoft#page/212/mode/2up/search/209 Article 7].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Heidegger]] − who called it '''the fundamental question of [[metaphysics]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Heidegger)|Introduction to Metaphysics]]'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London (1959), pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fundamental Question|url=https://www.hedweb.com/witherall/existence.htm|website=www.hedweb.com|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Geier|first1=Manfred|title=Wittgenstein und Heidegger: Die letzten Philosophen|publisher=Rowohlt Verlag|isbn=9783644045118|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=JUiFDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP166|page=166|language=de|date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; − and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;"Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it is."

==Overview==
The question is general, rather than concerning the existence of anything specific such as the [[universe]] or [[multiverse]], the [[Big Bang]], [[mathematics|mathematical laws]], [[physical law]]s, [[time]], [[consciousness]] or [[God]]. It can be seen as an open [[metaphysical]] question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metaphysics special: Why is there something rather than nothing?|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23130890-400-metaphysics-special-why-is-there-something-rather-than-nothing/|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sorensen|first1=Roy|title=Nothingness|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nothingness/|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=26 April 2017|date=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dascal|first1=Marcelo|title=Leibniz: What Kind of Rationalist?|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781402086687|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Da_oP3sJs1oC&amp;pg=PA452|page=452|language=en|date=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldschmidt|first1=Tyron|title=The Puzzle of Existence: Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136249228|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=3XDMAgAAQBAJ|language=en|date=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the question's adequacy==

Some argue that the question may be inherently illogical; if the universe had no beginning point then its non-existence might never have been an option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Lynds|first1=Peter|title=Why there is something rather than nothing: The finite, infinite and eternal|eprint=1205.2720|date=10 January 2012|class=physics.gen-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study has suggested a model that eliminates the [[initial singularity]] and predicts that the Universe had no beginning but existed forever as a kind of quantum [[potential]] before 'collapsing' into the Big Bang's hot dense state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What if the universe had no beginning?|url=http://earthsky.org/space/what-if-the-universe-had-no-beginning|website=earthsky.org|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kosmologie: Quantentrick schafft Urknall-Singularität ab|url=http://www.spektrum.de/news/quantentrick-schafft-urknall-singularitaet-ab/1332377|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ein Universum ohne Urknall, Dunkle Materie und Dunkle Energie|url=http://www.forschung-und-wissen.de/nachrichten/astronomie/ein-universum-ohne-urknall-dunkle-materie-und-dunkle-energie-13372141|website=Forschung und Wissen|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other research a possible consequence of "[[rainbow gravity]]" might be that the universe had no beginning with time stretching back infinitely without an initial singularity and Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Clara|title=In a "Rainbow" Universe Time May Have No Beginning|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/rainbow-gravity-universe-beginning/|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=26 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly physics may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before the Big Bang, but 'started' with the &lt;!--beginning point--&gt;Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Big Bang? Quantum equation predicts universe has no beginning|url=https://phys.org/news/2015-02-big-quantum-equation-universe.html|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beginning of TIme|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html|website=Stephen Hawking|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related view from [[Augustine of Hippo]] is that time is part of God's creation.

Philosopher [[Stephen Law]] has said the question may not need answering, as it is attempting to answer a question that is outside a spatio-temporal setting, from within a spatio-temporal setting.

==On causation==
Ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] argued that the notion of an [[uncaused cause]] was non-sensical, and that the [[Eternity of the world|universe was eternal]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

[[David Hume]] argued that, whilst we expect everything to have a cause because of our experience of the necessity of causes, a cause may not be necessary in the case of the formation of the universe, which is outside our experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gutting|first1=Gary|title=Talking God: Philosophers on Belief|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=9780393352825|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=O96aCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55|language=en|date=2016-11-22}}{{pn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]] said "I should say that the universe is just there, and that's all",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strangenotions.com/5-reasons-why-the-universe-cant-be-merely-a-brute-fact/|title=5 Reasons Why the Universe Can't Be Merely a Brute Fact : Strange Notions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a "[[brute fact]]" position also taken by physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2016/05/08/the_evidence_is_pretty_incontrovertible_that_he_doesnt_exist_stephen_colberts_favorite_scientist_on_the_universe_naturalism_and_finding_meaning_without_god/|title="The evidence is pretty incontrovertible that he doesn't exist": Stephen Colbert's favorite scientist on the universe, naturalism and finding meaning without God|first=Phil|last=Torres|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Why there is something, rather than nothing?|eprint=1802.02231|date=6 February 2018|class=physics.hist-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Brian Leftow]] has argued that the question cannot have a causal explanation (as any cause must itself have a cause) or a contingent explanation (as the factors giving the contingency must pre-exist), and that if there is an answer it must be something that exists necessarily (i.e. something that just exists, rather than is caused).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.closertotruth.com/series/why-there-something-rather-nothing Brian Leftow - Closer To Truth]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18886">'''Reflectivism''' is a broad [[Umbrella term|umbrella label]], used primarily in [[International relations theory|International Relations theory]], for a range of theoretical approaches which oppose [[Rational choice|rational-choice]] accounts of social phenomena and, perhaps, [[positivism]] more generally.  The label was popularised by [[Robert Keohane]] in his presidential address to the [[International Studies Association]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;The attribution to Keohane is standard -- see e.g. Milja Kurki, ''Causation in International Relations: Reclaiming Causal Analysis''.  Cambridge University Press (2008), p. 124 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The address was entitled "International Institutions: Two Approaches", and contrasted two broad approaches to the study of [[international institution]]s (and international phenomena more generally).  One was "rationalism", the other what Keohane referred to as "reflectivism".  Rationalists — including [[Realism (international relations)|realists]], [[Neorealism (international relations)|neo-realists]], [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberals]], [[Neoliberalism in international relations|neo-liberals]], and scholars using [[Game theory|game-theoretic]] or [[Expected utility|expected-utility]] [[Economic model|models]] — are theorists who adopt the broad theoretical and [[ontological]] commitments of [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice theory]].

== Rationalism vs. reflectivism ==
Keohane characterised rationalism in the following fashion:

:[Rationalists accept] what [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] has referred to a "substantive" conception of rationality, characterizing "behaviour that can be adjudged objectively to be [[Optimal decision|optimally]] adapted to the situation" (Simon, 1985:294).  As Simon has argued, the principle of [[Decision-making models#Rationality|substantive rationality]] generates hypotheses about actual human behaviour only when it is combined with certain [[Duhem–Quine thesis|auxiliary]] [[Scientific theory#Assumptions in formulating theories|assumptions]] about the structure of [[utility function]]s and the formation of expectations.

:Since this research program is rooted in [[exchange theory]], it assumes [[scarcity]] and competition as well as [[rationality]] on the part of the actors.  Rationalistic theories of [[institution]]s view institutions as affecting patterns of [[Cost#Comparing private, external, social, and psychic costs|costs]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert O. Keohane, "International Institutions: Two Approaches", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 32, 4 (Dec. 1988), pp. 381, 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keohane went on to contrast this with the approach of "reflective" scholars:
:These authors, of whom the best-known include [[Hayward Alker]], [[Richard K. Ashley|Richard Ashley]], [[Friedrich Kratochwil]], and [[John Ruggie]], emphasize the importance of the "[[Intersubjectivity|intersubjective]] meanings" of international institutional activity (Kratochwil and Ruggie, 1986:765).  In their view, understanding how people think about institutional [[Social norms|norms]] and rules, and the [[discourse]] they engage in, is as important in evaluating the significance of these norms as measuring the behavior that changes in response to their invocation.

:These writers emphasize that individuals, local organizations, and even states develop within the context of more encompassing institutions.  Institutions do not merely reflect the [[Preference (economics)|preferences]] and power of the units constituting them; the institutions themselves shape those preferences and that power.  Institutions are therefore constitutive of actors as well as vice versa.  It is therefore not sufficient in this view to treat the preferences of individuals as given [[exogenous]]ly: they are affected by institutional arrangements, by prevailing norms, and by historically contingent discourse among people seeking to pursue their purposes and solve their self-defined problems.

:[I]t would be fair to refer to them as "[[Verstehen|interpretive]]" scholars, since they all emphasize the importance of historical and textual interpretation and the limitations of [[Scientific modelling|scientific models]] in studying world politics. But other approaches also have a right to be considered [[Antipositivism|interpretive]]. I have therefore coined a phrase for these writers, calling them "reflective", since all of them emphasize the importance of human reflection for the nature of institutions and ultimately for the character of world politics.&lt;ref&gt;Keohane, "International Institutions", pp. 381-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflectivism and rationalism are typically used as labels applying not just to the study of international institutions, but of international relations more widely, and even the social world as a whole.  Sociologies and histories of the International Relations discipline have sometimes used the opposition between these approaches to describe one of the central fault-lines within the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ole Waever, "The Rise and Fall of the Inter-Paradigm Debate", in Steve Smith, Ken Booth and Marysia Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond''.  Cambridge University Press (1996), pp. 164-70.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflexivity ==
There may be another sense, not specifically discussed by Keohane, in which the label is apt. Reflectivist scholars tend to emphasise the inherent [[Reflexivity (social theory)|reflexivity]] both of theory and of the social world it studies.  Unlike the term ''reflectivism'', the concept of [[Reflexivity (social theory)|"reflexivity"]] has wide currency outside of international relations, having come to prominence in [[social theory]] in the latter part of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Prominent early works in social theory developing the theme of reflexivity include Anthony Giddens, ''The Constitution of Society: Outline of the Theory of Structuration''.  Polity (1984); [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and Loïc Wacquant, ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology''.  University of Chicago Press (1992); and Ulrich Beck, ''Risk Society: Towards a New Modernity''.  SAGE (1992 [1986]).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflexivity refers to the ways in which elements and phenomena in social life have the capacity to "fold in on", or be "directed towards", themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Similar imagery is used by Matthew Eagleton-Pierce, "Examining the Case for Reflexivity in International Relations: Insights from Bourdieu", ''Journal of Critical Globalisation Studies'' 1 (2009), p. 111–12.  Another explicit analysis of reflexivity in IR, also inspired by the social theory of Pierre Bourdieu, is Anna Leander, "Do We Really Need Reflexivity in IPE? Bourdieu's Two Reasons for Answering Affirmatively", ''Review of International Political Economy'' 9, 4 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, they can produce effects on, or have implications for, their own features, dynamics and existence. An example is the "[[self-fulfilling prophecy]]" (or "self-disconfirming prophecy")&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Ido Oren, "Can Political Science Emulate the Natural Sciences? The Problem of Self-Disconfirming Analysis", ''Polity'' 38, 1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; — a situation in which merely describing, predicting, imagining or believing something to be the case may eventually result in its actually coming to be the case.&lt;ref&gt;In IR, see e.g. David Patrick Houghton, "The Role of Self-Fulfilling and Self-Negating Prophecies in International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 11, 3 (2009); Robert Jervis, ''System Effects: Complexity in Political and Social Life''.  Princeton University Press (1997), pp. 60, 148–50.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, reflectivists emphasise the significance of human [[self-awareness]]: the ways people observe, imagine, describe, predict and theorise about themselves and the social reality around them, and the [[wikt:recursive|recursive]] effect this "self-knowledge" or these "reflections" have on that social reality itself.  Some scholars link reflexivity with [[Structure and agency|the broader debate]], within International Relations theory and social theory more generally, over the relationship between "[[Agency (sociology)|agency]]" and "[[Social structure|structure]]" in the social world.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Kate O'Neill, Jörg Balsiger and Stacy VanDeveer, "Actors, Norms and Impact: Recent International Cooperation Theory and the Influence of the Agent-Structure Debate", ''Annual Review of Political Science'' 7 (2004); Alexander Wendt, "The Agent-Structure Problem in International Relations Theory", ''International Organization'' 41, 3 (1987), p. 359; Daniel Mügge, "Reflexivity in Global Finance: How Agency Matters to Market Change", GARNET Working Paper #14/07 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the relationship between people's capacity to "freely" choose their actions and/or to "make a real difference" to the world around them, and the social "[[Social structure|structures]]" in which people are always embedded, and which may powerfully shape – often against their will or in ways they are unaware of – the kinds of things they are able to do.

Reflectivists also often claim that studying and ''theorising'' about international relations can be, should be, and are necessarily, reflexive. For one thing, they claim, theories about social reality may affect – might change – social reality itself.&lt;ref&gt;A point emphasised, among many others, by Brent J. Steele, ''Ontological Security in International Relations: Self-Identity and the IR State''.  Routledge (2008), pp. 150, 160-64 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of (neo-)realism have raised the possibility that realist theories, for instance, may act as [[Self-fulfilling prophecy|self-fulfilling prophecies]].  To the extent that they are taken by theorists and practitioners to be the "common sense" of international politics, diplomacy and policy-making, those theories may encourage precisely the kind of mistrust, ruthless competition and amorality that they posit to be natural and inherent features of the international realm.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Annette Freyburg-Inan, ''What Moves Man: The Realist Theory of International Relations and Its Judgment of Human Nature''. SUNY Press (2003); Alexander Wendt, ''Social Theory of International Politics''.  Cambridge University Press (1999), pp. 368-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Familiar methodological examples of the capacity of observation and theorising to affect the object/phenomena of study include the "[[observer-expectancy effect]]" and long-running concerns among anthropologists and ethnographers over the possible effect of [[Participant observer#Impact of researcher involvement|participant observation]] on the very people and behaviours being studied.

Furthermore, reflectivists argue, those theories invariably reflect in important ways the social context in which they were produced; so in a sense the social world shapes the theories made of it.&lt;ref&gt;One detailed empirical study is Ido Oren, ''Our Enemies and Us: America's Rivalries and the Making of Political Science''.  Cornell UP (2003); see also Oren, "Is Culture Independent of National Security? How America's National Security Concerns Shaped 'Political Culture' Research", ''European Journal of International Relations'' 6, 4 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; There is often a [[normative]] or ethical aspect to the emphasis on reflexivity.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Brooke Ackerly and Jacqui True, "Reflexivity in Practice: Power and Ethics in Feminist Research on International Relations", ''International Studies Review'' 10, 4 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Reflectivists often argue that theorists should be as self-aware as possible — to reflect as much as possible on the influences ([[Presupposition|assumptions]], [[bias]]es, normative commitments, etc.) that feed into and shape the theories they produce.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Mark Neufeld, "Reflexivity and International Relations Theory", ''Millennium'' 22, 1 (1993), p. 55ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, they should be able to [[Reflexivity (social theory)#Overview|hold their own theories]] to the standards and arguments they set out in those same theories.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Inanna Hamati-Ataya, "The 'Problem of Values' and International Relations Scholarship: From Applied Reflexivity to Reflexivism", ''International Studies Review'' 13, 2 (2011); Christian Büger, "Paradigms, Cultures and Translations: Seven Ways of Studying the Discipline of International Relations", paper presented at the Annual Convention of the International Studies Association, Chicago (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, they should reflect on the likely and possible effects of their theorising.  Some reflectivists (e.g. those of a [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralist]] persuasion) have argued that theorising should itself be understood as a [[Practice (social theory)|practice]], like the human practices that theories study; that it is an act (conscious or unconscious) of intervention into social reality, and that as such it is never "innocent" or "neutral", and there is a degree of responsibility for its consequences that theorists cannot (and should not try to) escape.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Marysia Zalewski, "'All These Theories yet the Bodies Keep Piling Up': Theories, Theorists, Theorising", in Smith, Booth and Zalewski (eds.), ''International Theory: Positivism and Beyond'', pp. 340-53; Steve Smith, "Singing Our World into Existence: International Relations Theory and September 11", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 48, 3 (2004); Jack Amoureux and Brent Steele, ''Reflexivity and International Relations''. Routledge Press (2016); Jack Amoureux, ''A Practice of Ethics for Global Politics: Ethical Reflexivity''. Routledge Press (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reflectivism and post-positivism ==
Reflectivist approaches include such approaches as [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]], [[Feminist theory|feminism]], [[Poststructuralism|post-structuralism]], [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] and [[Critical Theory]].  The challenge launched by these approaches against rationalist approaches, which have largely dominated the IR discipline for the past three decades, was linked to the "Third Debate in International Relations"&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Lapid, "The Third Debate: On the Prospects of International Theory in a Post-Positivist Era", ''International Studies Quarterly'' 33, 3 (Sept. 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; between [[Positivism|positivists]] and [[Postpositivism|post-positivists]]/[[Antipositivism|anti-positivists]]. (The first two disciplinary "Great Debates" are supposed to have pitted (1) [[Realism (international relations)|realists]] vs. so-called "[[Idealism in international relations theory|idealists]]", and (2) [[Behavioralism|behaviouralists]] vs. so-called "traditionalists", the latter favouring historical methods and insights from [[political philosophy]].) Although the large majority of reflectivists oppose [[Positivism#Positivism in science today|positivism]], it might be a mistake to equate reflectivism with post-positivism or anti-positivism, as [[Constructivism (international relations)#Recent developments|(conventional) constructivists]] who are positivist in orientation would nevertheless fall under Keohane's description.  Confusion may be compounded by the fact that in International Relations theory, rationalism&lt;ref&gt;On which, see e.g. Miles Kahler, "Rationality in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; and positivism can often be (erroneously) equated.&lt;ref&gt;That positivism and rationalism are not synonymous is noted e.g. by Milja Kurki and Colin Wight, "International Relations and Social Science", in Timothy Dunne, Milja Kurki and Steve Smith (eds.), ''International Relations Theories: Discipline and Diversity''.  Oxford University Press (2007), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; There are many positivist political scientists who do not adopt [[Rational choice theory|rational-choice]] assumptions.

Some mainstream International Relations scholars, dismissing the importance or value of non-positivist approaches to social science, have reframed the rationalism-reflectivism debate narrowly, as a debate between [[Rationalist-constructivist debate|rationalism and ("conventional") constructivism]], construed as the two major [[Social theory|social theories]] (or "[[Ontology|ontologies]]") of (mainstream) International Relations theory. The rationalism-constructivism debate drew considerable attention within the mainstream at the turn of the 21st century, with some rejecting the starkness of the opposition itself and asserting a fundamental compatibility, or possibility of synthesis, between the two approaches.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. James Fearon and Alexander Wendt, "Rationalism v. Constructivism: A Skeptical View", in Walter Carlsnaes, Thomas Risse and Beth Simmons (eds.), ''Handbook of International Relations'', 1st edn. SAGE (2002), pp. 52-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of reflectivist approaches==
The main criticisms of reflectivist approaches stem from the [[epistemology|epistemological]] differences between reflectivism and what in the social sciences has come to be known as [[positivism]]. Since the 1970s, mainstream International Relations theory has become increasingly, and more insistently, positivist in epistemological orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Maliniak, Amy Oakes, Susan Peterson and Michael J. Tierney, "The International Relations Discipline, 1980-2006", paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, Chicago (2007), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The typical reflectivist rejection of positivist assumptions and methods has led to criticism that the approach cannot make reliable statements about the outside world and even that it has repudiated the entire "social science enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;In reference to "postmodernism", for example, see Peter Katzenstein, Robert Keohane and Stephen Krasner, "International Organization at Fifty: Exploration and Contestation in the Study of World Politics", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (Autumn 1998), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt; Such criticisms are widespread in American political science, and reflectivism is not generally popular in U.S.-based IR scholarship, especially when compared with scholarship originating in Europe and the third world.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Ole Waever, "The Sociology of a Not So International Discipline:  American and European Developments in International Relations", ''International Organization'' 52, 4 (1998); Thomas Biersteker, "The Parochialism of Hegemony:  Challenges for 'American' International Relations", in Arlene Tickner and Ole Waever (eds.), ''International Relations Scholarship Around the World:  Worlding Beyond the West''.  Routledge (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Representative Men''''' is a collection of seven lectures by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], published as a book of [[essay|essays]] in 1850. The first essay discusses the [[great man theory|role played by "great men" in society]], and the remaining six each extol the virtues of one of six men deemed by Emerson to be great:
* [[Plato]] ("the Philosopher")
* [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] ("the Mystic")
* [[Michel de Montaigne]] ("the Skeptic")
* [[William Shakespeare]] ("the Poet")
* [[Napoleon]] ("the Man of the World")
* [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] ("the Writer")

{{History of Scotland}}
The '''Scottish Enlightenment''' ({{lang-sco|Scots Enlichtenment}}, {{lang-gd|Soillseachadh na h-Alba}}) was the period in [[History of Scotland#18th century|18th and early 19th century Scotland]] characterised by an outpouring of intellectual and scientific accomplishments. By the eighteenth century, Scotland had a network of parish schools in the Lowlands and four universities. The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as [[The Select Society]] and, later, [[The Poker Club]] as well as within Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|ancient universities]] ([[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title='Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership', in Stephen Brown and Warren McDougall (eds.), The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Vol. II: Enlightenment and Expansion, 1707–1800|date=2012|publisher=University of Edinburgh|location=Edinburgh|pages=297–309|url=https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. M. Towsey (2010). ''Reading the Scottish Enlightenment: Books and Their Readers in Provincial Scotland, 1750–1820''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharing the [[humanism|humanist]] and [[Rationalism|rationalist]] outlook of the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] of the same time period, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason. In Scotland, the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing [[empiricism]] and practicality where the chief values were improvement, virtue, and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole.

Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy, political economy, engineering, architecture, medicine, geology, archaeology, law, agriculture, chemistry and sociology. Among the Scottish thinkers and scientists of the period were [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[Robert Burns]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Playfair]], [[Joseph Black]] and [[James Hutton]].

The Scottish Enlightenment had effects far beyond Scotland, not only because of the esteem in which Scottish achievements were held outside Scotland, but also because its ideas and attitudes were carried all over Europe and across the [[Atlantic world]] as part of the [[Scottish diaspora]], and by European and American students who studied in Scotland.

==Background==
The roots of the Scottish Enlightenment can be traced to the seventeenth century, when there was impressive Scottish activity and engagement in law, science, medicine, and economics with the European continent. The Scottish Enlightenment of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was a natural development of this earlier engagement and advancement of knowledge.

Union with England in 1707 meant the end of the Scottish Parliament and independence. The parliamentarians, politicians, aristocrats, and [[Wikt:placeman|placemen]] moved to London. Scottish law, however, remained entirely separate from English law, so the civil law courts, lawyers and jurists remained behind in Edinburgh. The headquarters and leadership of the [[Church of Scotland]] also remained, as did the universities and the medical establishment. The lawyers and the divines, together with the professors, intellectuals, medical men, scientists and architects formed a new [[middle class]] elite that dominated urban Scotland and facilitated the Scottish Enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Broadie, ''The Scottish Enlightenment'' (1997) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lynch, ed., ''Oxford Companion to Scottish History'' (2001) pp. 133–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth===
{{Main article|Economy of Scotland in the early modern era}}
At the union of 1707, England had about five times the population of Scotland and about 36 times as much wealth, but there were four Scottish universities (St. Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh) against two English. Scotland experienced the beginnings of economic expansion that allowed it to close this gap.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Campbell, "The Anglo-Scottish Union of 1707. II: The Economic Consequences", ''Economic History Review'', vol. 16, April 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Contacts with England led to a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. Although some estate holders improved the quality of life of their displaced workers, enclosures led to unemployment and forced migrations to the burghs or abroad.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, pp. 288–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The major change in international trade was the rapid expansion of the Americas as a market.&lt;ref name=Mackie1991p292&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; Glasgow particularly benefited from this new trade; initially supplying the colonies with manufactured goods, it emerged as the focus of the tobacco trade, re-exporting particularly to France. The merchants dealing in this lucrative business became the wealthy [[tobacco lord]]s, who dominated the city for most of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, p. 296.&lt;/ref&gt; Banking also developed in this period. The [[Bank of Scotland]], founded in 1695 was suspected of [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sympathies, and so a rival [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] was founded in 1727. Local banks began to be established in burghs like Glasgow and Ayr. These made capital available for business, and the improvement of roads and trade.&lt;ref name=Mackie1991p297&gt;J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Penguin, 1991), {{ISBN|0140136495}}, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education system===
{{Main article|Education in early modern Scotland}}
The humanist-inspired emphasis on education in Scotland culminated in the passing of the [[Education Act 1496]], which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools.&lt;ref name=Bawcutt&amp;Williams2006pp29-30&gt;P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, ''A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry'' (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), {{ISBN|1-84384-096-0}}, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The aims of a network of parish schools were taken up as part of the Protestant programme in the 16th century and a series of acts of the Privy Council and Parliament in [[School Establishment Act 1616|1616]], [[Education Act 1633|1633]], [[Education Act 1646|1646]] and 1696 attempted to support its development and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= |title=School education prior to 1873 |journal=Scottish Archive Network |year=2010 |url=http://www.scan.org.uk/knowledgebase/topics/education_box1.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zt4xQMkX?url=http://www.scan.org.uk/knowledgebase/topics/education_box1.htm |archivedate=2 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 17th century there was a largely complete network of parish schools in the Lowlands, but in the Highlands basic education was still lacking in many areas.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003&gt;R. Anderson, "The history of Scottish Education pre-1980", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, ''Scottish Education: Post-Devolution'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), {{ISBN|0-7486-1625-X}}, pp. 219–28.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the effects of this extensive network of schools was the growth of the "democratic myth", which in the 19th century created the widespread belief that many a "lad of pairts" had been able to rise up through the system to take high office, and that literacy was much more widespread in Scotland than in neighbouring states, particularly England.&lt;ref name="Anderson2003"/&gt; Historians are now divided over whether the ability of boys who pursued this route to social advancement was any different than that in other comparable nations, because the education in some parish schools was basic and short, and attendance was not compulsory.&lt;ref name=Devine2001p91-100&gt;T.

''The Scottish Nation, 1700–2000'' (London: Penguin Books, 2001). {{ISBN|0-14-100234-4}}, pp. 91–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of what the literacy rate actually was, it is clear that many Scottish students learned a useful form of visual literacy that allowed them to organise and remember information in a superior fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel |url=https://www.academia.edu/1817033/The_Shape_of_Knowledge_Children_and_the_Visual_Culture_of_Literacy_and_Numeracy_Science_in_Context_26_2013_215-245 |title=The Shape of Knowledge: Children and the Visual Culture of Literacy and Numeracy|journal=Science in Context |year=2013|volume=26|pages=215–45 |doi=10.1017/s0269889713000045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title='The Child Writer: Graphic Literacy and the Scottish Educational System, 1700–1820'|journal=History of Education|date=2016|volume=45|pages=695–718|url=https://www.academia.edu/23569976/The_Child_Writer_Graphic_Literacy_and_the_Scottish_Educational_System_1700_1820_History_of_Education_45_2016_695-718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 17th century, Scotland had five universities, compared with England's two. After the disruption of the [[Wars of the three kingdoms|civil wars]], [[Scotland under the Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] and purges at the [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration]], they recovered with a lecture-based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high quality liberal education to the sons of the nobility and gentry.&lt;ref name=Anderson2003/&gt; All saw the establishment or re-establishment of chairs of mathematics. Observatories were built at St. Andrews and at King's and Marischal colleges in Aberdeen. [[Robert Sibbald]] (1641–1722) was appointed as the first Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh, and he co-founded the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] in 1681.&lt;ref name=Devine2012p373&gt;T.

Attendance was less expensive and the student body more socially representative.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Houston, ''Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600–1800'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), {{ISBN|0-521-89088-8}}, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; In the eighteenth century Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system.&lt;ref name="HermanTwo"&gt;A. Herman, ''How the Scots Invented the Modern World'' (London: Crown Publishing Group, 2001), {{ISBN|0-609-80999-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual climate===
In France, the Enlightenment was based in the [[Salon (gathering)|salons]] and culminated in the great ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' (1751–72) edited by [[Denis Diderot]] and (until 1759) [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (1713–84) with contributions by hundreds of leading intellectuals such as [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778), [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] (1712–78) &lt;ref&gt;D. Vallier, ''Rousseau'' (New York: Crown, c1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montesquieu]] (1689–1755). Some 25,000 copies of the 35-volume set were sold, half of them outside France. In Scottish intellectual life the culture was oriented towards books.{{clarify|date=December 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. M. Towsey, ''Reading the Scottish Enlightenment: Books and Their Readers in Provincial Scotland, 1750–1820'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1763 Edinburgh had six printing houses and three paper mills; by 1783 there were 16 printing houses and 12 paper mills.&lt;ref&gt;R. B. Sher, "Scotland Transformed: The Eighteenth Century", in J. Wormald, ed., ''Scotland: A History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual life revolved around a series of clubs, beginning in Edinburgh in the 1710s. One of the first was the Easy Club, co-founded In Edinburgh by the Jacobite printer [[Thomas Ruddiman]]. Clubs did not reach Glasgow until the 1740s. One of the first and most important in the city was the Political Economy Club, aimed at creating links between academics and merchants,&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p346"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0712698930}}, p. 346.&lt;/ref&gt; of which noted economist [[Adam Smith]] was a prominent early member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=John Cunningham (ed.) |title=Adam Smith: Critical Assessments vol. 1 |date=1993 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415108942 |page=95 |edition=[Repr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other clubs in Edinburgh included [[The Select Society]], formed by the younger [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]], a prominent artist, and philosophers David Hume and Adam Smith&lt;ref name="MacDonald2000p57"&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; and, later, [[The Poker Club]], formed in 1762 and named by [[Adam Ferguson]] for the aim to "poke up" opinion on the militia issue.&lt;ref name="Lynch1992p348"&gt;M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (London: Pimlico, 1992), {{ISBN|0712698930}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Jonathan Israel]] argues that by 1750 Scotland's major cities had created an intellectual infrastructure of mutually supporting institutions, such as universities, reading societies, libraries, periodicals, museums and masonic lodges. The Scottish network was "predominantly liberal Calvinist, Newtonian, and 'design' oriented in character which played a major role in the further development of the transatlantic Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="HermanTwo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Israel|first=Jonathan|title=Democratic Enlightenment: Philosophy, Revolution, and Human Rights 1750–1790|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xP4l0ug3rAC&amp;pg=PA233|year=2011|publisher=Oxford UP|page=233|accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Lenman says their "central achievement was a new capacity to recognize and interpret social patterns."&lt;ref&gt;R.

==Major intellectual areas==

===Empiricism and inductive reasoning===
{{Cleanup section|reason=Despite the heading, this section lacks content on inductive reasoning.|date=September 2018}}
The first major philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment was [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] (1694–1746), who was professor of moral philosophy at Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. He was an important link between the ideas of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Shaftesbury]] and the later school of [[Scottish Common Sense Realism]], developing [[Utilitarianism]] and [[Consequentialist]] thinking.&lt;ref name="Mitchison1983p.150"/&gt; Also influenced by Shaftesbury was [[George Turnbull (theologian)|George Turnbull]] (1698–1748), who was regent at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and who published pioneering work in the fields of Christian ethics, art and education.&lt;ref&gt;A. Broadie, ''A History of Scottish Philosophy'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0748616276}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Hume]] (1711–76) whose ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature|Treatise on Human Nature]]'' (1738) and ''[[Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary|Essays, Moral and Political]]'' (1741) helped outline the parameters of philosophical [[Empiricism]] and [[Scepticism]].&lt;ref name=Mitchison1983p.150&gt;R. Mitchison, ''Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), {{ISBN|074860233X}}, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; He would be a major influence on later Enlightenment figures including [[Adam Smith]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Jeremy Bentham]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Freydberg, ''David Hume: Platonic Philosopher, Continental Ancestor'' (Suny Press, 2012), {{ISBN|1438442157}}, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume's argument that there were no efficient causes hidden in nature was supported and developed by [[Thomas Brown (philosopher)|Thomas Brown]] (1778–1820), who was [[Dugald Stewart]]'s (1753–1828) successor at Edinburgh and who would be a major influence on later philosophers including [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Graham, ''Scottish Philosophy: Selected Readings 1690–1960'' (Imprint Academic, 2004), {{ISBN|0907845746}}, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Hume, [[Thomas Reid]] (1710–96), a student of Turnbull's, along with minister [[George Campbell (minister)|George Campbell]] (1719–96) and writer and moralist [[James Beattie (writer)|James Beattie]] (1735–1803), formulated [[Common Sense Realism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Emerson, "The contexts of the Scottish Enlightenment" in A. Broadie, ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to the Scottish Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|978-0-521-00323-0}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Reid set out his theories in ''An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense'' (1764).&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Wilson, P. H. Reill, ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (Infobase Publishing, 2nd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|0816053359}}, pp. 499–501.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach argued that there are certain concepts, such as human existence, the existence of solid objects and some basic moral "first principles", that are intrinsic to the make up of man and from which all subsequent arguments and systems of morality must be derived. It can be seen as an attempt to reconcile the new scientific developments of the Enlightenment with religious belief.&lt;ref name=Gutjhar2011p39&gt;Paul C. Gutjahr, ''Charles Hodge: Guardian of American Orthodoxy'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), {{ISBN|0199740429}}), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{Main article|Scottish literature in the eighteenth century}}
Major literary figures originating in Scotland in this period included [[James Boswell]] (1740–95), whose ''An Account of Corsica'' (1768) and ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' (1785) drew on his extensive travels and whose ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]'' (1791) is a major source on one of the English Enlightenment's major men of letters and his circle.&lt;ref&gt;E. J. Wilson and P. H. Reill, ''Encyclopedia Of The Enlightenment'' (Infobase, 2nd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|0816053359}}, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allan Ramsay (poet)|Allan Ramsay]] (1686–1758) laid the foundations of a reawakening of interest in older Scottish literature, as well as leading the trend for pastoral poetry, helping to develop the [[Habbie stanza]] as a [[poetic form]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyer [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]] (1696–1782) made a major contribution to the study of literature with ''Elements of Criticism'' (1762), which became the standard textbook on rhetoric and style.&lt;ref&gt;J. Friday, ed., ''Art and Enlightenment: Scottish Aesthetics in the Eighteenth Century'' (Imprint Academic, 2004), {{ISBN|0907845762}}, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hugh Blair]] (1718–1800) was a minister of the Church of Scotland and held the Chair of Rhetoric and [[Belles Lettres]] at the University of Edinburgh. He produced an edition of the works of [[Shakespeare]] and is best known for ''Sermons'' (1777–1801), a five-volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and Lectures on Rhetoric and ''Belles Lettres'' (1783), an essay on literary composition, which was to have a major impact on the work of Adam Smith. He was also one of the figures who first drew attention to the [[Ossian]] cycle of [[James Macpherson]] to public attention.&lt;ref&gt;G. A. ''Kennedy, Classical Rhetoric and Its Christian and Secular Tradition Form Ancient to Modern Times'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), {{ISBN|0807861138}}, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Macpherson (1736–96) was the first Scottish poet to gain an international reputation. Claiming to have found poetry written by the ancient bard Ossian, he published "translations" that were proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] [[Epic poetry|epics]]. ''Final'', written in 1762, was speedily translated into many European languages, and its appreciation of natural beauty and treatment of the ancient legend has been credited more than any single work with bringing about the Romantic movement in European, and especially in German literature, through its influence on [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Buchan, ''Crowded with Genius'' (London: Harper Collins, 2003), {{ISBN|0-06-055888-1}}, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually it became clear that the poems were not direct translations from the Gaelic, but flowery adaptations made to suit the aesthetic expectations of his audience.&lt;ref&gt;D. Thomson, ''The Gaelic Sources of Macpherson's "Ossian"'' (Aberdeen: Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[Robert Burns]] (1759–96) the most important Scottish language poet was [[Robert Fergusson]] (1750–74), who also worked in English. His work often celebrated his native Edinburgh and Enlightenment conviviality, as in his best known poem "Auld Reekie" (1773).&lt;ref name=Carruthers2009pp58-9&gt;G. Carruthers, ''Scottish Literature'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|074863309X}}, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Burns, an Ayrshire poet and lyricist, is now widely regarded as the [[national poet]] of Scotland and became a major figure in the Romantic movement. As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected [[Folk music|folk songs]] from across Scotland, often revising or [[Literary adaptation|adapting]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=L.

===Sociology and anthropology===
Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed what leading thinkers such as [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]] (1714–99) and Lord Kames called a ''[[science of man]]'',&lt;ref name="Magnusson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040 |title=Northern lights |author=[[Magnus Magnusson]] |work=[[New Statesman]] |publisher=Review of [[James Buchan]]'s ''Capital of the Mind: Edinburgh (Crowded With Genius: Edinburgh's Moment of the Mind'' in the [[United States]]) [[London]]: [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] {{ISBN|0-7195-5446-2}} |date=10 November 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329124427/http://www.newstatesman.com/200311100040 |archivedate=March 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was expressed historically in the work of thinkers such as James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] and John Walker, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behave in ancient and primitive cultures, with an awareness of the determining forces of [[modernity]]. Modern notions of visual anthropology permeated the lectures of leading Scottish academics like Hugh Blair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Matthew Daniel|title=The Line of Reason: Hugh Blair, Spatiality and the Progressive Structure of Language|journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society|year=2011|volume=65|pages=9–24|doi=10.1098/rsnr.2010.0098}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alan Swingewood argues that modern sociology largely originated in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Swingewood, "Origins of Sociology: the Case of the Scottish Enlightenment," ''The British Journal of Sociology,'' Vol. 21, No. 2 (June, 1970), pp. 164–80 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/588406 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Monboddo is most famous today as a founder of modern comparative historical [[linguistics]].

===Mathematics, science and medicine===
One of the central pillars of the Scottish Enlightenment was scientific and medical knowledge. Many of the key thinkers were trained as physicians or had studied science and medicine at university or on their own at some point in their career. Likewise, there was a notable presence of university medically-trained professionals, especially physicians, apothecaries, surgeons and even ministers, who lived in provincial settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title='The Sparkling Nectar of Spas: The Medical and Commercial Relevance of Mineral Water’, in Ursula Klein and Emma Spary (eds.), Materials and Expertise in Early Modern Europe: Between Market and Laboratory|date=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=198–226|url=https://www.academia.edu/1114266/The_Sparkling_Nectar_of_Spas_The_Medical_and_Commercial_Relevance_of_Mineral_Water_in_Ursula_Klein_and_Emma_Spary_eds._Materials_and_Expertise_in_Early_Modern_Europe_Between_Market_and_Laboratory_Chicago_The_University_of_Chicago_Press_2010_198-226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike England or other European countries like France or Austria, the intelligentsia of Scotland were not beholden to powerful aristocratic patrons and this led them to see science through the eyes of utility, improvement and reform.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Edinburgh became a major centre of medical teaching and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bynum|first1=W. F.|last2=Porter|first2=Roy|title=William Hunter and the Eighteenth-Century Medical World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nJc0wTuTGuMC&amp;pg=PA142|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=142–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Edinburgh Medical School rose to prominence by the end of the 18th century. [[Robert Sibbald]] and the establishment of the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] in 1680 also played a major role in the development of medicine in Enlightenment Scotland.

==Significance==
Representative of the far-reaching impact of the Scottish Enlightenment was the new ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', which was designed in Edinburgh by [[Colin Macfarquhar]], [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]] and others. It was first published in three volumes between 1768 and 1771, with 2,659 pages and 160 engravings, and quickly became a standard reference work in the English-speaking world. The fourth edition (1810) ran to 16,000 pages in 20 volumes. The ''Encyclopaedia'' continued to be published in Edinburgh until 1898, when it was sold to an American publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Brown|title=The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: Enlightenment, Britain and Empire (1707–1918)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BasUT5FyhM8C&amp;pg=PA199|year=2007|publisher=Edinburgh U.P.|pages=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural influence===
The Scottish Enlightenment had numerous dimensions, influencing the culture of the nation in several areas including architecture, art and music.&lt;ref&gt;June C. Ottenberg, "Musical Currents of the Scottish Enlightenment," ''International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music'' Vol. 9, No. 1 (Jun., 1978), pp. 99–109 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/836530 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Scotland produced some of the most significant architects of the period who were involved in the intellectual culture of the Enlightenment. [[Robert Adam]] (1728–92) was an interior designer as well as an architect, with his brothers developing the [[Adam style]],&lt;ref&gt;''Adam Silver'' (HMSO/Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, 1953), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He influenced the development of architecture in Britain, Western Europe, [[Architecture of the United States|North America]] and in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;N.

Watkin, ''The Architect King: George III and the Culture of the Enlightenment'' (Royal Collection Publications, 2004), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.

Artists included [[John Alexander (painter)|John Alexander]] and his younger contemporary [[William Mossman]] (1700–71). They painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p56&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading Scottish artist of the late eighteenth century, Allan Ramsay, studied in Sweden, London and Italy before basing himself in Edinburgh, where he established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, including his friend the philosopher David Hume and the visiting [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/490799/Allan-Ramsay "Allan Ramsey"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] (1723–98) spent almost his entire career in Italy and emerged as a pioneering neo-classical painter of historical and mythical themes, including his depictions of scenes from Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', as well as acting as an informal tutor to British artists and as an early archaeologist and antiquarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253404/Gavin-Hamilton "Gavin Hamilton"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his works can be seen as Enlightenment speculations about the origins of society and politics, including the ''Death of Lucretia'' (1768), an event thought to be critical to the birth of the [[Roman Republic]]. His classicism would be a major influence on French artist [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1748–1825).&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp63-5&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, pp. 63–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of a musical culture in the capital was marked by the incorporation of the Musical Society of Edinburgh in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;E. G. Breslaw, ''Doctor Alexander Hamilton and Provincial America'' (Louisiana State University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|0807132780}}, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish composers known to be active in this period include: Alexander Munro (fl. c. 1732), James Foulis (1710–73) and Charles McLean (fl. c. 1737).&lt;ref name="Baxter2001app140-1"&gt;J.

Wilson, ''Edinburgh'' (Lonely Planet, 3rd edn., 2004), {{ISBN|1740593820}}, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-eighteenth century, a group of Scottish composers began to respond to Allan Ramsey's call to "own and refine" their own musical tradition, creating what James Johnson has characterised as the "Scots drawing room style", taking primarily Lowland Scottish tunes and adding simple figured basslines and other features from Italian music that made them acceptable to a middle-class audience. It gained momentum when major Scottish composers like [[James Oswald (composer)|James Oswald]] (1710–69) and [[William McGibbon]] (1690–1756) became involved around 1740. Oswald's ''Curious Collection of Scottish Songs'' (1740) was one of the first to include Gaelic tunes alongside Lowland ones, setting a fashion common by the middle of the century and helping to create a unified Scottish musical identity. However, with changing fashions there was a decline in the publication of collections of specifically Scottish collections of tunes, in favour of their incorporation into British collections.&lt;ref&gt;M. Gelbart, ''The Invention of "Folk Music" and "Art Music"'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), {{ISBN|1139466089}}, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wider impact===
While the Scottish Enlightenment is traditionally considered to have concluded toward the end of the 18th century,&lt;ref name="Magnusson"/&gt; disproportionately large Scottish contributions to British science and letters continued for another 50 years or more, thanks to such figures as [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[James Watt]], [[William Murdoch]], [[James Clerk Maxwell]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] and [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Wills, ''Scottish Firsts: a Celebration of Innovation and Achievement'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 2002), {{ISBN|1-84018-611-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the movement spread beyond Scotland across the British Empire, and onto the Continent. The political ideas had an important impact on the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founding fathers of the US]], which broke away from the empire in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Walker Howe.

===Cultural representations===
The Scottish dramatist [[Robert McLellan]] (1907-1985) wrote a number of full-length stage comedies which give a self-conscious representation of Edinburgh at the height of the Scottish enlightenment, most notably ''[[The Flouers o Edinburgh]]'' (1957). These plays include references to many of the figures historically associated with the movement and satirise various social tensions, particularly in the field of spoken language, between traditional society and [[anglicisation|anglicised]] Scots who presented themselves as exponents of so-called 'new manners'. Other later examples include ''[[Young Auchinleck]]'' (1962), a stage portrait of the young [[James Boswell]], and ''[[The Hypocrite]]'' (1967) which draws attention to conservative religious reaction in the country that threatened to check enlightenment trends. McLellan's picture of these tensions in [[nation]]al terms is complex, even-handed and multi-faceted.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Donati (ed.), ''Robert McLellan: Playing Scotland's Story, Collected Dramatic Works'' (Edinburgh, Luath Press, 2013), {{ISBN|9781906817534}}.

[[File:Swami Vivekananda 1893 Scanned Image.jpg|thumb|Swami Vivekananda &amp;ndash; his teachings and philosophy stressed on different aspects of religion, youth, education, faith, character building as well as social issues pertaining to India."]]

Swami Vivekananda was a [[Hindu]] monk from India. He played significant role in the growing Indian nationalism of the 19th and 20th century, reinterpreting and harmonising certain aspects of Hinduism. His '''teachings and philosophy''' applied this reinterpretation to various aspects of education, faith, character building as well as social issues pertaining to [[India]], and was also instrumental in introducing Yoga to the west.

According to Vivekananda a country's future depends on its people, stating that "man-making is my mission."&lt;ref name="My India India Eternal"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivekananda|first=Swami|title=My India: the India eternal|year=1996|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|location=Calcutta|isbn=81-85843-51-1|pages=1–2|edition=1st|editor=Swami Lokeswarananda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion plays a central role in this man-making, stating "to preach unto mankind their divinity, and how to make it manifest in every movement of life."&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda: Life and Teachings, Belur Math"&gt;{{cite|title=Swami Vivekananda: Life and Teachings|url=http://www.belurmath.org/swamivivekananda.htm|publisher=Belur Math|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330175816/http://www.belurmath.org/swamivivekananda.htm|archivedate=30 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indian nationalism==
Vivekananda played a major role in the growing Indian nationalism in the late 19th and the 20th century, encouraging many Indians with his success and appeal in the west. His example helped to build pride in India's cultural and religious heritage, and to stand up against the British colonial system.

Swami Vivekananda believed that India is the blessed ''punyabhumi'', the "land of virtue":

{{quote|".. the land where humanity has attained its highest towards generosity, towards purity, towards calmness, above all, the land of introspection and of spirituality - it is [[India]]. "&lt;ref name="Vivekananda’s Lankan connection"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivekananda’s Lankan connection|url=http://dailypioneer.com/sunday-edition/sundayagenda/spirituality-agenda/38428-vivekanandas-lankan-connection.html|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
According to Swami Vivekananda it is coordinated willpower that leads to independence. He gave the British colonial system as an example, with forty millions of Englishmen ruling three hundred millions of people in [[India]]. According to Vivekananda, the forty millions put their wills together and that resulted infinite power, and that was the reason of their success. Vivekananda prescribed, to make a great future [[India]] the whole serest will lie in organization, accumulation of power, co-ordination of wills.&lt;ref name="The future of India RKV"&gt;{{cite web|title=The future of India|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_3/lectures_from_colombo_to_almora/the_future_of_india.htm|work=ramakrishnavivekananda.info|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Vivekananda the Indian race never cared about physical wealth, although they acquired immense wealth.&lt;ref name="My life and mission RKVI CW"&gt;{{cite web|title=My life and mission|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_8/lectures_and_discourses/my_life_and_mission.htm|work=ramakrishnavivekananda.info|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Religion played a major role in Vivekananda's ideas. To Vivekananda religion was not only talk or doctrine or theory, but realization of the best and strongest powers within oneself. He said, 
{{quote|[I]t is being and becoming, not hearing or acknowledging; it is the whole soul becoming changed into what it believes."&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda: Life and Teachings, Belur Math" /&gt; He also felt religion is the gist of all worship is to be pure and to do good to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Universal teachings of Swami Vivekananda|url=http://www.ramakrishna.org/ut_sv.htm|work=ramakrishna.org|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Swami Vivekananda, religion is the idea which is raising the brute into man, and man into God.&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda Sayings AB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda Sayings|url=http://www.abuddhistlibrary.com/Buddhism/H%20-%20World%20Religions%20and%20Poetry/World%20Religions/From%20the%20Indian%20Tradition/Teachers%20from%20the%20Indian%20Tradition/Swami%20Vivekananda/Sayings/Sayings%20of%20Swami%20Vivekananda%20-%20The%20Holy%20Trinity%20-%20%5B%20RMIC%20%5D.htm|work=abuddhistlibrary.com|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ramakrishna===
Vivekananda was deeply influenced by the [[Brahmo Samaj]], and by his guru [[Ramakrishna]], who regarded the Absolute and the relative reality to be nondual aspects of the same integral reality. According to Michael Taft, Ramakrishna reconciled the dualism of form and formless,{{sfn|Taft|2014}} regarding the Supreme Being to be both Personal and Impersonal, active and inactive. Ramakrishna &lt;blockquote&gt;The Personal and Impersonal are the same thing, like milk and its whiteness, the diamond and its lustre, the snake and its wriggling motion. It is impossible to conceive of the one without the other. The Divine Mother and Brahman are one.&lt;ref name="GM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sri Ramakrisha The Great Master, by Swami Saradananda, (tr.)

Swami Vivekananda (12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta, was an [[India]]n [[Hindu]] [[monk]], a chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic [[Ramakrishna]]. &lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-4|[4]]][[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-5|[5]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He was a key figure in the introduction of the Indian philosophies of [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga]] to the Western world&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-6|[6]]][[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEGeorg2002600-7|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and is credited with raising [[Interfaith dialogue|interfaith]] awareness, bringing [[Hinduism]] to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century.&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEClarke2006209-8|[8]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He was a major force in the [[Hindu reform movements|revival of Hinduism]] in India, and contributed to the concept of [[nationalism]] in [[colonial India]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEVon Dense1999191-9|[9]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Vivekananda founded the [[Ramakrishna Math]] and the [[Ramakrishna Mission]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEGeorg2002600-7|[7]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He is perhaps best known for his speech which began, "Sisters and brothers of America ...,"&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEDutt2005121-10|[10]]]&lt;/sup&gt; in which he introduced Hinduism at the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] in [[Chicago]] in 1893.

Born into an aristocratic [[Bengali people|Bengali]] family of [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced by his [[guru]], Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God could be rendered by service to mankind. After Ramakrishna's death, Vivekananda toured the [[Indian subcontinent]] extensively and acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in [[British India]]. He later travelled to the United States, representing India at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions. Vivekananda conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes, disseminating tenets of [[Hindu philosophy]] in the United States, England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a [[List of Hindu gurus and saints|patriotic saint]] and his birthday is celebrated there as [[National Youth Day (India)|National Youth Day]].

He belonged to a traditional family and was one of nine siblings.  His mother, Bhubaneswari Devi, was a devout housewife. The progressive, rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality.

In 1880 Narendra joined [[Keshab Chandra Sen]]'s [[Nava Vidhan]], which was established by Sen after meeting [[Ramakrishna]] and reconverting from Christianity to Hinduism. The same search for direct intuition and understanding can be seen with Vivekananda. Not satisfied with his knowledge of philosophy, Narendra came to "the question which marked the real beginning of his intellectual quest for God."&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEBanhatti19958-39|[39]]]&lt;/sup&gt; He asked several prominent Calcutta residents if they had come "face to face with God", but none of their answers satisfied him.&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTESen200612–13-49|[49]]][[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEPangbornSmith1976106-31|[31]]]&lt;/sup&gt; At this time, Narendra met Debendranath Tagore (the leader of Brahmo Samaj) and asked if he had seen God. Instead of answering his question, Tagore said "My boy, you have the [[Yogi]]'s eyes."&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEBanhatti19958-39|[39]]][[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEChattopadhyaya199931-36|[36]]]&lt;/sup&gt; According to Banhatti, it was Ramakrishna who really answered Narendra's question, by saying "Yes, I see Him as I see you, only in an infinitely intenser sense."&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEBanhatti19958-39|[39]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Nevertheless, Vivekananda was more influenced by the Brahmo Samaj's and its new ideas, than by Ramakrishna.&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEMichelis200549-48|[48]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It was Sen's influence who brought Vivekananda fully into contact with western esotericism, and it was also via Sen that he met Ramakrishna.

In 1881 Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884. Narendra's first introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly's Institution when he heard Professor William Hastie lecturing on [[William Wordsworth]]'s poem, [[The Excursion]]. While explaining the word "trance" in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students visit Ramakrishna of [[Dakshineswar]] to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted some of his students (including Narendra) to visit Ramakrishna.

According to Banhatti, "[a] singer, a painter, a wonderful master of language and a poet, Vivekananda was a complete artist",&lt;sup&gt;[[Swami Vivekananda#cite note-FOOTNOTEBanhatti1963273-203|[195]]]&lt;/sup&gt; composing many songs and poems, including his favourite, "[[Kali the Mother (poem)|Kali the Mother]]". Vivekananda blended humour with his teachings, and his language was lucid. His Bengali writings testify to his belief that words (spoken or written) should clarify ideas, rather than demonstrating the speaker (or writer's) knowledge.

=== UNIVERSITIES ===
* 24 January 1857 -University of Calcutta
* 20 January 1817 -Presidency University, Kolkata
* 13 July 1830 -Scottish Church College                                           
Born on 12 January 1863 at Calcutta in the West Bengal, Vivekananda was the son of Viswanath Datta and Bhubaneswari Devi. His mother became his first teacher and taught her English and Bengali. Vivekananda listened from his mother the stories of Ramayana and Mahabharata. Being attached with the educational institutions like the Presidency College and General Assembly’s institution, he passed B.A. and became a member of the Brahmo Samaj. His curiosity increased on the question of the existence of God and he asked one question to all whom, he met – “Have you seen God?” At last he met Rama Krishna Parmahamsa, a priest of the Dakshineswar Kali temple and accepted him as his Guru. He was known then Vivekananda. His address in the parliament of Religions at Chicago as “Sisters and Brothers of America” astonished all. He visited different parts of Europe and many foreigners including sister Nivedita became his disciple. Later on Vivekananda established Ramakrishna Mission on social, religious and cultural foundation. He wrote several books like ‘Jnanayoga’, ‘Bhaktiyoga’, ‘Rajayoga’, ‘To the youth of India’ etc. His divinity was greatly feel by the Indians through his speech and works. He breathed his last in 1902.

=== Reforms ===

=== Hinduism-Universal Religion ===
Vivekananda considered Hinduism to be the mother of all religions. He established through historical sequence. He showed that Vedic religion had influenced Buddhism which again was instrumental in influencing Christianity. He told that all the religions of the world have the same value and importance. In the Parliament of Religions he told—&lt;blockquote&gt;” …The Christian is not to become a Hindu or a Buddhist, nor a Hindu or a Buddhist to become a Christian. But each must assimilate the spirit of the others and yet preserve his individuality and grow according to his own law of growth ….Upon the banner of every religion soon be written … ‘Help and not fight’,‘Assimilation and not Destruction’,‘Harmony, and peace and not Dissension.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus, through his universal religion, Vivekananda preached the unity of God. He told that though the paths are different for different religions but the goal is same. He attached great importance to the unity of all religions and their fusion into one universal religion.

=== Advaita Vedantism ===
Swami Vivekananda was a great lover of Vedantic philosophy. He believed in monism. He had firm faith on one God. His motto, as reflected earlier, was to establish a link among different religions. He had told that as water of different rivers mingle in the sea, similarly every religion finds itself at the feet of God. He did not see any difference between a Veda or Koran or Bible. Temple, Mosque and Church were equal for him.

He preferred to meditate at any place without any inhibition in his mind. By his personal example he preached monism or Advaita Vedantism. By that he showed his toleration towards every religion. He spoke the message of Vedanta regarding the world unity and to believe shapeless God.

=== Caste System ===
A striking contrast was noticed in the idea of Vivekananda regarding the caste system. Strangely enough, he supported the Varna system as described in the Vedas. Unfolding the advantages of the caste system, he told that division of labour is a great blessing of this system. It would lead to excellence in any profession.

This division, of course, will lead to a caste on the path of progress. However, he also exposed the evils of this system. Untouchability was its worst part. So, Vivekananda criticized this type of “Don’t touches”. He wanted to curb out this type of dogmatism from the society.

=== Estimate ===
Of course, Vivekananda was criticized for his idea regarding the caste system. His idea of internationalism was regarded as a platonic utopia. However, criticisms are only for criticisms sake. Swami Vivekananda’s constituent endeavor to free religion from superstitions really establishes him as a great reformer. His synthesis of the materialism and spiritualism is another remarkable feature of his philosophical thought. Thus, he was a great spiritual, nationalist, internationalist and so on.

Renaissance and reformation were the two peas of Vivekananda’s personality. He really brought a reawakening of the Indian culture. By his sharp intellect and reformative attitude he made Hinduism a progressive force in the world. A rare gem he was in the treasure of Indian wisdom. Undoubtedly he dazzled as a shining star in the cultural horizon of India and attracted the attention of the people of the world.

===  Yoga and meditation ===

Swami Vivekananda compared human mind with a monkey who is always restless and incessantly active by his own nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The mind is like a monkey|url=http://www.psychokhemia.com/learn/treasures/020-vivekananda-monkey-mind.html|work=psychokhemia.com|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noticed, the human mind naturally wants to get outside, to peer out of the body, as it were, through the channels of the organs.&lt;ref name="The Cosmons- The Microcosm"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Cosmons- The Microcosm|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_2/jnana-yoga/the_microcosm.htm|work=ramakrishnavivekananda.info|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, he stressed on practice of concentration,&lt;ref name="Concentration, its practice"&gt;{{cite web|title=Concentration, its practice|url=http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_1/raja-yoga/concentration_its_practice.htm|work=ramakrishnavivekananda.info|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he felt there is no limit to the power of the human mind, the more concentrated it is, the more powerful it becomes.&lt;ref name="Why Control Mind? GR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Control Mind?|url=http://www.greenmesg.org/swami_vivekananda_sayings_quotes/mind-why_control_mind.php|work=greenmesg.org|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Swami Vivekananda suggested not to do anything which disturbs the mind or makes it restless.

===Universalism===
Although embracing and propagating Universalism, he regarded Hinduism the best of all religions, and Advaita Vedanta the best of what Indian religious thought had to offer. According to Vivekananda the greatest misfortune of the world is we do not tolerate and accept other religions. In his lecture in Parliament of religions on September 15, 1893, he told a story of a frog who lived in a well for a long time, he was born there and brought up there and he used to think that nothing in the world can be bigger than that. Swami Vivekananda concluded the story: 
{{cquote|I am a Hindu. I am sitting in my own little well and thinking that the whole world is my little well. The Christian sits in his little well and thinks the whole world is his well. The Mohammedan sits in his little well and thinks that is the whole world.&lt;ref name="Why we disagree"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why we disagree|url=http://www.indianeye.org/2008/01/07/why-we-disagree-by-swami-vivekananda/|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609023028/http://www.indianeye.org/2008/01/07/why-we-disagree-by-swami-vivekananda/|archivedate=9 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Vivekananda we must not only tolerate other religions, but positively embrace them, since the truth is the basis of all religions.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 5/Epistles - First Series/XXII Alasinga]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society==

===Social service===
Social service was an essential aspect of Vivekananda's ideas, and an innovation which deviated from both Advaita Vedanta and Ramakrishna. He nevertheless attributed these ideas to both, trying to reconcile them with his own ideas.

According to Vivekananda, an important teaching he received from Ramakrishna was that ''Jiva is Shiva'' (each individual is divinity itself). So he stressed on ''Shiva Jnane Jiva Seva'', (to serve common people considering them as manifestation of God). According to Vivekananda, man is potentially Divine, so, service to man is indeed service to God.&lt;ref name="IDEOLOGY of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=IDEOLOGY of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission|url=http://www.belurmath.org/Ideology.htm|work=belurmath.org|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-injury===
Swami Vivekananda called [[Jain]] [[Digambara|monks]] the first great ascetics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://belurmath.org/complete_works_of_swami_vivekananda/volume_3/vol_3_frame.htm BUDDHISTIC INDIA Para 22-23]&lt;/ref&gt; He praised their ancient knowledge of presence of low form of life in water:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 3/Buddhistic India|BUDDHISTIC INDIA Para 24]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A terrible thing, killing these low forms of life. So these monks, if they died of thirst, they would never kill these animals by drinking water. How all that we call ethics they simply bring out from that one great principle of non-injury and doing good.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_3/buddhistic_india.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Personal development==
In line with the influence of western ideas, Vivekananda stressed the importance of individual development.

===Character building===
Swami Vivekananda realized three things are necessary to make every man great, every nation great:&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda Ebook Q"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda Ebook|url=http://www.consciouslivingfoundation.org/ebooks/13/CLF-SwamiVivekananda-Quotes.pdf|work=consciouslivingfoundation.org|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conviction of the powers of goodness;
* Absence of jealousy and suspicion;
* Helping all who are trying to be and do good.

Swami Vivekananda suggested to try to give up jealousy and conceit and learn to work unitedly for others. He told that purity, patience and perseverance overcome all obstacles. He suggested to take courage and work on. Patience and steady work, according to Swami Vivekananda, this is the only way to get success.

According to Swami Vivekananda "faith in ourselves and faith in God- this is the secret of greatness. Swami Vivekananda observed the history of the world is the history of a few men who had faith in themselves, and it is faith which calls out divinity within. So he told, if people have faith in three hundred and thirty millions of [[Hindu]] mythological gods, and in all the gods which foreigners have now and still have no faith in themselves, there will be no salvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivekananda|first=Swami|title=My India: the India eternal|year=1996|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|location=Calcutta|isbn=81-85843-51-1|pages=110–111|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Vivekananda believed education is the manifestation of perfection already in men.&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda: Life and Teachings, Belur Math" /&gt; He thought it a pity that the existing system of education did not enable a person to stand on his own feet, nor did it teach him self-confidence and self-respect. To Vivekananda, education was not only collection of information, but something more meaningful; he felt education should be man-making, life giving and character-building. To him education was an assimilation of noble ideas.&lt;ref name="My India India Eternal" /&gt; 
{{quote|Education is not the amount of information that we put into your brain and runs riot there, undigested, all your life. We must have life building, man making, character making assimilation of ideas. If you have assimilated five ideas and made them your life and character, you have more education than any man who has got by heart a whole library...&lt;ref name="The Future of India Wikisource"&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 3/Lectures from Colombo to Almora/The Future of India]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda quotes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda quotes|url=http://jnanagni.com/quotes/swami-vivekananda/|work=jnanagni.com|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

Swami Vivekananda felt that the education that young boys and girls receive is very negative. He thinks they do not gain confidence or self-respect from these education, so according to Swami Vivekananda only positive education should be given to children.&lt;ref name="The Education that India needs"&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 4/Translation: Prose/The Education that India needs]]&lt;/ref&gt; Swami Vivekananda told, if young boys and girls are encouraged and are not unnecessarily criticized all the time, they are bound to improve in time.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 7/Conversations And Dialogues/X]]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; He also told the youth: 
{{quote|Set yourselves to the task of spreading education among the masses. Tell them and make them understand, "You are our brothers—a part and parcel of our bodies, and we love you and never hate you."&lt;ref name="Vivekananda Reader"&gt;{{cite web | title=Vivekananda Reader | publisher=Advaita Ashrama | date=2012 | author=Narasimhananda, Swami | pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Womanhood==
Swami Vivekananda warned it is completely unfair to discriminate between sexes, as there is not any sex distinction in ''atman'' (soul), the soul has neither sex, nor caste nor imperfection. He suggested not to think that there are men and women, but only that there are human beings.&lt;ref name="Thoughts on Women SV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thoughts on Women|url=http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/spiritual/swami_vivekananda_talks/thoughts-on-women-swami-vivekananda/index.html|work=writespirit.net|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511145313/http://www.writespirit.net/inspirational_talks/spiritual/swami_vivekananda_talks/thoughts-on-women-swami-vivekananda/index.html|archivedate=11 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swami Vivekananda felt, The best thermometer to the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women&lt;ref name="Thoughts on Women SV"/&gt; and it is impossible to get back India's lost pride and honor unless they try to better the condition of women.&lt;ref name="Vivekananda's letters condition of women"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivekananda's letters|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ma/vivekananda/vivekanandaletters.html|work=Angelfire|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vivekananda considered men and women as two wings of a bird, and it is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing. So, according to him, there is no chance for welfare of the world unless the condition of woman is improved.

Swami Vivekananda noticed almost everywhere women are treated as playthings. In modern countries like America, women have more independence, still, Vivekananda had noticed, men bow low, offer a woman a chair and in another breath they offer compliments like "Oh, how beautiful your eyes.." etc. Vivekananda felt, a man does not have any right to do this or venture so far, and any woman should not permit this as well. According to Swami Vivekananda such things develop the less noble side of humanity. They do not tend to noble ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vivekananda|first=Swami|title=My India: the India eternal|year=1996|publisher=Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture|location=Calcutta|isbn=8185843511|pages=68–69|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Vivekananda, the ideal of womanhood in [[India]] is motherhood &amp;ndash; that marvelous, unselfish, all-suffering, ever-forgiving mother.&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda RKMD"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda|url=http://www.rkmdelhi.org/about-us/our-inspiration/swami-vivekananda/|work=rkmdelhi.org|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivekananda felt, in [[India]], there are two great evils &amp;ndash; trampling on the women, and grinding through the poor through caste restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letters written from Chicago January 1895, To Mrs. Ole Bull|url=http://www.vivekananda.net/knownletters/1895Chicago.html|work=vivekananda.net|accessdate=30 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121055245/http://www.vivekananda.net/KnownLetters/1895Chicago.html|archivedate=21 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Sita]] is typical of [[India]] &amp;ndash; the idealized [[India]]. Swami Vivekananda assured if world literature of the past and world literature of the future are thoroughly exhausted, yet, it'll not be possible to find out another [[Sita]], because [[Sita]] is unique, the character was depicted once for all. Swami Vivekananda felt there may have been several [[Rama]]s, perhaps, but never more than one [[Sita]].&lt;ref name="Valmiki's Sita"&gt;{{cite web|title=Valmiki's Sita|url=http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Valmiki%E2%80%99s_Sita|work=hindupedia.com|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Vedantist's View of Mary"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Vedantist's View of Mary|url=http://www.vedanta-atlanta.org/articles/Mary.html|work=vedanta-atlanta.org|author=Swami Yogeshananda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivekananda felt:
{{cquote|All our mythology may vanish, even our Vedas may depart, and our Sanskrit language may vanish for ever, but so long as there will be five Hindus living here, even if only seeking the most vulgar patois, there will be the story of Sita present.&lt;ref name="The ideal of womanhood, Sita Y"&gt;{{cite web|title=The ideal of womanhood, Sita|url=http://www.yabaluri.org/TRIVENI/CDWEB/theidealofwomanhoodsitajan55.htm|work=yabaluri.org|accessdate=3 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416061555/http://www.yabaluri.org/TRIVENI/CDWEB/theidealofwomanhoodsitajan55.htm|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  }}
Sita was a true [[India]]n by nature, Vivekananda concluded, who never returned injury.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda/Volume 4/Lectures and Discourses/The Ramayana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thierry Henri Philippe Baudet''' (born 28 January 1983) is a Dutch politician, jurist, columnist and historian who founded and leads the [[political party]] [[Forum for Democracy (Netherlands)|Forum for Democracy]] (FvD, {{lang-nl|Forum voor Democratie}}).

==Biography==
Born in [[Heemstede]] to a family of partial French and Indonesian origin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ontdekjouwverhaal.nl/nieuws/52782-2/|title=De genealogie van Thierry Baudet {{!}} NGV|work=NGV|access-date=2018-07-13|language=nl-NL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudet is a [[euroscepticism|eurosceptic]] and opposed to [[multiculturalism]]. Baudet is an advocate for a return to [[nation states]]; his party set up the [[Dutch Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement referendum, 2016]] with the [[GeenStijl]] website and the Burgercomité EU association, in which Baudet voted no.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.nrc.nl/next/2016/03/07/ze-delen-weinig-behalve-een-diepe-afkeer-van-euro-1596081|title=Ze delen weinig, behalve een diepe afkeer van Europa|accessdate= 20 March 2016|authorlink= [[Thijs Niemantsverdriet]]|date= 7 March 2016 |publisher=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|language=Dutch

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he gave a speech at the Flemish nationalist event [[IJzerwake]]. He also spoke at several [[Vlaams Belang]] conferences. Baudet maintains that his [[Conservatism|conservative]] political convictions have been largely influenced by two events in his first year as a history undergraduate in Amsterdam: the [[September 11 attacks]] and the [[assassination of Pim Fortuyn]]. In November 2016 Baudet co-signed a letter initiated by the German journalist [[Billy Six]] which requested [[Donald Trump]] to press for a new investigation regarding [[MH17]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/baudet-vraagt-trump-om-nieuw-onderzoek-naar-mh17-nabestaanden-geschokt~a4455637/?_sp=577b2d76-f88f-44e8-9c62-38351ac182cf.1505931431413&lt;/ref&gt;

Baudet features regularly in both print and visual media in Europe. As a journalist he has had a permanent column in ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'', and is published in ''[[Le Monde]]'', PressEurope and European Ideas. Recently he has been active as a commentator in [[Studio PowNed]] on the Dutch public television. As an academic teacher and researcher Baudet focuses on questions of law, history and political philosophy through a multidisciplinary approach.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/next/2016/03/07/ze-delen-weinig-behalve-een-diepe-afkeer-van-euro-1596081|author= [[Thijs Niemantsverdriet]]|title=Ze delen weinig, behalve een diepe afkeer van Europa|accessdate= 20 March 2016|date= 7 March 2016 |publisher=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|language=Dutch|quote=dutch original "Hij noemt zichzelf zonder terughoudendheid "de belangrijkste intellectueel van Nederland".

===Member of the House of Representatives===
In the [[Dutch general election, 2017|general election of 2017]] his newly founded party won two seats in the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]], Baudet being elected alongside [[Theo Hiddema]].

== Controversy ==
In February 2018 Baudet was confronted with the question whether there is a relation between [[Race and intelligence|IQ and race]] in a debate with [[Femke Halsema]]. Hiddema and the number two on Baudet's party list for the [[Dutch municipal elections, 2018]] in Amsterdam, Yernaz Ramautarsing, stated they believed it to be true while Baudet refused to answer the question. Deputy Prime Minister [[Kajsa Ollongren]] stated that Forum for Democracy is a bigger threat than the PVV and that members have an unhealthy fascination for race differences; Baudet made a complaint for [[defamation]] at an Amsterdam police station. Hiddema supported him as his [[advocate]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1624498/baudet-aangifte-wegens-smaad-en-laster Baudet aangifte small en laster] (in Dutch), ''De Telegraaf''.&lt;/ref&gt; In a debate a few days later, he no longer refused to answer the question and mentioned he shares Ramautarsing's opinion on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parool.nl/verkiezingen/alle-ballen-op-baudet-in-haags-amsterdams-verkiezingsdebat~a4568769/ All balloon op Baudet in Haags Amsterdams verkiezingsdebat] (in Dutch), ''Parool''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions and opinions==
Baudet is a [[National conservatism|national conservative]] and [[Euroscepticism|eurosceptic]], advocating for both Netherlands' exit from the European Union and its eventual dissolution. He is against further unskilled [[immigration]] into the Netherlands. In a speech he spoke about immigration causing a [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] [[dilution (equation)|dilution]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nporadio1.nl/dit-is-de-dag/onderwerpen/400417-baudet-snapt-ophef-om-homeopatische-verdunning-niet&lt;/ref&gt; and in an interview he said he prefers a dominant white and cultural Europe as it is.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpBzt9PyU5w&lt;/ref&gt; He is opposed to [[Ukraine]] joining the [[European Union]].

Baudet has a strong opinion on [[art]]s, the topic of his book ''[[Oikofobie]]'', and considers non-Western art and Western post-1900 [[modernism]] in [[visual arts]] inferior to Western [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], encourages education and programmation of [[tonal music]] opposed to [[atonal music]] and dislikes modern post-1950 [[architecture]].

Baudet frequently speaks about the perceived existence of a "party cartel", in which the main ruling parties of the country divide power among themselves and conspire towards the same goals, despite claiming to be competitors.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4520bb4c-07e3-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=14 March 2017|title=Populists seize the moment as Dutch fall out of love with EU|author=Joshua Chaffin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baudet is not religious, but he is sympathetic with [[Christianity|Christian]] values. In an interview, he called himself an "[[agnostic]] [[cultural Christian]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [https://cip.nl/60959-thierry-baudet-pleit-voor-herwaardering-christendom Thierry Baudet pleit voor herwaardering christendom], ''cip.nl'', 15 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baudet and the media==
Since Baudet entered the States General with his political party, he became a hot topic in the Dutch media with daily new analytic articles, background checks, gossip, and interviews. His broad international network is a prominent re-occurring chapter in the debate whether his political position is extreme right, racist, or fascistic. He had contact with [[Jared Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://decorrespondent.nl/7738/thierry-baudet-ontmoette-in-het-geheim-een-amerikaanse-racist-van-alt-right/376817386-2d11d76b ''De Correspondent'' article] (in Dutch).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milo Yiannopoulos]], [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] and [[Filip Dewinter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://decorrespondent.nl/7955/hoe-thierry-baudet-aan-de-lippen-hing-van-jean-marie-le-pen/811713530980-29774dcf ''De Correspondent'' article] (in Dutch).&lt;/ref&gt; He speaks about non-Western immigrants as the cause of an "homeopathic dilution" of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trouw.nl/opinie/van-homeopathische-verdunning-naar-seksuele-verdunning~a9191e0b/ ''Trouw'' article] (in Dutch).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1158">'''Wagnerism'''  has a number of meanings:

* the [[philosophy|philosophical]] ideals put forward by [[Richard Wagner]] which indicate  the traits of a "true" [[Germany|German]], among other [[aestheticism|aesthetic]] ideas.
* an attachment, sometimes fanatical, to the music of Wagner.
* a form of adversarial [[labour union]] legislation, the [[Wagner Act]] in the [[United States]], and similarly adopted in [[Canada]], among other countries.

The first two of these aspects were promoted, often in distorted form, by the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime in Germany. [[Adolf Hitler]] argued that "Germany would be impossible without Wagner and all he represents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&amp;context=manuscripts |title=Hitler and Wagnerism |author=Janet Gregory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women have engaged in [[philosophy]] throughout the field's history. While there were women [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, and a relatively small number were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, particularly during the 20th and 21st century, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane. Eight women philosophers: theory, politics, and feminism. University of Illinois Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://read.hipporeads.com/why-i-left-academia-philosophys-homogeneity-needs-rethinking/#|title=Why I Left Academia: Philosophy’s Homogeneity Needs Rethinking - Hippo Reads|author=|date=|website=read.hipporeads.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient philosophy]] in the West, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], female philosophers such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC) were active during this period. Notable [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] include [[Hypatia]] (5th century), [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098-1179) and [[St. Catherine of Sienna]] (1347-1380). Notable [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] included [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) and [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850). Influential [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary philosophers]] include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), [[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919), [[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924), [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), [[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) and [[Susan Haack]] (born 1945).

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], giving rise to new generations of female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93). See also "Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities." National Center For Education Statistics, E.D. Tabs, July 1997. U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 97-973;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF-93).&lt;/ref&gt; Women make up as little as 17% of philosophy faculty in some studies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;U.S. Department of Education statistics in above-cited reports seem to put the number closer to 17%, but these numbers are based on data from the mid-1990s. [[Margaret Urban Walker]]'s more recent article (2005) discusses the data problem and describes more recent estimates as an "(optimistically projected) 25–30 percent."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of [[misogyny]] and [[sexual harassment]]" of women students and professors.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/05/19/unofficial-internet-campaign-outs-professor-alleged-sexual-harassment-attempted|title=Unofficial Internet campaign outs professor for alleged sexual harassment, attempted assault|author=|date=|website=insidehighered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], stated in 2015 that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against."&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/jan/05/philosophy-is-for-posh-white-boys-with-trust-funds-why-are-there-so-few-women|title=Philosophy is for posh, white boys with trust funds' – why are there so few women?|first1=Rebecca|last1=Ratcliffe|first2=Claire|last2=Shaw|date=5 January 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that there is gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis - National Association of Scholars|author=|date=|website=www.nas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers, and they require editors and writers to ensure they represent the contributions of women philosophers.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline."&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|date=13 May 2015|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;

==Representation and working climate==
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Nussbaum/nussbaum-con1.html|title=Conversation with Martha C. Nussbaum, p. 1 of 6|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that "...there is compelling evidence" of "...philosophy’s gender imbalance" and "bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products." In 1992, the association recommended that "fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In a 2008 article “Changing the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),” MIT philosophy professor [[Sally Haslanger]] stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia “encourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled "Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis." The article states that a "...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to [[gender bias|bias against women]] or some kind of wrongful [[discrimination]]". Evidence cited includes "gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member"; "anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy"; "research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines"; "psychological research on implicit bias"; "psychological research on [[stereotype threat]]" and the "...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals".&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; Sesardic and De Clercq argue that "proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively."&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

American philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]] stated in 2008 that "...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn’t actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/philosphy-women-warnock-baggini-debate|title=Does philosophy have a problem with women?|first1=Mary|last1=Warnock|first2=Julian|last2=Baggini|date=25 July 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haslanger states that she experienced “occasions when a woman’s status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‘mature’ student), or was in a long-distance relationship". American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;

In July 2015, British philosopher [[Mary Warnock]] addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is "... against intervention, by [[Hiring quota|quota]]s or otherwise, to increase women’s chances of employment" in philosophy.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She also argues that "... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance" and she states that she does not "...believe it shows a conscious bias against women." &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] states that he believes that there is "...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a "...great deal of unconscious bias" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Allegations of sexual harassment===
In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; On March 28, 2011, the blog ''New APPS'' published a post examining the allegations of persistent [[sexual harassment]] faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to "serial harassers" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions. The post proposed that, since institutional procedures seemed to have been ineffective at removing or punishing harassers, philosophers should socially shun known offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/03/what-is-to-be-done-about-sexual-harassment-in-the-philosophy-profession.html What is to be done about sexual harassment in the philosophy profession? – New APPS: Art, Politics, Philosophy, Science].

According to Heidi Lockwood, an associate professor of philosophy at [[Southern Connecticut State University]], there is a "...power “asymmetry” between professors and students – even graduate students"; as well, she noted that "...even when colleges and universities have blanket prohibitions against professor-student sexual relationships, as does Yale,...institution-specific policies leave students vulnerable [to sexual advances from faculty] at conferences."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
 
According to an August 2013 article in ''Salon'', a tenured male University of Miami philosopher resigned after allegedly "...sending emails to a [female] student in which he suggested that they have sex three times."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], set up a blog for women philosophers in 2010. She received numerous allegations of [[sexual harassment]] by male philosophy faculty, including a "job candidate who said she was sexually assaulted at the annual APA meeting where job interviews take place", an "undergraduate whose professor joked publicly about dripping hot wax on her nipples" and a "... lesbian who found herself suddenly invited, after she came out, to join in the sexualizing of her female colleagues." Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations.&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; In 2013, the [[American Philosophical Association]] formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a "...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: “Show me a grad student I can fuck”." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Saul states that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 2014, ''Inside Higher Education'' reported allegations that a [[Yale University]] philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the "alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result".&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
In an interview with ''Inside Higher Ed'', the alleged victim stated that she "...suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the “browbeating” she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In 1993, the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?harassment|title=Statement on Sexual Harassment - The American Philosophical Association|author=|date=|website=www.apaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection."
*"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on."
*"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board."

===Black women===
[[File:Angela Davis en Bogotá, Septiembre de 2010.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Angela Davis]] (born 1944) is an American [[Activism|political activist]], philosopher and author. Her research interests include [[African-American studies]] and the philosophy of punishment and prisons.]]
There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, [[African-American]]s and other individuals from the [[African diaspora]]. According to philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]], the "numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling"; in a 2003 study, there "...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report." &lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/women-in-philosophy-do-the-math/?_r=0|title=Women in Philosophy?

McPherson, there is a "gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"&gt;L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black-underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html&lt;/ref&gt;  McPherson states that there is a "...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"/&gt;

The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], who obtained her degree in 1965 from [[Yale University]]. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include [[Angela Davis]], a political activist who specializes in writing about [[feminism]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]], [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; [[Kathryn Gines]], the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in [[continental philosophy]], [[Africana philosophy]], [[Race theory|philosophy of race]] and Black [[feminist philosophy]]; [[Anita L. Allen]], the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by [[President Obama]] to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and [[Adrian Piper]], an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Stanford University]], and who specializes in [[Nietzsche]], nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and [[African-American philosophy]].

=== Asian women ===
Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/asian-american-woman-philosopher/|title=Asian, American, Woman, Philosopher|last=Yancy|first=George|last2=Lee|first2=Emily S.|date=2015-04-06|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Yancy]], Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at [[California State University, Fullerton]], states, "I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued." She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. [[University of Washington]] philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n1.pdf|title=Asian Americans, Positive Stereotyping, and Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: "Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy." On the other had, "Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in ''passive'' rather than aggressive terms." Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and "derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity" may also contribute to the wide disparity.

==Reports from the US ==
[[U.S. Department of Education]] reports indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"/&gt; Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‘in philosophy.’ This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one [[data set]] exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]]' 2000 report, "Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities," estimates in Table 23 that the total number of "History and Philosophy" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, "In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;NCES (2000), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anita L Allen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Anita L. Allen]] (born 1953) is a professor of law and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].]]
In their 1997 report, "[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97973.pdf Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities]," NCES notes, that about "one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4)." In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men),
12.7 are female (971 women).&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men);
female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy.

The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time."&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively)."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/sed-2004.pdf Hoffer, T.B., V.

MAP’s short-term goals include providing a space for students to discuss and work on these issues, and long-term goals include contributing to the culture of academic philosophy and increasing participation and recognition of minorities in philosophy. In recent years, MAP has fostered collaborative work between chapters, establishing "connections between chapters that benefit both members and departments long-term,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mapforthegap.com/uploads/2/2/3/2/22328318/eoy_report_.pdf|title=Minorities and Philosophy End of Year Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased work on inclusive pedagogy, and organized efforts to bring philosophy into communities outside of university campuses, such as prisons and elementary schools.

* Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the  classroom.
* Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. 
* Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy.&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"/&gt;

==History==
While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"/&gt;  Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, "Feminist History of Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/feminism-femhist/&gt;.
  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline." &lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; According to [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the University of Sheffield, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the humanities, is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;
[[File:Emilie_Chatelet_portrait_by_Latour.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706-1749)]]
In the May 13, 2015 issue of ''The Atlantic'', Susan Price notes that even though Kant's first work in 1747 cites [[Emilie du Chatelet|Émilie Du Châtelet]], a philosopher who was a "...scholar of Newton, religion, science, and mathematics", "her work won’t be found in the 1,000-plus pages of the new edition of The Norton Introduction to Philosophy." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; The Norton Introduction does not name a female philosopher until the book begins to cover the mid-20th century. Scholars argue that women philosophers are also absent from the "...other leading anthologies used in university classrooms." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price states that university philosophy anthologies do not usually mention 17th century women philosophers such as [[Margaret Cavendish]], [[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]], and [[Lady Damaris Masham]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that some say still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Amy Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, states that “...women have been systematically left out of the canon, and that women coming in have not been able to see how much influence women have had in the field."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', which as published in 1967, had "...articles on over 900 philosophers, [but it] did not include an entry for [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] or [[Simone de Beauvoir|de Beauvoir]]. "[T]hese women philosophers were scarcely even marginal" to the canon set out at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/feminism-femhist/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Charlotte|last1=Witt|first2=Lisa|last2=Shapiro|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=11 July 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] (born 1947) argues that "...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ten-great-female-philosophers-the-thinking-womans-women-299061.html|title=Ten great female philosophers: The thinking woman's women|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia claims that "[t]oday's lack of major female philosophers is not due to lack of talent but to the collapse of philosophy", because, in her view, philosophy "... as traditionally practised may be a dead genre" that "belongs to a vanished age of much slower and rhetorically formal inquiry."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

===Ancient philosophy===

[[File:Hipparchia of Maroneia Villa Farnesina.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]]. Detail from a Roman wall painting in the [[Villa Farnesina]] in [[Rome]].]]
Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of [[Plato]], [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]]. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' on her.&lt;ref name="Wider1986"&gt;K.

[[Medieval philosophy]] dates from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD to the Renaissance in the 16th century. [[Hypatia]] (AD 350 – 370 to 415) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]], astronomer, and philosopher in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], then a part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="socrates"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Ecclesiastical History|last= Scholasticus|first= Socrates |authorlink= Socrates Scholasticus |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |url = http://cosmopolis.com/alexandria/hypatia-bio-socrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the head of the [[Neoplatonic]] school at [[Alexandria]], where she taught [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries''; ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999: ''"Greek Neoplatonist philosopher who lived and taught in Alexandria."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook |last1=Mueller |first1=I. |authorlink= |author2=L.S.

===Modern philosophy===
The 17th century marks the beginning of the [[modern philosophy]] era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced [[René Descartes]] and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on [[John Locke]]’s philosophy. [[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. [[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by [[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) in her essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her essay ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). During the 19th century, [[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876)  criticized the state of women's education and [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858), [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) called for [[women's rights]]. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) argued that women were oppressed by an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. Near the start of the 20th century, [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was the first woman to become president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Women thinkers such as [[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940), an [[anarchism|anarchist]], and
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919), a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], are known for their political views.

====17th century====
*[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated.
*[[Anna Maria van Schurman]] (1607–1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of [[female education]]. 
*[[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] (1618–1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably [[René Descartes]], who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. 
*[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]] (1623–1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy.
*[[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]] (1631-1679) was an [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] whose work, in the tradition of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], was an influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Conway's thought is original as it is [[rationalist philosophy]], with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.&lt;ref name="Duran2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Damaris Cudworth Masham]] (1659–1708) was an English philosopher, [[proto-feminist]], and advocate for women's education. 
*[[Mary Astell]] (1666–1731) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] writer and [[rhetorician]] known for advocacy of equal [[educational opportunities for women]], which earned her the title of "first English feminist."&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;Batchelor, Jennie.

*[[Catharine Trotter Cockburn]] (1679–1749) published her first major philosophical work, ''A Defence of Mr. Lock[e]'s [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' in 1702, at the age of 23. Much of the scholarly interest in her writing centres on [[gender studies]]. 
*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She translated and commented on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. She criticized [[John Locke]]’s philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience. She also theorized about [[free will]] and on the way to do [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was an Italian philosopher and physicist who was the first woman in the world to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies.

*[[Catharine Macaulay]] (1731–1791) was an English historian and writer. She attacked [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]'', calling it "a poison...".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1992|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1790 ''Letters on Education'', she argued along the lines that [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] would do in 1792, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis-education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walters, Margaret|year=2006|title=Feminism: A Very Short Introduction|location=USA|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280510-X|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male–female inequality. 
*[[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) was an early [[United States|American]] advocate for women's rights, an essayist, [[playwright]], [[poet]], and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes—that women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other [[Feminism|feminist]] writers of the century. The essay predated [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' which was published in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Mary|title=An Enlightened Woman: Judith Sargent Murray and the Call to Equality|journal=[[Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review|Undergraduate Review]]|date=2011|volume=7|issue=21|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&amp;context=undergrad_rev|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. She is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]]. In ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work,&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

====19th century====
*[[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876) was an English [[social theorist]] and political writer, often cited as the first female [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Hill, Michael R. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qyzyUpMfh24C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Harriet Martineau: Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives'']. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94528-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote books and essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and feminine perspective.  In ''Society in America'', she criticised the state of women's education, stating that the "intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction" of access to education; she urged women to become well-educated and free.
*[[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858) was a philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. In [[John Stuart Mill]]'s autobiography, he claimed she was the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He stated that "when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen." Together, they wrote "Early Essays on Marriage and Divorce", published in 1832.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=harriet+taylor+mill|title=Search (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) was an American journalist, critic, philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration.
*[[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the [[United States]]. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as [[abolition of slavery]] and she sought to expand [[women's rights]]. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women.
*[[Victoria, Lady Welby]] (1837–1912) was a self-educated English [[philosopher of language]]. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and ''[[The Monist]]''. She published her first philosophical book, ''What Is Meaning?  Studies in the Development of Significance'' in 1903, following it with ''Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources'' in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word ''significs'' for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and [[semiology]]. 
*[[Bertha von Suttner]] (1843–1914) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'').&lt;ref name="weop"&gt;''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]].

*[[Helene von Druskowitz]] (1856–1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant [[sexism]] of the era.
*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) was an American [[feminist]], [[sociologist]], novelist, writer and [[social reform]]er. Her short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. She argued that the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann J. Lane, ''To Herland and Beyond'', 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. She argued that women were the underdeveloped half of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Knight, ''Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Her Contemporaries'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women.

====Early 20th century====
*[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]]. She was also the first woman to become president of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Calkins studied psychology under [[William James]] and studied at [[Harvard University]], which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1980 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 55–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1981.tb01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1979 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 346–356 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197910)15:4&lt;346::aid-jhbs2300150408&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as "the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard." &lt;ref name="Hilgard, E.

*[[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a [[free-thinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution.&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=122–134|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. 
*[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919) was a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Economics|economist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] of [[Polish-Jewish]] descent.

[[File:Hannah_arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) considered herself a political theorist, but she is often described as a philosopher.]]
[[Contemporary philosophy]] is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the end of the 19th century with the [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. Some influential women philosophers from this period include:
*[[Ayn Rand]] (1905-1982) developed a philosophical system she named [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], which affirms [[objective reality]] and advocates holding [[reason]] as absolute.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/objectivity.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/reason.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ethics]], Rand championed [[rational egoism]] and [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/self-interest.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[politics]], she advocated for [[individual rights]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[esthetics]],  she upheld [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/romanticism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regards [[Aristotle]] as her sole major philosophical influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/aristotle.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985) was an American [[philosopher]] of [[philosopher of mind|mind]] and of [[philosopher of art|art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in [[philosophy]] and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name="gardner1"&gt;{{Citation|author=[[Howard Gardner]]|title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity|chapter=Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer |publisher=Basic Books|pages=48–54|location=New York|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/gardnerlanger.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah.

*[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]].
*[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.  [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know".&lt;ref name="Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G.

*[[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919) is an English [[ethics|moral philosopher]]. A senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], she is known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. Midgley strongly opposes [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argues, wholly inadequate. She has written extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. ''The Guardian'' has described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'"&lt;ref name=brown2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warnock studied at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1984. She delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]], entitled "Imagination and Understanding," at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1992.

*[[Philippa Foot]] (1920-2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], most notable for her works in [[ethics]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]]. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him.
*[[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) is a Canadian-American [[philosopher]] noted for her contributions to [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the [[University of Oxford]], she taught philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1969 to 1984.
*[[Susan Haack]] (born 1945) is distinguished professor in the humanities, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami. She earned her PhD at [[Cambridge University]]. She has written on [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]]. Her [[pragmatism]] follows that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Haack's major contribution to philosophy is her [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory called [[foundherentism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aune | first1 = B. | title = Haack's ''Evidence and Inquiry''| journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–632 | doi = 10.2307/2108389 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flage | first1 = D.

[[Image:Ernst Haeckel 2.jpg|thumb|170px|right| [[Ernst Haeckel]] wrote about the ''World Riddle'' in 1895]]

The term "'''world riddle'''" or "'''world-riddle'''" has been associated, for over 100 years, with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (who mentioned ''Welträthsel'' in several of his writings)
and with the [[biologist]]-[[philosopher]] [[Ernst Haeckel]], who, as a [[professor]] of [[zoology]] at the [[University of Jena]],&lt;ref name=Ha1911&gt;
     "Biography of Ernst Heinrich Haeckel, 1834&amp;ndash;1919" ([[Article (publishing)|article]]),

&lt;/ref&gt;
wrote the book ''Die Welträthsel'' in 1895&amp;ndash;1899, in modern spelling ''Die Welträtsel'' ([[German language|German]] "The World-riddles"), with the English version published under the title ''The Riddle of the Universe'', 1901.&lt;ref name=Ha1911/&gt;

The term "world riddle" concerns the nature of the universe and the [[meaning of life]].

The question and answer of the World Riddle has also been examined as an inspiration or [[allegory|allegorical meaning]] within some musical compositions, such as the unresolved harmonic progression at the end of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (1896) by [[composer]] [[Richard Strauss]], made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

== View of Nietzsche ==
[[Image:FWNietzscheSiebe.jpg|thumb|120px|right| [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].]]

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] referred to the "World Riddle" (''Welträthsel'') in several of his writings; however, his direct influence was limited to a few years, by his failing health.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

== View of Haeckel ==
[[Ernst Haeckel]] viewed the World Riddle as a dual-question of the form, "What is the nature of the physical universe and what is the nature of human thinking?" which he explained would have a single answer since humans and the universe were contained within one system, a mono-system, as Haeckel wrote in 1895:
&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
:: [From ''Monism as Connecting Religion and Science'' by Ernst Haeckel (translated):]
:: "The following lecture on [[Monism]] is an informal address delivered extemporaneously on October 9, 1892, at Altenburg, on the seventy-fifth anniversary of the ''"Naturforschende Gesellschaft des Osterlandes."'' ... The "exacting" [[Berlin]] [[physiologist]] shut this knowledge out from his mind, and, with a short-sightedness almost inconceivable, placed this special [[neurological]] question alongside of the one great "'''world-riddle'''," the fundamental question of substance, the general question of the connection between matter and energy.  As I long ago pointed out, these two great questions are not two separate "'''world-riddles'''." The neurological problem of [[consciousness]] is only a special case of the all-comprehending [[cosmology|cosmological]] problem, the question of substance. "If we understood the nature of matter and energy, we should also understand how the substance underlying them can under certain conditions feel, desire, and think." Consciousness, like feeling and willing, among the higher animals is a mechanical work of the [[ganglion|ganglion-cells]], and as such must be carried back to chemical and physical events in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of these.  -Ernst Haeckel, 1895 &lt;ref name=PGmono/&gt;

Haeckel had written that human behavior and feeling could be explained, within the laws of the physical universe, as "mechanical work of the ganglion-cells" as stated.

== View of William James ==
The [[philosopher]] [[William James]] in his book ''[[Pragmatism]]'' (1907) wrote about the world-riddle, as follows:

:: [From ''Pragmatism'' (Lecture VII) by William James:]
:: "All the great single-word answers to the world's riddle, such as God, the One, Reason, Law, Spirit, Matter, Nature, Polarity, the [[Dialectic]] Process, the Idea, the Self, the Oversoul, draw the admiration that men have lavished on them from this oracular role. By amateurs in philosophy and professionals alike, the universe is represented as a queer sort of petrified sphinx whose appeal to man consists in a monotonous challenge to his divining powers. THE Truth: what a perfect idol of the rationalistic mind!"
:::::::::::: --William James, ''Pragmatism'', 1907.&lt;ref name=GutenWJ&gt;
     "The Project Gutenberg EBook of Pragmatism, by William James" (text),
     Project Gutenberg, 2002, Gutenberg.org webpage:
     [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/prgmt10.txt Gutenberg-Pragmatism].
&lt;/ref&gt;

William James has questioned the attitude of thinking that a single answer applies to everything or everyone.  In the passage, the capitalized "THE" signifies the viewpoint meaning "the one and only" [[absolute truth]].

== Emil du Bois-Reymond ==
[[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] used the term "World Riddle" in 1880 for [[Emil_du_Bois-Reymond#The_Seven_World_Riddles|seven great questions]] of science, such as the ultimate nature of matter and the origin of simple sensations. In the lecture to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] he declared that neither science nor philosophy could ever explain these riddles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Emil du Bois-Reymond: Neuroscience, Self, and Society in Nineteenth-Century Germany|last=Finkelstein|first=Gabriel Ward|date=2013|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262019507|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/berdiegrenzende07reygoog]
