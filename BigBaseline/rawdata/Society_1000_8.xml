'''Albert Leffingwell''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] (1845–1916) was an American physician, social reformer, and vocal advocate for [[vivisection]] reform.  He authored many books bringing light to the cruel abuses of animal experimentation and calling for regulation.  At the same time he sought middle ground between the anti-vivisection societies which called for the abolition of all experimentation and those who rejected any restraints.  Leffingwell also was concerned with meat safety, believing that lax regulations, in particular allowing cancerous animals into the [[food chain]], were responsible for increases in the incidence of cancer.  He also served as the president of the [[American Humane Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Dr. Albert Leffingwell.

'''Alicia Teresa Jane O'Shea Petersen''' (2 July 1862 &amp;ndash; 22 January 1923) was a [[Tasmania]]n suffragist and social reformer.

Alicia O'Shea Petersen was born in Tasmania. She became interested in women's and labor rights as a result of her own work in [[sweatshop]]s. She was also influenced by her cousin [[John Earle (Australian politician)|John Earle]], who founded the Workers' Political League and became the first [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] [[Premier of Tasmania]] in 1909. 

She was the first woman in [[Tasmania]] to stand as a political candidate, contesting the federal seat of [[Division of Denison|Denison]] in 1913. In 1922, when women were first eligible to stand for the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]], she was a political candidate in Denison.

'''Anne Newport, Baroness Torrington''' (? - 1735) was an eighteenth-century aristocrat and social reformer. 

She was the daughter of Robert Pierrepont and Anne Murray. 

She was the third wife of [[Thomas Newport, 1st Baron Torrington|Thomas Newport, Baron Torrington]], a [[barrister]] and [[Lord of the Treasury]].

A '''bachelorette party''', '''hen(s) party''', '''hen(s) night''' or '''hen(s) do''', is a party held for a [[woman]] who is about to get [[Marriage|married]]. The terms ''hen party'', ''hen do'' or ''hen night'' are used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Canada]], while the terms ''hens party'' or ''hens night'' are common in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], and the term ''bachelorette party'' is common in the [[United States]]. The term '''stagette''' is occasionally used in Canada.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-541816-6"&gt;{{cite book
|editor= Barber, Katherine|title=Canadian Oxford dictionary|edition=2|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire]|year=2004|isbn=0-19-541816-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be referred to as a ''girls' night out'' or ''kitchen tea'' ([[South Africa]] in particular) or other terms in other English-speaking countries. Other pre-wedding celebrations, such as the '''bridesmaids luncheon''', are often held in lieu of bachelorette parties due to the latter's association with [[Lascivious behavior|licentiousness]] in some countries since the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Adam2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adam|first=Elise Mac|title=Something New: Wedding Etiquette for Rule Breakers, Traditionalists, and Everyone in Between|date=19 February 2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|language=English |isbn=9781416958093|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2009Haire"/&gt;

The bachelorette party is modeled after the [[bachelor party]],&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Post, Peggy|authorlink=Peggy Post|title=Emily Post's wedding etiquette|edition=5|publisher=Collins|location=London|year=2006|pages=183–184|isbn=0-06-074504-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is itself historically a dinner given by the [[bridegroom]] to his friends shortly before his wedding.&lt;ref name="1922 Post"&gt;{{cite book|author=Post, Emily|authorlink=Emily Post|title=Etiquette in Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home|publisher= [[Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company]]|year=1922

==History==
Prior to its usage as a term for a pre-wedding party, ''hen party'' was used in the United States as a general term for an all-female gathering, usually held at a hostess's residence. In 1897, ''[[The Deseret News]]'' noted that a hen party was a "time honored idea that tea and chitchats, gossip smart hats, constitute the necessary adjuncts to these particular gatherings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BLhLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fTADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6867,6158820&amp;dq=hen-party&amp;hl=en| title= Hen Party is Great Fun| work= The Deseret News |page= 12|publisher=Google News |date= December 18, 1897| access-date= June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] was described as hosting a Christmas-time hen party for [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]] wives and "ladies of the press".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Gridiron Widows Visited by Santa| agency= Associated Press| location= Washington| date= December 15, 1940| page=B-9| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fjtPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=W00DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4017,4940452&amp;dq=hen-party&amp;hl=en| work=St. Petersburg Times |publisher=Google News |accessdate= June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9iEhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tWQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6361,456699&amp;dq=hen-party&amp;hl=en| title= And, Too, How Much Should Wives Tell Husbands| first= Hal| last= Boyle | work= Sarasota Herald-Tribune |page= 4| publisher= Google News |location= New York| date= September 6, 1951| access-date= June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WsYwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YmoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3476,2742002&amp;dq=hen-party&amp;hl=en| title= Dorothy Dix Says...| work= Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | page= 12| date= June 10, 1947| access-date= June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bachelorette party is consciously modeled after the centuries-old [[bachelor's party]],&lt;ref name= isbn0-06-074504-5 /&gt;&lt;ref name= isbn0-8135-3811-4 /&gt; which is itself historically a [[black tie]] dinner given by the [[bridegroom]],&lt;ref name="1922 Post"/&gt; or sometimes his father,&lt;ref name="Haire2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1904885,00.html|title=A Brief History Of Bachelor Parties|last=Haire|first=Meaghan|date=16 June 2009|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|language=English|accessdate=15 December 2017|quote=In the past, a bachelor party could commonly involve a black-tie dinner hosted by the groom's father, with toasts to the groom and the bride.

=== Modern adaptations ===
The practice of giving a party to honour the bride-to-be goes back for centuries. However, certain American bachelorette party customs involving licentiousness among some social groups may have begun during the [[Sexual Revolution]] of the 1960s. It was uncommon until at least the mid-1980s,&lt;ref name="2009Haire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1904885,00.html|title=A Brief History Of Bachelor Parties|last=Haire|first=Meaghan|date=16 June 2009|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|language=English|accessdate=15 December 2017|quote=In the past, a bachelor party could commonly involve a black-tie dinner hosted by the groom's father, with toasts to the groom and the bride. The more recent traditions of hazing, humiliation and debauchery — often consuming entire weekends and involving travel to an exotic destination such as Las Vegas or its nearest available facsimile — became a staple of bad '80s sex comedies.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first book on planning bachelorette parties was published only in 1998.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8135-3811-4"&gt;{{cite book|last= Montemurro| first= Beth|title=Something old, something bold: bridal showers and bachelorette parties|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|year=2006|isbn=0-8135-3811-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Hen party in San Francisco, USA-1Aug2010.jpg|upright|right|thumb|A woman dancing on the bar at a bachelorette party in the US]]
Since the 1980s, many parties in honor of the bride-to-be that were labeled as bachelorette parties often involved displays of sexual freedom, such as trading intimate secrets, getting drunk, and watching [[Striptease#Male strippers|male strippers]].&lt;ref name="2009Haire"/&gt; Parties that honored the bride-to-be without them avoided that label.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8135-3811-4"/&gt; Now, however, the term is used for a wide variety of parties.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8118-4458-7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-470-10672-7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fox, Sue|title=Etiquette For Dummies |publisher=For Dummies|location=|year=2007|isbn=0-470-10672-7
|quote=Bachelor and bachelorette trends vary from coast to coast and are changing fast in many social circles. Most every type of party is acceptable...|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bachelorette parties became especially popular around the turn of the 21st century and frequently appeared in the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Montemurro|first1=Beth|title=Something Old, Something Bold: Bridal Showers and Bachelorette Parties|isbn=9780813538112|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53_K9J2F5zoC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=bachelorette+party+1990s+early+2000s&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uXqDyqq7lC&amp;sig=m2Lpf8wkW_YP1F64o6TOyIzIjPE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Sd1QVYCqKYqu7gbHrYDICg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bachelorette%20party%201990s%20early%202000s&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those uncomfortable with these modern customs of debauchery often celebrate the night before their wedding with a combined [[stag and doe|stag and doe party]], a custom that has become increasingly popular.&lt;ref name="2009Haire" /&gt;

Author Beth Montemurro has tied the cultural significance of a bachelorette party to concepts of [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-8135-3811-4" /&gt;  The phrase "hen party" mirrors the male "stag party" in referencing social stereotypes of each gender at the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Creative compounding in English: the semantics of metaphorical and metonymical noun-noun combinations | first=Réka | last=Benczes | year=2006 | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company | isbn=90-272-2373-4 | page=95 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eK8R61s_gwQC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=%22hen+party%22+history&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=CZRdTKCoFMP98AbA2LCzDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hen%20party%22%20history&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When held in a private venue, such as the hostess's home, the party may take any form that pleases the hostesses and honors the bride-to-be. Dinners and [[cocktail parties]], which provide comfortable opportunities for participants to talk or to give intimate advice to the bride-to-be, are common.&lt;ref name= isbn0-06-074504-5 /&gt; Other hostesses choose a themed party, such as a "[[pamper party]]," with guests indulging in [[spa]] treatments, or a cooking class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.henweekends.co.uk/spa-hen-party/|title=Spa Hen Party {{!}} UK &amp; European Spa Breaks {{!}} Hen Weekends|website=www.henweekends.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="new etiq"&gt;{{cite book|first1= Kristen |last1= Finello |first2=Diane |last2=Forden |title=Bridal Guide Magazine's New Etiquette for Today's Bride| publisher= Warner Books |location=New York |year=2005 |pages=28–29 |isbn=0-446-67822-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; While proposing a [[toast (honor)|toast]] to the bride-to-be is common at most bachelorette parties, some center on [[drinking games]].

In the 21st century, many companies sell products aimed at the organizers of bachelorette parties, including packs of themed games, pre-printed invitations, decorations, novelties, and [[sex toy]]s. A common theme of parties is male nudity. In North America, it is common in some social circles to hire a [[male stripper]] or attend a male strip club.

In the UK, a [[naked butler]] has become a common theme and a popular hen party idea. The naked butler is often dressed in just a collar, dickie bow, cuffs and a short apron or trunks. He will wait on the hen and her party including serving drinks and food as well as hosting or taking part in hen party games and entertainment. An extension of this concept that has also become popular in the UK is the hiring of a naked chef to cater for the guests often accompanied by a naked butler to serve the food and drinks. [[Life drawing]] parties featuring a nude male model might also be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A bachelorette art party that makes ogling hot naked guys respectable|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/a-bachelorette-art-party-that-makes-ogling-hot-naked-guys-respectable-4991034|website=www.laweekly.com|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Participants are often all women. [[Bridesmaids]] (if any) are typically invited, but any of the [[bride]]'s close friends may be included.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"/&gt;

This party is typically hosted by one or more members of the [[wedding party]], although it is possible for any friend to host a party in honor of the bride-to-be. Formally, a party in honor of the bride-to-be is never hosted by the bride-to-be,&lt;ref name="Rude III"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/opinions/dont_be_rude_part_iii_socializing.php|title=Don’t Be Rude: Part III, Socializing|last= Berry| first= Margaret|date=September 4, 2002|work=[[The Morning News (online magazine)|The Morning News]]|publisher=|quote= Don’t throw parties in your own honor.

It also suggests that the party is a poorly camouflaged push for gifts, instead of a heartfelt expression of affection from a dear friend. |accessdate=2008-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although she may participate in its planning. While it is normally the duty of a hostess to pay for the entertainment she gives her guests, it is common in most English-speaking countries for participants to share the costs of this event.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"/&gt; Whether the bride-to-be pays her share, or whether her share is divided between other participants is determined by the organizers and the bride-to-be during the early stages of the planning process.

Participating in a bachelorette party is always optional, and many brides decline these parties altogether.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"/&gt; Neither bridesmaids nor other friends can be required either to attend or to pay for any part of this party.&lt;ref name="isbn0-609-60431-7"&gt;{{cite book|last= Martin| first=Judith|authorlink=Judith Martin|title=Miss Manners on Weddings|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|year=1999|pages=136&amp;ndash;137|isbn=0-609-60431-7|quote=Contrary to rumor, bridesmaids are not obliged to entertain in honor of the bride, nor to wear dresses they cannot afford.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it is derived from a formal dinner, a bachelorette party is properly held in the evening,&lt;ref name="1922 Post"/&gt; usually about a week (or at least a few days) before the wedding,&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"/&gt; and usually includes dinner, although alternative approaches are not uncommon.&lt;ref name="isbn0-06-074504-5"/&gt;

==Role of alcohol==
In the early 21st century, some bachelorette parties rivaled the drunkenness seen in Hollywood portrayals of bachelor parties.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://health.usnews.com/wellness/articles/2017-07-12/how-to-plan-a-sober-bachelorette-or-bachelor-celebration|title=How to Plan a Sober Bachelorette or Bachelor Celebration|last=Castaneda|first=Ruben|date=12 July 2017|work=US News and World Report|access-date=2018-04-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, sober bachelorette parties are not unusual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many brides and guests are staying [[Sobriety|sober]] in recovery from alcoholism or are not drinking alcoholic beverages [[Alcohol and pregnancy|due to pregnancy]] or health issues, for [[Religion and alcohol|religious reasons]], or because they do not want to drink alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brides.com/story/how-to-survive-a-bachelorette-when-youre-sober|title=Surviving a Bachelorette Party When You’re Sober|last=Emery|first=Léa Rose|date=11 August 2017|work=Brides|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sober parties focus on building relationships and activities beyond hanging out at a place that serves alcohol.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Location==
Many bachelorette parties are held at home or at a nearby restaurant.  Some people turn a bachelorette party into a weekend trip to another city.  Some cities, such as [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] for people in the southwestern US and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] for people in the [[Upper Midwest]], are relatively popular with American bridal parties that are seeking a weekend destination and can afford to pay hundreds of dollars per person for the experience.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/annehelenpetersen/how-nashville-became-one-big-bachelorette-party|title=How Nashville Became One Big Bachelorette Party|last=Petersen|first=Anne Helen|date=29 March 2018|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other people will travel farther to cities such as [[Las Vegas]].  In the UK, parties in relatively inexpensive European destinations such as [[Latvia]] and the [[Canary Islands]] are popular.  

One reason that bridal parties travel to a different city is because they want to behave differently than they normally would, but they do not want to deal with the social repercussions that might ensue if friends, family members, or professional acquaintances saw them doing this.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  When large numbers of bachelor and bachelorette parties choose the same cities, this can produce extra jobs and new businesses to cater to them, but it also draws complaints from local residents who are faced with the disruption and public service costs caused by the seasonal influx of noisy parties and drunken visitors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Stag parties caused so much disruption in [[Riga, Latvia]] that the city formed a police group specifically to deal with bachelor and bachelorette parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/5101628.stm|title=Stagflation|last=|first=|date=2006-06-21|work=BBC|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2359095/British-men-flock-Latvia-cut-price-parties-easy-prey-mafia-beauties.html|title=The stag hunters: Hordes of British men are flocking to Latvia for cut-price parties. But they are easy prey for mafia beauties who seduce them, spike their drinks and empty their bank accounts|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
A more traditional alternative is the ''bridesmaids luncheon'', hosted by friends of the bride's mother or mothers of the bridesmaids, usually give the day before the wedding. Attendees include the bridesmaids, their mothers and close female friends and relatives; the event is often multi-generational including mothers and even grandmothers of the bride and groom. At a bridesmaids luncheon, the bride often presents a small gift to each bridesmaid. The purpose of the luncheon is for the bride to thank her attendants and includes presenting them with bridesmaid gifts. This is also the time when the bridesmaids' gift, if any, is customarily given to the bride. If there is a cake, it may contain symbolic [[Good luck charm|good luck charms]].

If a significant aspect of the party is presenting small gifts to the bride-to-be, then the event is properly called a [[bridal shower]]. For the convenience of the bride-to-be, bridal showers are usually held earlier than a bachelorette party.&lt;ref name="isbn0-385-41342-4"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vanderbilt, Amy |author2=Tuckerman, Nancy |author3=Dunnan, Nancy |authorlink=Amy Vanderbilt|title=The Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette|edition=|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, N.Y|year=1995|pages=364–365|isbn=0-385-41342-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

In [[Canada]] a [[stag and doe]] party, also called a "Jack and Jill", "buck and doe" or "hag" (''hen'' + ''stag'') party, is a [[fundraising party]] that includes both men and women. These parties are held by couples wishing to distance themselves from the licentiousness associated with many post-1980s bachelorette parties and are becoming increasingly popular, especially as a means to financially support a wedding.

==Life==
Bhoja or Bhojo was born in 1785&lt;ref name="Datta1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: A-Devo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ObFCT5_taSgC|year=1987|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1803-1|page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Leva Patil|Leva]] [[Kanbi]]&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt; caste at village named Fattehpur or Devkigalol near [[Jetpur, Navagadh|Jetpur]] in [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]]. His father's name was Karshandas and mother was Gangabai and family surname was Savalia. He met his guru, a [[sanyasin]] from Girnar at age of 12. Later, when he was 24, the family shifted to [[Fatehpur, Gujarat|Fatehpur]] near [[Amreli]], Gujarat. He came to be known as Bhoja Bhagat ([[Bhagat]] derived from ''Bhakt'', devotee) and Bhojalram in his later life.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;&lt;ref name=x/&gt;

By occupation he was a farmer. Although, he was an illiterate, but with blessings of his [[Guru]] in [[Girnar]], he wrote poems and songs condemning social inequities, which became well known as "Bhoja Bhagat Na Chabkha".&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite book|title=Milestones in Gujarati Literature|author=Krishnalal M.

Bhoja Bhagat died in 1850 at age of 65 at [[Virpur (Rajkot)|Virpur]], where he had gone to visit his disciple [[Jalaram]]. His memorial temple (called ''Ota'' locally) is located at Virpur.&lt;ref name=h&gt;{{cite book|title=Gujarat State Gazetteers: Amreli|author=Gujarat (India)|date=1972|publisher=Directorate of Government Print., Stationery and Publications, Gujarat State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCkbAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He liked to call himself as ''Bhojal'' in his verses.&lt;ref name=c/&gt; As a poet and philosopher also wrote ''[[Aarti]]s'', ''[[Bhajan]]s'', ''Dholas'', ''Kafis'', ''[[Kirtan]]s'', ''Mahinas'' and ''Prabhatias'' but is most famous for his ''Chabkhas''. These satirical pieces are known as ''Bhoja Bhagat na Chabkha'' ( literally ''Lashes of Bhoja Bhagat'' ) in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. His rough language is seen in these ''Chabkha'' which tells about social equanimity. His tender and compassionate language his visible in his verses, ''pada'' describing separation of [[Gopi]]s from [[Krishna]] in ''Bhaktamala'', ''Chalaiyakhyan'' and his ''bhajan'' of ''Kachabo ane Kachabi'' (couple of turtles). His ''Saravadan'' is about union with cosmic consciousness.&lt;ref name="Ayyappappanikkar1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ayyappappanikkar|title=Medieval Indian Literature: Surveys and selections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KYLpvaKJIMEC&amp;pg=PA128|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-0365-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akademi, p. 128 Medieval Indian Literature&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=d&gt;{{cite book|title=The Modern review, Volume 17, Issues 2-6|author=Ramananda Chatterjee|year=1915|publisher=Prabasi Press Private, Ltd.|pages=446|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pihE-bC3HFwC|issn=0026-8380|accessdate=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brawling, 喧嘩, PA160113aaa.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The [[yakuza]]'s fight by festival of Japan]]

'''Brawling''' (probably connected with German language ''brüllen'', to roar, shout), in law, was the offence of quarrelling, or creating a disturbance in a [[church (building)|church]] or churchyard. Brawling was covered in [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastic courts]] until 1860. It has rarely been prosecuted since then.

==History==
During the early stages of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in England religious controversy too often became converted into actual disturbance, and the ritual lawlessness of the [[Wikt:parochial|parochial]] [[clergy]] very frequently provoked popular violence. To repress these disturbances the [[Brawling Act 1551]] was passed in 1551, by which it was enacted: "that if any person shall, by words only, quarrel, chide or brawl in any church or churchyard, it shall be lawful for the ordinary of the place where the same shall be done and proved by two lawful witnesses, to suspend any person so offending, if he be a layman, from the entrance of the church, and if he be a clerk, from the ministration of his office, for so long as the said ordinary shall think meet, according to the fault."&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Brawling |volume=4 |page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Act of 1553 added the punishment of imprisonment until the party should repent. The Brawling Act 1551 was partly repealed in 1828 and wholly repealed as regards laymen by the [[Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860]]. Under that Act, which applies to [[Ireland]] as well as to England, persons guilty of riotous, violent or indecent behaviour, in churches and chapels of the Church of England or Ireland, or in any chapel of any religious denomination, or in England in any place of religious worship duly certified, or in churchyards or burial-grounds, were liable on conviction before two justices to a penalty of not more than £5, or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two months. This enactment applied to clergy as well as to laity, and a clergyman of the Church of England convicted under it could also be dealt with under the [[Clergy Discipline Act 1892]] (''Girt v. Fillingham'', 1901, L.R. Prob. 176).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

When Mr [[John Kensit|J. Kensit]] during an ordination service in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] "objected" to one of the candidates for ordination, on grounds which did not constitute an impediment or notable crime within the meaning of the ordination service, he was held to have unlawfully disturbed the [[bishop]] of [[London]] in the conduct of the service, and to be liable to conviction under the Act of 1860 (''Kensit'' v. ''Dean and Chapter of St Paul's'', 1905, L.R. 2 K.B. 249). The public worship of [[Protestant]] Dissenters, [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Jews]] in England had before 1860 been protected by a series of statutes beginning with the [[Act of Toleration 1689|Toleration Act]] of 1689, and ending with the [[Liberty of Religious Worship Act 1855]]. These enactments, though not repealed, were for practical purposes superseded by the summary remedy given by the Act of 1860. In Scotland disturbance of public worship is punishable as a [[breach of the peace]] (''Dougall'' v. ''Dykes'', 1861, 4 Irvine 101).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===In the British Empire===
In British possessions abroad, interference with religious worship was usually dealt with by legislation, and not as a common-law offence. In [[India]] it was an offence voluntarily to cause disturbance to any assembly lawfully engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies (Penal Code, s. 296). Under the [[Queensland Criminal Code]] of 1899 (s. 207) penalties were imposed on persons who wilfully and without lawful justification or excuse (the proof of which lies on them) disquiet or disturb any meeting of persons lawfully assembled for religious worship, or assault any forces lawfully officiating at such meeting, or any of the persons there assembled.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===In the United States===
In the United States disturbance of religious worship is treated as an offence under the [[common law]], which is in many states supplemented by legislation (see Bishop, ''Amer. Crim. Law,'' 8th ed. 1892, vol. i. s. 542, vol. ii. ss. 303-305; California Penal Code, s. 302; ''Revised Laws of Massachusetts'', 1902, chap. 212, s. 30.).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1998, [[Peter Tatchell]] of [[OutRage!]] was prosecuted for interrupting the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]'s Easter sermon with a short gay rights speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/easter%20sunday.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924202506/http://www.petertatchell.net/religion/easter%20sunday.htm |archivedate=2009-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1860 legislation (which transferred jurisdiction away from the ecclesiastic courts) was used to try him; his defense focused on the [[Human Rights Act 1998]]. He was convicted and fined £18.60 (referring to the 1860 legislation) plus court costs.

[[Image:Collaborative E-democracy2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In a collaborative e-democracy every citizen participates in the policy process, either indirectly, by delegating proxy representatives to vote on their behalf within the different policy domains, or directly, by voting on a particular issue (green arrows).]]

'''Collaborative e-democracy''' or '''super-democracy''' is a democratic conception that combines key features of [[direct democracy]], [[representative democracy]], and [[e-democracy]] (i.e. the use of [[Information and communication technology|ICTs]] for democratic processes). The concept was first published at two international academic conferences in 2009 (see below).

Collaborative e-democracy refers to a [[political system]] in which governmental stakeholders ([[politicians]]/[[political party|parties]], [[Minister (government)|ministers]], [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] etc.) and non-governmental stakeholders ([[NGO]]s, [[lobbying|political lobbies]], local communities, individual [[citizens]], etc.) collaborate on the development of public [[law]]s and [[policy|policies]]. This collaborative policymaking process is conducted on a governmental [[social networking site]] in which all citizens are members (collaborative e-policy-making).

While directly elected [[government officials]] (i.e. [[Liquid democracy#Delegated voting|‘proxy representatives’]]) would conduct the vast majority of law and policy-making processes (representative democracy), the citizens would retain their final [[voting]] power on each issue (direct democracy). Additionally each citizen would be empowered to propose their own policies to the electorate and thus initiate new policy processes where applicable ([[initiative]]). Collaboratively generated policies would consider the opinion of a larger proportion of the citizenry; therefore they may be more just, more sustainable, and thus easier to implement.

==Theoretical background==
Collaborative e-democracy involves following theory components:
* '''‘Collaborative democracy’''', a “political framework where electors and the elected actively collaborate to attain the best possible solution to any situation using collaborative enabling technologies to facilitate wide scale citizen participation in government”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collaborative-democracy.com/cdDefinition.cfm www.collaborative-democracy.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/cdn/ Collaborative Democracy Network], Center for Collaborative Policy, [[California State University, Sacramento]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''‘Collaborative e-policymaking’''' (or CPM) is a software facilitated five phase [[Policy#Policy cycle|policy process]] in which every citizen participates directly or indirectly (i.e. via proxy representatives). The process is conducted on a governmental social networking site in which all citizens are members. Each citizen can suggest issues, rank and evaluate the suggestions of others, and vote on the laws and policies that will affect them. [At a general level, CPM is a universal process that would facilitate every organisation (e.g. business, government) or self-selected group (e.g. union, online community) to co-create their own regulations (e.g. laws, code of conduct) and strategies (e.g. government actions, business strategies) by involving all stakeholders in the corresponding decision-processes.] &lt;ref&gt;Petrik, K. (2010) [http://www.jedem.org/article/viewArticle/14 "Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach. ], JeDEM - eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government, Vol 2, No 1 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csus.edu/ccp/ Collaborative Policy], Center for Collaborative Policy, [[California State University, Sacramento]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Australian National University, ANU E Press; [http://epress.anu.edu.au/anzsog/collab_gov/mobile_devices/index.html Collaborative Governance - A new era of public policy in Australia?]
&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Proxy voting]] and [[delegative democracy]]''': Direct democracy would require each citizen to vote on each policy issue each time. As this would overburden most people, the citizens in a collaborative e-democracy delegate trusted representatives (or proxies) to vote on their behalf on all those issues and/or domains where they lack of time, experience, or interest for direct participation. Although the proxy votes on the principals behalf, the principal retains the final voting power on each issue. Thus proxy representation combines the best features of direct democracy and representative democracy on the social networking site.&lt;ref&gt;Petrik, K. (2010) [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1556176.1556222 "Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision-making."], [http://www.dgrc.org/ Digital Government Society of North America]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy process==
Collaborative e-policymaking is a process where public laws &amp; policies are generated in collaboration of multiple stakeholders (e.g. affected people; [[domain expert]]s; parties who can help to implement a solution). Each new policy cycle starts with the identification of a collective problem or goal by the collective of participants (i.e. citizens, experts, proxy representatives).

* '''Suggestion &amp; ranking phase''': Each participant is encouraged to submit policy proposals for how to solve the identified problem / achieve the goal (policy [[crowdsourcing]]). The submissions are ranked so that the policy with the most supporters appears on top of the others.
* '''Evaluation phase''': For each top-ranked proposal (i.e. law or government action) the upsides and downsides of its implementation are defined so that the collective can evaluate how they would be affected by each policy. The evaluation process is supported by independent domain experts.
* '''Voting phase''': Based on the co-created information the collective votes for the proposal that is considered to be optimal for solving the collective problem / achieving the goal. As a result, a new law is introduced or a new government action executed.
* '''Revision phase''': A pre-determined period after implementation the collective is addressed to determine whether the problem was solved / the goal achieved by the selected policy or not. If yes, the policy cycle concludes; if no, the process starts over with the suggestion phase until the issue is resolved.
To be clear, CPM is automated as a [[Process (computing)|software process]] that is conducted on the governmental social networking site.

==Principles==
Collaborative e-democracy is based on following core principles:
* '''[[Self-government]]''', the ideal of direct democracy, and “''quod omnes tangit ab omnibus approbetur''”, the ancient maxim from the Roman law that says “''that which affects all people must be approved by all people''”. This principle is in sharp contrast to representative democracy where the public policymaking process is biased by corporate lobbies ([[Corporatocracy]]).
* '''[[Open source governance]]''', a political philosophy which advocates the application of the philosophies of the [[open source]] and [[open content]] movements to democratic principles in order to enable any interested citizen to add to the creation of policy.
* '''Aggregation''': One function of the social networking site is to aggregate the citizens’ opinions on issues (e.g. agreement with a certain policy). Based on this communality people can form ad-hoc groups to address these issues.
* '''[[Collaboration]]''': Another function facilitates the collaboration of likeminded people on common issues (e.g. the co-creation of a policy proposal) within aggregated groups and/or between independent groups. Besides groups with controversial strategies / perspectives which focus on similar outcomes compete with each other.
* '''[[Collective intelligence]]''': The CPM process harnesses the peoples’ collective intelligence, i.e. a shared group intelligence that emerges from the aggregation, collaboration, competition and (consensus) decision-making of the various stakeholders. This group intelligence is utilised to identify issues and to co-create solutions that are optimal / sustainable for most people. Collective intelligence reflects a design pattern of [[Web 2.0]].
* '''Collective learning &amp; Adoption''': The direct democracy component of collaborative e-democracy shifts the responsibility of policymaking from government teams (top down) to the collective of citizens (bottom up). As the people are confronted with the consequences of their own decisions a collective learning process is initiated. Collaborative e-democracy is not a static construct but flexible and open to change, by quickly integrating learning experiences and by collectively adopting to new social, economical or environmental circumstances. This principle reflects ‘Perpetual Beta’, another design pattern of Web 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oreilly.com/catalog/web2report/chapter/web20_report_excerpt.pdf O’Reilly Radar Web 2.0 Principles and Best Practices]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits &amp; limitations==
The concept of collaborative e-democracy intends to achieve following '''benefits''':
* '''[[Transparency (social)|Transparency]] and accessibility''': The CPM process would be transparent and accessible for all citizens via the internet.
* '''[[Political efficacy]]''': Allowing citizens to participate in government processes would increase the political efficacy and counteract the [[democratic deficit]].
* '''[[Deliberative democracy|Deliberation]]''': The governmental social networking site as main platform for political information &amp; communication would increase the quality of deliberation between the various governmental and non-governmental stakeholders of the nation.
* '''Collective awareness''': Large scale online participation would increase the public awareness of the collective problems, goals, or policy issues (e.g. the opinions of minorities) and facilitate harnessing the nation’s collective intelligence for collaboratively developing policies.

On the contrary the concept has several '''limitations''':
* '''[[Constitution]]al limits''': Most democratic nations have constitutional limits to direct democracy; governments may be unwilling to relinquish such policy-making authority to the collective.
* '''[[Digital divide]]''': People without internet access would be disadvantaged in a collaborative e-democracy. Therefore, traditional democratic procedures would be made available until the digital divide is concluded.
* '''[[Majority rule]]''': Such as in most democratic decision processes majorities could over vote minorities. The evaluation process would however give a fair warning when a minority group would be significantly discriminated against by a certain policy.
* '''[[Naive]]ty''':  Voters may lack a thorough understanding of the facts and data surrounding their options.  This could lead to misplaced votes which do not represent the voters' actual will.  However, the proxy voting / delegation included in the system greatly mitigates this problem.  Increased education, [[critical thinking]] and reasoning skills (all of which could occur naturally through a better form of government), and usage of the internet should also help reduce the problem. Also, the CPM process involves proxies and experts to inform people upon the implications of the suggested policies before a decision is made.

==Research &amp; development==
In 2009 the two conceptions, ''collaborative e-democracy'' and ''collaborative e-policy-making'', were  first published at two [[academic conference]]s on [[e-governance]] and [[e-democracy]]:
* Petrik, Klaus (2009) ''“Participation and e-Democracy: How to utilize Web 2.0 for policy decision-making”''; the [http://dgo2009.pbworks.com/ 10th International Digital Government Research Conference: "Social Networks: Making Connections between Citizens, Data &amp; Government"] in [[Puebla]], [[Mexico]];
* Petrik, Klaus (2009) ''“Deliberation and Collaboration in the Policy Process: A Web 2.0 approach”'';  [http://edem2009.ocg.at/ The 3rd Conference on Electronic Democracy] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]].
* A third publication appears in the [http://www.jedem.org/article/viewArticle/14 "eJournal of eDemocracy and Open Government", Vol 2, No 1 (2010)].

Current research is conducted at the [[Queensland University of Technology]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] where a [[Prototype#Computer programming.2Fcomputer science|prototype]] software for  collaborative e-policymaking is being developed. The software will be featured on an independent web 2.0 platform with open participation; the volunteer participants will be facilitated to collaboratively develop Australian public laws and policies by proceeding through the phases of the CPM process. The start of the trialling period is probably 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbaninformatics.net/people/klaus/ QUT Urban Informatics Lab]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Community]] service''' is a non-paying job performed by one person or a group of people for the benefit of the community or its institutions. Community service is distinct from [[volunteering]], since it is not always performed on a voluntary basis. Personal benefits may be realized, but it may be performed for a variety of reasons including citizenship requirements, a substitution of criminal justice [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], requirements of a school or class, and requisites for receipt of certain benefits.

== Background ==
[[Community]] service is a non-paying job performed by one person or a group of people for the benefit of the community or its institutions. Community service is distinct from [[volunteering]], since it is not always performed on a voluntary basis. It may be performed for a variety of reasons.
* It may be required by a government as a part of citizenship requirements, generally in lieu of military service.
* It may be required as a substitution of, or in addition to, other criminal justice [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] – when performed for this reason it may also be referred to as '''community payback'''.
* It may be mandated by schools to meet the requirements of a class, such as in the case of [[service-learning]] or to meet the requirements of graduating as class valedictorian.
* In the UK, it has been made a condition of the receipt of certain benefits, including disability-related ones. {{dubious|date=October 2017}} (see [[Workfare in the United Kingdom]])
* In [[Sweden]] it's a [[suspended sentence]] called "samhällstjänst" ("society service").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/2437379|title=Att undanröja villkorlig dom som förenats med samhällstjänst|author=Charlotta Hellberg|date=2012|publisher=Lund University|language=Swedish and English|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons ==

=== High school graduation and community work ===

Some educational [[jurisdiction]]s in the United States require students to perform community service hours to graduate from [[high school]]. In some high schools in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], for example, students must finish 200 hours of community service to get a [[high school diploma|diploma]]. Some school districts in Washington, including [[Seattle Public Schools]], differentiate between community service and "service learning," requiring students to demonstrate that their work has contributed to their education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattleschools.org/area/gradreq/G10-00B.pdf High School Graduation Requirements Classes of 2008-Beyond] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615190223/http://www.seattleschools.org/area/gradreq/G10-00B.pdf |date=2007-06-15 }}, Seattle Public Schools, G10-00B, revised September 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; If a student in high school is taking an [[Advancement Via Individual Determination|AVID]] course, community service is often needed. Whether American public schools could require volunteer hours for high school graduation was challenged in ''[[Immediato v. Rye Neck School District]]'', but the court found no violation.

Many other high schools do not require community service hours for graduation, but still see an impressive number of students get involved in their community. For example, in [[Palo Alto, California]], students at [[Palo Alto High School]] log about 45,000 hours of community service every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getinvolvedpaloalto.weebly.com|title=Get Involved Palo Alto|work=Get Involved Palo Alto|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the school's College and Career Center awards about 250–300 students the [[President's Volunteer Service Award]] every year for their hard work.

=== Colleges ===

Though not technically considered a requirement, many colleges include community service as an unofficial requirement for acceptance. However, some colleges prefer work experience over community service, and some require that their students also continue community service for some specific number of hours to graduate. Some schools also offer unique “community service” courses, awarding credit to students who complete a certain number of community service hours. Some academic honor societies, along with some [[fraternities and sororities in North America]], require community service to [[Fraternities and sororities in North America#joining|join]] and others require each member to [[Fraternities and sororities in North America#Philanthropy|continue]] doing community service.

Many student organizations exist for the purpose of community service, the largest of which is [[Alpha Phi Omega]]. Community service projects are also done by [[sorority|sororities]] and [[fraternity|fraternities]].

Beginning in the 1980s, colleges began using service-learning as a pedagogy. A partnership of college presidents began in 1985 with the initiative of boosting community service in their colleges. This alliance called Campus Compact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Service Learning Program History|url=http://thestamp.umd.edu/leadership_community_service_learning/about_lcsl/history/program_history|website=Adele H. Stamp Student Union|accessdate=16 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013221125/http://thestamp.umd.edu/leadership_community_service_learning/about_lcsl/history/program_history|archivedate=13 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; led the way for many other schools to adopt service-learning courses and activities.

Service-learning courses vary widely in time span, quality, and in the balance of “service” and “learning” stressed in the course. A typical service-learning course, however, has these factors in common:
* A ''service'' component where the student spends time serving in the community meeting actual needs
* A ''learning'' component where students seek out or are taught information—often both interpersonal and academic—that they integrate into their service
* A ''reflection'' component that ties service and learning together
Reflection is sometimes symbolized by the hyphen in the term “service-learning” to indicate that it has a central role in learning by serving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eyler|first1=Janet|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?|date=1999|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0-7879-4483-1|page=4|edition= First}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection is simply a scheduled consideration of one’s own experiences and thoughts. This can take many forms, including journals, blogs, and discussions.

Service-learning courses present learning the material in context, meaning that students often learn effectively and tend to apply what was learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eyler|first1=Janet|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?|date=1999|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0-7879-4483-1|page=96|edition= First}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As the book ''Where’s the Learning in Service-Learning?'' notes, “Students engaged in service-learning are engaged in authentic situations; they get to know real people whose lives are affected by these issues… As a result, they have lots of questions—real questions that they want to have answered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eyler|first1=Janet|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?|date=1999|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0-7879-4483-1|page=86|edition= First}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, students are interested and motivated to learn the materials to resolve their questions.

Community service learning strives to connect or re-connect students with serving their community after they finish their course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eyler|first1=Janet|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learming?|date=1999|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0-7879-4483-1|pages=46|edition= First}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 September 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It creates a bridge for the lack of community service found among college-age people in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic News Release|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/volun.nr0.htm|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community service-learning ===
The one serving may be able to take something away from the experience and be able to use any newfound knowledge or interpersonal discoveries to improve their future servitude and the people around them. To gain the most from community service requires balancing learning with serving. Learning and serving at the same time improves a student's community while teaching life lessons and building character.

Community service-learning is “about leadership development as well as traditional information and skill acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?|last1=Eyler|first1=Janet|date=1999|publisher=Jossey-Bass|isbn=0-7879-4483-1|location=San Francisco, CA|page=10}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2015-06-21--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;” Therefore, the combination of people doing service and learning at the same time teaches them how to be effective and, more importantly, how to be effective about what is important to them. It improves their overall experience and application opportunities they gain from it. By adding service to learning, and balancing the two, community service can become more than just the simple act of serving. It takes small steps to create big change and this is what service-learning hopes to achieve. By being a classroom, a hands-on learning experience, and an opportunity to change the community, people are able to not only serve, but impact themselves as well.

==== Community Service-Learning definition ====
For community service-learning to be properly applied and understood, one must start with a good definition of service-learning. According to Fayetteville State University, “Service learning is a process of involving students in community service activities combined with facilitated means for applying the experience to their academic and personal development.  It is a form of experiential education aimed at enhancing and enriching student learning in course material.  When compared to other forms of experiential learning like internships and cooperative education, it is similar in that it is student-centered, hands-on and directly applicable to the curriculum.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uncfsu.edu/civic-engagement/service-learning/definition-of-service-learning|title=Definition of Service Learning|website=www.uncfsu.edu|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Freddy Cardoza defined Community Service-Learning as “Service learning is a Pedogogy (or a specific teaching-learning approach) that has few lectures, and is a more interactive hand's on educational strategy which provides students with instruction while leading them through meaningful community service experiences and engaging them in personal reflection on those experiences in order to build character and to teach problem-solving skills and civic responsibility.”&lt;ref&gt;"The Theology and Theory of Service Learning" Freddy Cardoza&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation not found}} Professor Cardoza stressed that it was important for a student take some time and reflect on what they are experiencing, seeing, doing, and what problems they are encountering and how they are going to apply what they have been learning to solve these problems. In other words, service-learning aims to link the personal and interpersonal development with cognitive development, as well as equipping the student with critical knowledge to help them understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to Service Learning" Freddy Cardoza&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation not found}}

Character.org defines Service-Learning this way: "Service learning is different than community service in several key ways. Service learning includes student leadership, reflective and academic components, and chances for celebration once the service activity has been successfully completed. Students reflect on community needs, ways to help, and once their service has been completed, they can internalise how their efforts have helped, while learning more about academics such as geography, math, or science."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://character.org/key-topics/service-learning/|title=Service Learning|last=|first=|date=|website=character.org|publisher=|access-date=September 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From these definitions, we can come up with our own definition of Community Service-Learning: "A teaching method that takes what is taught in a classroom and equips the student to apply that knowledge in real world situations, while equipping them to take their place in the world, become better citizens, and to be active social and economic problem solvers."

=== Court ordered service ===
[[File:Community Service Work Detail for 35th District Court Northville Michigan.JPG|thumb|Community service work detail for 35th District Court, [[Northville, Michigan]]]]
People convicted of a crime may be required to perform community service or to work for agencies in the sentencing jurisdiction either entirely or partially as a substitution of other [[judicial remedy|judicial remedies]] and [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], such as [[incarceration]] or [[fine (penalty)|fines]]. For instance, a fine may be reduced in exchange for a prescribed number of hours of community service. The court may allow the defendant to choose their community service, which must then be [[documentation|documented]] by "credible agencies," such as non-profit organizations, or may mandate a specific service.

Sometimes the sentencing is specifically targeted to the defendant's crime, for example, a [[litter]]er may have to clean a park or roadside, or a drunk driver might appear before school groups to explain why drunk driving is a crime. Also, a sentence allowing for a broader choice may prohibit certain services that the offender would reasonably be expected to perform anyway; for example, a convicted [[lawyer]] might be specifically prohibited from counting ''[[pro bono]]'' legal service.

=== Corporate social responsibility ===
Some employers involve their staff in some kind of community service programming, such as with the [[United Way of America]]. This may be completely voluntary or a condition of employment, or anything in between.

In addition, approximately 40% of Fortune 500 companies offer [[volunteer grant]] programs where companies provide monetary donations to nonprofit organizations in recognition of their employee's volunteerism (Ex. $500 volunteer grant after 25 hours of community service).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qgiv.com/blog/top-fundraising-consulting-firms/ |title=FAQ – Our database of corporate giving programs |publisher=Qgiv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worldwide examples ===
Community service in the [[United States]] is often similar to that in [[Canada]]. In [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], community service is an option for many [[criminal sentence]]s as an alternative to incarceration. In the [[United Kingdom]], community service is now officially referred to by the [[Home Office]] as more straightforward ''compulsory [[unpaid work]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080806122717/http%3A//www.noms.homeoffice.gov.uk/managing%2Doffenders/sentences/punishment/community%2Dsentences/ How we manage offenders], National Offender Management Service&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory unpaid work includes up to 300 hours of activities, such as conservation work, cleaning up graffiti, or working with a charity.  The [[Howard League for Penal Reform]] (the world's oldest prison reform organization) is a prominent advocate for increased community sentencing to reduce prison population and improve rehabilitation.

Starting in 2010, Danish High School students receive a special diploma if they complete at least 20 hours of voluntary work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng.uvm.dk/Aktuelt/News/Eng/2010/Jan/100108%20Students%20to%20get%20recognition%20for%20volunteer%20work.aspx Students to get recognition for volunteer work], Danish Ministry of Education, January 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Baccalaureate]] program formerly required 50 hours of community service, together with a written reflection on the service performed, to fulfill the requirement of 150 hours of CAS (Creativity, Action, Service) and receive an IB Diploma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibo.org/diploma/curriculum/core/cas/index.cfm Creativity, action, service (CAS)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703004308/http://www.ibo.org/diploma/curriculum/core/cas/index.cfm |date=2010-07-03 }}, Diploma Programmer curriculum—core requirements, homepage of the International Baccalaureate Organization&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Florence Nightingale]] exercised the entrepreneurship trait of nursing to help improve the unstable conditions of hospitals during the mid 1800s. Her tasks compiled of planning ahead at what needed to be different and how she was going to attempt to change things for the better, acting upon the ideas she came up with, and finally leaving behind a notebook of ideas and recommendations to help the next generation prevent the same disaster of extremely high death rates from happening again. Not only did she organize fundraisers to raise money for the hospital and arrange more stable living conditions to improve the health of the soldiers in the hospital, but she also removed people who were lapsed at their job and delegated tasks to more capable people, sometimes having to do the work herself. She grew up with the desire to help people or anything that needed a hand. Her love for aid and service to others grew when she got older and despite her lack of support from her family she pursued her dream and sacrificed her life for other people. She was not afraid to do the hard things if she knew it was going to make things better or as Niccolò Machiavelli puts it, “[T]here is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Machiavelli|first=Niccolo|title=The Prince|date=1532}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florence Nightingale is quoted as writing “The first thought I can remember, and the last was nursing work.” She served a specific group of people and benefited the public—which is community service.

==== '''Community Service in African Countries''' ====
Community Service in many African countries reflects inherited colonial compulsory national service. But community service in Africa has its own historical foundation that preexists any Western influence. The village chief, in the past would summon the entire community to a project or undertaking that benefited the entire community. Among the [[Akan people|Akans of West Africa]], it was called ''oman edwuma''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com/news/2017/December-19th/help-yourselves-before-buildings-collapse-on-pupils-presiding-methodist-bishop.php|title=Help yourselves before buildings collapse on pupils - Presiding Methodist Bishop|date=2017-12-19|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; which literally translates as 'state service' or 'service to the state.' ''Oman Edwuma'' is still practiced in many communities and may carry the force of traditional sanction. Recently, Aistiphi Inc&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philanthropy.space|title=Philanthropy Space - AISTIPHI {{!}} Development Philanthropy and Community Service|website=philanthropy.space|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a philanthropy-based social enterprise, drew upon on this ancient tradition to pioneer Philanthropy Space™&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://philanthropy.space/ghana/|title=Philanthropy Space Ghana - Aistiphi Gazette|last=|first=|date=|website=Philanthropy Space Ghana|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Our Commonwealth of Goodwill™ for African countries. The goal is to tap into this ancient practice of civic goodwill to foster development and poverty reduction.

=== Community service for institutions ===

Many institutions require and/or give incentive to students or employees alike to volunteer their time to community service programs.  From volunteering to participating in such charity events like walks or runs, institutes continue the practice or requiring their employees or students to grow in camaraderie while giving back to various communities. Many institutions also provide opportunities for employees and students to work together, and most student groups participate in their own form of community service. Each is unique in its own right; all are incredibly popular with employees; and in all of these programs, human resources plays an integral role.&lt;ref name="cupahr.org"&gt;https://www.cupahr.org/hew/files/HEWorkplace-Vol3No3-GivingBack.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; One such program, [[Johns Hopkins University]], under the leadership of Johns Hopkins University [[President Ronald J. Daniels]] and the chief executive officer of [[Baltimore City Schools]], the university’s human resources and community affairs departments worked with the school system to develop the [[Johns Hopkins Takes Time for Schools]] program in 2009, launching it on March 3, 2010. The program is a service partnership aimed at providing support and assistance to Baltimore City Schools (BCS) while providing faculty and staff an avenue for community service, offering their talents to the city’s youth and improving the administrative and educational capacities of the area’s school system.&lt;ref name="cupahr.org"/&gt; Some institutes even give their students or employees a guaranteed number of days or weeks of leave for certain acceptable community service programs. One example is [[East Carolina University]], which gives 24 hours of community service leave for full-time employees per year as an incentive and compensation for community service.&lt;ref&gt;https://stars.aashe.org/institutions/east-carolina-university-nc/report/2017-02-14/EN/public-engagement/EN-13/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious reasons for serving ===

Beyond required community service, some religious groups emphasize serving one’s community. These groups and churches reach out by holding [[Vacation Bible School]]s for children, hosting [[Red Cross]] blood drives, having fall carnivals, or offering free meals. Through these services, churches are able to benefit neighborhoods and families. Some churches create non-profit organizations that can help the public. Crisis pregnancy centers are often run by religious groups to promote pro-life values in local families. To meet impoverished people’s needs, some churches provide a food pantry or start a homeless shelter. Also, certain churches provide day care so that busy parents can work.

==== Christian service ====
[[Christianity]], the foundation of thousands of service organizations, holds many strong beliefs about community service. Christians view serving in one’s church and community as a way of showing God’s unconditional love. According to the Christian Bible, 1 Peter 4:10–11 (NIV) says:

''“Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms. If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.”''

These verses are the basis for Christian belief in outreach using one’s abilities, which they believe are given by God. According to Dr. Freddy Cardoza,{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} a teacher at biblical [[Biola University]], Christians are called to serve people because all people are made in God’s image. Christianity teaches that Jesus was a perfect example of serving during His time on earth. Jesus Christ healed the sick, fed thousands of people, and died for all mankind. Dedicated Christians see the importance of community service to show God’s love and to further spread the Gospel.

In addition, Christian belief states that they hold dual-citizenship, both in the kingdom of Heaven and the kingdom of earth.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} They believe that they have a responsibility to live life to the full while on earth, reaching out to others and meeting their needs, but also live in such a way as to prepare for eternity spent in Heaven. This means that they should be invested in both kingdoms, and everything they do should incorporate this line of thinking. 2 Corinthians 9:12-13 (NIV translation of the Bible) says:

"This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord’s people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God. Because of the service by which you have proved yourselves, others will praise God for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else."

These verses illustrate the act of meeting the needs of the community, while also acting with the Kingdom of Heaven in mind by encouraging spiritual growth in those individuals. Because Christians believe that all people are created in God's image, they believe that this means that they are a mortal representative of God to everyone they come in contact with. This adds meaning to everything that they do and say in the service of others. If they do not do their best to minister to both the physical and spiritual needs of others, they are not being good representatives of God's love.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===== Examples of Christian community service =====

Many well-known [[non-governmental]] (NGO) community service organizations were founded by Christians seeking to put their beliefs into practice.  Three prominent examples are [[Samaritan's Purse]], [[Salvation Army]], and [[Habitat for Humanity]].

[[Samaritan's Purse]] was inspired by a prayer of evangelist [[Robert Pierce]], "Let my heart be broken for the things which break the heart of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaritanspurse.org/our-ministry/history/|title=History|work=Samaritan's Purse|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After traveling through Asia and seeing first-hand the suffering of impoverished children, lepers, and orphans—in 1970, Pierce founded Samaritan's Purse. Today, Samaritan's Purse reaches millions of people across the globe by providing aid such as disaster relief, medical assistance, and child care. A notable Samaritan's Purse project is [[Operation Christmas Child]] headed by [[Franklin Graham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samaritanspurse.org/what-we-do/operation-christmas-child/|title=Operation Christmas Child|work=Samaritan's Purse|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salvation Army]] was founded by [[William Booth]] and his wife [[Catherine Booth]] in 1865.  Booth was a [[Methodist]] minister and preacher on the streets of London. His tent meetings gathered crowds of drunkards, prostitutes and thieves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/usn/history-of-the-salvation-army|title=The Salvation Army – History of the Salvation Army|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; who eventually became the first "soldiers" in the army, which has grown to 1,442,388 members in 126 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Salvation Army#cite note-stats-1]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Salvation Army's motto is "Doing the Most Good" and does so by providing aid such as shelter, food, clothing, spiritual training and disaster relief.

[[Habitat for Humanity]] provides housing for people in need. Founded by [[Millard Fuller]], its vision is to "...put God’s love into action by bringing people together to build homes, communities and hope."&lt;ref name="habitat.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.habitat.org/how/about_us.aspx|title=About Habitat for Humanity|work=Habitat for Humanity Int'l|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Habitat for Humanity has built or repaired over 800,000 homes and served more than 4 million people worldwide since its creation in 1976.&lt;ref name="habitat.org" /&gt; They describe their vision as "...a world where everyone has a decent place to live."&lt;ref name="habitat.org" /&gt;

== Personal benefits of serving ==

Community service also allows those participating to reflect on the difference they are making in society. Some participants of a community service project may find themselves gaining a greater understanding of their roles in the community, as well as the impact of their contributions towards those in need of service. Because community service outlets vary, those who serve are exposed to many different kinds of people, environments, and situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tilt.colostate.edu/sl/students/benefits.cfm|title=Students|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With each new community service project, some participants may gain insightful experience in a variety of areas. Participants may also internalize the information that they found personally insightful for future use. While simply performing community service is valuable to the recipients, those serving often find it beneficial to pause and reflect on how they are changing society for the better. Schools often take students on community service projects so they can learn how their individual actions affect the well-being of the public. Participants may find that serving the public fosters a more solidified view of self and purpose.&lt;ref name="Evidence of Service-Learning Benefits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/service/benefits.html|title=Evidence of Service-Learning Benefits|work=Service Learning|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those involved in community service learning may also find that after serving the community for an extended period of time, they have an advantage in real-world experience. Eventually, the skills and knowledge obtained while working with the community may be applied in future areas of work.&lt;ref name="Evidence of Service-Learning Benefits" /&gt; Community service may also increase a participant's social connectivity. Because most community service opportunities allow others to interact and work with other individuals, this service may help volunteers network and connect with others towards a common goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/356.black/benefits_of_participation_in_service|title=Welcome to the SiteMaker Transition Project|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People gain the most from their community service projects when they volunteer their time to help people that they have never interacted with before. This direct contact allows people to see life from a different perspective and reevaluate their opinions of others. Many young people who get involved in community service come out with a more well-rounded worldview.

Another benefit in participating in community service is a greater understanding and appreciation for diversity. Appreciating other cultures and breaking down stereotypes is important to becoming a responsible citizen and better person. By participating in a community service project where interaction is required, personal relationships can begin to grow. These personal relationships help people have informal and consistent interactions that through time,often breakdown negative stereotypes. These relationships can also facilitate more opinions and viewpoints surrounding various topics that help participants to grow in diversity.&lt;ref&gt;"Where's The Learning in Service-Learning," Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles Jr., Jossey-Bass, 1999, Page 28&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes can be defined as, "believing unfairly that all people or things with a specific characteristic are the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stereotype|title=Stereotype – Definition of Stereotype by Merriam-Webster|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes often reveal themselves in quick judgments based solely off of visible characteristics. These judgments move into a biased opinion when you believe that these judgments are always true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aauw.org/2014/08/13/why-stereotypes-are-bad/|title=Why Stereotypes Are Bad and What You Can Do about Them|work=AAUW: Empowering Women Since 1881|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stereotypes can be harmful to both personal relationships and relationships within the work place. Community Service helps people to realize that everyone does not fall into these preconceived ideas. Along with breaking down stereotypes, community service work can assist people in realizing that those they are helping and working with are no different from themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Where's The Learning in Service-Learning," Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles Jr., Jossey-Bass, 1999, Page 31&lt;/ref&gt; This realization can lead to empathizing with others. Learning to understand the needs and motivations of others, especially those who live different lives from our own, is an important part of living a productive life. This leads to a view of humanity that can help a person stay free of biased opinions of others and can lead to a more diverse and ultimately more productive and thought provoking life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Katherine W.|title=How Diversity Works|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/|journal=Scientific American|language=en|volume=311|issue=4|pages=42–47|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1014-42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choosing the right strategy ==
As pointed out by [[de Tocqueville]], America, in sharp contrast with other developed countries, has had a formidable ability to form associations. Civilians have a unique desire and aptitude to organize themselves apart from government to address the needs in their communities. However, making sure an effort has a positive effect on society requires clear analysis and a strategy. Analysis identifies root causes of problems that project implementation must address. Individuals, like neighborhoods, enjoy permanent change only if it is an inner one—and the greatest form of community service is encouraging that inner change.

[[Abraham Kuyper]] advocated ''[[sphere sovereignty]],'' which honors the independence and autonomy of the “intermediate bodies” in society, such as schools, press, business, the arts, etc. He champions the right of every community to operate its own organizations and manage its own groups, with the foundational belief that parents know what their child really needs, and that local people are more capable of helping fellow locals. Those who agree with his views perceive community service as a "trampoline" that seeks to launch their targets to better employment and lifestyle, avoiding what they see as destructive decision making for mal-established goals by poorly developed community service efforts.

Amy L. Sherman, in her book ''Restorers of Hope'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Restorers-Hope-Community-Church-based-Ministries/dp/1592449913/|title=Restorers of Hope: Reaching the Poor in Your Community with Church-Based Ministries that Work|last=Sherman|first=Amy L.|date=2004-11-04|publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Pub|isbn=9781592449910|edition= Reissue |location=Eugene, OR|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that community service planning should be made with the valuable opinion of the local residents, since they have firsthand knowledge of the inside realities of their community's current state. Making them a part of the movement, change or project creates in the members of the community a sense of belonging and hope. Joint effort: relationships – these make the difference.

'''Dadoba Pandurang''' (9 May 1814 – 17 October 1882) (Pune, Maharashtra,British India) was a social reformer and linguist from Bombay. He was born with the surname '''Tarkhadkar''' but he never used it in later life. He wrote extensively on religion and social reform as an opponent of rituals and caste, while supporting widow-remarriage and education for women. He was a brother of [[Atmaram Pandurang]].

Pandurang studied at a local school for four years before going to private high school followed by studies at the Bombay Native School and Book Society. He was a recipient of a West Scholarship and studied at what became the Elphinstone and he learnt several languages including Portuguese, Persian and Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=rao /&gt;

In 1830 he became a school teacher and in 1840 he moved to Surat. The headmaster at this school in Surat was Henry Green, a noted agnostic and free thinker who influenced Pandurang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Caste, Conflict and Ideology: Mahatma Jotirao Phule and Low Caste Protest in Nineteenth-Century Western India| first=Rosalind |last=O'Hanlon| publisher=Cambridge University Press| year= 2002|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1846 he served as acting superintendent of vernacular schools and in 1852 he was selected for the post of Deputy Collector and Magistrate at Ahmednagar. He moved to Thana in 1858 and retired in 1861 due to troubles with superiors. Pandurang's major contribution was a grammar of Marathi. ''Maharastra Bhasheche Vyakaran'' published in 1836 that went into seven editions during his lifetime. He also published a supplement in 1881. Other publications included ''Yashoda Pandurangi'' (1865), ''Dharam Vivechan'' (1868), ''Paramhamsik Bramhadharma'' (1880), ''[[iarchive:ahindugentleman00pandgoog|A Hindu Gentleman's Reflections respecting the works of Swedenborg]]'' (1878), ''The absurdity of the Holi Festival as it is now practised by the Hindus'' (1829), ''Shishubodh'' (posthumously published in 1884) and ''Vidhavasrumarjan'' (1857). He wrote ''Dharam Vivechan'' under the pen-name of ''Ek Jagadwasi Arya''.&lt;ref name=rao&gt;{{cite journal|title=A maker of modern Maharashtra: Dadoba Pandurang (1814-1882)| first=Vasant D. |last=Rao| journal= Proceedings of the Indian History Congress| volume=28| year=1966| pages=442–448| jstor=44140475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pandurang taught Sanskrit briefly at the Sir Jamshedjee Jeejeebhoy Zarthosti Madresa in 1871. In 1848, he founded and presided over the ''Upayukta Jnanprasarak Sabha'', a students' literary and scientific society which met to discuss various topics every alternate Thursday.&lt;ref name=rao /&gt;

'''Devendrar Jayanthi''' is a festival celebrated annually on 11 September. It is organised by various political parties, community organisations and civil societies in Southern Tamil Nadu to commemorate the memory of [[Immanuvel Devendrar]], a freedom fighter and [[Indian National Congress]] leader who took part in the [[Quit India Movement|Quit India movement]] during the [[British Raj]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/remembering-immanuel-sekaran-brave-dalit-leader-who-lost-his-life-savarna-brutality-49168|title=Thiyagi Immanuel Sekaran}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the [[Indian Army]] in independent India and later he fought for the rights of depressed class people of Southern Tamil Nadu, particularly for upliftment of [[Pallar]] caste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Immanuel Sekaran an Icon of depressed class}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of chief minister [[K. Kamaraj]].

==Political background==
[[File:Devendrar_Jayanthi_in_Paramakudi.jpg|thumb|200px|Gathering at Immanuel sekaran memorial on Devendrar jayanthi]]

Immanuel Devendrar was a member of the Indian National Congress and a close associate of its leader, K. Kamaraj. At that time, Congress was supported by influential communities of southern Tamil Nadu, such as the Pallars and [[Nadar (caste)|Nadars]], and opposed by the [[Forward Block]], which was itself favoured by the [[Maravar]] community. The two sides clashed during elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/immanuel-sekaran-in-the-vanguard-of-dalit-struggle/article2443838.ece|title=Caste riots of South Tamilnadu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence erupted notably in the districts of [[Ramanathapuram district|Ramanathapuram]] and [[Madurai district|Madurai]] which claimed over 40 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1522/15220360.htm|title=Series of violence that shooked the south}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devendrar was killed at this time and the anniversary of his death is today celebrated by various political parties and community organisations and civil societies as Devendrar Jayanthi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/freedom-fighter-dalit-icon-remembering-tamil-nadu-s-immanuel-sekaran/story-EzBsVdnsQj9gQzuuNKdDiI.html|title=Devendrar jayanthi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Devendrar Jayanti is among the celebrations sometimes criticised as being designed mainly as expressions of caste pride and political power, which sometimes turn into inter-caste violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/Two-month-ban-issued-in-Ramanathapuram-district/articleshow/42094253.cms|title=Law and Order problem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2820/stories/20111007282012800.htm|title=Paramakudi police firing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniindia.com/dalit-leader-immanuel-death-anniversary-passes-off-peacefully/other/news/620462.html|title=Immanuel devendrar remebrance day passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics claim that political parties used them as a form of [[vote bank]] politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://swarajyamag.com/politics/tamil-nadu-caste-realities-unlikely-to-change-any-time-soon|title=Caste reality of Tamilnadu politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These critics are rebutted by people who say that every caste has its own leader and the people are celebrating the memories of their leaders. Despite of these arguments every year the government is struggling to maintain the law and order during these celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikatan.com/news/tamilnadu/10365.art|title=Immanueal Sekaran jayanthi celebrations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.dailyhunt.in/news/india/english/hindustan+times-epaper-httimes/freedom+fighter+dalit+icon+remembering+tamil+nadu+s+immanuel+sekaran-newsid-57791528|title=Sekaran jayanthi passes of peacefully}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Durga Mohan was born in a well-known [[Baidya]]-Brahmin family at Telirbagh, [[Bikrampur]], [[Dhaka]] in [[Bengal]], now part of [[Munshiganj District]] of [[Bangladesh]]. Bikrampur has a long historical and cultural trail since many centuries. In 12th Century it was the capital of Ballal Sena and Lakshmana Sena, Kings of Sena dynasty and since then considered as an important seat of learning and culture of Eastern India&lt;ref name="Dasgupta"&gt;{{cite book|first=Hemendranath|last=Dasgupta|year=1994|chapter=Deshbandhu Chittaranjan Das|title=Chittaranjan Das|editor-first=Verinder|editor-last=Grover|publisher=Deep &amp; Deep Publications|isbn=81-7100-568-3|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Durga Mohan's father Kashiswar was a government pleader in the court of Barishal, presently in Bangladesh. Kashiswar had three sons, Kali Mohan, Durga Mohan and Bhuban Mohan, and all of then became practicing lawyer at Calcutta High Court.

Durga Mohan lost his mother early in life.  After studying for sometime in the village school, he joined an English school at [[Barisal]], where his father used to practice law.  Subsequently, he won a junior scholarship and joined [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Hindu College, Calcutta]], then under the [[University of Calcutta]]. He used to stay in the house of his uncle Bireswar Dash at Kalighat.  After studying for a year at Kolkata, he went to Dhaka and returned to Presidency College with a senior scholarship. &lt;ref name="shastri"&gt;{{cite book|first=Shibnath|last=Shashtri|title=Ramtanu Lahiri O Tatkalin Banga Samaj|publisher=S. K . Lahiri &amp; Co, Calcutta|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a student of Presidency College he was greatly influenced by Edward Cowley, professor of history and an erudite Sanskrit scholar.  Many of the students used to go to the residence of Cowley, who was deeply attached to Christianity.  They used to discuss about religious matters. Some of students were influenced by Cowley’s deep faith.  One of Durga Mohan Das’s friends, Bhagaban Chandra Chatterjee became a Christian.  Durga Mohan Dash was also swayed for a period. He brought his child-wife, Brahmamoyee to the house of a Christian priest, in order that she could also understand the Christian faith before he finally decided to convert.  That led to his being turned out from the house of Bireswar Das.

At that time he had passed the licentiate examination in law and had started practising at Kolkata but that was not enough to keep him going in the city and so he  shifted to Barisal.

==Barisal Brahmo Samaj==

His elder brother Kali Mohan Dash, who later became a famous lawyer of Kolkata High Court, then used to practice in [[Barisal]]. He provided him shelter and gave him some books of [[Theodore Parker]]. His elder brother asked him to read the books before deciding about his religion. On reading the books he changed his opinion and instead of converting to Christianity, joined the Brahmo Samaj.

He got together his friends and established a Brahmo Samaj at Barisal. In order to enlighten devotees, he invited Brahmo preachers from Kolkata to visit Barisal and deliver lectures. Education of women was top priority. He organised many functions and festivals. Soon, Barisal became a great centre of Brahmo activity.

In the course of time, the great controversy about remarriage of widows engulfed entire society and Durga Mohan Das plunged forward into that movement.  He and his friends publicly promised to organise remarriage of widows.  He offered financial support to such couples because they had to undergo severe social boycott.  He even went to the extent of getting his young widowed step mother married to a friend of his.  That brought in opposition from entire society.  His earnings dwindled because people boycotted him but he remained steadfast in his mission.  There were few people, other than [[Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar]] who have contributed so much to the cause of remarriage of widows.  Mention may be made of another person in East Bengal who had also contributed substantially to this cause - [[Braja Sundar Mitra]].

It was during this period that the sons of Raj Chandra Roy, zemindar of nearby Lakhutia, joined the Brahmo Samaj and strengthened the movement. One day they took their wives with them to the residence of the English commissioner.  That created such a sensation that it reverberated beyond Barisal, across Bengal and became a talking point in Kolkata society, because that was an age when women of respectable families never came out in public from the inner precincts of their houses.  Later, the noted Brahmo reformer [[Nibaran Chandra Mukherjee]] married into this family.  That happened to be a great social event in those days.

== The reformist at Kolkata ==

Around 1870, Durga Mohan Dash shifted to Kolkata High Court. [[Dwarakanath Ganguly]], the great champion of women’s emancipation, had already shifted from [[Dhaka]] to Kolkata with his newspaper ''Abalabandhab''. There were other young men such as Rajaninath Roy, who were clamouring for reforms within the Brahmo Samaj. Till then women used to sit in the Brahmo Samaj behind a screen. The reformists started bringing their wives into the open. That immediately caused some confusion but ultimately they won the day. Brahmo Samaj allowed women to sit in the open.

When Miss [[Annette Akroyd]] opened a boarding school for girls in Kolkata, Durga Mohan Dash assisted her financially and admitted his daughters in the school. The school was later merged with [[Bethune School]] and his daughters were amongst the earlier batches to pass out of that school.

It was during that period that his wife died.

Being an outright reformist he sided with such people as [[Sivanath Sastri]], [[Ananda Mohan Bose]], [[Sib Chandra Deb]], and [[Umesh Chandra Dutta]] for the establishment of Sadharan Brahmo Samaj in 1878. He extended substantial financial support for the new organisation and served as its president.

He went to England in 1888 and returned with illness. All his three sons had qualified as barristers and his daughters were married. He led a rather lonely life. He married a widowed daughter of Kali Narayan Gupta of Dhaka. However, old age had caught on and he died on 19 December 1897.

[[Chittaranjan Das]] was son of his brother Bhuban Mohan Dash. Amongst his children the more renowned were [[Satish Ranjan Das]], [[Sarala Roy]] and [[Abala Bose]]. [[Subroto Mukerjee|Air Marshal Subroto Mukerjee]] was his great grandson on his daughter's side.

After Durga Mohan Das's first wife Bhramamoyee Devi's death, he married a highly respectable widow lady Hemantasashi Sen, daughter of a renowned Brahmo social reformer Kali Narayan Gupta of Dhaka. Hemantasashi Sen's only son by her first husband was noted music composer and songwriter [[Atul Prasad Sen]].

==Introduction==
''EGM note 6''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that violence against women and girls is defined as ‘any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women [or girls], including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.’{{ref|a}} It exists in multiple, interrelated and sometimes recurring forms, and is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women.{{ref|b}}

''EGM note 7''&lt;br /&gt; Experts stressed that we are at a critical moment where international bodies, nation states and civil society can and must come together to solidify commitments to ending violence against women and girls, as fragile and – in many places – deteriorating economic conditions, persistent environmental degradation, internal conflicts and wars, all contribute to the exacerbation of violence against women and girls, and violations of their rights.

''EGM note 8''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that the impacts of the global financial crisis, the economic pressures on Governments to reduce funding to social services and programmes, and the ongoing resource constraints faced by conflict-affected and developing countries, all risk limiting or reducing the investment States will make in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 9''&lt;br /&gt; However, they highlighted the enormous costs violence against women and girls entails to States and societies as a whole, in terms of reduced human capital, decreased productivity, exacerbated social inequalities, lowered overall educational outcomes, and broad strains on public services. Violence diminishes women’s and girls’ ability to gain an education, earn a living and participate in public life, and live a life free of fear. It has significant health impacts, including psychological consequences, physical injuries, sexual/reproductive health issues and death.{{ref|c}} In war-affected settings, violence against women and girls inhibits efforts towards peace-building and sustainable recovery, contributing to the risk of resurgent conflict. In development settings, it hinders progress towards achievement of several of the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)]], including those relating to [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education|education]], [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases|HIV/AIDS]], [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 5: Improve maternal health|maternal health]] and [[Millennium Development Goals#Goal 4: Reduce child mortality rates|child mortality]].{{ref|d}} It has intergenerational impacts, given that women use disproportionately more of their income toward supporting their families, and because violence diminishes their ability to fully participate in their societies (for example in politics, work or education) they are less able to invest in their children’s futures. One study in Chile found that women’s lost earnings alone as a result of domestic violence cost US$1.56 billion or more than 2 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product.{{ref|e}}

''EGM note 10''&lt;br /&gt; Violence against women and girls therefore entails massive costs to the State, and has a dragging effect on all other social and economic development efforts, particularly in humanitarian and development contexts. It is only by lowering the incidence of violence against women and girls, preventing recurrence, and responding effectively to existing violence to minimise ongoing impacts, that the overall costs of such violence to any economy will be reduced.{{ref|f}} Experts noted that, in the face of such evidence, prevention is not only possible, but central to the social and economic advancement of developed and developing countries alike. It was reiterated that all States have not only a responsibility to significantly strengthen their planning and budgeting efforts for prevention of violence against women and girls, but that doing so will contribute to positive social and economic outcomes.

''EGM note 11''&lt;br /&gt; Experts brought together experiences from across developing and developed countries, and from humanitarian contexts (arising from conflict and natural disasters), demonstrating that violence against women and girls could be prevented regardless of political, social and economic conditions. Levels of violence against women and girls vary across countries that with similar economic status or political systems – a variation that can be attributed to different laws, policies, practices, norms, behaviours and attitudes that contribute to, justify or excuse violence against women and girls. Such factors must be targeted to prevent and reduce violence within and across all settings.

''EGM note 12''&lt;br /&gt; Across developing and developed countries alike, more comprehensive, multi-sectoral and sustained approaches were recognised as necessary to achieve such change, with investments commensurate to the enormous scale of the abuse and its impacts. While the allocation of more resources to prevention remained high on the priority list for experts, political will was also identified as a key factor. It was noted that organisations and communities in some developing countries have led the way in testing and expanding new models for prevention, however experts did not believe any State was currently meeting its full normative obligations in this area.

''EGM note 13''&lt;br /&gt; Experts reiterated that violence against women and girls is a pervasive and systematic human rights violation, caused by – and reinforcing – gender inequality and entrenched discrimination. While most violence against women and girls is committed by non-State actors or individuals (usually men known to the victims/survivors, often husbands/intimate partners or other family members), experts were adamant that laws, policies and practices emanating from the State – as well as from traditional or customary practices – could also result in direct violence against women and girls, fail to respond to it, or create an environment where such violence was tolerated, excused or justified.

''EGM note 14''&lt;br /&gt; To this end, experts noted that the prevention of violence against women and girls could not be achieved without the full implementation of the existing legal obligation on States – under the ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women|Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)]]'' to ‘take all appropriate measures to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women,’{{ref|g}} along with the more detailed obligations relating to the elimination of violence against women and girls outlined in the ''[[Fourth World Conference on Women#Beijing Platform for Action|Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (BPfA)]]''.{{ref|h}}&lt;ref name="Source2"&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/ Beijing Platform for Action (BPfA), [[UN Women]]. Retrieved 28 February 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; Experts emphasised, as central to the latter, the obligation on States to ‘refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations’{{ref|i}} to eliminate violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 15''&lt;br /&gt; A key message from experts was that the call for greater efforts to prevent violence against women and girls is not a ‘new demand,’ but well supported by international legal and normative frameworks. What is new is the emergence, in recent years, of an unprecedented evidence and practice base that provides concrete guidance on the application of proven and effective strategies, and makes prevention of violence against women and girls a tangible and measurable goal. We now know that to effectively prevent violence against women and girls, efforts must go beyond simple awareness-raising projects and instead work to actively (and measurably) transform discriminatory and violence-supportive attitudes and behaviours, community norms, institutional practices and systems, laws and policies, and society as a whole.

''EGM note 16''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that this holistic and comprehensive approach to prevention has the potential to create numerous benefits for communities beyond reductions in violence, because it also addresses the discrimination, inequality and other violence-supportive practices and behaviours that contribute to a range of social ills. Prevention of violence against women and girls is ultimately about building relationships, communities and organisations that are equal, non-violent and respectful of all individuals. It results in the creation of more peaceful, egalitarian and productive societies where women and girls live free from the discrimination, harassment, violence and fear of violence that can block them from reaching their full human potential.

===Defining prevention===
''EGM note 17''&lt;br /&gt; The focus of the meeting (and this report) was on prevention of violence against women and girls ''before it occurs'', that is, by identifying and addressing its underlying causes and promoting shifts in the social environment that ultimately reduce the number of new incidents of violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 18''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that prevention of violence against women and girls remains a poorly understood concept across sectors and stakeholders. Prevention is often conflated with early intervention or the response to existing violence, or else limited to awareness raising or social marketing campaigns. Simplistic analyses and programmes aimed at single-cause factors such as alcohol abuse, or placing the responsibility to prevent violence on women and girls themselves (such as self-defence programmes) can in some cases do more harm than good, and are not uncommon. Cynical perceptions that violence against women and girls is somehow an inevitable part of society, and that efforts to prevent it are well-intentioned but ultimately ineffective, are also widespread. There is therefore a need to build not only evidence, but shared understandings of the complexity and causes of violence against women and girls, and of how it can be effectively prevented.

''EGM note 19''&lt;br /&gt; Experts recognised that this transformative agenda engages all levels of the socio-political system, from policy and legislative development, to the development and delivery of programmes and services ‘on the ground’, and the capacity building of the institutions responsible for implementation. Confronting existing social and gendered realities that continue to use arguments based on culture, customs and ‘traditional’ values and practices to justify discrimination and violence against women and girls, and treat them as subordinate and second-class citizens, remains a major challenge in addressing the social and cultural environments that permit violence against women and girls to flourish with impunity. As the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences has noted: ‘no form of interpersonal violence against women is devoid of structural violence – as in all places, such abuse is underpinned by beliefs about the perpetrator’s right to harm another, based on societal notions of gender and rights.’{{ref|j}}

''EGM note 20''&lt;br /&gt; Experts were particularly keen to convey that, in prevention terms, violence against women and girls in the private sphere and/or perpetrated by non-State actors could ''not'' be considered as something ‘separate’ from the actions of the State. Experts stressed that violence against women and girls – in every context – can be perpetuated by State decision-making mechanisms, laws, policies and practices when these systematically marginalize women and girls and/or fail to promote their rights. These include not only legal policies and programs that fail to criminalize violence against women and girls or adequately punish it, but also State-sanctioned discrimination, for example: excluding women from political participation (such as assemblies, high-level government positions, and key decision-making bodies like constitutional committees); constitutional language that threatens women’s rights (whether existing or developing in emerging State structures); or discriminatory laws, policies and budgets which disproportionately limit women’s and girls’ rights, neglect their voices and concerns, and fail to promote full substantive, as well as formal, equality between men and women.

''EGM note 21''&lt;br /&gt; State-sanctioned violence and discrimination against women is significantly tied to cultural and social norms that pervade a nation, which are then used to justify, excuse or tolerate violence against women and girls. When laws and policies limit women’s freedoms or deem women as ‘complementary’ instead of ‘equal to’ men, this trickles down to public perception of women and girls and their role in society, and undermines their safety and security within the State. These social and cultural norms are similarly impacted by the respect, or otherwise, of women’s civil and political rights (such as their political participation), and their economic, social and cultural rights (such as their access to work and education). Greater levels of social and economic equality between men and women, for instance, are closely correlated with lower levels of violence against women and girls at the population level. Similarly, greater visibility of women in leadership roles, including in constitution committees, assemblies and high-level posts in government, in peacekeeping troops and in peace-building talks, promotes positive and egalitarian norms and combats gender stereotypes in a way that counters discriminatory and violence-supportive attitudes and the marginalization of women and girls.

''EGM note 22''&lt;br /&gt; Prevention of violence against women and girls is often conceptualised in terms of awareness raising or community mobilisation, and these are important components. Experts reiterated the importance of grassroots community mobilisation in driving attitudinal and behavioural transformation at the local level. However, in light of the above, experts stressed the more expansive and multi-level nature of effective prevention, in particular the critical role of government to create an ‘enabling environment’ through undertaking policy, legislative and budgetary reform to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment, and actively address the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and disadvantage that place women and girls at risk of violence. They emphasised the additional role of States in providing support to women’s and other civil society actors, including women, men and youth community and religious leaders and opinion-makers, in their prevention efforts.

''EGM note 23''&lt;br /&gt; Experts further stressed the importance of continued investment in an effective ''response'' to existing violence against women and girls – including through improving legislative, police, justice and service systems{{ref|k}} – as a fundamental ‘building block’ for prevention, establishing accountability and redress, and protecting women and girls from further violence. Effective response systems are also necessary to ensure support of women and girls who may identify violence in their own lives as a direct result of prevention activity and seek help and redress. Experts acknowledged that a separate stream of work on building an effective multi-sectoral response was being undertaken in preparation for CSW.

''EGM note 24''&lt;br /&gt; Experts recommended that prevention and response strategies be developed and implemented as a holistic and integrated system that upholds the human rights of girls and women to live in societies, communities and families that are free of such violence. However, while essential, experts noted the evidence that an effective response has, in itself, only a limited impact on reducing the number of new incidents of violence. Specific actions to address the foundations of violence – discriminatory and violence-supportive practices, laws, norms, behaviours and attitudes – are also necessary in order to prevent violence against women and girls from happening in the first place, within and across all settings. These are the focus of discussions and recommendations in this Report.

===Describing the context===
''EGM note 25''&lt;br /&gt; The emphasis on economic growth in the development agenda globally has led to growing inequalities and a reduced focus on redistribution. The rolling economic crises currently gripping almost all of the world’s countries has resulted in increased unemployment and poverty, a shortage of housing, and cutbacks in social spending including subsidies for health and education. These multiple crises have in turn fuelled communal and ethnic tensions, mass migration and displacement, rendering millions homeless and poor, and more vulnerable to trafficking and diverse forms of exploitation. In most communities, this also results in the heightened vulnerability of women and girls to violence and exploitation.

''EGM note 26''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted the evidence that violence against women and girls is intensified and exacerbated in situations of socio-economic stress, conflict and other crisis situations. In addition to the impact of economic crises described above, global warming and associated rising sea levels and severe weather events, as well as environmental degradation and resource depletion, can all contribute to conditions of social and economic vulnerability, including homelessness and mass migrations. They can also lead to the disaster or crisis situations in which violence against women and girls is known to increase.

''EGM note 27''&lt;br /&gt; As discrimination based on sex and gender continues to dominate social formations even in the 21st century, experts noted that violence against women and girls continues to be perceived as ‘normal’ in many contexts. The pervasive nature of militarization and the growth of all forms of religious fundamentalisms and other forms of extreme nationalism creates cultures where women are reduced to being symbolic ‘bearers’ of their culture and have their mobility and autonomy restricted in many different ways.

''EGM note 28''&lt;br /&gt; Exacerbated by the conditions described above (and even without them) women and girls experience daily harassment, abuse, discrimination and violence across the numerous settings in which they conduct their lives, from workplaces, schools and other educational institutions, community and faith organisations and groups, market places, shops, on public transport, in social settings, online and via social media, during flight and while displaced as a result of conflict and natural disasters, and above all in their homes.

''EGM note 29''&lt;br /&gt; Experts also identified emerging contexts and issues that have an impact on violence against women and girls. For example, experts agreed that the role of new media presents a number of layered and complex challenges, as well as opportunities, for the prevention of violence against women and girls. In the first instance, new media is often a platform for the perpetuation of harmful masculinities and the objectification of women and girls. This can take a number of forms from everyday hyper-sexualised, one-dimensional images of women and girls to hard-core pornography which has moved from the peripheries to the mainstream of the pornography industry. Virtual spaces are also utilised to perpetuate direct attacks on women and girls. This can range from cyber-stalking to the posting of inappropriate images / videos of women. For example, women have increasingly reported incidents of footage of them engaged in sexual activity (filmed both with and without consent) being posted on internet sites without their consent. In a number of cases this has included the posting of footage of actual rapes.{{ref|l}}

''EGM note 30''&lt;br /&gt; Violence in the virtual space and the wider issues of how women and girls are objectified in the media has particular implications for girls and younger women, who are much more like to engage with social networking sites, instant messaging, etc. Despite the range of violations, incidents can be hard to prosecute, especially as the internet is not limited to nation spaces. There are also real challenges around balancing the right to freedom of expression with the right to be protected from discrimination.{{ref|m}}

Their One Man Can campaign tackles [[HIV]] and [[gender-based violence]].]]
''EGM note 31''&lt;br /&gt; Experts also noted with concern the emerging evidence that adolescent girls and young women may also be targeted for sexual violence in the context of serious youth violence (e.g. youth gangs) and/or broader urban violence. They may also be members of gangs themselves and involved in perpetration of violence against other young women and girls within or between gangs. Experts further expressed the concern that adolescent girls and young women were frequently overlooked in policy and programming responses designed for young men, adult women or for children in general, yet the context of their lives may be quite distinct and require specific approaches, particularly given they are the age group at greatest risk of sexual violence.{{ref|n}}

''EGM note 32''&lt;br /&gt; In humanitarian crises caused by conflict and/or natural disasters, women and girls are at risk of violence throughout all stages: during crises, during flight from crises, while living in displaced settings, and during and following return. In situations of armed conflict, women and girls can be exposed to violence at the hands of armed actors, including soldiers and military assigned to protect civilians and assist in their safe flight from conflict. They may be recruited into armed groups and serve as sexual slaves to combatants. In some settings women and girls continue to be used as ‘weapons of war,’ subject to sexual assault by all parties to conflict, at times in front of their husbands, children, and other family or community members.

''EGM note 33''&lt;br /&gt; While much attention has been accorded to sexual violence against women and girls during conflict, they suffer many additional forms of violence in humanitarian emergencies, including sexual exploitation, trafficking, early marriage, and [[intimate partner violence]].{{ref|o}} Experts noted that all of these forms of violence can be averted or reduced with effective prevention programming from the contingency planning phase through to recovery, and States’ responsibilities to work towards the prevention of this violence are reinforced by a broad normative framework mandating protection of women and girls from sexual and other forms of violence in emergencies. And yet, prevention programming remains weak in virtually every humanitarian setting around the world.

''EGM note 34''&lt;br /&gt; Experts further noted the evidence that while more than 740,000 men, women, and children die each year as a result of armed violence, the majority of these deaths – 490,000 – occur in countries that are not affected by conflict.{{ref|p}} The proliferation of small arms increases the vulnerability of women and girls to violence, and exacerbates the seriousness of that violence. This is particularly true in the context of urban/serious youth (e.g. gang) violence (referred to above), but also in the case of violence in the home, where the presence of small arms significantly increases the risk of the victim being killed.{{ref|q}} The violent deaths of approximately 66,000 women and girls are attributed to armed violence globally each year.{{ref|r}}

''EGM note 35''&lt;br /&gt; Experts were finally keen to emphasise that – even within the same geographic or socio-political setting, ‘context’ was not the same thing for different women and girls. Women and girls often experience multiple and intersecting forms of social disadvantage and discrimination (in addition to that based on gender), and this compounds their individual and collective vulnerability to violence. The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, has recently noted that theories on violence have often ‘failed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how various forms of discrimination, beyond a male/female gender binary, contextualize, exacerbate, and correlate to high levels of violence in given societies. The lack of an intersectional approach can lead to the reinforcing of one form of discrimination in attempts to alleviate another.’{{ref|s}} Factors such as race, ethnicity, caste, class, age, religion, sexual orientation, marital status, geographic location, disability, HIV status or status as a refugee or internally displaced person, will all influence the forms and nature of violence women and girls may suffer, and the relationship of these factors to prevention is discussed in the ‘Key Findings’ section.

==Global policy and legislative / normative framework (abridged)==
''EGM note 36''&lt;br /&gt; The international community is committed to eliminating violence against women and girls{{ref|t}} and has recognised – in various global and regional legal and policy instruments – the important role of prevention towards this end.

''EGM note 37''&lt;br /&gt; Above all, State responsibility for prevention of violence against women and girls through social and behavioural change is supported by the foundational treaty on women’s human rights, the ''Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women'' (CEDAW), which establishes signatories’ legal obligation to take ‘all appropriate measures [to] modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women.’{{ref|u}}  General Recommendation 19 of the CEDAW Committee defines violence as a form of discrimination against women, and establishes the obligation of States to act with ‘due diligence’ to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls.

''EGM note 38''&lt;br /&gt; The ''Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women'' enhanced the definition of violence against women and also included protection of women from violence committed in the private domain as being an obligation of the state.{{ref|v}} Responsibilities of the State to prevent violence, abuse and neglect of girls are further supported by the ''Convention on the Rights of the Child'', requiring States parties to ‘take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse’ including ‘forms of prevention,’{{ref|w}} along with its two Optional Protocols.{{ref|x}}

''EGM note 39''&lt;br /&gt; The ''Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action'' (BPfA), adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995, recognised the complexity of the underlying causes of violence against women and girls, and the need to link prevention and response activities. Paragraph 118 notes that:&lt;br /&gt;
:''violence against women throughout the life cycle derives essentially from cultural patterns, in particular the harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices and all acts of extremism linked to race, sex, language or religion that perpetuate the lower status accorded to women in the family, the workplace, the community and society. Violence against women is exacerbated by social pressures, notably the shame of denouncing certain acts that have been perpetrated against women; women's lack of access to legal information, aid or protection; the lack of laws that effectively prohibit violence against women; failure to reform existing laws; inadequate efforts on the part of public authorities to promote awareness of and enforce existing laws; and the absence of educational and other means to address the causes and consequences of violence. Images in the media of violence against women, in particular those that depict rape or sexual slavery as well as the use of women and girls as sex objects, including pornography, are factors contributing to the continued prevalence of such violence, adversely influencing the community at large, in particular children and young people.''{{ref|y}}

''EGM notes 40 to 51''&lt;br /&gt; Other global policy and legislative / normative frameworks that are currently in place.

''EGM note 52''&lt;br /&gt; In conclusion, while the normative framework has clearly developed an obligation for States to take holistic, comprehensive, strategic and well-resourced action to prevent violence against women and girls, and while States have increasingly ratified the relevant treaties and in some cases brought these obligations into their legal frameworks, much work remains to be done before the normative obligations will be fully implemented. Gaps remain in terms of resource allocation, legislative and policy development, and systems and mechanisms for coordinated and sustained action.

''EGM note 53''&lt;br /&gt; In considering the above analysis, experts believed that a significant global shift in perceptions was necessary towards greater recognition of the widespread and systematic nature of violence against women and girls, deserving of more serious attention by States and the international community. Experts returned to and supported the international definition of violence against women and girls in the ''Declaration'', i.e. as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against them, that shall mean all acts of gender-based violence that result in, or are likely to result in, physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women and girls, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life.{{ref|z}}

''EGM note 54''&lt;br /&gt; However, some experts noted that such violence is not isolated or sporadic, but could be seen as part of a widespread or systematic practice intended to humiliate or degrade an identifiable group. As such, they called for violence against women and girls to be considered a crime against humanity. Others cautioned against linking violence against women and girls to current definitions of crimes against humanity, given the existing limitations of international law and jurisprudence. It was noted that the landmark February 2008 judgement of the Sierra Leone Appeals Chamber of the Special Court in the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council case had set an historic precedent in recognising forced marriage as a distinct category of crimes against humanity in international criminal law.{{ref|A}} Experts therefore agreed that calling for violence against women and girls to be recognised as a crime against humanity was intended as an aspirational statement and advocacy goal, one which would expand current definitions and understanding of crimes against humanity – in a way similar to the Sierra Leone case – and help drive a global shift in perceptions towards one that recognises the full seriousness of violence against women and girls, and the urgency with which we must prevent it.

==Key findings (abridged)==
''EGM note 55''&lt;br /&gt; Based on comprehensive discussion at the EGM, review of the papers presented by experts, and an analysis of the global context, normative framework and evidence and practice base, experts agreed on the following key findings. Experts noted the significant development, over recent years, of guidance to States and other stakeholders in the development, implementation and monitoring of policy and programming to prevent violence against women and girls,{{ref|B}} and again
referred to the papers submitted to the EGM as providing further information on current practice. Rather than reiterate that guidance here, experts have confined their findings below to the emerging issues, and those perceived to be of most critical relevance to CSW.

''EGM note 56''&lt;br /&gt; Experts wished to reiterate, as a finding and central tenet of their recommendations, that prevention of violence against women and girls is a positive endeavour, a precondition for enabling women and men to reach their full potential, and is essential to the creation of healthy, equitable, stable and productive communities, workplaces, schools and universities, faith and cultural institutions, sporting and recreation organisations, and societies as a whole.

''EGM note 57''&lt;br /&gt; Noting recent research highlighting the unique and catalysing impact of women’s organisations on enduring and effective policy development to end violence against women and girls,{{ref|C}} experts were unanimous that effective prevention of violence against women and girls was not only often driven by, but ''required'' the involvement of women’s organisations, working in partnership with national, provincial and local Governments, communities, civil society groups, donors, the private sector and other non-state actors.

''EGM note 58''&lt;br /&gt; Experts emphasized the importance of moving away from short-term, ad hoc sensitisation and awareness raising activities and towards more comprehensive, longer-term prevention efforts that are grounded in communities and work systematically to change unequal power relations between women and men. Such social norm change requires working with a cross section of the community from women and men, young people, religious and cultural leaders, health care providers, police, government officials, the media and others, over time and in varied ways, to challenge norms that perpetuate violence and emphasize the positive benefits of non-violence, justice and equality for individuals, families and the broader community. Civil society plays an essential role in mobilising communities to rethink the acceptability of violence and supporting positive change.

''EGM note 59''&lt;br /&gt; However, while women’s and other civil society organisations and communities themselves have been at the forefront of developing the practice and evidence base for prevention programming, factors such as time, reach and workforce constraints can prevent many good initiatives from being evaluated, expanded or otherwise scaled-up. Research has also shown that those working to end violence against women and girls can themselves face discrimination, hostility, repudiation and even violence, precisely because they challenge traditional notions of the family and gender that contribute to such violence.{{ref|D}}

''EGM note 60''&lt;br /&gt;
To maximise the impact and sustainability of such work, therefore, Governments have a key role to play in supporting and creating an enabling environment for women’s organisations and others working to prevent violence against women and girls to continue to drive and innovate prevention programming, safe from violence and discrimination themselves. Governments should also activate their reach and mandate to ensure the scale-up, systematisation and embedding of good practice in laws, policies and through public institutions (e.g. schools, social and health services, media and workplace regulation) for long-term sustainability.

''EGM note 61''&lt;br /&gt; Experts noted that without States taking their full responsibility for sustained, systematic and coordinated policy, programming and investment for prevention, the transformative social development necessary to end violence against women and girls cannot be achieved. Few States worldwide had implemented their obligations to this end. A 2011 review of National Action Plans on Violence against Women found that most policies were limited to responding to existing violence. Those that did contain specific prevention actions largely focussed on raising awareness of new laws or where to access services, with some containing one-off or single-sector prevention activities such as social marketing campaigns or schools-based programmes. Only one identified plan took a long-term, multi-sectoral and holistic approach to prevention, with appropriate institutional support mechanisms and commensurate investment.{{ref|E}}

''EGM note 62''&lt;br /&gt; Importantly, one-off, single-sector or small-scale interventions, while they may have some effectiveness for participating individuals, are unable to change the social norms at the community or society level that have a dampening effect on such attitudinal change. Therefore, they can never in themselves decrease prevalence of violence against women and girls across society as a whole. Broad and sustainable change is only achieved when such activities are implemented in a long-term and cumulative way, mutually reinforced across various settings. These should be linked to a prevention framework which is coordinated to ensure that all levels are appropriately engaged, with evaluation and monitoring for continuous improvement. It is particularly essential that all strategies and interventions are supported by policy and legislative reform that promotes gender equality, challenges discrimination, and provides an effective response to existing violence.

''EGM notes 63 to 102''&lt;br /&gt; Other key findings from the EGM.

==Report recommendations==
''Recommendation 103''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts stressed the critical importance of women’s organisations, civil society, international institutions, donors and States working together to go beyond ‘ad hoc’ approaches to prevention, and for States to take their responsibility for developing long-term and multi-sectoral strategies so that activity can be coordinated, and evidence built, to achieve real results. With an increased commitment from all actors to such an approach, and corresponding investment, many experts believed violence against women and girls could be ended within a generation. To this end, experts have made recommendations (see below) for a coordinated and target-focussed approach to preventing violence against women and girls, driven by two overarching activities – a [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan]] – framing the work of international, regional and national institutions (including States) toward the goal of ending violence against women and girls, along with a  [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls|Global Advocacy Campaign]] – driven by women’s and other civil society organisations to create momentum and provide accountability for the above.

''Recommendation 104''&lt;br /&gt; Also, given CSW’s specific mandate with regards to implementation of the ''Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action''{{ref|F}} experts have made further recommendations for immediate implementation, aligned with the BPfA’s strategic objectives of taking integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women, and studying the causes and consequences of violence against women and the effectiveness of preventive measures. While the BPfA objectives cover both prevention of, and response to, violence against women and girls, and experts supported full implementation of all of these, the recommendations below build on those areas focussing on prevention.

''Recommendation 105''&lt;br /&gt; Finally, experts identified recommendations arising from emerging issues or gaps in the evidence and practice base regarding prevention of violence against women and girls in certain contexts and settings. These include recommendations for prevention in settings affected by humanitarian crises such as conflict and natural disasters; contexts of serious urban or youth violence; with regards to representation of women and girls in the context of mass media as well as in new social media; and in the context of the global financial crisis and shifting geopolitics. In addition to the broad recommendations below that are relevant to all settings, special attention has been given to certain contexts and settings in order to highlight specific strategies for prevention related to these particular areas of concern. Experts have also chosen to highlight certain recommendations specific to preventing violence against girls, including adolescent girls, and young women, as a frequently overlooked group worthy of special consideration.

=== A global implementation plan to end violence against women and girls ===
[[File:Earth-illustration-blue.jpg|thumb|''[[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|A global implementation plan to end violence against women and girls.]]''(Recommendations 106 -112)]]
''Recommendation 106''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts agreed that while an international legal and normative frame work for preventing violence against women and girls is already in place, there are two major barriers to its implementation. The first is that social and cultural norms and customs are often used as a shroud or excuse for laws, practices and behaviours that are either directly violent and discriminatory towards women and girls, or else contribute to and support violence against them. '''The BPfA clearly calls on States to ‘refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,’'''{{ref|G}} and experts were adamant that this entails an active obligation on States to examine their own laws and policies, and challenge the communities, organisations and individuals in their jurisdictions, to eliminate norms and customs that excuse, justify or tolerate violence against women and girls, and which exist in all societies.

''Recommendation 107''&lt;br /&gt;
A second barrier to full implementation of existing obligations is the lack of a coordinated, strategic agenda at international, regional and national levels for '''modifying ‘the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women,’'''{{ref|H}} '''required by [[CEDAW]].''' This is an essential precondition and support for the sustainable prevention of violence against women and girls. As noted above, such prejudices, practices and stereotypes are rampant in all societies, expressed as much through channels such as media and popular culture, as through institutions more identifiable as the bearers of custom or ‘tradition’ (e.g. faith institutions). A much greater commitment and level of resourcing is required from all States, along with significantly improved coordination of policy, programming and research at global, regional and national levels towards a shared strategic agenda to eliminate these and so meet the legal obligation under CEDAW.

''Recommendation 108''&lt;br /&gt;
To this end, an overarching recommendation from experts was that Member States commit, at CSW in 2013, to develop a [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls]], to be launched in 2015, with a particular focus on prevention of violence against women and girls. This Plan should aim to provide vigilance on established international obligations (particularly the overarching BPfA&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; and [[CEDAW]] obligations cited above), and serve as the tool for operationalising these norms into national policy and programming in a coordinated and results-based way.

''Recommendation 109''&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls]], endorsed and supported by Member States at its launch, would aim to:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intensify and scale-up global awareness of violence against women and girls as a global emergency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine the best thinking on how to proceed with concrete pledges for action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mobilise international, regional and national action by governments, multilaterals, the private sector and civil society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the foundation for an evidence and practice-informed global prevention strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase resources available to end violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 110''&lt;br /&gt;
Development of the plan should be linked to the processes defining the post-2015 development agenda, to ensure that the prevention of violence against women and girls is rightly understood as crucial to the meeting of other internationally agreed development goals, and that targets relating to the prevention of (and response to) such violence are explicitly identified and well situated in the post-2015 development framework.

''Recommendation 111''&lt;br /&gt;
Development of the plan would require, among other things:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identification of a small set of key policy, legal and programme-delivery targets (institutions) at the national level towards which global violence prevention efforts can be directed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed review of existing action plans, indicators, recommendations, platforms for action, policy agendas, and recommendations outlined by the Security Council, UN Treaty bodies, the special rapporteurs, and various UN agencies, with a view to closing implementation gaps and building the next stage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creation of a cohesive global community of key stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designation of strong coordinating mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Development of an accountability framework with indicators to measure State responsiveness to the policy, legal and programme-delivery goals identified and an independent monitoring mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 112''&lt;br /&gt;
Development of the plan should include the proactive engagement of new partners (such as the private sector, sporting organisations, religious and cultural leaders, the media and entertainment industry), with a critical eye to the internal structures and methods of operation of such partners to ensure they fully support and in no way undermine the human rights of women and girls.

===A global advocacy campaign for prevention===
&lt;!-- [[File:Civilizations map 2.png|thumb|''[[A Global Advocacy Campaign for Prevention.|A global advocacy campaign for prevention]]'' (Recommendations 113 to 114)]] --&gt;
''Recommendation 113''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts further recognised the crucial and catalytic role of women’s organisations and called for them to help build support and momentum for the above. A global ‘movement for prevention’ is needed, engaging a critical mass of individuals, groups and institutions working together to create communities and countries that are safe for women and girls and where their rights are respected.

''Recommendation 114''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts’ second overarching recommendation was therefore that women’s organisations, in partnership with other civil society organisations and identified willing international and regional institutions, States and other relevant parties, lead a [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls]], as a crucial accompaniment to the development of the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Implementation Plan]] above. [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls|The Advocacy Campaign]] could include the creation of plain language communications materials, mechanisms to share information and practice, avenues for capacity development, and advocacy strengthening, for example through the training of male and female youth and veteran activists and leaders to monitor progress of nations on international agreements, produce reports, and represent women’s and girls’ priorities and interests in international fora. The aim of [[Global Advocacy Campaign to Prevent Violence against Women and Girls|the Advocacy Campaign]] would be to create momentum for the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Implementation Plan]], ensure the consistent promotion of evidence-informed, rights-based prevention activity, and hold international, regional and national stakeholders accountable to women and girls.

===Integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls===
[[File:No-slavery.jpg|thumb|''Integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls.'' (Recommendations 115 to 125)]]
''Recommendation 115''&lt;br /&gt;''
While the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan]] may take one to two years to develop, there are many areas of work that States have already committed to under the BPfA&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; Strategic Objective D1 – to take integrated measures to prevent and eliminate violence against women – and upon which they can and should take immediate action. Below are recommendations elaborated by the experts in line with the growing evidence and practice base on prevention, in support of these existing commitments.

''Recommendation 116''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 124(j), calling on Governments to ‘formulate and implement, at all appropriate levels, plans of action to eliminate violence against women,’and Paragraph 124(p)calling for the allocation of ‘adequate resources within the government budget and mobilis[ation of]community resources for activities related to the elimination of violence against women, including resources for the implementation of plans of action at all appropriate levels,’''' experts recommend that States work in partnership with funders, international and regional institutions, women’s and civil society organisations and other stakeholders to develop, implement,
evaluate and monitor coordinated, multisectoral and sustained prevention strategies, alongside and reinforcing strategies to improve the response to existing violence. Such strategies should
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;address the underlying causes of violence against women and girls in norms and practices at socio-structural, community, organisational, relationship and individual levels, and include a performance monitoring framework, and coordination and accountability mechanisms.&lt;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;comprise a variety of coordinated interventions to be implemented in a mutually reinforcing way across settings and sectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include the review and revision of policy and legislation to ensure a consistent whole-of-government framework for the prevention of violence against women and girls that promotes women’s and girls’ human rights and gender equality in line with international norms. This review and reform process should ensure law and policy: aligns with and responds explicitly to State obligations under relevant human rights treaties, intergovernmental agreements and international standards/guidelines, repealing and reforming discriminatory laws and criminalizing violence against women and girls; defines violence against women and girls according to international norms, acknowledging that such violence is a form of discrimination and manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, and the recognising the particular vulnerabilities of girls; and recognises that women’s and girls’ experience of violence is shaped by factors such as disability, age, ethnicity, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, marital status, sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS status, migrant or refugee status and exposure to conflict or natural disaster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;be supported by multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms, with the involvement of representatives from across government institutions and also civil society, donors and other stakeholders who can aid in implementation. These mechanisms should begin by identifying where existing capacity could be harnessed in particular programmatic areas for immediate impact (e.g. through existing health or education sectors, or existing nongovernment programming), and provide for the development of capacity (e.g. a human rights training curriculum and mandatory training for all elected officials and civil servants at every level of government) across other sectors for mid to longer-term work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensure earmarked budgets are in place in each relevant Ministry – including human and technical resources – to fund such strategies over the short, mid and long-terms. Working to integrate prevention of violence against women and girls into all leading policy and funding frameworks can also provide strategic avenues and a broad base from which to strengthen efforts and secure budgets. Examples of these include poverty reduction and development strategies and national plans, and sector-wide reforms related to education, health, security, justice, HIV and AIDS, peace-building, transitional justice, reconstruction and conflict prevention strategies and frameworks in post-conflict situations, and contingency planning strategies and frameworks in settings affected by cyclical natural disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;set specific targets and include mechanisms for monitoring progress towards them, across implementing institutions, and agencies in international/regional systems. Institutional responsibilities and reporting arrangements against these targets should be articulated, and mechanisms for accountability established. For example, regular and participatory multi-sectoral assessments at the national and local levels, across line ministries and related public sector institutions can strengthen accountability for performance in terms of agreed-upon budgetary commitments and/or related performance on budgetary allocations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aim to create an enabling environment for women’s and civil society organisations working on prevention of violence against women and girls. Resource allocation models should maximise collaboration between community organisations, and continuity of funding for programmes where they are shown to be effective through appropriate evaluation (see recommendation 131).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;include – across all settings and frameworks – efforts to engage men and boys in achieving gender equality and preventing violence, informed by the expertise of the women’s sector, and with mechanisms to ensure accountability to women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 117''&lt;br /&gt;''
Experts further recommend that UN agencies mirror what is recognised as good practice for Governments above, and adopt a coordinated, interagency approach to prevent (and respond to) violence against women and girls, with support from the highest political level (i.e. the Secretary General). As part of the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan]], UN agencies should develop a system-wide workplan building on related system-wide initiatives (e.g. the Secretary Generals’ [[UNiTE to End Violence Against Women|UNiTE Campaign]]) and through existing coordination mechanisms, to support and promote national implementation of, monitor progress against, and advance the international normative framework. Regional institutions should similarly develop and implement coordinated workplans to support Member States implement regional normative frameworks for prevention of violence against women and girls, monitor progress against these frameworks, and advance the frameworks themselves. Such workplans might include strategies to:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand normative interpretations and understandings of prevention activity – beyond awareness-raising, education and sensitisation of the media – to make linkages with and encompass positive obligations on States to promote gender equality and change social norms contributing to gender stereotyping, discrimination and violence against women and girls, across all levels, jurisdictions, sectors and settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide policy guidance, technical advice and knowledge management to support States develop, implement and monitor holistic, systemic and sustained approaches to prevention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure coordinated and sustained national and regional programming for prevention across different agencies and funding streams, and in different settings, such as conflict-affected contexts, natural disasters, low, middle and high-income countries (e.g. through UNDAFs, humanitarian funding streams, and in cooperation with regional bodies).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure outcomes and targets for prevention of violence against women and girls are a key component of the post-2015 development agenda.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 118''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 124(k) ‘Adopt all appropriate measures, especially in the field of education, to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, and to eliminate prejudices, customary practices and all other practices based on the idea of the inferiority or superiority of either of the sexes and on stereotyped roles for men and women’,''' experts recommend that States:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor compulsory education promoting human rights and gender equality, challenging gender stereotypes, discrimination and violence against women and girls, and building skills for equal and respectful relationships and for peaceful conflict resolution, at all levels of schooling, from kindergarten to the tertiary level and in non-school educational settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review teaching and learning materials to support the above, elaborating relevant curricula and materials in partnership with specialists on violence against women and girls, and ensuring that such education is gender-sensitive, comprehensive and fully integrated and includes assessment and reporting measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide for specialized training and resources for teaching and support staff to deliver the above curricula, implement gender-sensitive approaches to instruction through non-violent pedagogy, and support students who may disclose violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support schools, tertiary institutions and other educational settings to promote broader ‘whole-school/institution cultures’ of equality, non-violence and respect, through engagement of leadership, events and extracurricular activities, and involvement of the community, as well as through policy and practice reform such as instigating institution-wide bans on all violence – including corporal punishment – and protocols and procedures for responding to violence, discrimination, bullying and harassment, whether in the staff-room, the classroom or elsewhere on the school/institution grounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor and support girls’ completion of secondary schooling which multiple studies suggest is strongly protective against domestic and sexual violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 119''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 126(a), calling for the development of ‘programmes and procedures to eliminate sexual harassment and other forms of violence against women in all educational institutions, workplaces and elsewhere,’''' experts make a number of recommendations to States, employers, trade unions, community and youth organisations and non-governmental organisations, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review regulatory frameworks, codes of conduct, protocols and procedures, of workplace, educational institutions, sporting clubs, community and faith organisations, the military, police and other organisational/institutional environments, to ensure they work to eliminate discrimination and harassment, and build organisational environments that are safe and inclusive of women and girls, and encourage women’s and girls’ participation and leadership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Foster collaboration between employer and other organisations, and with women’s and other civil society organisations – especially those with expertise in engaging men and boys for gender equality – to recognise the role of organisations/institutions in prevention of violence against women and girls. Such a role is not only limited to addressing violence, discrimination and harassment within the organisation itself, but also extends to the organisation/institution as a ‘change-maker,’ capable of contributing to the transformation of attitudes, practices and social norms in their communities and society as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and implement awareness-raising and bystander capacity-building initiatives for employees or other members of the organisation, especially those aimed at supporting men to proactively challenge men’s violence or early warning signs of such violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify women and men who can act as positive role models and ambassadors for prevention among employer and other organisations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure protection and regulation in both the private and public sector for migrant workers to help combat harassment, discrimination and trafficking incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 120''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 125(e) calling for the organisation, support and funding of ‘community-based education and training campaigns to raise awareness about violence against women as a violation of women's enjoyment of their human rights and mobilis[ation of] local communities to use appropriate gender-sensitive traditional and innovative methods of conflict resolution,’''' experts recommend that States, local authorities, civil society organisations, communities and community organisations, promote gender equal and non-violent relationships, families and communities through new and existing holistic prevention efforts, services, programmes, events and grant/funding initiatives; prioritise prevention of violence against women and girls in grassroots efforts, urban and municipal planning; and implement legislative, regulatory and community-based programming initiatives to prevent violence and harassment of women and girls in private and public spaces.

''Recommendation 121''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 125(f), recognising, supporting and promoting ‘the fundamental role of intermediate institutions, such as primary health-care centres, family-planning centres, existing school health services, mother and baby protection services, centres for migrant families and so forth in the field of information and education related to abuse’''' experts recommend that States and partner organisations:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor programmes combining respectful relationships skills building and counselling support for children and young people, especially those who have been exposed to, or are identified as at risk of, violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor intensive early-intervention programmes for children and young people demonstrating violence-supportive attitudes and/or who are using violence, recognising that this may be a result of prior victimisation and using a model that empowers them with the skills and inner resources for non-violent conflict resolution and healthy relationship-building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor positive and non-violent parenting programmes, including those specifically targeting fathers/men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate issues of gender equality and prevention of violence against women and girls into health and social welfare programmes including sexual, reproductive and maternal health, HIV-AIDS programmes, and programmes promoting equal, respectful and non-violent intimate and family relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support the role of these sectors in identifying women and girls at risk of violence and referring them to early intervention or response services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 122''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraphs 125(d) and (e), supporting ‘initiatives of women's organisations and non-governmental organisations all over the world to raise awareness on the issue of violence against women and to contribute to its elimination,’ and organising, supporting and funding ‘community-based education and training campaigns to raise awareness about violence against women as a violation of women's enjoyment of their human rights and mobilise local communities to use appropriate gender-sensitive traditional and innovative methods of conflict resolution,''' ’experts recommend that States, including local governments, with community organisations, non-governmental organisations, educational institutions, the public and private sectors, particularly enterprises, and the mass media, as appropriate, develop and implement – in concert with wider strategies above – social marketing, communications and holistic community mobilisation efforts addressing the underlying causes of violence against women and girls, such as through the promotion of positive, respectful and non-violent masculinities; challenging gender stereotypes; raising awareness of the unacceptability of violence; and promoting critical thinking within the community on violence against women and girls as a manifestation of inequality and a violation of women’s human rights.

''Recommendation 123''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 126(d) calling for ‘special measures to eliminate violence against women, particularly those in vulnerable situations, such as young women, refugee, displaced and internally displaced women, women with disabilities and women migrant workers, including enforcing any existing legislation and developing, as appropriate, new legislation for women migrant workers in both sending and receiving countries,''' ’experts recommend that States, employers, trade unions, community and youth organisations and non-governmental organisations, as appropriate, recognise the multiple vulnerabilities of women and girls to various forms of violence throughout their life cycle, and identify clear prevention activities and budgets for this work.

''Recommendation 124''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with''' '''[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325|UNSCR 1325]]''', experts recommend that States ensure they have and implement action plans on women, peace and security, including comprehensive strategies to address the proliferation of small arms and armed violence, whether in conflict, post - conflict or ‘peacetime’ settings. Such initiatives should specifically include:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The support of arms control and disarmament initiatives and policies that take into account the needs and perceptions of both men and women, namely through consultation and [[threat assessment]], and provide adequate incentives for participation, namely in regular campaigns of gun registry and civilian disarmament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The harmonisation and implementation of laws that address domestic violence and firearms and ammunition – banning individuals with a history of violence from access to firearms, and ensuring guns are seized and gun licences suspended in domestic violence cases. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The improvement of the police officers’ capacity to conduct psychosocial evaluations, along with strengthened police training on violence against women and girls and the role of firearms, reaching beyond those working in special victim units.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conduction of risk analysis in all centres for victim support, including assessing the presence of a weapon in the home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 125''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with the UN General Assembly Special Session on HIV and AIDS, and the 2010 [[UN AIDS Agenda for Accelerated Country Action on Women, Girls, Gender Equality and HIV|UN AIDS Agenda for Accelerated Country Action on Women, Girls and HIV]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2010/agenda_for_accelerated_country_action_en.pdf UN AIDS Agenda for Accelerated Country Action on Women, Girls, Gender Equality and HIV.] Retrieved 28 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; '''and AIDS,''' integrate a focus on promoting gender equality, addressing gender based violence and engaging men and boys for gender equality into national AIDS plans.{{ref|J}}

===Research on the cause and consequences of violence against women and girls and the effectiveness of prevention measures===
[[File:Hand glass.png|thumb|''Research on the causes and consequences of violence against women and girls and the effectiveness of prevention measures.''(Recommendations 126 to 133)]]
''Recommendation 126''&lt;br /&gt;''
There are also several areas of work that States have already committed to under the BPfA&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; Strategic Objective D2 – to study the causes and consequences of violence against women and the effectiveness of preventive measures – upon which immediate action can be taken. Below are recommendations elaborated by the experts in support of these existing commitments.

''Recommendation 127''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 129(a) calling on Governments, regional organisations, the United Nations, other international organisations, research institutions, women's and youth organisations and non-governmental organisations, as appropriate, to ‘promote research, collect data and compile statistics, especially concerning domestic violence, relating to the prevalence of different forms of violence against women, and encourage research into the causes, nature, seriousness and consequences of violence against women and the effectiveness of measures implemented to prevent and redress violence against women’,''' experts make several recommendations:

''Recommendation 128''&lt;br /&gt;''
States should ensure the systematic collection, disaggregation (by gender, age and other characteristics), analysis and dissemination and use of data, including through supporting civil society organisations, academics and other actors engaged in research, to inform policy and strategy development on prevention. National statistical agencies and relevant ministries such as those of health or justice, should apply internationally agreed upon technical and ethical standards, ensuring consistency of concepts, regularity of data collection, and wide and timely dissemination of data. Government’s national machineries for the advancement of women should be closely associated with such efforts. Collaboration between producers and users of data should be strengthened by having users involved in all stages of data collection and dissemination. Data collection on violence against women and girls should be age-disaggregated and carried out in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including advocates and agencies providing services to women and girls, policymakers, legislators and researchers. It is also necessary that data be collected in a way that respects confidentiality and the rights of research participants and does not jeopardize their safety.

''Recommendation 129''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and national institutions, in partnership with research organisations, academia, and other civil society groups, should work together to identify gaps and improve research and data collection to inform prevention work, particularly in the following areas:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documenting the prevalence and characteristics of all forms of violence against women and girls, including violence experienced by particular groups of women and girls (such as women with disabilities, indigenous women, or women affected by armed conflict and/or natural disasters, to name a few), with implications for prevention programming.
ext for first item here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying risk and protective factors (for both victimisation and perpetration) and causal pathways for all forms of violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 130''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and regional institutions, in partnership with research organisations and academia, should examine processes for identifying and establishing intergovernmental agreement on common indicators to measure progress on the prevention of violence against women and girls at the international, national and local levels should be developed. Such indicators should be appropriate to the context and include both impact indicators that measure the reduction in levels of violence as well as indicators that measure short and medium term progress, such as changes in social norms, or organisational and community practices.

''Recommendation 131''&lt;br /&gt;''
States, donors and international/regional institutions should provide for the regular and comprehensive evaluation of projects and programmes on prevention, with feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement. Evaluative data on the effectiveness of prevention strategies in low and middle income countries should be developed and utilized in order to facilitate the replication, scaling up and institutionalization of the most effective interventions. Evaluations should be sensitive to the long-term and complex nature of the social change required for prevention, seeking to measurer not only reductions in levels of violence (which will only be apparent in the longer-term), but also shorter term indicators of change such as the shifts in attitudes, norms and practices referred to above.
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation should include a variety of methods including surveys, qualitative studies, administrative statistics/data and participatory approaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methods used should be appropriate to the context and scale of the interventions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where appropriate and feasible, longitudinal studies should be conducted to enable measurement of change over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evaluation should include also include measures of cost-effectiveness and feasibility of scaling up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 132''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and regional institutions, in partnership with research organisations and academia, should work together to develop practical tools and resources to support States and programmers in the elaboration, implementation and monitoring of prevention activity, for example:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[[Monitoring and evaluation]] tools that are practical and feasible for small-scale organisations and in low resource settings, including those affected by conflict and/or natural disasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-dimensional evaluation strategies capable of capturing the learnings and outcomes from holistic and multi-sectoral strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tools for the collection and analysis of comparable statistical and qualitative data across countries relevant to prevention, building on existing methodologies such as the WHO Multi-country study, the ICRW and Instituto Promundo International Men and Gender Equality Survey and the P4P multi-country Change Project surveys, and research learnings emerging from the previous recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methodologies for cost-benefit analyses of prevention activity, covering not only the saving of longer-term reduced prevalence of violence itself, but also the mid-term social and economic benefits of increased institutional capacity, early intervention, increased gender equality, etc, and guidance for costing and financing prevention strategies. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 133''&lt;br /&gt;''
International and regional institutions, civil society organisations, States and research institutions should support the development of ‘learning labs’ to produce new knowledge, design, test and share innovative approaches for the prevention of violence against women and girls. An international research and programming centre/institution for prevention might be envisaged to this end, providing guidance, tools and oversight for the activities described above, and potentially playing a role in the independent monitoring of the [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls|Global Implementation Plan.]]

'''''Emerging evidence and practice have highlighted further issues for prevention of violence against women and girls only partially covered by the existing normative framework, and experts have identified specific areas of action responding to these (detailed under the sub-headings below).'''''

===Mass and new media===
{{See also|Sexualization (as a political term)}}
[[File:Computer-globe.png|thumb|''Mass and new media.'' (Recommendations 134 to 136)]]
''Recommendation 134''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 125(j) calling for awareness raising on ‘the responsibility of the media in promoting non-stereotyped images of women and men, as well as in eliminating patterns of media presentation that generate violence, and encourage those responsible for media content to establish professional guidelines and codes of conduct’ and on ‘the important role of the media in informing and educating people about the causes and effects of violence against women and in stimulating public debate on the topic,’''' experts recommend that States, including local governments, community organisations, non-governmental organisations, educational institutions, the public and private sectors, particularly enterprises, and the mass media, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen regulatory frameworks with regard to media, advertising imagery, texts, games and other popular culture mediums which portray women or girls in a discriminatory, degrading or stereotypical way, or which glorify violent masculinities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage all media agencies that currently produce, or provide platforms for the distribution of, material/content which objectifies girls and women and/or which promote/distort messages around violence against girls and women, through a partnership approach, for example co-regulation. This includes the internet, mass media, music and games industries, and advertisers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build partnerships with journalists and other media professionals for the prevention of violence against women and girls and the promotion of gender equality, such as through training, guidelines and awards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include dedicated resources in national media outlets for organisational and content development supporting gender equality and non-discrimination.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support advocates such as victims/survivors of violence, men committed to non-violence, and high-profile people to respond to enquiries from journalists and speak at events on issues of violence against women and girls, and to promote messages of gender equality and non violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Promote inclusion and visibility of women at national conferences and in local and national media to challenge negative gender stereotypes and promote images of women leaders, intellectuals, politicians, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the media to educate, inform and engage citizens on women’s rights, in particular engaging women voters on women’s issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

''Recommendation 135''&lt;br /&gt;''
In addition to the recommendations made in line with BPfA’s&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; Paragraph 125(j) above, wider and long term action is needed to address the role the media currently plays in contributing to, maintaining and reinforcing, gender stereotypes. Experts recommend that all stakeholders above take immediate interim action to provide children and young people with media literacy skills as a core aspect of school curricula. This should aim to build gender analysis skills to interrogate the status quo (i.e. the objectification of girls and women), critique constructions of gender roles and offer alternative interpretations and framings of the content that they are engaging with on a daily basis.

''Recommendation 136''&lt;br /&gt;''
'''In line with BPfA’s'''&lt;ref name="Source2"/&gt; '''Paragraph 129(d), encouraging ‘the media to examine the impact of gender role stereotypes, including those perpetuated by commercial advertisements which foster gender-based violence and inequalities, and how they are transmitted during the life cycle, and [to]take measures to eliminate these negative images with a view to promoting a violence-free society,’''' experts recommend that international/regional organisations, States, research institutions, civil society partners and media organisations, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commit to the research and development of urgently needed guidance (and where appropriate, regulatory action) for the prevention and prohibition of discrimination against women and girls and gender stereotyping across all media. This includes guidance on both the development and the distribution of material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fully implement the Convention for the Rights of the Child (Article 17) which recognises the importance of mass media and calls on states to develop ‘appropriate guidelines for the protection of the child from information and material injurious to his or her well-being.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognise that media is an influential mechanism that can make a real difference to a larger project of preventing violence against women and girls. As such, work with media should not just be focussed on limiting harm, but should also be focussed on media making a positive difference e.g. responsible reporting of violence against women and girls which provides accurate information and a gendered analysis (i.e. one which interrogates dominant masculinities and recognises and challenges male privilege).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage with the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression as he considers issues of balancing the right to freedom of expression with the right to be protected from discrimination, with a view to contributing to and building on his recommendations to support prevention of violence against women and girls. Similarly, engage with the International Telecommunications Union as it considers the issue of internet regulation at its December 2012 conference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===The global financial crisis and geo-politics===
[[File:TED Spread.png|thumb|''The global financial crisis and geo-politics.'' (Recommendations 137 to 139)]]
''Recommendation 137''&lt;br /&gt;
Given the likely negative impact of the global financial crisis on levels of violence against women and girls, and the subsequent economic, health and social costs of such increased violence (in terms of reduced productivity, strains on services, etc.), experts recommend that States, international and regional institutions, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders, should proactively and collaboratively work to protect women’s and girls’ right to live free of violence, in order to ‘stem the tide’ of negative economic, health and social impacts arising from such violence and their subsequent further costs to the State.

''Recommendation 138''&lt;br /&gt;
International and regional organisations, donors, development agencies, philanthropics and other non-governmental organisations should ensure that allocations of aid funding in the wake of the crisis support programmes
to prevent (and respond to) violence against women and girls and promote women’s human rights.

''Recommendation 139''&lt;br /&gt;
International and regional institutions, civil society organisations and established donors should engage emerging middle income countries and new donors in the development of the new [[Global Implementation Plan to End Violence against Women and Girls]] and encourage a rights-based approach to aid investment that prioritises prevention of violence against women and girls through this international, target-focussed framework.

===Urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) and armed violence===
[[File:Gun outline.svg|thumb|''Urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) and armed violence.'' (Recommendation 140)]]
''Recommendation 140''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts recommend that States, non-governmental organisations, international/regional institutions and other stakeholders as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support investigations into the relationship between violence against women and girls and armed violence, especially thestrategies of gender-based violence used within and between rival armed groups and the use and threat of gender-based violence in the private sphere by members of armed groups, especially with guns. Research should also be undertaken on the link between intimate partner / domestic violence and armed violence, including the collection of data on the role of firearms in violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase collaboration between those working on violence against women and girls and those working on arms control at the local, national and international public policy levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor policies and programmes aimed at preventing and/or reducing armed violence specifically against girls and women locally and nationally that include gender-responsive protection measures in child and adolescent law and education systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor tailored strategies for girls and women who are involved in/associated with armed violence, and for girl children and adolescents at risk, with their active participation at all stages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strengthen crime prevention policies to ensure a review of, and action on, the differential impact of urban violence on violence against women and girls, and by the same token, explicitly consider the impact of urban, serious youth (e.g. gang) or armed violence in policies or strategies for the prevention of violence against women and girls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invest in knowledge creation and data collection on the typologies and motivations of young men’s and women’s involvement in armed and violent criminality, especially in contexts with significant gun violence rates, as well as research on armed violence victims/survivors and witnesses, recognising that the decision to join gangs and other armed groups may be fuelled by social exclusion, family violence and violence experienced while in prison or at the hand of state security forces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support the strengthening of community policing initiatives, including specially trained officers with a focus on youth and family violence, violence against women and girls, and on human rights. Promote greater collaboration between police forces and other security sectors for community-based prevention efforts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate, strengthen and expand professional and vocational training programmes into socio-educational, juvenile justice and prison systems that are designed according to needs-based assessments, and including curricula on the gendered drivers and consequences of gun violence. Encourage and facilitate community reintegration approaches, including through supporting work with communities to prevent stigmatisation of youth who wish to reintegrate themselves into the community in a non-violent way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engage urban young people in the development of public policies across key areas such as employment, revitalisation of marginalised neighbourhoods and housing, and cultural initiatives. Build the capacity of institutions and civil society organisations to harness the potential of young people to foster change, and position them as active protagonists in programme development, implementation and monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Humanitarian crises related to conflict and natural disasters===
[[File:CasaDestruidaFriburgo2011.jpg|thumb|''Humanitarian crises related to conflict and natural disasters''. (Recommendation 141)]]
''Recommendation 141''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts noted the lack of documented prevention strategies for settings affected by conflict and/or natural disasters, and the consequent improvised, small-scale, and/or issue-specific nature of prevention activities in these settings. They emphasised that it is critical that States – and the humanitarian, peacekeeping, civil society and development actors with whom they engage – institute broad, well-coordinated measures to prevent violence against women and girls in all stages of humanitarian intervention, and ensure that those measures incorporate strategies that reach the most vulnerable, as well as monitoring and evaluation components in order to develop an evidence base for good practice. To this end, experts recommend that States and their humanitarian partners:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate prevention into all contingency planning for humanitarian emergencies, and develop early warning systems to assess and avert the risk of violence against women and girls. Contingency planning and early warning strategies should engage women and girls in the affected communities in order to anticipate protection needs and develop, for example, community alert networks, safe spaces for women and girls, access to reproductive and sexual health care, widespread information about the illegality of violence against women and girls and the consequences for perpetrators. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a crisis strikes, immediately institute protections across all areas of humanitarian response, according to the IASC ''Guidelines for Gender-based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Settings''. Collect disaggregated data to identify the particular security needs of women and girls and develop targeted tools and guidelines to facilitate protection from and prevention of violence against women and girls, including protection from sexual exploitation and abuse committed by humanitarian actors against beneficiaries of humanitarian aid. Work with international and local human rights organisations to monitor the activities of armed groups to ensure that they adhere to the rules of combat, and are prohibited from, and held accountable for, violence against women and girls. All peacekeeping operations must act in accordance with the standards set forth in the UNSCRs on Women, Peace and Security.{{ref|K}}&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the initial emergency has passed and when working towards reconstruction, collaborate to expand prevention efforts and facilitate durable solutions for lasting peace and security. This includes incorporating prevention of violence against women and girls as an integral component of post-conflict and post-disaster action plans, including national action plans on Women, Peace and Security, and throughout all transition and recovery strategies. Ensure these action plans are multi-sectoral and supported by widespread protective legislation as well as capacity building across all key sectors to monitor and address risks for violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the reconstruction phase, undertake programming to build social and economic assets of women and girls in order to limit their future exposure to violence, through, for example, education, livelihoods, lifeskills, and leadership. Support women’s and girls’ empowerment in new and existing constitutions, bolstered by national mechanisms, government programs, and civil society partnerships, particularly women’s organisations addressing violence against women and girls. Identify and address risks related to perpetration of violence, particularly amongst boys who have been exposed to violence and in terms of limiting the availability of small arms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In post-conflict settings, ensure the inclusion of women and girls in peace-building efforts at the national and local levels. Include elements addressing violence against women and girls committed during conflict in all peace agreements. Ensure that survivors have safe access to on-going care and treatment in all conflict-related transitional justice and reparations programmes. Include an emphasis on the special needs of women and girls who were part of fighting forces in programmes for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration, and efforts to prevent future violence against women and girls, including by demobilised male soldiers. Work with families and communities to overcome prejudice and discrimination against women ex-combatants and women heads of household. Ensure an end to impunity by integrating prevention of (and response to) violence against women and girls into all security sector and justice reform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

===Girls, adolescent girls and young women===
[[File:Young girl applying cosmetics.jpg|thumb|''Girls, adolescent girls and young women.'' (Recommendation 142)]]
''Recommendation 142''&lt;br /&gt;
Experts recognised that girls, including adolescent girls, and young women are often excluded from, or ‘squeezed into,’ interventions which are focussed on adult women, on boys and young men, or on children in a gender-neutral way. Experts concluded that an emphasis on prevention work specifically tailored to the needs, experiences and aspirations of girls,
adolescent girls and young women is urgently needed; acknowledging the complexities of the current landscape that they are required to negotiate. Experts made the following recommendations to States, women’s and civil society organisations, international and regional institutions, public and private sectors, as appropriate:
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop, implement and monitor tailored prevention activity with adolescent girls and young women that takes an empowerment, not protection, approach, and explicitly address their needs and rights, informed by the voices of adolescent girls and young women themselves. The onus is often placed on girls and young women to avoid / stop violence from happening to them rather than on developing widespread and embedded activities which challenge the social norms that permeate their lives. Prevention programmes should therefore address what is happening around young people (e.g. social pressures, media messaging and so forth) rather than purely on helping young women to ‘manage’ their adolescence (and the risks of violence this is assumed to entail) more effectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support all adolescents and young people to understand the nature of consent and coercion, and the impact of social and environmental factors on individual ability to truly provide consent (e.g. with key messages such as ''‘your '''yes''' is only as good as your ability to say '''no'''''’). The issue of consent, and especially sexual consent, is complex and is widely misunderstood among many adults. Yet adolescent girls and young women are often expected to be able to negotiate this difficult terrain which is focussed exclusively on the nature of a ‘no’ rather than the expectation that what is required is a strong, enthusiastic ‘yes’. This in turn reinforces notions of female passivity (the object of pursuit) and male aggressor (the pursuer). Such activities would have relevance to a number of areas from teen relationships to forced marriage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure a gender dimension is incorporated into multi-sectoral legislative, policy and programmatic development to prevent (and respond to) violence against children, taking into account the specific needs, vulnerabilities and voices of girls of all ages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

'''Emma Cons''' (4 March 1838 – 24 July 1912) was a British [[social reformer]], [[educationalist]] and [[theatre manager]].

==Early life==
Born in [[St. Pancras, London]],&lt;ref&gt;Census, England and Wales, 1861&lt;/ref&gt; she trained as an artist and joined the [[Ladies' Co-operative Art Guild]] in London, run by Caroline Hill, mother of the future housing reformer and founder of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], [[Octavia Hill]].  As Cons's father Frederick Cons was suffering from ill health, she needed to work and the Guild helped her get work as an [[limner|illuminator]] as well as restoring manuscripts for [[John Ruskin]].  Cons also tried working as a watch engraver, and as a [[stained glass]] designer but experienced harassment from men who resented a woman working amongst them.

From 1864, Cons worked for Octavia Hill as a rent collector, starting work at Barrett's Court, [[Oxford Street]].  Later Cons moved to South London, and in 1879 she established the [[South London Dwellings Company]] around Surrey Lodge, [[Lambeth]], near to [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]].

In 1889, Cons became the first female [[alderman]] on the [[London County Council]] (LCC), working alongside the first elected women members [[Jane Cobden]] (elected for Bow and Bromley) and Lady Sandhurst (elected for [[Brixton]]). The elections were challenged by anti-suffragists, but as Cons had not been elected, she had been asked by the LCC Progressives to become an alderman, and it was difficult to challenge her position.

When she voted, however, she became liable for a fine:  De Souza v. Cobden, which reached the [[Court of Appeal]] in 1891, ruled Cobden and Cons could legally be members of the council but could not vote.  After this, Cons' commitment to the cause of women's [[suffrage]] was energetic, and she served on the Committee for the Return of Women as Councillors, became Vice-President of the [[Women's Local Government Society]], and Vice President of the Women's Liberal Federation.

==Educationalist==
Cons also helped found [[Swanley Horticultural College]] (which amalgamated with [[Wye College]] later part of [[Imperial College London]], a part of [[University of London]] before closure in 2009), in 1892, the first such college for women, and she founded [[Morley College]] for working men and women, aided by money donated by [[Bristol]] based millionaire manufacturer and philanthropist, [[Samuel Morley (MP)|Samuel Morley]].

Cons also founded the Working Girls Home, a hostel in [[Drury Lane]], London, and she established various crèches and clinics for women including what was described as 'the Home for Feeble-Minded girls' at [[Bodmin]].

==Cultural heritage==
[[File:Waterloo the old vic 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Old Vic Theatre]]]]
In 1880, Emma Cons, re-opened what is now the [[Old Vic Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Cecily and Baylis, Lilian.(1926). ''The Old Vic''. Cape, London.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Lambeth]], south [[London]], as the ''Royal Victoria Coffee and [[Music Hall]]''. It was "a cheap and decent place of amusement on strict [[Temperance movement|temperance]] lines". Through this initiative, she brought the plays of [[William Shakespeare]] and also [[opera]] to [[working class]] people.

In 1882, Samuel Morley began to take an interest in the affairs of the theatre, and in 1884 he joined the executive committee. He contributed a large amount of money to the scheme, and his business advice was of value. Morley College developed from the lectures given at the Old Vic.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Cons, Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, Cons devoted her autumn holiday in [[Cyprus]] to trying to help refugee [[Armenians]], who had fled from persecution in Turkey.  In 1908, Cons became the first woman to speak at the [[Institute of Directors]], on behalf of the South London Dwellings Company.

==Personal life==
Emma Cons died on 24 July 1912, of a cerebral haemorrhage, at Chippen's Bank, [[Hever, Kent]], home of her friend, [[Ethel Everest]].

Her niece, [[Lilian Baylis]] (1874–1937),&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, Elizabeth.(2006) ''Lilian Baylis: A Biography''. University of Hertfordshire Press, Hatfield. {{ISBN|1-902806-63-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; assisted in running the [[Old Vic]]. Her sister, Ellen Cons (1840–1920), was also closely associated with many philanthropic schemes, and was one of the governors of the Old Vic.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt;

==Plaques to Emma Cons==
Plaques honouring Emma Cons are displayed outside the Old Vic on the corner with [[Waterloo Road, London|Waterloo Road]] and in the basement area bar. Another round [[blue plaque]] was put up by the Greater London Council, on the street wall of 136 Seymour Place, Marylebone, where she lived and worked. Today, the building is WLM Seymour Place.

The '''''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential''''' is published by the [[Union of International Associations]] (UIA). It is available online since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/encyclopedia?qt-encyclopedia=1#qt-encyclopedia UIA Online Encyclopedia]. Union of International Associations.&lt;/ref&gt; and was previously available as a CD-ROM and as a three-volume book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/encyclopedia?qt-encyclopedia=2#qt-encyclopedia Hardcover edition of the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential]. Union of International Associations.&lt;/ref&gt; The online Encyclopedia is currently in a redevelopment phase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/projects/encyclopedia UIA Encyclopedia redevelopment].

== Notes and commentaries within the ''Encyclopedia'' projects ==
The ''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential'' contains nearly 500 pages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/319419 Expanding Resources on International Organizations], a review by Chadwick F. Alger, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; of introductory notes and commentaries. Some of them just provide readers with usual information about the work content and its organization. Most of them, however, represent extensive reports on the exploratory work done by the editors in eight projects (also called research areas, or sections). Here are those projects, with illustrative examples of key ideas figuring in the notes and commentaries.

=== Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project ===
A first objective of the editors in that project&lt;ref name=encycintro&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/164014 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is to collect and present information on the following topics: the problems with which humanity perceives itself to be faced; the organizational, human, and intellectual resources it believes it has at its disposal; the values by which it is believed any change should be guided; the concepts of human development considered to be either the means or the end of any such social transformation. A second objective is to clarify the conceptual challenge of interrelating such plentiful and disparate or even contradictory information. A third objective is to enable alternation between viewpoints from different cultures, ideologies, beliefs and even "facts", as a way for individuals and societies to become empowered with an appropriate response to the problematic conditions of the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=5 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: significance]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=4 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: objectives]. Union of International Associations.

Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the disagreement amongst the advocates of different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the ''Encyclopedia'' uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing an increasing number of people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=2 World problems project – Significance: constraints on a problem-focused approach]. Uia.be (21 May 1973). Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=23 World problems project – Comments: general]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia'' databases are much about how problems, strategies, values, development concepts, and organizations are linked together. As a result, the possibility of focusing on [[feedback|feedback loops]] has proven to be an important feature of the ''Encyclopedia'', and a program has been carried out to identify "''vicious problem loops''". A vicious problem loop is a chain of problems, each aggravating the next, and with the last looping back to aggravate the first in the chain.  Here is an example: Man-made disasters, Vulnerability of ecosystem niches, Natural environment degradation, Shortage of natural resources, Unbridled competition for scarce resources, Man-made disasters. Solutions that focus on only one problem in a chain may fail or even be harmful, because the cycle has the capacity to regenerate itself, and also because several cycles may interlock, forming tangled skeins of interlinked global problems. The loop detection program detected more than 50,000 loops (of up to 9 elements) in more than 12,000 problem profiles. It is thought that a similar work could be done about mutually facilitating or constraining strategy loops, so as to constitute a dynamic response to aggravating or reducing loops of problems through a circle of matching strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=19 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: feedback loops and dependent co-arising]. Union of International Associations.

Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other examples of loops can be seen at [http://www.uia.be/node/157?kap=7 Transformative approaches project – Analysis: Vicious cycles and loops] and [http://www.uia.be/node/157?kap=9 Transformative approaches project – Examples of vicious problem cycles and loops]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World problems and global issues ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/285958 World problems project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; endeavors to present all the phenomena in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute a challenge to creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the [[problem]]s that infringe their values and arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are really serious, little effort has been made to determine how many problems there are. Likewise, while it is becoming increasingly evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that [[complexity]]. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some less threatening problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.&lt;ref name=sections&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=11 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Content: sections and sub-sections].

Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Views concerning problems are extremely varied. Several pages in the notes and commentaries deal with that variety. Problems are agenda items for assemblies or conferences; action targets for organizations; issues for political parties or governments; events or topics for the media; markets for businesses; sins for religions; puzzles for sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=8 World problems project – Criteria: problem disguises and problem evasion]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems can be viewed as synonymous with chaos and disorder, or as elements in an ordered array; as static or dynamic entities; as discrete or continuous phenomena; as objective things or subjective experiences; as directly experienceable phenomena or as indirect implications of seemingly innocent phenomena; as inherently comprehensible or incomprehensible entities; as the results of due processes or as spontaneous phenomena. For many people in the West problems may be considered as artifacts of concerned minds, about which reason, principles, or history are relevant, while in the East to conceive of life as presenting problems to be solved may be seen as a misconception of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=7 World problems project – Criteria: assumptions]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other pages of notes and commentaries deal extensively with the variety of points of view under headings such as ''Approaches to problems'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=24 World problems project – Comments: approaches to problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beyond the problem-lobby mindset'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=25 World problems project – Comments: beyond the problem-lobby mindset].

Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global strategies and solutions ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/190 Global strategies project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; aims at identifying the complete range of [[strategy|strategies]] perceived by constituencies acting at the international level.

The conventional way of addressing any problem situation is to elaborate a strategy, but given the number, variety and interrelationships of the problems, it is uncertain whether any conventional strategy could be adequate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/304593 Global strategies project – Rationale]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, many groups have "answers" to the current crisis. The proponents of each such answer naturally attach special importance to their own as being of crucial relevance at this time, or even as being the only appropriate basis for a viable world society in the future. However, that focus on "answer production", a vital moving force in society, obscures the manner in which such answers, in the absence of integration between them, undermine each other’s significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=1 World problems project – Significance: acknowledgement of the universe of problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears to the editors that the elements of the strategic challenge at this time include:
*a vast and changing network of perceived problems, on which no single body has (or possibly could have) adequate control;
*a vast and changing network of conceptual tools and knowledge resources, which is not (and possibly could not be) controlled by any single body;
*a vast and changing [[social network|network]] of agencies, organizations, groups and active individuals spanning every conceivable human interest and extending from the community level to the international level, and on which no single body has (or possibly could or should have) adequate control.
The strategic problem therefore is how to ensure that the appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response to emerging problem complexes. But it would seem that this must be achieved without organizing such response – for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and probably should develop) which favor alternative approaches. The challenge is therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response to problem networks, in the light of values perceived in various parts of the social system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=20 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: network strategy]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pages of notes and commentaries describe in details various approaches to global strategies, and their limits. Such are ''Strategic ecosystem: beyond "The Plan"'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=18 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: beyond "The Plan"].

=== Human values and wisdom ===

Work on the first edition started with funds from Mankind 2000, matching those of the [[Union of International Associations|UIA]]. The publisher [[K G Saur Verlag|Klaus Saur]], of Munich, provided funds, in conjunction with those from the UIA, for work on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions. Seed funding for the third volume of the 4th edition was also provided on behalf of Mankind 2000.&lt;ref name=backstrat /&gt; In the nineties, seed funding was provided, again on behalf of Mankind 2000, for computer equipment which subsequently allowed the UIA to develop a large website and make progressively available for free the ''Encyclopedia'' databases as from the 1994–1995 edition. In turn, this proven [[knowledge management]] capacity enabled the UIA, on the initiative of Nadia McLaren, a consultant ecologist who has been a primary editor for the ''Encyclopedia'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/164090 Nadia McLaren].

The ''Encyclopedia'' was the fruit of a continuing processing of documents gathered from many of the thousands of the [[international organization]]s profiled in the ''[[Yearbook of International Organizations]]''. Many such bodies regularly produce a wide range of material on the areas of their concern, many regularly send documents to the UIA, and many, when requested more specifically, supplied documents for the ''Encyclopedia''. The following organizations provided documents in the greatest quantity: FAO, ILO, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNCTD, WHO, Commonwealth Secretariat, Council of Europe, OECD, World Bank group. Furthermore, the United Nations Library in Geneva facilitated access to other material over two decades.&lt;ref name=back&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=8 Encyclopedia of world problem and human potential project – Overview: background and acknowledgements].

He reports in ''Encyclopedia Illusions''&lt;ref name=illusions /&gt; how the narrow focus of the [[Club of Rome]] on a few socio-economic aspects of futures research prompted the much vaster exploration concerning world problems and human potential.

Anthony Judge was the architect and managing editor of the ''Encyclopedia''. He was also the main author of the notes and commentaries. The principal editors over the years have been, for different editions, Jon Jenkins and Maureen Jenkins (who had also worked at the Institute of Cultural Affairs), Owen Victor, Jacqueline Nebel, Nadia McLaren, and Tomáš Fülöpp. There were also enthusiastic editorial contributions from volunteers.

[[Richard Slaughter]] emphasized that the significance of the work is not its size or the scope of its references, impressive though these are. It is rather in the nature of what has been attempted. The accompanying notes and commentaries, he said, are good enough to be published separately because they contain highly cogent observations on the "global problematique", commentaries on the work of numerous great thinkers from a wide variety of fields, and an impressive array of insights about the epistemology, symbolism, metaphysics, metaphors and linguistic representations of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.org/reviews/slaught.php A meta-linguistic resource] Richard A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18813">'''Environmental security''' examines threats posed by environmental events and trends to individuals, communities or nations. It may focus on the impact of human [[War|conflict]] and [[international relations]] on the [[Natural environment|environment]], or on how environmental problems cross [[Sovereign state|state]] borders.

==General==
The [[United Nations Millennium Project|Millennium Project]] assessed definitions of environmental security and created a synthesis definition:

Environmental security is environmental viability for life support, with three sub-elements: 
*preventing or repairing military damage to the environment,
*preventing or responding to environmentally caused conflicts, and
*protecting the environment due to its inherent [[moral value]].

It considers the abilities of individuals, communities or nations to cope with [[Environmental hazard|environmental risks]], [[Climate change|changes]] or conflicts, or limited [[Natural Resources|natural resources]]. For example, climate change can be viewed a threat to environmental security. Human activity impacts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, impacting regional and global climatic and environmental changes and thus changes in agricultural output. This can lead to food shortages which will then cause political debate, ethnic tension, and civil unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Chalecki, Elizabeth. Environmental Security: A Case Study of Climate Change. Pacific Institute for Studies of Development, Environment, and Security&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental security is an important concept in two fields: [[international relations]] and [[international development]].

Within international development, projects may aim to improve aspects of environmental security such as [[food security]] or [[water security]], but also connected aspects such as [[energy security]], that are now recognised as [[Sustainable Development Goals]] at UN level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW AND BUSINESS|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targets for [[MDG]] 7 about environmental sustainability show international priorities for environmental security. Target 7B is about the security of [[fisheries]] on which many people depend for [[food]]. Fisheries are an example of a resource that cannot be contained within state borders. A conflict before the [[International Court of Justice]] between Chile and Peru about maritime borders and their associated fisheries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haguejusticeportal.net/eCache/DEF/9/091.html |title=Maritime Dispute (Peru v. Chile) |publisher=The Hague Justice Portal |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a case study for environmental security.

==History==
The [[The Copenhagen School (international relations)|Copenhagen School]] defines the referent object of environmental security as the environment, or some strategic part of it.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Buzan, Ole Waever, and Jaap de Wilde, ''Security: A New Framework for Analysis'' (Boulder: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the definition of [[international security]] has varied over time. After [[World War II]], definitions typically focused on the subject of [[realpolitik]] that developed during the [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]].

As tensions between the superpowers eased after the collapse of the Soviet Union, academic discussions of definitions of security significantly expanded to encompass a far broader range of threats to peace, including, particularly, environmental threats associated with the political implications of resource use or pollution. By the mid-1980s, this field of study was becoming known as "environmental security". Despite a wide range of semantic and academic debates over terms, it is now widely acknowledged that environmental factors play both direct and indirect roles in both political disputes and violent conflicts.

In the academic sphere environmental security is defined as the relationship between security concerns such as armed conflict and the natural environment.  A small but rapidly developing field, it has become particularly relevant for those studying resource scarcity and conflict in the developing world.  Prominent early researchers in the field include [[Felix Dodds]], [[Norman Myers]], [[Jessica Tuchman Mathews]], Michael Renner, Richard Ullman, Arthur Westing, [[Michael Klare]], [[Thomas Homer Dixon]], [[Geoffrey Dabelko]], [[Peter Gleick]], Rita Floyd and [[Joseph Romm]].

===Origins===
According to Jon Barnett, environmental security emerged as an important concept in [[security studies]] because of some interrelated developments which started in 1960s. The first one was the increasing level of [[environmental consciousness]] in so called [[developed countries]].&lt;ref name=Alan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alan|first1=Collins|title=Contemporary Security Studies|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Great Britain|isbn=9780199694778|pages=190–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various occurrences and events triggered the growth of the [[environmental movement]] during this period of time. [[Rachel Carson]]'s well-known book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' was one of the extraordinary publications of that time and brought greater degree of environmental awareness among ordinary people by warning them of the dangers to all natural systems including animals and food chain from the misuse of [[chemical pesticides]] such as [[DDT]]. Whilst Carson undoubtedly contributed to public debate at the time she was arguably not amongst the more radical 'social revolutionaries' who were also urging greater public awareness of [[environmental issue]]s.&lt;ref name="Rachel Carson"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rachelcarson.org/ | title=Life and Legacy of Rachel Carson| accessdate=29 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the number of largest well-known [[environmental non-governmental organizations]] such as the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (1961), [[Friends of the Earth]] (1969), and [[Greenpeace]] (1971) were founded during that time.&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt;
 
The second notable development which brings the emergence of concept of environmental security was number of scholars started to criticize the traditional notion of security and mainstream security debates in their work from 1970s by emphasizing its inability to handle environmental problems at national and international security level.&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt;  First commentators were [[Richard Falk]] who published 'This Endangered Planet' (1971), and Harold and Margaret Sprout who wrote 'Toward a Politics of Planet Earth' (1971). These two commentators asserted in their book that the notion of security can no longer be centered only on military power, rather nations should collectively take measurements against common environmental problems since they pose threat to national well-being and thus international stability. These main ideas about environmental interdependence between countries and common security threat have remained key themes of environmental [[security studies]].&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richard|first1=Matthew et al|title=Global Environmental Change and Human Security|date=2010|publisher=MIT Press|location=London|isbn=9780262013406|pages=118–130|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzI5MTgzOV9fQU41?sid=8f8224fb-89c9-47f7-a3bf-f5705ce6969e@sessionmgr103&amp;vid=0&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1=yes|accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, not until Richard Ullman publishes an academic article named "Redefining Security" (1983), radical departure from the dominant security discourse haven't happened. Ullman offered the following definition of national security threat as "an action or sequence of events that (1) threatens drastically and over a relatively brief span of time to degrade the quality of life for the inhabitants of a state, or (2) threatens significantly to narrow the range of policy choices available to the government of a state, or to private, nongovernmental entities within the state".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Ullman|title=Redefining Security Issues|journal=International Security|date=1983|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/446023/pdf=yes|accessdate=29 September 2016|doi=10.2307/2538489}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Significant other scientists onward also linked the issue of security by focusing on the role of environmental degradation in causing violent conflict. Others, while recognizing the importance of environmental problems, argued that labeling them 'environmental security' was problematic and abandoned analytical rigor for normative and emotional power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deudney|first=Daniel|date=2016-06-23|title=The Case Against Linking Environmental Degradation and National Security|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/03058298900190031001|journal=Millennium|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=461–476|doi=10.1177/03058298900190031001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental change and national security==
Even though [[environmental degradation]] and [[climate change]] sometimes cause [[war]] and violent conflict within and between countries and other times not,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pugh|first=Jeffrey|date=December 2008|title=Challenges and opportunities of human conflict and environmental transformation in Ecuadorian highlands|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44201034_Challenges_and_opportunities_of_human_conflict_and_environmental_transformation_in_Ecuadorian_highlands|journal=Pirineos|volume=163|pages=63–75|via=|doi=10.3989/pirineos.2008.v163.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; it can weaken the national security of the state in number of profound ways. [[Environmental change]] can undermine the economic prosperity which plays big role in country’s military capacity and material power. In some [[developed countries]], and in most [[developing countries]], [[natural resources]] and [[environmental services]] tend to be important factors for [[economic growth]] and [[employment rate]]. Income from and employment in primary sectors such as [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[fishing]], and [[mining]], and from environmentally dependent services like [[torus]], may all be adversely affected by [[environmental change]]. If [[natural capital]] base of an economy erodes, then so does the long-term capacity of its armed forces.&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.un.org/en/events/environmentconflictday/pdf/GN_Renewable_Consultation.pdf | title= Renewable Resources and Conflict| accessdate=29 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, changes in environmental condition can exposes people to health threats, it can also undermine [[human capital]] and its well-being which are essential factors of [[economic development]] and stability of [[human society]].

Climate change also could, through extreme weather events, have a more direct impact on [[national security]] by damaging critical infrastructures such as [[military bases]], naval yards and training grounds, thereby severely threatening essential national defense resources.&lt;ref name=Joshua&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cfr.org/climate-change/climate-change-national-security/p14862|title= Climate Change and National Security| accessdate=29 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire''' was a [[politico]]-[[economic]] system of relationships between [[liege lord]]s and enfeoffed [[vassal]]s (or feudatories) that formed the basis of the [[social structure]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] during the [[High Middle Ages]]. In German the system is variously referred to ''Lehnswesen'', ''Feudalwesen'' or ''Benefizialwesen''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Feudalism in Europe emerged in the Early Middle Ages, based on [[Patronage in ancient Rome|Roman clientship]] and the [[Germanic peoples#Culture|Germanic social hierarchy]] of lords and retainers.  It obliged the [[feudatory]] to render personal services to the lord. These included e.&amp;nbsp;g. holding his stirrup, joining him on festive occasions and service as a [[cupbearer]] at the banquet table. Both pledged mutual [[loyalty]]: the lord to "shelter and protect", the vassal to "help and advise". Furthermore, feudal lord and vassal were bound to mutually respect one another, i.e. the lord could not, by law, beat his vassal, humiliate or lay hands on his wife or daughter.&lt;!-- German Wikipedia has "daughter" not "children"; presumably this refers to protection from sexist behaviour or sexual predation. --&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The highest liege lord was the sovereign, the [[king]] or [[duke]], who granted [[fief]]s to his [[prince]]s. In turn, they could award fiefs to other [[nobility|nobles]], who wanted to be [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] by them and who were often subordinate to the liege lord in the aristocratic hierarchy.

== Terms ==
[[File:Lehensurkunde Götz von Berlichingen Burg Hornberg.jpg|thumb|[[Götz von Berlichingen]] was enfeoffed with [[Hornberg Castle (Neckarzimmern)|Hornberg Castle]] in this deed]]
A [[fief]] (also fee, feu, feud, tenure or fiefdom, '''''{{lang-de|Lehen}}''''', {{lang-lat|feudum}}, ''feodum'' or ''beneficium'') was understood to be a thing (land, property), which its owner, the liege lord (''Lehnsherr''), had transferred to the hereditary [[ownership]] of the beneficiary on the basis of mutual loyalty, with the proviso that it would return to the lord under certain circumstances.

Enfeoffment gave the vassal extensive, hereditary [[usufruct]] of the fief, founded and maintained on a relationship of mutual loyalty between the lord and the beneficiary. The Latin word ''beneficum'' implied, not only the actual estate or property, the fief - in Latin usually called the ''feodum'' - but also the associated legal relationship.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The owner was the so-called liege lord or feudal lord (German: '''''Lehnsherr''''' ''Lehnsgeber''; Latin: ''[[Dominium|dominus]] feudi'', ''senior''), who was usually the [[territorial lord]] or reigning monarch. The beneficiary was his vassal, liegeman or feudatory (German: '''''Vasall''''', ''[[Lehnsmann]]'', ''[[Knecht]]'', ''Lehenempfänger'' or ''Lehensträger''; Latin: ''vassus'' or ''vasallus''). Both parties swore an [[oath of fealty]] ('''''[[Lehnseid]]''''') to one another. The rights conferred on the vassal were so similar to actual possession that it was described as beneficial ownership (''[[dominium utile]]''), whereas the rights of the lord were referred to as direct ownership (''[[dominium directum]]'').

The fief (German: ''Lehen'' or '''''Lehnsgut''''') usually comprised an estate or a complex of estates, but also specified rights of use and rights of taxation or duties.

Linguistically the term ''Lehen'' is connected with the word ''leihen'', to lend or loan, and meant something like "loaned property" (c.f. the modern German ''Darlehen'', a loan), whilst the word ''feudum'', which some etymologists suggest comes from the Latin ''fides'' (loyalty), is more likely to be derived from the [[Old High German]] ''feo'', which meant ''Vieh'' i.e. "cattle", but later generally meant "goods" or "property".

The opposite of a fief was the freehold, [[allod]] or ''allodium'', which roughly corresponds to the present freehold estate.

An institution during the transition from feudal states to what is now the free ownership of property, was the ''allodifizierte Lehen'' ("allodified fief"), a fief in which the feudal lord gave up direct ownership - usually in  return for the payment of compensation or an allodified rent (''Allodifikationsrenten'') - but the vassal's ownership of the fief with an agreed agnatic succession - resembling a family [[entailed estate]] (''Familienfideikommiß'') - remained in place.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Types ===
There were numerous different types of feudal arrangement depending on regional tradition and the nature of feudal lordship (secular or ecclesiastical/monastic). The best-known of these were:

* '''''[[Afterlehen]]:''''' A [[mesne]] fief whereby the vassal awarded (parts of) his fief to a third party
* '''''Altarlehen:''''' A medieval proto-foundation (''proto-Stiftung'').  Its purpose was to allocate annual revenue from the property to a specific primate for his abbey or church
* '''''Beutellehen:''''' originally a ''Ritterlehen'' that was later rented to farmers
* '''''[[Burglehn]]:''''' a fief in payment for services as a [[castellan]] (''[[Burgmann]]'')
* '''''Erblehen:''''' a fief where the heirs of the vassal automatically inherited his rights and duties. The fief only first became hereditary through the conferral of a letter of hereditary right (''Erbrechtsbrief'') from the liege lord
* '''''Fahnlehen:''''' ("banner fief"&lt;ref name="Stieber"&gt;Stieber, Joachim. W. (1978). ''Pope Eugenius IV, the Council of Basel and the Secular and Ecclesiastical Authorities in the Empire'', E.J. Brill, Leiden, p. 124. {{ISBN|90-04-05240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;) a fief to a secular prince, in which banners symbolised the fief and the duties to the [[Heerbann]].
* '''''Falllehen:''''' a fief that expired on the death of the vassal. See ''Schupflehen''
* '''''Freistift:''''' a fief that could be cancelled at 12 months notice
* '''''Handlehen:''''' a fief awarded for a specified period or the life of the vassal. Originally: a fief sealed by a handshake instead of a formal oath of fealty.
* '''''Kunkellehen:'''''  a fief to a vassal who was a woman (also called a ''Weiberlehen'' or ''feudum femininum'')
* '''''Mannlehen/Mannslehen:''''' a fief to a vassal who had to be a man
* '''''ligisches Lehnswesen:''''' a fief in which the vassal was excluded from holding fiefs from other lords through a stronger contract between lord and vassal
* '''''Schildlehen:''''' similar to ''Fahnenlehen'', but where the vassal held the rank of count or lower
* '''''Schupflehen:''''' a fief that expired on the death of the vassal. His heirs were figuratively seen as "pushed" (Old German/Alemannic: ''geschupft'') out of the contract
* '''''Stiftslehen:''''' the fief was granted by an abbey, also called a ''Klosterlehen'' 
* '''''Weiberlehen:''''' see ''Kunkellehen''
* '''''Zepterlehen:''''' a fief to an ecclesiastical prince

== Feudal system ==
The king gave estates or appointments (''Ämter'') to upper or crown vassals (''Kronvasallen''), who, in turn, passed them on to lower vassals (''Untervasallen''). The lower vassals would then hire the land to be cultivated by unfree farmers. There were no feudal relationships between farmers and the lower vassals.

During the Middle Ages another structure developed in Germany, the so-called ''[[Heerschild]]ordnung'', a medieval feudal hierarchy:

* King (''König'')
* Ecclesiastical princes (''Geistliche Fürsten'')
* Secular, or lay, princes (''Weltliche Fürsten'')
* Counts and barons (''Grafen und Freiherren'')
* [[Ministeriales]] (''Ministerialen'' or ''Dienstmannen'')
* Vassals of the ministeriales (''Männer der Ministerialen'')
* Free knights (''Ritterbürtige Mannen'') (who could only receive a fief, not grant one)

Initially, only those of knightly birth were entitled to be enfeoffed, i.e. free knights who could bear arms and were in full possession of their title. Later, unfree ministeriales also rose to the knighthood. Vassalage consisted mainly of military campaigns (military service) and court duty (the presence of vassals at the court in order to offer advice). From court service, the state and imperial diets emerged. The fief was only given to the vassal to utilize; later, the vassal also became a sub-owner, but the feudal lord always retained the rights to this office. Eventually, the heritability of fiefs evolved later, but the landowner nevertheless remain the liege lord.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Roots of feudalism ==

=== Roman patronage ===
{{main|Patronage in ancient Rome}}

In [[Late Antiquity]], out of the Roman system of patronage (or clientage) and the clan (''[[Sippe]]'') relationships of the [[Migration Period]] (''Völkerwanderungszeit'') (Germanic kingdoms on Roman soil), relations between rulers and their subjects developed into a prevailing consensus that was commonplace and accepted.

In Roman culture, it was common for a patron (a wealthy Roman citizen) to automatically retain his freed [[slave]]s in a dependent relationship, known as patronage. In some cases, populations of conquered areas would become clients of the general who conquered the area. This required the client to accompany his patron to war and protect him if the latter so wished, to accompany him to court as a vocal supporter and, if the patron held public office, to act as his assistant and to accompany him on representational events in public.

In return, the patron had to ensure the legal and practical support of his client in all aspects of life. A Roman citizen, a non-Roman and even entire tribes in the Roman Empire could have a patron-client relationship.

In Late Antiquity, this form of relationship was increasingly adopted in rural areas, because the Roman nomenklatura increasingly saw their vast estates (''[[Latifundia]]'') as their refuge and also as economically important pillars, over which they sometimes even had their own jurisdiction and fortified prisons.
 
Clients at that time were usually bound to their patrons through the allocation of land.

=== Germanic clan system ===
During the latter years of the period of [[Sippe|clan society]] with Germanic kingdoms on Roman soil, it was common for all the land to belong to the [[king]]. Only he could distribute land to his subjects. These subjects were usually family members, warriors who had performed outstanding feats, and noblemen. This land did not become the property of the subject, but was handed over to him only ''in persona''. On the death of king or vassal, the land was [[de facto]] returned to the new king. Over time, a practice developed that the person [[enfeoffed]] with the land, together with his family, became the beneficiaries of the [[fief]] and remained permanently bound to it. Upon the death of one party, a new act of homage (''Lehnseid''), a formal legal ceremony, had to take place. These transitions were fluid and there were exceptions to the practice of [[enfeoffment]].

The vassal often enfeoffed the estate, usually divided into smaller parcels of land, to other lesser vassals, who in turn had to swear fealty to him. In return for the lease of land, the king could demand loyalty and allegiance from the vassal and his sub-vassals. This means that, in the event of war, they had to provide soldiers and assistance, or if money ran short or a ransom was needed, they were expected to support the king.

The Roman patron-client relationship and the early clan-based feudal relationship in the Germanic kingdoms merged during the early Middle Ages into the feudal law, or ''Lehnsrecht'', a legal and social set of relationships, which effectively formed a pyramid with the king at the top.

The enforcement of ''Lehnsrecht'' is associated with the reduced circulation of money in the [[Late Antiquity]] and [[Early Medieval]] periods. [[Money]] could not bind a [[vassal]] to a king, only land. Unlike money, this was plentiful.

Even kings (see [[Richard the Lionheart]] - compulsory allegiance) and at least in the early Middle Ages, the [[clergy]] (see [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]]-[[Salian dynasty|Salian]] [[imperial church]] system) could be vassals of a king or another king.

=== Emergence of feudal relationships ===
[[File:Lehnseid.png|thumb|Acceptain of the oath of fealty (''Lehnseid'') in 1512]]
Under the feudal system, various legal institutions came together during the [[Carolingian period]] that had previously existed independently. These institutions were:
* The ''antrustiones'' - these were the inner circle of the king's retinue; they were distinguished by the fact that a multiple of the usual [[weregild]] had to be paid to them.
* The ''vassi'' - free lords who could no longer look after for themselves were able to [[commend]] themselves into the hands of a more powerful lord, receiving sustenance and shelter in return for an obligation of loyalty and service. They did not lose their status as free lords through the [[Commendation ceremony|commendation]] ceremony, but the royal court continued to be responsible for them. The commendation was enacted by the so-called ''handgang'' ceremony, i.e. the future ''vassus'' put his hands, folded, into the hands of his lord, who then enclosed them. This gesture made the relationship of the two very clear.
* The ''beneficium'' (original meaning of "benefit") - in the early Middle Ages land was leased, but there were also cases where estates were granted without requiring recompense, for example under duress or to do someone a favour. The lord then remained the true owner of the land, but was no longer its beneficiary.

It was from the combination of these institutions, especially as more and more lords achieved high social position, that the feudal system emerged.
The ''handgang'', which together with the oath of loyalty (''Treueid''), became referred to as ''homagium'' (Latin), ''homage'' (French), or ''mannschaft'' (German), became the decisive legal device until well into the 12th century. Not until the spread of the system of legal deeds was the ''handgang'' dropped from the oath of allegiance, which was better recorded in writing.

[[Commendation ceremony|Commendation]]s were still carried out at all levels. In lower classes they were based on the [[manorial]] system (''Grundherrschaft''), at the high levels on feudalism (''Lehnswesen'').

The award of fiefs often replaced the remuneration for work. This was necessary because the [[monetary system]] necessary to make regular payments was still far too underdeveloped during the early Middle Ages.

=== Subsequent development ===
As the services of the vassal specifically included military service, under the Frankish monarchy the feudal system was for centuries the basis of the army as well as the social organization of the Holy Roman Empire. &lt;!-- (see [[Personenverbandsstaat]]) --&gt;

It was not only the king who acquired vassals in this way. He was soon imitated by secular and ecclesiastical magnates. Gradually, the principle of the heritability of fiefs was established along with the admissibility of passing them on as ''Afterlehen'' to sub-vassals. The latter were also declared as heritable in 1037 by [[Conrad II (HRR)|Conrad II]] in the ''[[constitutio de feudis]]''. So it came to pass that as early as the 12th century, all duchies and counties were awarded as fiefs.

Within each of these ecclesiastical and secular territories, however, there was a variety of types of feudalism. Not until the 13th century, did the importance of the feudal system decline, because instead of vassals (''Vassallen''), liegemen (''Dienstmannen'') - well-educated men (c.f. the development of the [[university]] system) - were appointed. The kings encouraged this development, for political reasons, and so strengthened [[territorial lordship]] (''Landesherrschaft''), which replaced the feudal system empire-wide. This strengthening of territorial rulers had an impact that could not be reversed, so that the power of the various principalities did not reduce, unlike the situation in France and England.

In England, feudal ties were abolished as early as the Revolution of 1649, and then by an express decree by Charles II in 1660. In France they were abolished by the decisions of the National Assembly on 4 and 5 August 1789. In Germany, the dissolution of feudal associations (''Lehnsverband'') was a long process. Legally, it was abolished ''inter alia'' by the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] acts, in the [[Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation]] and the [[Frankfurt Constitution]] of 1849. One of the last fiefs was awarded in 1835, when the ailing Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Schlitz, known as Görtz, was enfeoffed with the spring at [[Bad Salzschlirf|Salzschlirf]] and began to excavate it again. Those fiefs still in existence in the 20th century were abolished in 1947 by an [[Allied Control Council]] edict.

== Important principles of feudal law in the Holy Roman Empire ==
In general, the vassal (''Lehnsmann'') was granted land or [[Freihaus|free houses]] (''Freihäuser'') in return for his services. He could also provide services at the lord's residence and be accommodated there.  Most of these so-called ''servi non cassati'' were given a fief as soon as one became available.

Official positions (''Ämter'') and sovereign rights over a particular territory (feudal [[regalia]]) could be awarded as a fief. It was in this way that the [[House of Thurn and Taxis]] received its '''''Postlehen''''' or postal service rights. In addition, there were numerous enfeoffments of church rights, church fiefs (''[[Stift]]e'' or ''feudal ecclesiastica'') and enfeoffments of [[foundation (non-profit)|foundation]]s associated with an [[altar]] (''feudum altaragli''). Also, cash payments from the royal treasury or profits from certain duties could be awarded as a fief.

=== Feoffment ===
Feoffment (''constitutio feudi, infeudatio'') involved the vassal being formally seized of his fief through a [[commendation ceremony]]. In Frankish times, commendation centered around the so-called handclasping ceremony (''Handgang''):  the vassal clasped his hands together and placed them in the hands of his lord, who then clasped his hands around those of his vassal. He thereby symbolically received the protection of his new superior. From the end of the 9th century, this act was expanded to include an [[oath of allegiance]], which was usually sworn on a religious [[relic]]. The oath served to affirm the binding of the liegeman to his liege, but emphasized that the vassal had not lost his status as a free knight, because only the free could be bound by oath.

In the 11th century, the commendation ceremony required the liegeman to pay homage (''homagium'' or ''Mannschaft''), which involved the handclasping ceremony as well as a declaration of intent. The liege lord could also make a declaration, but he would often forego this. This was followed by the loyalty oath and sometimes a kiss. Since, in the Middle Ages, a binding legal act could be constituted by a symbolic action, an object was symbolically handed over in a process known as [[livery of seizin]] and could be a staff or a banner (called a ''Fahnenlehn''). The emperor could also symbolically hand over his sceptre (in the so-called ''Zepterlehen''). As literacy rose, a charter of feoffment was also made out as part of the act that, over time, listed the feoffed estate and benefits that the vassal was to receive in ever increasing detail.

In the late Middle Ages, an entry fee was demanded for feoffment, which was often based on the fief's annual income.

The fief (benefice) that the vassal received could be owned by the lord or have been granted in fee by another. Sometimes the vassal even sold or gifted over his possessions to the lord (''Lehnsauftragung'') and then received it back as a fief ([[Oblation (legal)|''oblatio feudi'']]). This was usually done in the hope that the liege lord could defend his estate better in the event of a dispute in the field or at court. The lord purchased or accepted the gift because he might have the intention or hope, for example, of merging unrelated fiefdoms into a whole and thus extending his sphere of influence, for example, in terms of jurisdiction, or the appointment of clergy.

=== Legal relationship between lords and vassals ===
From the 11th century, the obligations of vassals were usually described as ''auxilium et consilium'' (help and advice). ''Auxilium'' usually implied assistance in terms of military service that the vassal had to render. This could be unlimited, i.e. the vassal had to assist his lord in every conflict, or it could be limited in time, space and in the number of troops to be raised. With the advent of the mercenaries, the reliance on vassals became less important and their service increasingly took the form of administration and court duties. ''Consilium'' meant primarily the obligation to appear at imperial assemblies or ''[[Hoftag]]e''. Vassals whose feudal lord was not the king took part in the councils of their liege lords. They also had to administer justice over their subjects in the name of their master.

The vassal could even be required to pay money; though perhaps not to the extent of England, where military service became a requirement for war funds and the English king used the money to pay for his mercenaries. Monetary payments were also required in other cases, such as to pay a ransom for a captive lord, for the [[accolade]] of his eldest son, for the [[dowry]] of his eldest daughter, or for a journey to the [[Holy Land]].

The feudal lord could also demand recompense (''Lehnserneuerung'' or ''renovatio investiturae'') from his vassals if they lost their fief or upon changes of lord - changes of ruler at any level, local lord, prince or king (known as ''Herrenfall, Hauptfall, Thronfall'') - as well as changes of vassal (known as ''Lehnsfall, Vasallenfall'' or ''Mannfall, Nebenfall''). The latter had to submit a written application (''Lehnsmutung'') within a [[Year and a day rule|year and a day]] (actually 1 year, 6 weeks, 3 days) and ask for the renewal of his investiture, but this term could be extended by a decree from the lord (''Lehnsindult'').

Depending on [[local law]], the vassal might be liable, apart from the fee, for the renewal of the enfeoffment (called the ''Schreibschilling'' or ''Lehnstaxe''), to pay a special tax (the ''Laudemium, Lehnsgeld, Lehnsware'' or ''Handlohn''). Finally, in the event of a [[felony]] by the vassal, the lord could confiscate the fief under the so-called ''Privationsklage'' action or step in to prevent the deterioration of the estate, if necessary, by legal means. He could also assert his claim to ownership at any time against any unauthorized third parties.

The duties of the lords were less precisely defined, however, they were largely discharged on the handover of the fief. The vassal always had a claim to loyalty from his lord (''Lehnsprotektion'') and a breach of that by the lord meant the loss of his sovereignty over his vassal. The vassal had the "right of use" of the fief (the object of enfeoffment or  ''Lehnsobjekt''). The lord also had to represent his vassals in court.

=== Dissolution of a feudal relationship ===
Originally, a lord-vassal tie (''Lehnsbindung'') was a lifelong, faithful relationship that could end only on death. It was also inconceivable that someone could be the vassal of more than one lord. In fact, multiple vassalage soon emerged and loosened the duty of loyalty for the liegeman (''Lehnsmann'') considerably. Also, the opportunity to inherit a fief diminished the ability of the lord to intervene and loosened the personal loyalty of liegemen. Over time, the importance of fiefdoms increased more and more, whilst the duty of loyalty faded increasingly into the background. In the end, a fief was simply an estate for which the heir had to perform a certain ceremony.

== Summary ==
In summary, the feudal system was based on two main components - the personal and the material elements.

Personal element:
The lord and vassal committed themselves to mutual loyalty. The visible expression of this commitment was the act of the vassal placing his hands in those of his lord (''handgang'' - comparable with today's handshake, except that the ''handgang'' symbolized a hierarchical relation).

Material element:
Based on the pledge of loyalty between them, the lord made land available to the vassal. The vassal was obliged, in return, to render various services and taxes.

== Family, house and place names ==
An echo of the old feudal system in Europe is found in family names such as [[Lehner]], Lechner, Lehmann, Lehle, Horrigan and Lenherr as well as in numerous house and even place names, that even today have the term ''Lehen'' in the names (see a list at [[Lehen (disambiguation)]]).

Men and women use [[social network service]]s (SNSs) differently and with different frequencies.  In general, several researchers have found that women tend to use SNSs more than men and for different and more social purposes.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Historical connections==
Technologies, including communications technologies, have a long history of shaping and being shaped by the gender of their users. Although technologies used to perform housework have an apparent historical connection to gender in many cultures,&lt;ref name=MacKenzie_and_Wajcman&gt;{{cite book |first1=Donald |last1=MacKenzie |first2=Judy |last2=Wajcman |title= The Social Shaping of Technology: How the Refrigerator Got its Hum |year=1985 |publisher=Open University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; a more ready connection to SNSs may be drawn with [[telephone]]s as a communications technology readily and widely available in the home. Telephone use has long had gendered connections ranging from the widespread assumption that women simply talk more than men, and the employment of women as [[switchboard operator|telephone operators]]. In particular, young women have been closely associated with extensive and trivial use of the telephone for purely social purposes.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book |first=Claude |last=Fischer |title=America Calling: A Social History of the Telephone to 1940 |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kearney&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. C. Kearney |year=2005 |title=Birds on the Wire |journal=Cultural Studies |volume=19 |issue=5 |pages=568–601 |doi=10.1080/09502380500365499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, women's use of and influence on the development of computers has been trivialized&lt;ref name=Light&gt;{{cite journal |author=Light, J. |year=1999 |title=When Computers were Women |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=455–83 |doi=10.1353/tech.1999.0128}}&lt;/ref&gt; while significant developments in computers have been masculinized.&lt;ref name=Jonsson&gt;{{cite book |first=F. |last=Jonsson |year=2007 |chapter=The Absence of Hackerettes in the Culture of Programming | editor1-first=M. S. |editor1-last=Elm |editor2-first=J. |editor2-last=Sundén |title=Cyberfeminism in Northern Lights: Digital Media and Gender in a Nordic Context |pages=243–264 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the idea that there may be both real and perceived differences in how men and women use SNSs – and that those uses may shape the SNSs – is neither new nor surprising and has historical analogues.

There is historical and contemporary evidence that current fears about young girls' online safety have historical antecedents such as [[telegraph]]s and telephones. Further, in many cases those historical reactions resulted in restrictions of girls' use of technology to protect them from predators, molesters, and other criminals threatening their innocence. Like current fears focused on computer use, particularly SNSs and other communication media, these fears are most intense when the medium enters the home. These fears have the potential to – at least temporarily – overwhelm the positive and empowering uses of these technologies.&lt;ref name=Cassel_and_Cramer&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Cassel |first1=J. |last2=Cramer |first2=M. |editor-first=T. |editor-last=McPherson |title=Digital Youth, Innovation, and the Unexpected |publisher=MIT Press |year=2008 |pages=53–75 |chapter=High tech or high risk: Moral panics about girls online}}
&lt;/ref&gt; These historical fears are echoed in contemporary media accounts of youths' use of SNSs.

Finally, the histories of some SNSs themselves have ties with gender. For example, [[gay men]] were one of the earliest groups to join and use the early SNS [[Friendster]].&lt;ref name=boyd_and_Ellison&gt;{{cite journal |first1=danah |last1=boyd |first2=Nicole |last2=Ellison |title=Social Network Sites: Definition, History, and Scholarship |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/boyd.ellison.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences==

===Predilection for usage===
Many studies have found that women are more likely to use either specific SNSs such as [[Facebook]]&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross&gt;{{cite journal|author=Acquisti, A., &amp; Gross, R. |year=2006 |title=Imagined communities: Awareness, information sharing, and privacy on the Facebook |journal=Privacy Enhancing Technologies |pages=36–58 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/gx00n8nh88252822/ |doi=10.1007/11957454_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Joinson&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joinson, A.

The gap in gender differences has become less apparent in LinkedIn. In 2015 about 26 percent of online men and 25% of online women used the business-and employee-oriented networking site.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/28/men-catch-up-with-women-on-overall-social-media-use/|title=Men catch up with women on overall social media use|date=2015-08-28|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-09-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers who have examined the gender of users of multiple SNSs have found contradictory results. Hargittai's groundbreaking 2007 study examining race, gender, and other differences between undergraduate college student users of SNSs found that women were not only more likely to have used SNSes than men but that they were also more likely to have used many different services, including Facebook, MySpace, and Friendster; these differences persisted in several models and analyses. Although she only surveyed students at one institution – the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] – Hargittai selected that institution intentionally as "an ideal location for studies of how different kinds of people use online sites and services."&lt;ref name=Hargittai&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hargittai, E. |year=2007 |title=Whose space? Differences among users and non-users of social network sites |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=13 |issue=1 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://jcmc.indiana.edu/vol13/issue1/hargittai.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, data collected by the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] found that men were more likely to have multiple SNS profiles. Although the sample sizes of the two surveys are comparable – 1,650 Internet users in the Pew survey&lt;ref name=Lenhart /&gt; compared with 1,060 in Hargittai's survey&lt;ref name=Hargittai /&gt; – the data from the Pew survey are newer and arguably more representative of the entire adult United States population.&lt;ref name=Pew_methodology&gt;{{cite web|title=IRB Information |author=[[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/About-Us/Our-Research/IRB-Information.aspx |accessdate=April 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429200237/http://www.pewinternet.org/Static-Pages/About-Us/Our-Research/IRB-Information.aspx |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; Pinterest, Facebook, and Instagram attract more females. Picture sharing sites overall are very popular among women. Pinterest alone attracts three times as many female users than male. Although use of Pinterest by men has increased from 5% in 2012. Facebook attracts about 77% of women online. Instagram is also more likely to attract women. Men are more likely to participate in online forums like Reddit, Digg or Slashdot. One in five men claim to be a part of an online forum.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt;

===Uses===

In general, women seem to use SNSs more to explicitly foster social connections. A study conducted by Pew research centers found that women were more avid users of social media.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; In November 2010, the gap between men and women was as high as 15%.&lt;ref name="Pew Research Center"/&gt; Female participants in a multi-stage study conducted in 2007 to discover the motivations of Facebook users scored higher on scales for social connection and posting of photographs.&lt;ref name=Joinson /&gt; Studies have also been conducted on the differences between females and males with regards to blogging. The Pew Research Center found that younger females are more likely blog than males their own age, even males that are older than them.&lt;ref&gt;Lenhart, A., Madden, M., Macgill, A., &amp; Smith, A. (2007). Teens and social media. Washington, DC: Pew Internet and American Life Project. Retrieved February 27, 2017, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2007/Teens-andSocial-Media.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a study of [[blog]]s maintained in MySpace, women were found to be more likely to not only write blogs but also write about family, romantic relationships, friendships, and health in those blogs.&lt;ref name=Jones_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Jones, S., Millermaier, S., Goya-Martinez, M., &amp; Schuler, J. |year=2008 |title=Whose space is MySpace? A content analysis of MySpace profiles |journal=First Monday |volume=13 |issue=9 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/2202/2024 |doi=10.5210/fm.v13i9.2202}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A study of [[Sweden|Swedish]] SNS users found that women were more likely to have expressions of friendship, specifically in the areas of (a) publishing photos of their friends, (b) specifically naming their best friends, and (c) writing poems to and about their friends. Women were also more likely to have expressions related to family relationships and romantic relationships. One of the key findings of this research is that those men who do have expressions of romantic relationships in their profile had expressions just as strong as the women. However, the researcher speculated that this may be in part due to a desire to publicly express [[heterosexual]] behaviors and mannerisms instead of merely expressing romantic feelings.&lt;ref name=Sveningsson&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Sveningsson Elm, M. |year=2007 |title=Gender stereotypes and young people's presentations of relationships in a Swedish Internet community |journal=YOUNG |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=145–167 |doi=10.1177/110330880701500203}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale study of gender differences in MySpace found that both men and women tended to have a majority of female Friends, and both men and women tended to have a majority of female "Top" Friends in the site.&lt;ref name=Thelwall1&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M. |year=2008 |title= Social networks, gender and friending: An analysis of MySpace member profiles |journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=59 |issue=8 |pages=1321–1330 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/MySpace_preprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.20835}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A later study found women to author disproportionately many (public) comments in MySpace,&lt;ref name=Thelwall2&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M. |year=2009 |title= Homophily in MySpace|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=219–231 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/MySpaceHomophilypreprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.20978}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
but an investigation into the role of emotion in public MySpace comments found that women both give and receive stronger positive emotion.&lt;ref name=Thelwall3&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Thelwall, M., Wilkinson, D., Uppal, S. |year=2010 |title=Data mining emotion in social network communication: Gender differences in MySpace|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=190–199 |url=http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/~cm1993/papers/DataMiningEmotionSNS_preprint.doc |doi=10.1002/asi.21180}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
It was hypothesised that women are simply more effective at using [[social networking sites]] because they are better able to harness positive emotion.

A study focused on the influence of gender and personality on individuals’ use of online social networking websites such as Facebook, reported that men use social networking sites with the intention of forming new relationships, whereas, women use them more for relationship maintenance. (Muscanell and Guadagno, 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Muscanell N.L., Guadagno R.E. | year = 2012 | title = Make new friends or keep the old: Gender and personality differences in social networking use | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 107–112 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.08.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In addition to this, women are more likely to use Facebook or MySpace to compare themselves to others and also to search for information. Men, however, are more likely to look at other people's profiles with in the intention to find friends. (Haferkamp et al., 2012) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haferkamp N., Eimler S.C., Papadakis A.M., Kruck J.V. | year = 2012 | title = Men are from Mars, women are from Venus?

[[Internet privacy|Privacy]] has been the primary topic of many studies of SNS users, and many of these studies have found differences between male and female SNS users, although some studies have found results contradictory to those found in other studies.

Some researchers have found that women are more protective of their personal information and more likely to have private profiles.&lt;ref name=Joinson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Caverlee_and_Webb /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Lewis, K., Kaufman, J., &amp; Christakis, N. |year=2008 |title=The taste for privacy: An analysis of college student privacy settings in an online social network |journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=79–100 |doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2008.01432.x}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that women are less likely to post some types of information. Acquisti and Gross found that women in their sample were less likely to reveal their [[sexual orientation]], personal address, or cell phone number.&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross /&gt; This is similar to Pew Internet &amp; American Life research of children users of SNSs that found that boys and girls presented different views of privacy and behaviors, with girls being more concerned about and restrictive of information such as city, town, last name, and cell phone number that could be used to locate them.&lt;ref name=Lenhart_and_Madden&gt;{{cite web|author=Lenhart, A., &amp; Madden, M. |year=2007 |title=Teens, privacy &amp; online social networks |publisher=[[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Privacy_SNS_Report_Final.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219174827/http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Teens_Privacy_SNS_Report_Final.pdf |archivedate=February 19, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; At least one group of researchers has found that women are less likely to share information that "identifies them directly – last name, cell phone number, and address or home phone number," linking that resistance to women's greater concerns about "[[cyberstalking]]", "[[cyberbullying]]", and security problems.&lt;ref name=Salaway_and_Caruso /&gt;

Despite these concerns about privacy, researchers have found that women are more likely to maintain up-to-date photos of themselves.&lt;ref name=Kolek&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Kolek, E. A., &amp; Saunders, D. |title=Online disclosure: An empirical examination of undergraduate Facebook profiles |journal=NASPA Journal |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=1–25 |year=2008 |doi=10.2202/1949-6605.1905}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strano&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Strano, M. M. |year=2008 |title=User descriptions and interpretations of self-presentation through Facebook profile images |journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace |volume=2 |issue=2 |accessdate=February 20, 2009 |url=http://www.cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2008110402&amp;article=(search%20in%20Issues)}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Kolek and Saunders found in their sample of college student Facebook users that women were more likely to not only post a photograph of themselves in their profile but that they were more likely to have a publicly viewable Facebook account (a contradictory finding compared to many other studies), post photos, and post photo albums.&lt;ref name=Kolek /&gt;

Women were more likely to have: (a) a publicly viewable Facebook account, (b) more photo albums, (c) more photos, (d) a photo of themselves as their profile picture, (e) positive references to alcohol, partying, or drugs, and (f) more positive references to or about the institution or institution-related activities. In general, women were more likely to disclose information about themselves in their Facebook profile, with the primary exception of sharing their telephone number.&lt;ref name=Kolek /&gt; Similarly, female respondents to Strano's study were more likely to keep their profile photo recent and choose a photo that made them appear attractive, happy, and fun-loving. Citing several examples, Strano opined that there may also be a difference in how men and women Facebook users display and interpret profile photos depicting relationships.&lt;ref name=Strano /&gt;

Privacy has also been a concern for the SnapChat app, which allows you to send messages either text or photo or video which then disappear. One study has shown that security is not a major concern for the majority of users and that most do not use Snapchat to send sensitive content (although up to 25% may do so experimentally). As part of their research almost no statistically significant gender differences were found.&lt;ref&gt;Roesner, F., Gill, B. T., &amp; Kohno, T. (2014). Sex, Lies, Or kittens? investigating the use of snapchat’s self-destructing messages. In ''Financial Cryptography and Data Security - 18th International Conference, FC 2014, Revised Selected Papers.'' (Vol. 8437, pp. 64-76). (Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics); Vol. 8437). Springer Verlag. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-662-45472-5_5&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyberbullying'''

Past research carried out to investigate if there are any gender differences in cyber-bulling has found that boys commit more cyber verbal bullying, cyber forgery and more violence based on hidden identity or presenting themselves as other person. (Sincek 2014).&lt;ref&gt;Šincek, D., 2014, January. Gender differences in cyber-bullying. In International Multidisciplinary Scientific Conference SOCIAL SCIENCES AND ARTS SGEM2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities==
Although men and women users of SNSs exhibit different behavior and motivations, they share some similarities. For example, one study that examined the veracity of information shared on SNSs by college students found that men and women were as likely to "provide accurate and complete information about their birthday, schedule of classes, partner's name, AIM, or political views."&lt;ref name=Acquisti_and_Gross /&gt;

In contradiction to several of the studies described above that found that women are more likely to be SNS users, at least one very reputable study has found that men and women are equally likely to be SNS users. Data gathered in December 2008 by the [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]] showed that the SNS users in their sample were equally divided among men and women.&lt;ref name=Lenhart /&gt; As mentioned above, the data from the Pew survey are newer and arguably more representative of the entire adult United States population&lt;ref name="Pew_methodology" /&gt; than the data in much of the previously described research.

==Traditional gender roles==
Some studies have found that traditional gender roles are present in SNSs, with men in this study conforming to traditional views of [[masculinity]] and the women to traditional views of [[femininity]].&lt;ref name=Martinez_Aleman_and_Wartman /&gt; Qualitative work with college student SNS users by Martínez Alemán and Wartman&lt;ref name=Martinez_Aleman_and_Wartman&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Martínez Alemán |first1=A. M. |last2=Wartman |first2=K. L. |year=2009 |title=Online social networking on campus: Understanding what matters in student culture |publisher=Routledge}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Managgo ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Manago_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |author=Manago, A. M., Graham, M. B., Greenfield, P. M., &amp; Salimkhan, G. |year=2008 |title=Self-presentation and gender on MySpace |journal=Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology |volume=29 |pages=446–458 |doi=10.1016/j.appdev.2008.07.001 |issue=6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; have found similar results for both Facebook and MySpace users. Moreover, the work by Managgo ''et al.'' discovered not only traditional gender roles and images but sexualisation of women users of MySpace.&lt;ref name=Manago_et_al /&gt; Similarly, research into the impact of comments in the profile of a Facebook users on that user's perceived attractiveness revealed a "sexual double standard", wherein negative statements resulted in male profile owners being judged more attractive and female profile owners less attractive.&lt;ref name=Walther_et_al&gt;
{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2007.00312.x |author=Walther, J. B., Van Der Heide, B., Kim, S., Westerman, D., &amp; Tong, S.

&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, at least one study has found that men and women SNS users both left textual clues about their gender.&lt;ref name=Caverlee_and_Webb /&gt;

==Other gender identities in social networking==
In February 2014, Facebook announced the vast expansion of options for choosing gender identities to list on profiles, ranging to up to 56 gender identity choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/apnewsbreak-gender-options-facebook-users-22501422|title=Technology and Science News - ABC News|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=567587973337709|title=Timeline Photos - Facebook Diversity - Facebook|work=facebook.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Facebook followed up with allowing gender-neutral relationship identities for identifying family members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/08/28/facebook-adds-gender-neutral-family-relationship-settings|title=Facebook Adds Gender-Neutral Family Relationship Settings|author=[[Parker Marie Molloy]]|work=Advocate.com|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5208">'''Global civics''' suggests to understand [[civics]] in a global sense as a [[social contract]] among all [[world citizen]]s in an age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advocates of the notion attempt to demonstrate that it is possible to imagine global civics. According to this notion, in an increasingly interdependent world, the [[world citizen]]s need a compass that would frame mindsets on a global scale, and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility related to specific world issues such as environmental problems and nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary? Feasible?| journal = Global Policy| date = June 2010| url = http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/articles/international-law-and-human-rights/global-civics-necessary-feasible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==

The term '''global civics''' was first coined by Hakan Altinay, a nonresident senior fellow with the Global Economy and Development program at the [[Brookings Institution]], in a working paper published in March 2010. The concept builds upon the basic tenets behind [[global ethics]], [[global justice]] and [[world citizenship]], inviting everyone to question their increasingly important role in a highly interdependent world. In early 2011, Altinay published ''Global Civics: Responsibilities and Rights in an Interdependent World,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title =Global Civics: Rights and Responsibilities in an Interdependent World| last=Altinay| first=Hakan| year = 2011 | publisher= Brookings Institution Press | location= Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a book of articles on global civics put forth by academics and intellectuals all around the world.

==Objections to the concept==
Opponents of the global civics concept argue that even a modest level of exercising responsibility towards all the people living in the world is so overwhelming and nearly impossible to achieve. These arguments also posit that [[civics]] assumes an effective state and enforcement. The claim goes that since there is no such thing as a [[world government]], global civics implementation is not feasible. Also, it has been suggested that superpowers of the world are selfish and dangerous nations, and that they do not feel constrained by international legitimacy and laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dangerous Nations|last= Kagan|first= Robert|year= 2006 | publisher= Alfred A. Knopf | location= New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the critics claim that any experience of pan-global solidarity among human beings cannot form the basis of constellation of rights and responsibilities as it is nascent at best and the experience of being a global citizen is a privilege restricted to international elites and a few activists.&lt;ref name = feasible/&gt;

==The role of universities==

The proponents of global civics also suggest that university campuses play a vital role in spreading a thorough understanding of how today's global world functions and contributes toward preparation of future generations for life in an interdependent world. This view calls for visionary universities that could successfully "provide their students with the forums and the tools to discuss and figure out what their responsibilities are to their fellow human beings." &lt;ref name = case/&gt;

==Guest interviews==
The on-line site also contains a number of highlighted guest interviews with selected individuals, each well established and prominent in their field of science, with the aim being for them to act as inspiration to young students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.com/events/sciencefair/blog.html&lt;/ref&gt; The individuals chosen include [[Mitch Resnick]], [[Spencer Wells]], [[Kevin Warwick]], and [[Mariette DiChristina]].

==2011 winners==

Shree Bose, a 17-year-old girl in Texas, won the grand prize and $50,000 for her research on the chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, that is commonly taken by women with ovarian cancer, tackling the problem of cancer cells growing resistant to cisplatin over time.

Naomi Shah of Portland, OR, won the age 15–16 category with a study of the effects of air quality on lungs, particularly for people who have asthma. Ms. Shah recruited 103 test subjects, performed 24-hour air quality measurements at their homes and workplaces and had each blow into a device that measured the force of their breath.

Lauren Hodge of York, PA, won the age 13–14 category for research on whether marinades reduce the amount of cancer-causing compounds produced by the grilling of [[meat]]. She found that [[lemon juice]] and brown sugar cut the level of carcinogens sharply, while [[soy sauce]] increased them.

People around the world (90 countries) had the opportunity to vote for their favorite projects in Google’s online voting gallery. Google has had more than 100,000 votes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/05/votes-are-in-for-google-science-fair.html |title= The Votes Are in for the Google Science Fair Finalists and People’s Choice Award Winner}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the competition was really tight.  Nimal Subramanian won the People’s Choice Award for receiving the most among the 60 semi-finalists. The public really loved Nimal's project on Cancer Busters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN2R4wGHAao |title= Cancer Buster – Effect of Anti-Cancer Agents on In Vitro Germination and Protein Level (project video)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nimal received a $10,000 scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/project-302852-science-irvine.html |title= Irvine Student Wins $10,000 Google Science Award|work= [[The Orange County Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 winners==
[[Brittany Wenger]], who was 17, won the grand prize with her "Global Neural Network Cloud Service for Breast Cancer". Designed to noninvasively diagnose malignant cancerous tumors, it successfully detected over 99% of malignant breast tumors in a test set. She received $50,000, a trip to the Galapagos Islands, mentoring and internship opportunities for winning the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/teenager-builds-cancer-detecting-artificial-brain-120725.html#mkcpgn=rssnws1|title=Teenager Builds Cancer-Detecting Artificial Brain: Discovery News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iván Hervías Rodríguez, Marcos Ochoa, and Sergio Pascual, all of Spain, won the 15-16 age group using microscopy to examine microscopic creatures in aquatic ecosystems.

Jonah Kohn won the age 13-14 group by designing and building a device designed to enhance the listening experience of those with hearing loss. His device attached to different parts of the body, translating sound into tactile stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/07/24/winners-of-the-2012-google-science-fair/ |title=Winners of the 2012 Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013==
The winners of the 2013 Google Science Fair were:

13-14 age category: Viney Kumar (Australia) — The PART (Police and Ambulances Regulating Traffic) Program. Viney’s project looked for new ways to provide drivers with more notice when an emergency vehicle is approaching, so they can take evasive action to get out of the emergency vehicle’s way.

15-16 age category: [[Ann Makosinski]] (Canada) — The Hollow Flashlight. Using Peltier tiles and the temperature difference between the palm of the hand and ambient air, Ann designed a flashlight that provides bright light without batteries or moving parts.

17-18 age category Grand Prize Winner: Eric Chen (USA) — Computer-aided Discovery of Novel Influenza Endonuclease Inhibitors to Combat Flu Pandemic. Combining computer modeling and biological studies, Eric’s project looks at influenza endonuclease inhibitors as leads for a new type of anti-flu medicine, effective against all influenza viruses including pandemic strains.

==2014==
The 2014 Google Science Fair started accepting entries on February 12, 2014 and the entries closed on May 13, 2014. And the results for the local, regional and Science in Action award nominees were declared. The Grand Prize was won by three girls from Ireland, [[Ciara Judge]] (16), Emer Hickey (16) and Sophie Healey (17). They were the first group winners of the competition and the youngest winners to date (they also won the 15-16 age category prize). Their project was entitled 'Combating the Global Food Crisis: Diazatroph Bacteria as a Cereal Crop Growth Promoter.'

The 13-14 age category was won by Mihir Garimella (14) from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania with a project titled 'Fruit-fly Inspired Robots.' Hayley Todesco (17) of Canada won the 17-18 age category with her project titled 'Cleaning up Oil Sands Waste.'

Along with the overall prizes for each category, a number of special awards were also announced. Kenneth Shinozuka (15) was declared as the Science In Action Award winner in recognition of the practical potential of his project 'Wearable Sensors for Aging Society.'

==2016==

The 2016 Google Science Fair closed its entries on May 17, 2016, the Global 16 Finalist were announced on August 11, 2016. The final event took place during 24 to 27 September 2016 at Mountain View, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Science Fair Awards Show 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZSmqjtgkmo|website=You Tube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen finalists competed for top five awards. The first two rounds had two age groups 13-15 and 16-18. However, unlike previous years, top awards during the finalist event did not distinguish between the two age groups of the previous rounds, thus making it particularly challenging event for the contestant compared to all previous years.

The Grand Prize was won by [[Kiara Nirghin]] (16) of South Africa for her project 'Fighting Drought with Fruit'.&lt;ref&gt;'{{cite web|title= Combatting drought with a Low-Cost, biodegradable Superabsorbent Polymer made out of Orange Peels|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/deb654bce83b15eed364f52fa8685634649014602eca78858c58fec00aa6041a|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lego Education Builder award was won by Anushka Naiknaware (13) of United States, the youngest contestant to win a top award ever, for 'Smart Wound Care for the Future'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fractal inspired Chitosan and Carbon Nanoparticle Based Biocompatible Sensor for Wound Management|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/562f25503d252660ac0e8309b7711f3fc2ef084c0fa3598a7a7cf9377fc8adaa|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Geographic Explorer award was won by Mphatso Simbao (18) of Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheap production of nitrogen pesticides and fertilizers through hydrolysis of plant protein for rural use|url=https://www.googlesciencefair.com/projects/en/2016/ae920a381dfc15613b9d8f530d904301ef5b23158fd60c5dc33af8d7a6d98d98|website=Google Science Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scientific American Innovator Award was won by a team of three for 'Fighting Foam Waste with Recycled Filters' from the US [Ashton (14), Luke (14) and Julia (14)].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4672">'''Hybrid navigation''' is the simultaneous use of more than one [[navigation system]] for location data determination, needed for [[navigation]]. By using multiple systems at once, the accuracy as a whole is improved. Especially for [[autonomous car|self-driving cars]], the exact and continuous knowledge of the navigating object's location is essential.&lt;ref name=HNN1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golem.de/news/autonomes-fahren-wer-hat-die-besten-karten-1509-115506.html|title=AUTONOMES FAHREN: Wer hat die besten Karten?|editor=golem | author= Friedhelm Greis | date=2015-09-02 | language=de| accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
&lt;!-- need ref to support that GPS is the main/best/most-general one and others are only added to augment it --&gt;
[[GPS]] or other satellite based systems ([[GLONASS]], [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|GALILEO]], [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BEIDOU]], [[Quasi-Zenith Satellite System|QZSS]]) provide a way to learn one's location, but these methods require [[free field]] conditions in order to receive the radio signal. Various satellite systems are subject to switching-off or reduction of data precision by the company or government that runs them.&lt;ref name=AAHN1 /&gt; They are also prone to intentional or unintentional disturbances. Even passing through a tunnel or a garage interrupts the data flow. In situations where the signal cannot be received reliably, alternate sources of location data are needed. Combining GPS with other methods can avoid these limitations, but each method has its own specific limitations. A hybrid system provides [[fault tolerance]] for each underlying method and improves the overall precision of the result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sanborn.com/highly-automated-driving-maps-for-autonomous-vehicles/| title=HIGHLY AUTOMATED DRIVING (HAD) MAPS FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES| accessdate=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid system needs to decide how to choose among the different methods at any given time. One solution is a triple configuration, allowing 'result voting' for data collecting systems.&lt;ref  name="AAHN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/2145 | title=Aviation Applications: Hybrid Navigation Techniques and Safety-of-Life Requirements |author=Bestmann, vonWulfen, Hecker, Kneissl, Kropp | date=August 2010 | accessdate= 2016-07-17 | language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICON1&gt;{{cite book|title=Multiple criteria decision making : proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference |editor1= Günter Fandel|editor2=Tomas Gal, Thomas Hanne |author=Johannes Jahn|chapter=Optimality Conditions in Set Valued Vector Optimation |pages=22 |location=New York |publisher= Springer-Verlag |date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Alternate systems that supply navigational data include:
* [[Inertial navigation system]]s. This system determines location by summing the movement vectors from start of the trip or some other [[waypoint]] whose location is well-defined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydro-international.com/content/article/how-does-inertial-navigation-work |title=How Does Inertial Navigation Work? |editor= Hydro International|date= 2011-01-27 |author=Leendert Dorst | language=en|accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Incremental sensors. This system uses vehicle speed data supplied by a [[Fleet Management System]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honeynav.com/etak/Etak%20paper%20RIN%20York%201985.pdf|title=NAV85 Papers|author=Stanley K.

* [[Differential Global Positioning System|Differential GPS]]. This system uses [[terrestrial radio]] transmitters with well-defined locations that broadcast information about how accurate the GPS signals are at identifying the locations of these transmitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southernavionics.com/blog/bid/43197/What-is-DGPS-or-Differential-GPS|title=What is DGPS or Differential GPS?|author= Brooks Goodhue | date= 2011-05-09 |language=en| accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an index of articles related to the issue of [[feminism]], [[women's liberation]], the [[women's movement]], and [[women's rights]].

&lt;!--
EDITORS: For almost any entry longer than one word, consider adding a similar entry at the alphabetical position for another keyword in the article title. For example, [[Feminist archaeology]] is indexed under [[Index of feminism articles#F|"F"]] and also under [[Index of feminism articles#A|"A"]] for [[Feminist archaeology|Archaeology, feminist]]. Also consider more than one additional position for one article, if the title has enough words that users might look for. For example, [[Equal Rights Amendment]], also known by the abbreviation "ERA", is indexed under [[Index of feminism articles#E|"E"]] twice, [[Index of feminism articles#R|"R"]], and [[Index of feminism articles#A|"A"]].

If deleting from one position, delete from others, too.

If changing in one position, change in others, too.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2629">'''Irene Ighodaro''' (16 May 1916 – 29 November 1995) was a [[Sierra Leone]]an physician and social reformer. She was president of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] of Nigeria. She was also the first President of the Medical Association of Nigerian Women. She was notable for being one of the first female physicians in [[West Africa]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Life==
Ighodaro was born Irene Elizabeth Beatrice Wellesley-Cole in [[Freetown, Sierra Leone]], one of seven children of engineer Wilfred Wellesley-Cole. Her elder brother was physician [[Robert Wellesley-Cole]]. She attended the Government Model School and graduated from the Annie Walsh Memorial School. She decided to become a physician after nursing her mother through a terminal illness. She received her M.B.B.S. from the [[University of Durham]] in England. She later married Samuel Ighodaro of [[Benin|Benin City]] with whom she had four children; Tony, Wilfred, Ayo, and Yinka. They moved to Nigeria, where he became a judge on the High Court of Midwestern Nigeria.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=Barbara|title=Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia|date=2002|publisher=Yorkin Publications|location=Waterford, Connecticut|isbn=0-7876-4074-3|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591304351.html|chapter=Ighodaro, Irene (1916–1995)|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ighodaro maintained a private medical practice and was a member of a number of western Nigerian medical advisory committees. She consulted the [[World Health Organization]] on child and maternal health and authored the book ''Baby's First Year''. She also chaired the University of Benin Teaching Hospital's board of management and was a member of the YWCA World Executive Committee.&lt;ref name="Morgan"/&gt; She was made a [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in 1958.&lt;ref name="Morgan"/&gt;

Ighodaro died on 29 November 1995.&lt;ref name="Morgan"/&gt;

'''Social nudity''' is the [[Nudity|nude]] appearance of the [[human body]] in relatively public settings [[Sex segregation|not restricted by gender]]. This occurs both in [[public space]]s and on [[commercial property]], such as at a [[Naturism|naturist resort]]. It is sometimes controversial for addressing and exploring a myriad of sometimes [[taboo]] subjects, [[stereotype]]s, and [[mores]]. Although many issues are discussed, it does not necessarily mean that they occur frequently.

Some isolated [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] nudity still exists in the [[tropics]], though this way of life is highly endangered, as is male [[nude swimming]] in public, which used to be very commonplace in [[Western civilization]]. Modern European-style naturism began around the turn of the [[20th century]] in [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]] and [[Northern Germany]], and it was later adopted in America as well.

==Terminology==
[[File:Woodstock Poland 2014 -- FKK.jpg|thumb|right|Nude men at the [[Woodstock Festival (Poland)|Woodstock Festival]] in Poland.]]
{{Further|Naturism#Terminology}}

The terms '''[[naturism]]''', '''[[Naturism|nudism]]''' and '''social nudity''' are generally defined as the practice of going [[Nudity|nude]], especially in a mixed social setting. The terms naturism and nudism generally also mean that the activities are done in non-[[human sexuality|sexualized]], [[family-friendly]] contexts.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The usage and definition of these terms varies both geographically and historically. In his book, ''Cinema Au Naturel'', author [[Mark Storey]] states: "two related terms that we will continually run across are ''nudist'' and ''naturist''. Although the meanings of the two terms are virtually identical, they often have different [[connotations]] for those who prefer one to the other. In America, people who believe that it is physically, socially, emotionally, and perhaps spiritually healthy to go about fully nude individually and in groups of mixed gender, wherever the weather permits and others are not offended, generally refer to themselves as "nudists". In Europe, such people more often than not, refer to themselves as "naturists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cinema Au Naturel: A History of Nudist Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LOMNAAAACAAJ|first=Mark|last=Storey|publisher=Naturist Education Foundation|year=2003|isbn=9780974084404|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clothing optional===
Most nudist resort require full-nudity only for the swimming pool, sauna, Jacuzzi, hot tub bath, with a clothing optional policy elsewhere. Full nudity requirements at free public naturist beaches are not common.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Advocates of full nudity maintain it provides a better sense of equality when everyone is without clothing. First-timers to a resort may be uncomfortable with other clothed people around and feel "naked." Since naturism is not a [[spectator sport]], anyone not already nude would be disallowed entry (except the periphery for undressing).{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

As the French [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] [[Marc-Alain Descamps]] wrote (translated): The reciprocal sight of complete nudity defuses the [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]]—[[voyeur]] relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Vivre Nu: Psychosociologie du Naturisme, Marc-Alain Descamps, Edition Trismégiste, 1987, {{ISBN|2-86509-026-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sites welcome everyone whether dressed or nude (subject to other miscellaneous rules and requirements)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluebonnetnudistpark.com/faq|title=Faqs|publisher=BlueBonnet Resorts Inc.|author=|date=|website=www.bluebonnetnudistpark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal concerns==
===Laws===
Many countries or provinces/states within a country have laws which adversely affect naturists. These laws are often intended to address "indecent exposure", but are so broadly written that they criminalize ordinary, non-sexual nudity. [[Muslim-majority countries]] may prohibit exposing areas of the body that are not considered indecent in Western culture, although exact details vary substantially.&lt;ref&gt;Martin et al. (2003), Encyclopedia of Islam &amp; the Muslim World, Macmillan Reference, {{ISBN|978-0028656038}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Public nudity in England and Wales is permitted anywhere provided it is not done with the intention ''to cause harassment, alarm or distress''.
&lt;ref name="bn-legal"&gt;{{cite web |title=Legal Guide for England and Wales June 2018 v2_4_1.pdf |url=https://www.bn.org.uk/files/file/739-legal-guides-public-place-naturism/?do=download&amp;csrfKey=c671c04c2278192f9a5c093d2f919f64 |website=British Naturism |accessdate=26 September 2018 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturism was specifically excluded from the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] (SOA) for England and Wales, under Section 66. Police and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] were not adequately informed, and any report of nudity was then prosecuted under Section 5 of [[Public Order Act 1986|The Public Order Act 1986]], which was created to deal with people who joined in riots. The Equalities Act of 2010 afforded Naturists with a protected status and use of the Public Order Act route was defeated in the courts in 2013. [[British Naturism]] felt police officers needed to be better informed, and after having discussions with the senior police officer in the [[College of Policing]] in  April 2018 mutually satisfactory wording was agreed, and the resultant preamble and “decision tree” for dealing with complaints about public nudity has been uploaded to the Police Training manuals.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Andrew|last=Welch|title=Policing Naturism - BN engineers a major breakthrough |url=https://www.bn.org.uk/news/news/policing-naturism-bn-engineers-a-major-breakthrough-r475/ |website=British Naturism |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some laws specifically target naturism. In the U.S. State of [[Arkansas]], nudism is illegal beyond the immediate family unit, even on private property. It is also a crime to "promote" or "advocate" nudism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.UnconstitutionalArkansas.org |title=Arkansas Law § 5-68-204 Violates First Amendment Rights |publisher=UnconstitutionalArkansas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
In [[Islam]], the area of the body not meant to be exposed in public is called the ''[[awrah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bukhari:6:60:282|url=http://www.sultan.org/books/bukhari/060.htm#006.060.282}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunnan Abu Dawud 32:4091|url=http://www.2muslims.com/directory/hadith/sunnan_abu_dawud/32/4091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include prohibitions on males wearing shorts, and females exposing their head. Precisely which body parts must be covered varies between different schools of Islamic thought.&lt;ref&gt;Martin et al. (2003), Encyclopedia of Islam &amp; the Muslim World, Macmillan Reference, {{ISBN|978-0028656038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
[[File:2011 World Naked Bike Ride, London.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Street photography]] at some public mass-nudity events, such as the [[World Naked Bike Ride]] above, is the norm.]]
At some beaches, taking photographs might be restricted. Private nude resorts might prohibit cameras altogether, while others may require permission be granted by anyone being photographed, in addition to management in some cases.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] issues a photo release form to allow people to give permission for the publication of photos of themselves or their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aanr.com/userfiles/download_files/photo_release.pdf |title=Photo Release Form |website=American Association for Nude Recreation |access-date=2014-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608165145/http://www.aanr.com/userfiles/download_files/photo_release.pdf |archive-date=2012-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hygiene==
Most nudists and naturist clubs consider it essential for reasons of [[hygiene]] to sit on a towel whenever sitting on a chair, bench, or any other place where others might sit (unless under water) and they consider it poor etiquette to do otherwise. Some clubs encourage members or guests to bring their own chairs. Likewise, sitting on someone else's towel is considered a breach of etiquette. Similar rules may also apply to [[clothing-optional bike ride]]s. Often in situations involving shared use of pools or tubs people are asked to shower first to minimize contamination and prolong the amount of time the water can be used before further maintenance is needed. This practice is also common in non-nudist pools.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Diversity==

===Gender===
Statistics show that more men than women participate in social nudity activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/justluxe/nudist-resort-guide_b_3267160.html|title=What Really Goes On Inside Nudist Resorts|first=|last=JustLuxe|date=16 May 2013|website=huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address this, some nudist organizations do not allow unaccompanied men, while encouraging unaccompanied women. Some venues ban all single people, and accept only families and male/female couples. Others have quotas for single males.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Age===
Many naturist and nudist clubs have few young members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daney |first=Charles |title=Why Don't More Young Adults Try Social Nudity? |date=6 May 1998 |url=http://cgd.best.vwh.net/home/naturism/nudity26.htm |accessdate=2006-09-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822115439/http://cgd.best.vwh.net/home/naturism/nudity26.htm |archivedate=2006-08-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been the case for the past few decades, though previously it was not so.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Reasons for this decline include [[parent]]s being concerned about the possibility of [[false accusation]]s or [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]]s of [[child abuse]] by those who are unfamiliar with non-sexual nudity. In the United States, [[Child Protective Services]] (CPS) may investigate even if no [[law]]s have been allegedly broken. Although such incidents are rare among its members, the [[American Association for Nude Recreation]] (AANR) has an attorney on hand to assist. Many private nudist venues require that one or both parents, including absent parents, be consulted regarding the documentation of their minor children. This may also include situations with [[Joint custody|partial custody]], [[Stepfamily|stepchildren]], etc.&lt;ref name="Cinder"&gt;The Nudist Idea, Cec Cinder, Ph.D. c. 1998, Ultraviolet Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|216}}

===Ethnicity===
[[File:3 Samoan girls-1902.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Samoan girls, c. 1902]]
Organized social nudity usually attracts more people of [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European ethnic]] backgrounds. This may be due to it becoming a social movement in Europe, before spreading to other parts of the world. Other reasons include the fact that most resorts are located far from the cities, and have done little to promote themselves to those of non-European ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Cinder"/&gt;{{rp|307}}

If someone is from an ethnicity whose recent [[ancestor]]s had no problem with public nudity (parts of Africa, Asia, pre-European [[Americas]], Australia, and the [[Pacific Islands]]), it might be thought of as being "primitive" by modern standards, and lacking in social status. (i.e. "Only the poorest of the poor would go about without clothing.") This contrasts with the more [[Western culture|Western]] attitude that nudity and sexuality are somehow related, but nonetheless causes them to shy away from social nudity.&lt;ref name="Cinder"/&gt;{{rp|308}}

==Home nudity between children==
{{Main|Nudity#Children}}

==Social nudity without labels or with alternative terminology==
Many people casually enjoy social nudity without adhering to any term and without associating with any traditional naturist, nudist or [[Freikörperkultur|FKK organization]] or any other groups or movements.&lt;ref name="terms5"&gt;Information from [http://cgd.best.vwh.net/home/naturism/nudity2.htm Being and Nakedness "Disorganized nudity" by Charles Daney] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430055053/http://cgd.best.vwh.net/home/naturism/nudity2.htm |date=2006-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is common, for example on [[nude beach]]es and other forms of [[public nudity]], such as seen at cultural events like [[Burning Man]] or [[clothing-optional bike rides]].

Several activists, such as [[Vincent Bethell]], claim that associations to promote naturism or nudism are unnecessary, leading only to "nudity in tolerated ghettos". Activist [[Social nudity in Seattle|Daniel Johnson]] believes that labels and affiliations overly complicate a relatively simple phenomenon, alienate others from a fear of over-commitment or undesirable stereotypes, and thus get in the way of integrating nudity into everyday life.&lt;ref name="terms6"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Nude &amp; Natural]] (N)|title=Beyond Safe Havens: Oregon's Terri Sue Webb|author=Daniel Johnson|volume=21|issue=3|date=Spring 2002|url=http://www.bodyfreedom.org/guide/essays/N_TerriW.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026114927/http://bodyfreedom.org/guide/essays/N_TerriW.html |archive-date=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Naturists and nudists counter that associating with established terms and philosophies such as nudism and naturism makes it easier to understand a common set of principles and values.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Other issues==
Non-naturists may get very concerned by issues that naturists do not perceive as problems.

===Staring===
[[Staring]] at others is generally discouraged by most nudist and naturist groups, and could result in eviction if someone complains that it made them uncomfortable. In the early days of naturism in the U.S. (1930s-1950s), the rules at many resorts stipulated that when [[conversing]], you must only look at each other face to face.&lt;ref name="Cinder"/&gt;{{rp|162}}

On the other hand, staring has been acceptable at the largely abandoned female [[beauty contest]]s. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In the 1960s and 1970s nudist royalty pageants and "Miss Nude" contests were held by some naturist clubs in the US and Canada. The former were open to men, women and children and were judged on the basis of audience applause, while the latter were typically open to women aged between 18 and 30 and were judged by panels drawn from the local community, businesses and the media as well as minor celebrities.&lt;ref name=GN&gt;{{cite book|title=Contesting Bodies and Nation in Canadian History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmJZAgAAQBAJ|first1=Patrizia|last1=Gentile|first2=Jane|last2=Nicholas|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2013|series=Studies in Gender and History|isbn=9781442663169|pages=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Black Dancer Wins 'Miss Nude World' 1977 Beauty Pageant|magazine=Jet|date=14 July 1977|volume=57|issue=17|issn=0021-5996|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pr8DAAAAMBAJ|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual well-being===
Smith and King pose the following points in their 2009 [[peer review]]ed paper ''Naturism and Sexuality: Broadening our approach to sexual well-being ''{{sfn|Smith|King|2009}}

* The relationship between naturism and sexuality is managed through social and spatial segregation. In commercial naturist resorts, eroticism and sexuality is controlled by applying hetero-normative values, and strict rules and policing. In other environments, eroticism is moderated through self-censorship of actions and behavior. This can make the practice of naturism an isolating, repressive, and anxious experience, rather than a liberating and social one.
* Mainstream naturism relies on discriminatory and dishonest practices to manage sexuality, which limits the diversity of the naturist population, and presents an image and culture that lacks integrity and transparency.
* Mainstream naturism puts strict limits on sexual feelings leading to physical arousal, and equates sexual exploration to deviancy. This may limit the educative potential of nudity in expanding our experience and understanding of sexual feelings beyond the genitals.
* Naturist environments can offer unique public spaces to explore sexual feelings and experiences that may be repressed or limited in conventional public spaces and sexual relationships.
* Mainstream naturism may pathologize (i.e. treat as psychologically abnormal or unhealthy) those who enjoy the eroticism of nudity. An [[asexuality|asexual]] discourse can leave individuals who experience nudity as erotic, to feel uneasy, guilty, defensive, and marginalized within the naturist community. This is similar to the way that popular culture often pathologizes and marginalizes naturists.
* Mainstream naturism may lead to conscious and unconscious repression of sexual feelings, and behavior that limits the relationship between naturism and ''nature''.
* Sexual feelings and behavior are often negotiated through unspoken consent based on the "ebb and flow" of feelings and body language. This subtle and non-verbal consent runs counter to government guidelines on clear verbal consent in sexual behavior. It is possible that the fear of not obtaining this kind of "consent" may limit future sexual exploration in naturist environments. It is also possible that frank sexual behavior may sometimes broaden peoples' sexual feelings, and consequently enhance sexual well-being. Currently, this positive relationship between naturism and sexuality remains undiscussed and repressed.
* Some naturist environments can induce sexual feelings. Nudity in public environments where it is not tolerated was cited several times as a source of people's sexual feelings. Sensory rich environments were also cited as potential trigger for sexual feelings, while personal spaces may legitimize an environment in which nudity can become sexual, without it contradicting the public image of naturism.
* The present law to combat deviant sexual behavior in a public space is inappropriate for the relationship between nudity and deviancy does not appear in the display of genitals, but in the behavior attached to the nudity. The abuse of nudity to cause "alarm and distress" can only exist in an environment in which nudity is absent from everyday spaces. By legislating against public nudity and sexual behavior, the sexual tension and "shock" value created by being nude in a public space may actually encourage those who wish to use nudity as a form of abusive, exploitative, and harassing behavior.

===Spontaneous erections===
While most nudists and naturists condemn any sort of overt sexual activity, the issue of non-sexual spontaneous [[erection]]s is highly debatable. "''What if I get an erection?"'' is the number one question among males who are considering joining social nudity.&lt;ref&gt;http://youngnaturistsamerica.com/nudist-erection-nudism-and-male-erections Author: Jordan Blum; Organization: Young Naturists America (YNA); Date: 23 July 2013{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, this topic is routinely ignored by [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] who study [[History of nudity#Traditional cultures|traditional cultures]], and it is not widely known what rules of etiquette exist among peoples who have lived nude since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;''An Anthropology of Absence: Materializations of Transcendence and Loss''
 By Mikkel Bille, Frida Hastrup, Tim Flohr Soerensen. Publisher: Springer Science+Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-sexual erections tend to be more problematic with nudists and naturists in the United States than in [[continental Europe]]. The world's largest naturist resort at [[Cap d'Agde]] in France is well known among the nudist community to be nonchalant about erections.&lt;ref&gt;''The Naked Truth About Cap d'Agde'' Author: Ross Velton Publisher: Chris Santilli  {{ISBN|978-0966268348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clubs and resorts disallowing erections commonly suggest covering the waist with a towel, lying on one's stomach, or going into the [[swimming pool]] (if within the [[pool fence]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aanr.com/faq.html#14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204023257/http://www.aanr.com/faq.html#14|archive-date=4 February 2005|title=Frequently Asked Questions|website=American Association for Nude Recreation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males of some [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous tribes]] of the [[Amazon Basin]] live nude except for a [[twine|light string]] worn around the [[waist]]line. This is used to conceal the [[foreskin]] of the penis from females, which is considered taboo in communal settings. Since the penis is normally held upright just below the [[navel]], erections are much less noticeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The minimalist dress code of the Amazon's Awa people|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9413908.stm|author=Justin Rowlatt|work=BBC News|date=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jehudi Ashmun''' (April 21, 1794 – August 25, 1828) was an American religious leader and social reformer who became involved in the [[American Colonization Society]]. He emigrated to the colony of Liberia in 1822, where he served as the United States government's agent (de facto governor) for two different terms: one from August 1822 until April 1824, and another from August 1824 until March 1828.

==Early life and education ==
Born in [[Champlain (village), New York|Champlain, New York]] in 1794, Ashmun first studied at [[Middlebury College]] in Vermont.  He spent his senior year at the [[University of Vermont]] and was ordained in Maine as a minister.

==Marriage and family==
Ashmun married in 1818 and his wife accompanied him to [[Bangor, Maine]], where he took his first position.

==Career==
Ashmun was appointed as the first principal, and one of the first two professors, of the [[Bangor Theological Seminary]] in [[Bangor, Maine]].  He retained this professorship until 1827, despite leaving the country for a few years while living and working in the new colony of [[Monrovia, Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Frederick Freeman, ''A Plea for Africa'' (1837), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quarterly"&gt;''American Quarterly Register'' (1842), pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawn by other opportunities, Ashmun moved to Washington, DC, where he worked as the editor of an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] monthly. Interested in the work of the [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS), he founded the newspaper ''[[The African Intelligencer]]'' and wrote about their mission.  His articles about the ACS, which was committed to repatriating free blacks to a colony in Liberia, led to his political appointment as representative of the U.S. government to the colony. At the age of 26, Ashmun was the leader in 1822 of a group of settlers and [[missionaries]] to Liberia on the ship ''Elizabeth''. His wife went with him but was among the many settlers who died of [[malaria]] in Liberia.

As United States representative to Liberia as well as agent of the ACS, Ashmun effectively became governor of the colony from 1822 to 1828, from ages 28 to 34. He took a leadership role in what he found to be a demoralized colony and helped build the defenses of [[Monrovia]], as well as developing trade.  During his tenure in Liberia, Ashmun increased agricultural production, annexed more lands from neighboring tribes, and exploited commercial opportunities in the interior.

He helped create a [[constitution]] for Liberia that enabled blacks to hold positions in the government. African Americans and their descendants, known as [[Americo-Liberians]], dominated the government into the late 20th century. This was unlike what happened in the early decades of the neighboring British colony of [[Sierra Leone]], which was dominated by whites although also founded for the resettlement of free blacks from Britain and Upper Canada. Ashmun's letters home and his book, ''History of the American Colony in Liberia, 1821–1823'' (1826) constitute the earliest written history of the Liberia colony.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quarterly" /&gt;

==Death==
In ill health in Liberia, Ashmun returned to the United States. He died in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] soon after. He was interred in [[Grove Street Cemetery]].

'''Joseph Rowntree''' (24 May 1836 – 24 February 1925) was an English [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] philanthropist and businessman from [[York]]. Rowntree is perhaps best known for being a champion of social reform, partner and friend of [[Charles_Booth_(philanthropist)|Charles Booth]], and his time as a [[chocolatier]] at family business ''[[Rowntree's]]'', one of the most important in Britain. Even as a powerful businessman, he was deeply interested in improving the [[quality of life]] of his employees; this led to him becoming a philanthropist, pursuing many [[charitable organization|charitable causes]]. In 1904 he created [[Rowntree trusts|three trusts]], the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation|Joseph Rowntree Village Trust]] (JRVT) which was originally set up to build and manage the garden village of [[New Earswick]], the [[Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust]] (JRCT) and the Joseph Rowntree Social Services Trust (JRSST). The latter two were both set up to effect social reform, the difference between them being that whereas the Charitable Trust was set up as a charity, the Social Services Trust was set up as a limited company so that if necessary it would be able to undertake social and political work not legally allowed by a charitable Trust. He suggested that only the JRVT would be permanent but in fact all the trusts are still in existence although the Social Services Trust has changed its name to the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust and with the separation of the Joseph Rowntree Housing Trust from the Village Trust in 1968, there are now four trusts that exist today.

==Early life==
Rowntree was born the son of Sarah and [[Joseph Rowntree (educationist)|Joseph Rowntree]], on Pavement Street in York where his father owned a grocer's shop.&lt;ref name="Vernon2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Vernon|title=Quaker Business Man: The Life of Joseph Rowntree|year=2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-38160-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Bootham School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oup.com/view/article/35857 ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'']{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At fourteen he accompanied his father on a visit to Ireland, and witnessed the effects of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|potato famine]].&lt;ref name=jrfbiog&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/biography.html Joseph Rowntree Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829193103/http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/biography.html |date=29 August 2008 }} – ''[[Joseph Rowntree Foundation|The Joseph Rowntree Foundation]]'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This experience was to provide the grounding for his political views and business ideas later in life.

== Career ==
He started working in his [[Joseph Rowntree (educationist)|father's]] grocery business as an apprentice the following year, and after his father's death in 1859 he took over the running, jointly managing the business with his brother [[John Stephenson Rowntree]].
[[File:Joseph Rowntree house in York.jpg|thumb|The house where Rowntree lived, on Bootham in York.]]
In 1869 he joined his brother, [[Henry Isaac Rowntree]], who owned a chocolate factory in York.   When Henry Isaac died in 1883, Joseph became the owner of the company.  Joseph pursued his progressive ideas within the running of [[Rowntree's]], in the design of the new factory opened in 1881, and in the business practices followed therein, including the founding of one of the first [[Retirement plan|Occupational Pension Schemes]].&lt;ref name=jrfbiog /&gt;

The company, [[Rowntree's]], grew from 30 to over 4,000 employees by the end of the 19th century making it Britain's eightieth largest manufacturing employer.&lt;ref name=JRBODNB /&gt; It merged with John Mackintosh and Co. in 1969 and was taken over by [[Nestlé]] in 1988.

He had two marriages, to Julia Eliza Seebohm in 1862 who died in 1863, and then to her cousin Emma Antoinette Seebohm in 1867 with whom he had six children.&lt;ref name=JRBODNB&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35857 Joseph Rowntree Biography] – ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt; The social investigator [[Seebohm Rowntree]] was one of their children.

Joseph Rowntree's grave, along with many other members of his family, can be seen in the [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] cemetery within the grounds of [[The Retreat]] on Heslington Road, [[York]].

Philosophical and political views: Joseph Rowntree was a supporter of liberal values, and was anxious to improve the quality of life of his employees. He provided them with a library, free education, a works magazine, a social welfare officer, a doctor, a dentist and a pension fund.

==The Joseph Rowntree School==
The [[Joseph Rowntree School]] was built in York in 1942 by the Joseph Rowntree Village Trust. In 2010 the school relocated to new premises costing £29 million. Students refer to it as "Jo Ro".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex Joseph Rowntree School pupils invited to step back into the classroom|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/4862833.Ex_Joseph_Rowntree_School_pupils_invited_to_step_back_into_the_classroom/|accessdate=27 May 2016|work=York Press|date=21 Jan 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Joseph Rowntree statue campaign==
A campaign was started in summer 2012 to put a statue of Joseph Rowntree at a prominent site in the centre of York, with a [[Facebook]] page – "A Joseph Rowntree statue for York City Centre" – that stated: "York should be proud of its greatest son! This campaign aims to place a statue of Joseph Rowntree, philanthropist, social reformer, and chocolatier, in Parliament Square, York, on the site of the repulsed and now-demolished toilet block."&lt;ref&gt;Kate Liptrot, [http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/9884273.Campaign_for_statue_of_Joseph_Rowntree/ "Campaign for statue of Joseph Rowntree on former “splash palace” site in York"], ''The Press'', 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Landstände''''' (singular ''Landstand'') or '''''Landtage''''' (singular ''Landtag'') were the various [[estates of the realm|territorial estates or diets]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[early modern period]], as opposed to their respective [[territorial lord]]s (the ''Landesherrn'').

== Usage ==
The structure of the ''Landstände'' was highly variable depending on the country and period of history. Furthermore, both the representatives of the older system, the ''Ständeordnung'', where the estates were predominant, and the parliaments of the newer people's representative systems were called ''Landstände''. The term ''Landtag'' was used, both under the ''Ständeordnung'' as well as the newer representative structures, for a general assembly of the estates or the parliament. The totality of the ''Landstände'' in a sovereign territory was also called the ''Landschaft''.

In the older feudal system the estates originally consisted of the assembly of deputies of the privileged estates of a country, the [[nobility]] and the [[clergy]], who had joined together to form an organised body. Later, representatives of the towns were added. In some cases (for example, in [[Vienna]], [[Württemberg]] or [[Mecklenburg]]) [[yeomen]] (''Freibauer'') were also given the right to participate as representatives of the [[peasant]]s.&lt;ref name="Herders"&gt;Herders Conversations-Lexikon. Freiburg im Breisgau 1855, Vol. 3, p. 704.&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual exception were the estates in the land of [[Land Hadler|Hadler]], which were formed almost exclusively of the farmers of large farms (''Großbauer'').&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Rüther: „Hadler Chronik. Quellenbuch zur Geschichte des Landes Hadeln.“ 1932. Neu heraus gegeben Bremerhaven 1979. pp. 37 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

At the ''Landtage'' the ''Landstände'' were divided into separate ''curiae'' (divisions). As a rule, three ''curiae'' were usually distinguished: the [[prelate]]s, the [[knight]]s and the [[town]]s.&lt;ref name="Götzinger"&gt;Götzinger, E.: Reallexicon der Deutschen Altertümer. Leipzig, 1885., pp. 943-944.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the early ''Landstände'' initially only represented the rights of their own estate and could only indirectly be considered to represent the whole population in their domain at the same time. In the ''Ständeordnungen'', unlike [[Absolute monarchy|absolutist]] systems of rule, the prince could not raise new taxes or adopt new laws outside his own personal estate (''chamber goods'' or ''Kämmergüter'') without the consent of the ''Landstände''.&lt;ref name="Herders" /&gt; In some cases, the estates also shared in the administration of justice and other public affairs. The limits of their powers were not usually accurately determined.

Sometimes the term ''Landstände'' was retained even for the constitutional assemblies of newer representative systems, which in many countries took the place of the privileged assemblies of the ''Ständeordnung'' during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Michael EHRLE: Volksvertretung im Vormärz. Studien zur Zusammensetzung, Wahl und Funktion der deutschen Landtage im Spannungsfeld zwischen monarchischem Prinzip und ständischer Repräsentation, 2 Bde., Frankfurt a. M., 1979 [=Europ. Hochschulschriften III/127].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
=== Precursor ===
The ''Landstände'' first emerged in the 14th century, although the term itself was not used in [[Middle High German]] and was probably first translated later from the [[French language|French]] word ''états''.&lt;ref name="Götzinger" /&gt;  But it was not a new concept. The records of the Roman historian, [[Tacitus]], show that co-determination was already being practised in the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]] at important public occasions. And according to the old Germanic law, public meetings and court hearings - the so-called ''[[thing (assembly)|things]]'' - were held, in the open. Even in the later [[Francia|Frankish Empire]], alongside the general assemblies of the [[nobility]] and [[clergy]], so-called ''[[placita]]'' are recorded; a form of representation of the people.

In individual tribes, for example the [[Bavaria]]ns and [[Saxons]], there were such meetings too. However, these gatherings did not represent a formal grouping of the estates, as had evolved by the 14th century. Even the [[Hoftag|imperial and knightly assemblies]] and the state ''things'' of the 12th and 13th centuries were structures that dealt with the general welfare of the land, but these meetings still lacked the character of an independent body.

=== Entstehung der Landstände ===
Seit dem 14. Jahrhundert bildeten sich mit der Entwicklung der [[Landeshoheit]] und mit der festeren [[Territorialisierung|Begrenzung des Territorialbestandes]] der einzelnen Herrschaften die eigentlichen Landstände aus den eingesessenen Herren, [[Vasall]]en und [[Ministeriale]]n heraus.&lt;ref name="Pierer"&gt;Pierer's Universal-Lexikon, Band 10. Altenburg 1860, S. 91-96.&lt;/ref&gt; Diese fingen an, sich über ihre Rechte und Freiheiten von den Landesherrn urkundliche Zusicherungen erteilen zu lassen und schlossen untereinander Bündnisse zur Wahrung ihrer eigenen Rechte und Freiheiten.&lt;ref name="Götzinger" /&gt;

Für den Zusammenschluss zu festen Organisationen bestanden verschiedene Gründe. Zum einen verlangten die Landesherren jetzt häufig Steuern und die größeren Grundbesitzer, wollten sich von dem Landesherrn bestimmtere Versprechungen über die künftige Anlegung der Steuern geben lassen.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt; Zum anderen waren Streitigkeiten über [[Sukzession]]sverhältnisse, der Übergang des Landes an einen neuen Herrn oder die Wiedervereinigung getrennter Landesteile Veranlassung zur Bildung einer festen Vereinigung.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt; Aus den dabei gewonnenen Privilegien bildete sich nach und nach eine Summe von Landesfreiheiten der Landstände gegenüber den Landesherren heraus.

Im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert wuchs der Einfluss der Landstände. Die [[Landesherr]]en waren wegen der Beschränktheit ihrer eigenen Mittel oft auf die Unterstützung ihrer Landstände angewiesen, womit diese an Bedeutung gewannen. Daher traten die Landstände im 15. und 16. Jahrhundert häufig sogar als wirkliche [[Mitregent]]en auf und beschäftigten sich mit allen wichtigeren Angelegenheiten, selbst solchen, die zunächst nur die fürstliche Familie angingen.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt; Aus der ursprünglichen Pflicht der Vasallen, ihren Lehnsherrn in bestimmten Fällen mit besonderen Leistungen zu unterstützen, entwickelte sich das Steuerbewilligungsrecht der Landstände.&lt;ref name="Meyers"&gt;Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon, Band 12. Leipzig 1908, S. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Es folgte die Gründung eigener landschaftlicher Kassen, in die zunächst die bewilligten Steuern eingezahlt wurden, um von da aus erst in die fürstlichen Kassen übergeführt zu werden. Für die Abwicklung setzten die Landstände vielfach ständig tagende Gremien (genannt Collegium, Ausschuss, Kommissariat, Verordnung usw.) ein und bauten repräsentative Gebäude.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de/artikel/artikel_45078 Maximilian Lanzinner, Landstände, in: Historisches Lexikon Bayerns]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Niedergang der Landstände ===
Im 17. Jahrhundert begann durch den [[Dreißigjähriger Krieg|Dreißigjährigen Krieg]] der Niedergang der Landstände in den meisten deutschen Staaten.&lt;ref name="Herders" /&gt; Dieser setzte sich im 18. Jahrhundert fort.

Mit der wachsenden Macht des Landesfürstentums (gemäß den Vorstellungen des [[Absolutismus]]) und der Entwickelung eines fürstlichen Beamtenstandes sank die Macht der Landstände, die in vielen Territorien fast bedeutungslos wurde, in andern Gebieten aber auch im 18. Jahrhundert noch großen Einfluss auf die Landesverwaltung besaßen.&lt;ref name="Meyers" /&gt; Dazu trug besonders die völlige Veränderung des Kriegswesens bei, welche die Macht in den Händen der Landesherren konzentrierte. Zudem beschränkte die Reichsgesetzgebung die Selbständigkeit der Landstände.&lt;ref name="Pierer" /&gt;

In Württemberg erhielt sich ihre volle Wirksamkeit bis 1805.&lt;ref name="Herders" /&gt; Im [[Königreich Sachsen]] behielten die Landstände bis zur Einführung der konstitutionellen Verfassung 1831 ihre Vormachtstellung. In [[Geschichte Mecklenburgs|Mecklenburg]] konnten die Landstände sogar bis 1918 ihre Macht erhalten. In Niedersachsen existieren „[[Landschaften und Landschaftsverbände in Niedersachsen|Landschaften]]“ mit ständischer Verfassung bis heute fort.

== Einzelne Landstände ==

Für die Landstände wurden im 19. und noch bis in die ersten Jahre des 20. Jahrhunderts [[Ständehaus|Ständehäuser]] als eigene Bauten mit Versammlungssälen und Verwaltungsräumen errichtet.

The '''legal working age''' is the minimum age required by [[law]] for a person to work, in each [[country]] or [[jurisdiction]].

Some types of labor are commonly prohibited even for those above the working age, if they have not reached yet the [[age of majority]]. Activities that are dangerous, [[harmful]] to the [[health]] or that may affect the [[morals]] of [[Minor (law)|minors]] fall into this category.

==Early years==
[[File:Namık Kemal-7.2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Namık Kemal (on the right) with his friend Hikmet]]
An [[Albanians|Albanian]] by origin,&lt;ref&gt;Metin Heper, ''The State and Kurds in Turkey: The Question of Assimilation'', Springer (2007), p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Namık Kemal was born in [[Tekirdağ]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]], today in [[Turkey]]) on 21 December 1840, to Fatma Zehra and Mustafa Asım Bey, the latter of whom was chief astrologer in the [[Ottoman sultan|Sultan]]’s Palace.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-417"/&gt; Since surnames or family names were not in use during the Ottoman Empire, "Kemal" was not his surname, but part of his first name. During his youth, Kemal traveled throughout the Ottoman Empire, staying in [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Kars]], and [[Sofia]], and studied a number of subjects, including poetry.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-417"/&gt; In 1857, at the age of 17, Kemal worked in the ''Tercüme Odası'' ("The Translation Office") of the government.&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-130"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanford J.

[[Namik Kemal]] admired the constitution of the [[French Third Republic]], he summed up the Young Ottomans' political ideals as "the sovereignty of the nation, the separation of powers, the responsibility of officials, personal freedom, equality, freedom of thought, freedom of press, freedom of association, enjoyment of property, sanctity of the home".&lt;ref name="BergerMiller"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Stefan|last2=Miller|first2=Alexei|title=Nationalizing Empires|date=2015|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=9633860164|page=447|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__9fCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA447|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BlackEdinburgh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Antony|title=The History of Islamic Political Thought: From the Prophet to the Present|date=2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=0748688781|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hd1vAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA286|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Hanioğlu, 104"&gt;Hanioğlu, M.

==Ideology and exile==
[[File:Namık Kemal-2.jpg|thumb|185px|right|An old photograph of Namık Kemal]]
Namık Kemal was heavily influenced by Western conceptions of the relationship between the government and the people.&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-504-505"/&gt; As such, he and his compatriots spoke out against the movement to centralize the government being undertaken by Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] (ruled 1861–1876), and his advisors [[Mehmed Emin Âli Pasha]] and [[Mehmed Fuad Pasha]].&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-5"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gábor Ágoston|author2=Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his criticism of the government, Namık Kemal was exiled from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1867 and fled to [[Paris]], where many other exiled [[Young Ottomans]] had found refuge.&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-506"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|authorlink=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|title=Ottoman Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhLOtjYtiPoC|date=1 August 1979|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-08093-8|page=506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869 or 1870, Kemal was allowed to return to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and proceeded to write for a number of Young Ottoman-run newspapers, and eventually published one of his own, ''Ibret'' ("Admonition"), in which he addressed more intellectual, social, and national subjects.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt; In addition, it was after his return to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] that Kemal wrote his most significant and influential work: the play ''Vatan Yahut Silistre'', or ''Silistra'', which translates to "Fatherland."&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-506"/&gt; The play tells the story of an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] soldier whose loyalty to his nation, and not his religion or allegiance to the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]], motivates him to defend the town of [[Silistra]], [[Bulgaria]] from the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] during the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-507"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|authorlink=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|title=Ottoman Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhLOtjYtiPoC|date=1 August 1979|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-08093-8|page=507}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact these nationalist sentiments, unheard of in the [[Ottoman Empire]] prior to Kemal, had on the [[Turkish people]] was so profound that Kemal’s newspaper, ''Ibret'', was shut down, and Kemal himself was banished from the Empire for the second time.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-507"/&gt; During this second exile, Kemal took refuge in [[Cyprus]], in a building known as the [[Namık Kemal Dungeon]] in [[Famagusta]], where he remained for three years.&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-507"/&gt;

===Later career===
[[File:Namik kemal2.jpg|thumb|185px|Namık Kemal was one of the leading figures in creating a national identity]]
Like many [[Young Ottomans]], Namık Kemal supported [[Murad V]]’s ascension to the throne after the abdication of [[Abdülaziz]] in 1876.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-514"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|authorlink=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|title=Ottoman Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhLOtjYtiPoC|date=1 August 1979|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-08093-8|page=514}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, their hope that Murad would institute the reforms they desired was dashed, for it rapidly became apparent that he was not suited for rule; his weak nerves and alcoholism leading to his abdication after only three months.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-404"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gábor Ágoston|author2=Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7|page=404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Namık Kemal protested against [[Murad V|Murad]]’s deposition, and continued to support Murad’s Western political perspectives, but ultimately, his pleas failed to have any effect and [[Murad V]] stepped down in 1876.&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-515"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|authorlink=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|title=Ottoman Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhLOtjYtiPoC|date=1 August 1979|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-08093-8|page=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Murad’s abdication, the first Ottoman Parliament, the [[General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire]], was established in 1876, largely as a result of pressure from the [[Young Ottomans]], as well as [[Midhat Pasha]]’s political influence.&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-181-182"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanford J. Shaw|authorlink1=Stanford J.

Shaw|authorlink1=Stanford J. Shaw|author2=Ezel Kural Shaw|authorlink2=Ezel Kural Shaw|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIET_7ji7YAC&amp;pg=PA520|volume=2|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29166-8|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to successfully implement his autocratic rule, Abdul Hamid II exiled many [[Young Ottomans]], including Namık Kemal, who were critical of his decision to disregard the Parliament.&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-530"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|authorlink=Patrick Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross|title=Ottoman Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BhLOtjYtiPoC|date=1 August 1979|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-688-08093-8|page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for the third time, Kemal was removed from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] by being forced into an administrative position in [[Chios]], where he would die in 1888.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinross1979-530"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-212-213"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanford J.

==Legacy==
Namık Kemal had an enormous influence on the formation of a [[Turkish nationalism|Turkish national identity]].&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-418"/&gt; Kemal’s focus on national loyalty, rather than loyalty to a monarch, influenced, as it was, by Western European ideals of self-government, contributed not only to the spread of democracy during the early 20th century, but also to the formation of the modern [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]] after the dissolution of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="ShawShaw1977-260-261"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stanford J. Shaw|authorlink1=Stanford J. Shaw|author2=Ezel Kural Shaw|authorlink2=Ezel Kural Shaw|title=History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIET_7ji7YAC&amp;pg=PA520|volume=2|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-29166-8|pages=260–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of modern Turkey, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], often remarked that he had been influenced by Kemal’s writing as a young man, and that they had subsequently been a source of inspiration for his goals in the formation of the Turkish government and state.&lt;ref name="ÁgostonMasters2009-48"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gábor Ágoston|author2=Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1084">'''Parallel society'''  refers to the self-organization of an ethnic or religious minority, often immigrant groups, with the intent of a reduced or minimal spatial, social and cultural contact with the majority society into which they immigrate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpb.de/publikationen/URZDVA Parallelgesellschaften?], ''Aus Politik und Zeitgeschichte'', No. 1–2 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was introduced into the debate about [[Human migration|migration]] and [[Social integration|integration]] in the early 1990s by the German sociologist [[Wilhelm Heitmeyer]] . It rose to prominence in the European public discourse following the murder of Dutch director and critic of Islam [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]]. In 2004, it was elected by the [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]] second as [[Word of the year]].

{{For2|"Porno chic" or "The Golden Age of Porn"|[[Golden Age of Porn]]}}
'''Pornographication''' or '''pornification''', sometimes referred to as '''[[raunch]] culture''', denotes the intrusion of the style and contents of the [[sex industry]] into mainstream culture (music, television, [[Hollywood movie]]s) and the [[sexualisation]] of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Attwood"&gt;{{citation | last = McNair | first = Brian | contribution = From [[porno-chic]] to porno-fear: the return of the repressed (Abstract) |editor-last=Attwood|editor-first=Feona|title=Mainstreaming Sex: The Sexualisation of Western Culture|url=http://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/18574/ |year=2009|publisher=IB Taurus|location=London|isbn=978-1-84511-827-3 |pages=110–130 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pornographication, particularly sexualising the images of women, is said to demonstrate "how [[patriarchal]] power operates in the field of [[gender]] representation".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Woodward|first=Kath|contribution = Gendered bodies: gendered representations | editor-last = Woodward | editor-first = Kath |title=The Short Guide to Gender|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtmaeNvWodUC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=pornogrification&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en |year=2011|publisher=The Policy Press, University of Bristol|isbn=978-1-84742-763-2 |page=85 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Women in Popular Culture'', Marion Meyers argues that the portrayal of women in modern society is primarily influenced by "the mainstreaming of [[pornography]] and its resultant hypersexualization of women and girls, and the [[commodification]] of those images for a global market".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyers|first=Marian|title=Women in Popular Culture: Representation and Meaning|url=http://www.hamptonpress.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=1-57273-828-6&amp;Category_Code=Q208 |date=May 2008|publisher=Hampton Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Pornography and the modern sex culture has been around for many decades, but has its roots in the Greek word "''porni'', which means prostitute and ''graphein'', which means to write.  It is shown throughout various global cultures.  In ancient Greece and Rome, there was many sexually charged images on the walls.  When the printing press was invented, it was much easier to distribute information to the masses, which is how the first versions of [[erotica]] came about.  What most people think about Western pornography and the sex culture started with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] of the 18th century.  Many more people had access to pornographic material during the Enlightenment, and in England books such as ''Fanny Hill; or, Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cleland | first = John | author-link = John Cleland | title = Fanny Hill, or, Memoirs of a woman of pleasure | publisher = Penguin Books | location = Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England New York, N.Y., U.S.A | year = 1985 | isbn = 9780140432497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; had commercial success as one of the earliest forms of erotica.  During this time, people started thinking more freely, so [[pornography]] could challenge the norms of the time, as with [[Marquis de Sade]]'s book ''[[Justine (de Sade novel)|Justine]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = de Sade | first = Marquis | author-link = Marquis de Sade | others = Pieralessandro Casavini (translator) | title = Les Infortunes de la Vertu | trans-title = [[Justine (de Sade novel)|Justine, or The Misfortunes of Virtue]] | language = French | publisher = Olympia Press | location = Paris | year = 1961 | origyear = 1791 | oclc = 50373239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most pornographic images before the 19th century were images or books, when the [[motion picture]] was invented, it created a whole new medium for sexual imagery.  At the start of the 1920s, it became popular throughout the West.

After the Internet was invented in the 1990s, more people could express themselves sexually online, and anyone could post pictures or videos if they chose to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Jenkins | first = John Philip | title = Pornography | url = https://www.britannica.com/topic/pornography | website = britannica.com | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica]] | date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pornography in the West is generally much more widely accepted, and "66% of men and 41% of women consume pornography on a monthly basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Persaud | first1 = Raj | last2 = Häkkänen-Nyholm | first2 = Helinä | author-link1 = Rajendra Persaud | author-link2 = Helinä Häkkänen-Nyholm | title = Is erotica bad for the brain? | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dr-raj-persaud/effects-of-porn-on-the-brain_b_5416615.html | work = [[The Huffington Post]] | location = United Kingdom | date = 30 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movies ===
In [[slasher movie]]s, sex and violence are often coupled together.  In famous [[horror film]]s such as ''[[Friday the 13th]]'', women are portrayed as weak and often are victims. Because of repeated viewing of these movies, people may become [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitized]], and especially with males, could be prone to "be less disturbed by scenes of extreme violence and degradation directed at women".  Men, after repeated exposure to violent films, were less likely to feel empathy and remorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sexual assault and the media | url = http://www.stopvaw.org/sexual_assault_and_the_media | website = stopvaw.org | publisher = Stop Violence Against Women, the Advocates for Human Rights | date = 13 July 2009 | access-date = 5 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Men could think that violence towards women is normal, which therefore leads to more [[sexual violence]] towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sapolsky | first1 = Barry | last2 = Molitor | first2 = Fred | last3 = Luque | first3 = Sarah | title = Sex and violence in slasher films: re-examining the assumptions | journal = [[Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly]] | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 26–38 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/107769900308000103 | date = March 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/107769900308000103 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movies are just one example of how sexuality is translated to men and women, explicitly showing men as dominant and powerful, and women as weak.

=== Television ===
Teens who were exposed to highly sexual content on TV were more likely to "act older" than their age.  If what was being shown on TV was educational, it could yield a positive result on teenagers.  For example, on one specific episode of ''Friends'', which had nearly 2 million viewers at the time, one of the characters had gotten pregnant even after using [[contraception]].  After the episode, teens were actually more likely to engage in [[Safe sex|safer sexual activity]], and as much as 65% remembered what was in that episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Collins | first1 = Rebecca L. | last2 = Elliott | first2 = Marc N. | last3 = Berry | first3 = Sandra H. | last4 = Kanouse | first4 = David E. | last5 = Kunkel | first5 = Dale | last6 = Hunter | first6 = Sarah B. | last7 = Miu | first7 = Angela | title = Does watching sex on television influence teens’ sexual activity? | url = http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB9068.html | publisher = [[RAND Corporation]] | access-date = 5 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Books ===
Literature which people read for sexual satisfaction is one of the earliest forms of media portraying sexuality.  Now, there are various websites to satisfy most people's varied sexual preferences and tastes.  As [[erotica]] was a form of social protest against the values of the culture at the time, as was with the famous book ''[[The Romance of Lust]]'', written as a few volumes between 1873–1876.  Described in the book are [[homosexuality]], [[incest]], and other socially unacceptable concepts. The values of the [[Victorian era]] perpetuated purity and innocence. So this book offered a new perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anonymous|title=The Romance Of Lust|date=1873–1876|publisher=Grove Green|location=United Kingdom|edition=1892|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/30254/pg30254-images.html | oclc = 760964009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, erotica has become the new norm, and is extremely popular. The most recent commercial success was ''[[Fifty Shades Of Grey]]'', describing in detail scenes of [[sadomasochism]] and other forms of kink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = James | first = E.L. | author-link = E. L. James | title = Fifty shades of Grey | publisher = Vintage Books | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780872723269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It sold over "31 million worldwide", and has been adapted into a film starring [[Dakota Johnson]] and [[Jamie Dornan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Grinberg | first = Emanuella | title = Explaining ''Fifty Shades'' wild success | url = http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/13/living/fifty-shades-buzz-50-shades-success/ | work = [[CNN]] | date = 13 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines ===
Magazines often portray sex in a very indirect way.  As seen in [[advertisements]] throughout, sex is portrayed without anyone needing to say a word.  However, in a lot of ways, this can be devastating to people's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]]s, especially women. Magazines feature women barely clothed in provocative positions, which can communicate that women are not good enough.  One of the more unlikely effects is it affecting dieting patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomsen | first1 = Steven R. | last2 = Weber | first2 = Michelle M. | last3 = Brown | first3 = Lora Beth | title = The relationship between reading beauty and fashion magazines and the use of pathogenic dieting methods among adolescent females | journal = Adolescence | volume = 37 | issue = 145 | pages = 1–18 | publisher = Libra Publishers | date = Spring 2002 | pmid = 12003283 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Access also available via [https://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+relationship+between+reading+beauty+and+fashion+magazines+and+the...-a086056749 The Free Library.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological theories==
In order to understand how sex culture is so prevalent, we need to look at [[human sexuality]] as a whole and why people gravitate towards such mediums as described above.

===Structuralism===
[[Structuralism]] is commonly defined as "analyzing a specific field as a complex system of interrelated parts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Mastin | first = Luke | title = Structuralism | url = http://www.philosophybasics.com/movements_structuralism.html | website = philosophybasics.com | publisher = The Basics of Philosophy }}&lt;/ref&gt; This term used in sociology was popularized with Michel Foucault, in France where most of the early research took place on it. Sociologists who look at sexuality focus on the idea of social institutions, such as the family, law, and the economy.  The economy requires money to go in and out of the system.  People could say sexual relationships are a social institution. Due to the Western acceptance of [[Judeo-Christianity]], incest is rarely represented in the media.  The idea of the family is so powerful and strong that dating someone or having relations with a member of one's family is highly taboo.  A structuralist would argue that sex culture is an offshoot of these institutions.  When it comes to pornography, it is another way of income and is an offshoot of the economy and the highly capitalistic ideas of the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foucault | first = Michel | author-link = Michel Foucault | title = The history of sexuality: volume 1, the will to knowledge | date = 1998 | publisher = Penguin | location = London | oclc = 929056897}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also expressed in how the family affects teenagers who view certain types of media, and those who are marginalized may be more susceptible to the negative impacts of sexuality.

=== Symbolic interactionism ===
[[Symbolic interactionism]] was first coined by [[George Herbert Mead]], who came up with this school of sociological thought in the 1930s. Its premise is primarily based on "objects acquire meaning, thus becoming symbols, through communication". One of his most famous books ''Mind, Self And Society'' is famous for describing this theory in depth.  Here, he pinpoints the [[self]] as an object and other create meaning around it.  At the same time, we change the self depending on how we perceive other's ideas of our selves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mead | first = George Herbert | author-link = George Herbert Mead | editor-last = Morris | editor-first = Charles W. | editor-link = Charles W. Morris | title = Mind, self, and society from the standpoint of a social behaviorist | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago, Illinois | year = 1962 | isbn = 9780226516684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So in studying something like sexuality or acts related to sex, a sociologist under this perspective could look at pornography and the messages it communicates, or look at magazines and the messages they send to people.  One graphic example provided is the "power" symbol communicated in pornography. In pornography, men are implied to be powerful and dominant, whereas women are not. This is especially true in violent pornography, where the person watching feels like they have a complete sense of control over the content, where women are depicted as enjoying it, so that communicates that it may be okay to be violent towards women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gossett | first1 = Jennifer Lynn | last2 = Byrne | first2 = Sarah | title = "Click Here": a content analysis of internet rape sites | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 689–709 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/089124302236992 | date = October 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/089124302236992 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scripting theory ===
With [[Sexual script theory|scripting theory]], it "is the result of elaborate prior learning that teaches us an etiquette of sexual behavior". It is all about [[Social learning theory|social learning]] and scripting theory states that everything we see and do sexually in our culture is influenced by a set of social scripts that are conditioned into people.  These provide details and instructions to guide us into how people choose partners and therefore, who they find attractive or desirable.  As mentioned before, magazines can indirectly send this message.  Since what is shown primarily is a woman's appearance, so women instinctively realize they need to appear a certain way for a mate.  It is a socially learned behavior that happens from repeated exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Shibley-Hyde | first1 = Janet | last2 = DeLamater | first2 = John | title = Understanding human sexuality | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780072494716 | edition = 8th |authorlink1=Janet Shibley Hyde|authorlink2= John DeLamater}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the late 1990s, several books, convenings, and exhibitions have generated new momentum and investment in public interest design. Since then, public interest design—frequently described as a movement or field—has gained public recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cary|first=John|title=Dignifying Design|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/dignifying-design.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 6, 2012|author2=Courtney E. Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Public interest design grew out of the community design movement, which got its start in 1968 after American [[civil rights]] leader [[Whitney Young]] issued a challenge to attendees of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) national convention:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leavitt|first=Jacqueline|title=From the Studio to the Streets: Service Learning in Planning and Architecture|year=2006|publisher=Stylus Publishing|location=Sterling, VA|isbn=978-1563771002|pages=103|authorlink=Multiplying Knowledge: Service-Learning x Activism = Community Scholars|author2=Kara Hoffernan |editor=Mary C. Hardin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

".  .  .  ''you are not a profession that has distinguished itself by your social and civic contributions to the cause of civil rights, and I am sure this does not come to you as any shock.  You are most distinguished by your thunderous silence and your complete irrelevance''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designingactivism.com/2011/12/31/whitney-young-1968-speech-to-the-aia Whitney Young 1968 Speech to the AIA]&lt;/ref&gt;"

The response to Young’s challenge was the establishment of community design centers (CDCs) across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designcoalition.org/aboutus/our%20roots.htm Design Coalition, "Our Roots"]&lt;/ref&gt;  CDCs, which were often established with the support of area universities,&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Jason|title=University-Community Design Partnerships: Innovations in Practice|year=2002|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=1-56898-379-4|pages=6–7|url=http://www.nea.gov/pub/UnivCommDesign.pdf|editor=Mark Robbins|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a variety of design services – such as affordable housing - within their own neighborhoods.

In architecture schools, “design/build programs” provided outreach to meet local design needs, particularly in low-income and underserved areas.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;  One of the earliest design/build programs was [[Yale University]]’s Vlock Building Project.  The project, which was initiated by students at Yale University School of Architecture in 1967, requires graduate students to design and build low-income housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=David|title=The New Frontier in Education|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2012/03/The-New-Frontier-Education.asp|publisher=Architectural Record|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most publicized programs is the [[Auburn University]] [[Rural Studio]] design/build program, which was founded in 1993.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clemence|first=Sara|title=Avant-Garde in Alabama|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304356604577342370002244732|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bostwick|first=William|title="Citizen Architect": The Humble Origins of Socially-Responsible Design|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1585096/citizen-architect-humble-origins-socially-responsible-design|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rural Studio’s first project, Bryant House, was completed in 1994 for $16,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samuel Mockbee and the Rural Studio: Community Architecture|url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/samuel-mockbee.html|publisher=National Building Museum|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Interest Design from the 1990s – Present==
Interest in public interest design – particularly socially responsible architecture – began to grow during the 1990s and continued into the first decade of the new millennium.  Conferences, books, and exhibitions began to showcase the design work being done beyond the community design centers,&lt;ref name=Cary /&gt; which had greatly decreased in numbers since their peak in the seventies.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;

[[Non-profit]] organizations – including [[Architecture for Humanity]], BaSiC Initiative, Design Corps, [[Public Architecture]], Project H, Project Locus, and MASS Design Group – began to provide design services that served a larger segment of the population than had been served by traditional design professions.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=C.J.|title=Does "Doing Good" Pay the Bills?|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/practice/Community-Service/2012/03/perspective-practice/Humanitarian-Work.asp|publisher=Architectural Record|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allweil|first1=Yael|title=The House of Dance and Feathers Mardi Gras Indian Museum-New Orleans, LA by Project Locus: Patrick Rhodes, Executive Director [EDRA/Places Awards 2007--Design].|journal=Places|date=2007|volume=19|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public interest design organizations also provide training and [[service-learning]] programs for architecture students and graduates.  In 1999, the Enterprise Rose Architectural Fellowship was established,&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; giving young architects the opportunity to work on three-year-long design and community development projects in low-income communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterprisecommunity.com/solutions-and-innovation/design-leadership/rose-architectural-fellowship/about-the-fellowship Enterprise Community website, "About the Fellowship"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the earliest formal public interest design programs include the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio at Mississippi State University&lt;ref name=Cary&gt;{{cite web|last=Cary|first=John|title=Chronology of the Public Interest Design Field|url=http://www.publicinterestdesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Public-Interest-Design-Chronology-120601.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012|coauthors=PublicInterestDesign.org, University of Minnesota College of Design, Tandus Flooring}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Public Interest Design Summer Program at the [[University of Texas]]&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;

The first professional-level training was conducted in July 2011 by the Public Interest Design Institute (PIDI) and held at the [[Harvard]] Graduate School of Design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicinterestdesign.com/harvard-school-of-design%20 Harvard School of Design course description]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, a survey of [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA), 77% of AIA members agreed that the mission of the professional practice of public interest design could be defined as the belief that every person should be able to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Bryan|title=Public Interest Design Takes Shape|url=http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20120917/public-interest-design-takes-shape|publisher=Metropolismag.com|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Bryan|author2=Roberta Feldman |author3=Sergio Palleroni |author4=Davide Perkes |title=2011 Latrobe Prize Progress Report: Public Interest Practices in Architecture|date=31 December 2011|url=http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/aia/documents/pdf/aiab094604.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Structures for Inclusion conference showcases public interest design projects from around the world.  The first conference, which was held in 2000, was called “Design for the 98% Without Architects."&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; Speaking at the conference, Rural Studio co-founder [[Samuel Mockbee]] challenged attendees to serve a greater segment of the population: “I believe most of us would agree that American architecture today exists primarily within a thin band of elite social and economic conditions&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Bryan|title=Good Deeds, Good Design: Community Service Through Architecture|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1568983912|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;...in creating architecture, and ultimately community, it should make no difference which economic or social type is served, as long as the status quo of the actual world is transformed by an imagination that creates a proper harmony for both the affluent and the disadvantaged.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;" 

In 2007, the [[Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum]] held an exhibition, titled “Design for the Other 90%,” curated by Cynthia Smith. Following the success of this exhibit, Smith developed the "Design Other 90" initiative into an ongoing series, the second of which was titled “Design for the Other 90%: CITIES”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/design-other-90-cities Design for the Other 90%: CITIES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016121902/http://www.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/design-other-90-cities |date=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2011), held at the [[United Nations]] headquarters. In 2010, Andres Lipek of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York curated an exhibit, called “Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/smallscalebigchange/ MoMA Exhibition: "Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement"]&lt;/ref&gt;”&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;

==Professional Networks==
One of the oldest professional networks related to public interest design is the professional organization is the Association for Community Design (ACD), which was founded in 1977.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communitydesign.org/about Association for Community Design website, "About" page]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non primary source needed}}

In 2005, adopting a term coined by architect Kimberly Dowdell, the Social Economic Environmental Design (SEED) Network was co-founded by a group of community design leaders,&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; during a meeting hosted by the Loeb Fellowship at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. The SEED Network established a common set of five principles and criteria for practitioners of public interest design. An evaluation tool called the SEED Evaluator is available to assist designers and practitioners in developing projects that align with SEED Network goals and criteria.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 2006, the Open Architecture Network was launched by [[Architecture for Humanity]] in conjunction with co-founder [[Cameron Sinclair]]'s TED Wish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/cameron_sinclair_on_open_source_architecture.html Cameron Sinclair's TED Prize talk and wish for the Open Architecture Network]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non primary source needed}} Taking on the name Worldchanging in 2011, the network is an open-source community dedicated to improving living conditions through innovative and sustainable design. Designers of all persuasions can share ideas, designs and plans as well as collaborate and manage projects. while protecting their intellectual property rights using the [[Creative Commons]] "some rights reserved" licensing system.

In 2007, DESIGN 21: Social Design Network, an online platform built in partnership with UNESCO, was launched.

In 2011, the Design Other 90 Network was launched by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in conjunction with its Design with the Other 90%: CITIES exhibition.

In 2012, IDEO.org, with the support of The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, launched HCD Connect, a network for social sector leaders committed to human-centered design. In this context, human-centered design begins with the end-user of a product, place, or system — taking into account their needs, behaviors and desires. The fast-growing professional network of 15,000 builds on "The Human-Centered Design Toolkit,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/ The Human-Centered Design Toolkit from IDEO]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non-primary source needed|date=January 2018}} which was designed specifically for people, nonprofits, and social enterprises that work with low-income communities throughout the world. People using the HCD Toolkit or human-centered design in the social sector now have a place to share their experiences, ask questions, and connect with others working in similar areas or on similar challenges.

'''Public open space''' is often referred to by [[urban planner]]s and [[landscape architect]]s by the acronym 'POS'. Varied interpretations of the term are possible.

'Public' can mean:
* owned by a national or local government body
* owned by 'public' body (e.g. a not-for-profit organization) and held in trust for the public
* owned by a private individual or organization but made available for public use or available public access, see [[privately owned public space]] (POPS)

'Open' can mean:
* open for public access
* open for public recreation
* outdoors, i.e. not a space within a building
* vegetated

Depending on which of these definitions are adopted, any of the following could be called Public Open Space:

* a [[public park]]
* a [[town square]]
* a [[greenway (landscape)|greenway]] which is open to the public but runs through farmland or a forest
* a public [[highway]]
* a [[private road]] with public access

'''Social interpretations of race''' regard the common [[Race (human categorization)|categorizations of people into different races]], often with [[Biological determinism|biologist]] tagging of particular "racial" attributes beyond mere anatomy, as more socially and culturally determined than based upon biology. Some interpretations are often [[deconstruction]]ist and [[Post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] in that they critically analyze the [[Historical race concepts|historical construction and development of racial categories]].

{{Race}}

==Social interpretation of physical variation==

=== Incongruities of racial classifications===
Marks (1995) argued that even as the idea of "race" was becoming a powerful organizing principle in many societies, the shortcomings of the concept were apparent. In the Old World, the gradual transition in appearances from one racial group to adjacent racial groups emphasized that "one variety of mankind does so sensibly pass into the other, that you cannot mark out the limits between them," as Blumenbach observed in his writings on human variation.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marks, ''Human Biodiversity: Genes, Race, and History (New York: Aldine de Gruyter, 1995), 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In parts of the Americas, the situation was somewhat different. The immigrants to the New World came largely from widely separated regions of the Old World—western and northern Europe, western Africa, and, later, eastern Asia and southern and eastern Europe. In the Americas, the immigrant populations began to [[miscegenation|mix]] among themselves and with the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] inhabitants of the continent. In the United States, for example, most people who self-identify as African American have some European ancestors—in one analysis of genetic markers that have differing frequencies between continents, European ancestry ranged from an estimated 7% for a sample of Jamaicans to ∼23% for a sample of African Americans from New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parra | first1 = Esteban J. | year = 1998 | title = Estimating African American Admixture Proportions by Use of Population-Specific Alleles | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 63 | issue = 6| pages = 1839–51 | doi=10.1086/302148 | pmid=9837836 | pmc=1377655}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of college students who self-identified as [[White people|white]] in a northeastern U.S. university, the west African and Native American genetic contribution were 0.7% and 3.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shriver | first1 = Mark D. | year = 2003 | title = Skin Pigmentation, Biogeographical Ancestry, and Admixture Mapping | doi = 10.1007/s00439-002-0896-y | pmid = 12579416 | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 112 | issue = 4| pages = 387–99 | doi-broken-date = 2018-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, social and legal conventions developed over time that forced individuals of mixed ancestry into simplified racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. Gossett, ''Race: The History of an Idea in America'', New ed. (New York: Oxford University, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the "[[one-drop rule]]" implemented in some state laws that treated anyone with a single known African American ancestor as black.&lt;ref&gt;F. James Davis, ''Who is Black?: One Nation's Definition'' (University Park PA: State University of Pennsylvania, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The decennial censuses conducted since 1790 in the United States also created an incentive to establish racial categories and fit people into those categories.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nobles, ''Shades of Citizenship: Race and the Census in Modern Politics'' (Stanford: Stanford University, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; In other countries in the Americas, where mixing among groups was more extensive, social non racial categories have tended to be more numerous and fluid, with people moving into or out of categories on the basis of a combination of socioeconomic status, social class, ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Mörner, ''Race Mixture in the History of Latin America'' (Boston: Little Brown, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to sort the increasingly mixed population of the United States into discrete racial categories generated many difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;P.R. Spickard, "The illogic of American racial categories," in M.P.P. Root, ed., ''Racially mixed people in America'' (Newbury Park CA: Sage, 1992), 12–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, efforts to track mixing between census racial groups led to a proliferation of categories (such as [[mulatto]] and [[octoroon]]) and "blood quantum" distinctions that became increasingly untethered from self-reported ancestry.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A person's racial identity can change over time. One study found differences between self-ascribed race and [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] administrative data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kressin | first1 = N.R. | display-authors = etal   | date = Oct 2003 | title = Agreement between administrative data and patients' self-reports of race/ethnicity | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = 10| pages = 1734–9 | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.10.1734| pmid = 14534230 | pmc = 1448042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race as a social construct and populationism===
{{multiple issues|section=yes|{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

The notion of a biological basis for race originally emerged through speculations surrounding the "blood purity" of Jews during the Spanish Inquisition, eventually translating to a general association of one's biology with their social and personal characteristics. In the 19th century, this recurring ideology was intensified in the development of the racial sciences, eugenics and ethnology, which meant to further categorize groups of humans in terms of biological superiority or inferiority.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking the Color Line: Readings in Race and Ethnicity|last=Gallagher|first=Charles A.|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|others=|year=2011|isbn=978-0078026638|location=|pages=|chapter="Defining Race and Ethnicity"|quote="In the nineteenth century, race and racial differences were the preeminent concerns of the racial sciences, eugenics and ethnology, better known today as scientific racism.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field of racial sciences, also known as [[scientific racism]], has expired in history, these antiquated conceptions of race have persisted throughout the 21st century. (See also: [[Race (human categorization)|Historical origins of racial classification]])

Contrary to popular belief that the division of the human species based on physical variations is natural, there exists no clear, reliable distinctions that bind people to such groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue/|title=Race Is a Social Construct, Scientists Argue|last=Gannon,LiveScience|first=Megan|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[American Anthropological Association]], "Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups.

Genetic diversity has characterized human survival, rendering the idea of a "pure" ancestry as obsolete.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Under this interpretation, race is conceptualized through a lens of artificiality, rather than through the skeleton of a scientific discovery. As a result, scholars have begun to broaden discourses of race by defining it as a social construct and exploring the historical contexts that led to its inception and persistence in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Racial Formation in the United States|last=Omi|first=Michael|last2=Winant|first2=Howard|publisher=Routledge|year=1986|isbn=978-0415520317|location=|pages=|chapter=Racial Formations|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even those who reject the formal concept of race, however, still use the word ''race'' in day-to-day speech. This may either be a matter of [[semantics]], or an effect of an underlying cultural significance of race in racist societies. Regardless of the name, a working concept of sub-species grouping can be useful, because in the absence of cheap and widespread genetic tests, various race-linked gene mutations (see [[Cystic fibrosis]], [[Lactose intolerance]], [[Tay–Sachs disease]] and [[Sickle cell anemia]]) are difficult to address without recourse to a category between "individual" and "species". As genetic tests for such conditions become cheaper, and as detailed [[haplotype]] maps and [[Single nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] databases become available, identifiers of race should diminish. Also, increasing interracial marriage is reducing the predictive power of race. For example, babies born with [[Tay-Sachs disease]] in North America are not only or primarily Ashkenazi Jews, despite stereotypes to contrary; French Canadians, Louisiana Cajuns, and Irish-Americans also see high rates of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tay-sachs.org/taysachs_disease.php|title=Tay-sachs Disease :: National Tay-Sachs &amp; Allied Diseases Association of Delaware Valley (NTSAD-DV)|website=www.tay-sachs.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts in the fields of genetics, law, and [[sociology]] have offered their opinions on the subject. Audrey Smedley and [[Brian D. Smedley]] of Virginia Commonwealth University Institute of Medicine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smedley|first1=Audrey|last2=Smedley|first2=Brian D.|title=Race as Biology Is Fiction, Racism as a Social Problem Is Real|date=1994|pages=16–26|url=http://aaronhood.net/wp-content/SocialConstructionRace.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; discuss the anthropological and historical perspectives on ethnicity, culture, and race. They define culture as the habits acquired by a society. Smedley states "Ethnicity and culture are related phenomena and bear no intrinsic connection to human biological variations or race" (Smedley 17). The authors state using physical characteristics to define an ethnic identity is inaccurate. The variation of humans has actually decreased over time since, as the author states, "Immigration, intermating, intermarriage, and reproduction have led to increasing physical heterogeneity of peoples in many areas of the world" (Smedley 18). They referred to other experts and their research, pointing out that humans are 99% alike. That one percent is caused by natural genetic variation, and has nothing to do with the ethnic group of the subject. Racial classification in the United States started in the 1700s with three ethnically distinct groups. These groups were the white Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans. The concept of race was skewed around these times because of the social implications of belonging to one group or another. The view that one race is biologically different from another rose out of society's grasp for power and authority over other ethnic groups. This did not only happen in the United States but around the world as well. Society created race to create hierarchies in which the majority would prosper most.
 
Another group of experts in sociology has written on this topic. Guang Guo, Yilan Fu, Yi Li, Kathleen Mullan Harris of the University of North Carolina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guo|first1=Guang|last2=Yilan|first2=Fu|last3=Hedwig|first3=Lee|last4=Tianji|first4=Cai|last5=Li|first5=Yi|last6=Harris|first6=Kathleen Mullan|title=Recognizing a Small Amount of Superficial Genetic Differences across African, European and Asian Americans Helps Understand Social Construction of Race|journal=Demography, December 2014|date=2014|volume=51|issue=6|pages=2337–2342|doi=10.1007/s13524-014-0349-y|pmid=25421523}}&lt;/ref&gt; department of sociology as well as Hedwig Lee (University of Washington Seattle), Tianji Cai (University of Macau) comment on remarks made by one expert. The debate is over DNA differences, or lack thereof, between different races. The research in the original article they are referring to uses different methods of DNA testing between distinct ethnic groups and compares them to other groups. Small differences were found, but those were not based on race. They were from biological differences caused from the region in which the people live. They describe that the small differences cannot be fully explained because the understanding of migration, intermarriage, and ancestry is unreliable at the individual level. Race cannot be related to ancestry based on the research on which they are commenting. They conclude that the idea of "races as biologically distinct peoples with differential abilities and behaviors has long been discredited by the scientific community" (2338).

One more expert in the field has given her opinion. Ann Morning of the New York University Department of Sociology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morning|first1=Ann|title=Does Genomics Challenge the Social Construction of Race?|journal=Sociological Theory|date=2014|volume=32|issue=3|pages=189–207|url=http://stx.sagepub.com/content/32/3/189|accessdate=13 April 2015|doi=10.1177/0735275114550881}}&lt;/ref&gt; and member of the [[American Sociological Association]], discusses the role of biology in the social construction of race. She examines the relationship between genes and race and the social construction of social race clusters. Morning states that everyone is assigned to a racial group because of their physical characteristics. She identifies through her research the existence of DNA population clusters.  She states that society would want to characterize these clusters as races. Society characterizes race as a set of physical characteristics. The clusters though have an overlap in physical characteristics and thus cannot be counted as a race by society or by science. Morning concludes that "Not only can constructivist theory accommodate or explain the occasional alignment of social classifications and genetic estimates that Shiao et al.'s model hypothesizes, but empirical research on human genetics is far from claiming—let alone demonstrating—that statistically inferred clusters are the equivalent of races" (Morning 203). Only using ethnic groups to map a genome is entirely inaccurate, instead every individual must be viewed as having their own wholly unique genome (unique in the 1%, not the 99% all humans share).

Ian Haney López, the John H. Boalt Professor of Law at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haney Lopez|first1=Ian|title=The Social Construction of Race|journal=Critical Race Theory|date=1994|pages=191–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains ways race is a social construct. He uses examples from history of how race was socially constructed and interpreted. One such example was of the [[Hudgins v. Wright]] case. A slave woman sued for her freedom and the freedom of her two children on the basis that her grandmother was Native American. The race of the Wright had to be socially proven, and neither side could present enough evidence. Since the slave owner Hudgins bore the burden of proof, Wright and her children gained their freedom. López uses this example to show the power of race in society. Human fate, he argues, still depends upon ancestry and appearance. Race is a powerful force in everyday life. These races are not determined by biology though, they are created by society to keep power with the majority. He describes that there are not any genetic characteristics that all blacks have that non-whites do not possess and vice versa. He uses the example of Mexican. It truly is a nationality, yet it has become a catch-all for all Hispanic nationalities. This simplification is wrong, López argues, for it is not only inaccurate but it tends to treat all "Mexicans" as below fervent Americans. He describes that "More recently, genetic testing has made it clear the close connections all humans share, as well as the futility of explaining those differences that do exist in terms of racially relevant gene codes" (Lopez 199–200). Those differences clearly have no basis in ethnicity, so race is completely socially constructed.

Through this small sampling of experts, it is clear that race as a social construction is a common theory. All of the experts in this sampling say that biological race is non-existent. Race therefore must have been created by societies. They were created to do what humans do, to serve the purposes of the majority. The hierarchies created by race have kept the majority "race" in control of everything from public policy to the workforce to law enforcement. They benefit from this construction of race. Yet, the minorities, who are just the same genetically, suffer under this system. Most of the points made by the experts expose this issue, yet none truly suggest a way to fix the problem. Bill Nye weighs in on the issue on the same side as the experts in the sample. He says that humans are humans, we are all one species. We have to fix it. If society created the problem, society has to take it on itself to fix it.

Some{{who|date=October 2013}} argue it is preferable when considering biological relations to think in terms of populations, and when considering cultural relations to think in terms of [[ethnicity]], rather than of race.

These developments had important consequences. For example, some scientists{{who|date=October 2013}} developed the notion of "population" to take the place of race. It is argued that this substitution is not simply a matter of exchanging one word for another.

This view does not deny that there are physical differences among peoples; it simply claims that the historical conceptions of "race" are not particularly useful in accounting for these differences scientifically. In particular, it is claimed{{by whom|date=October 2013}} that:

# knowing someone's "race" does not provide comprehensive predictive information about biological characteristics, and only absolutely predicts those traits that have been selected to define the racial categories, e.g. knowing a person's skin color, which is generally acknowledged to be one of the markers of race (or taken as a defining characteristic of race), does not allow good predictions of a person's blood type to be made.
# in general, the worldwide distribution of human phenotypes exhibits gradual trends of difference across geographic zones, not the categorical differences of race; in particular, there are many peoples (like the San of S. W. Africa, or the people of northern India) who have phenotypes that do not neatly fit into the standard race categories.
# focusing on race has historically led not only to seemingly insoluble disputes about classification (e.g. are the Japanese a distinct race, a mixture of races, or part of the East Asian race? and what about the [[Ainu people|Ainu]]?) but has also exposed disagreement about the criteria for making decisions—the selection of phenotypic traits seemed arbitrary.

[[Neven Sesardic]] has argued that such arguments are unsupported by empirical evidence and politically motivated. Arguing that races are not completely discrete biologically is a [[straw man]] argument. He argues "racial recognition is not actually based on a single trait (like skin color) but rather on a number of characteristics that are to a certain extent concordant and that jointly make the classification not only possible but fairly reliable as well". Forensic anthropologists can classify a person's race with an accuracy close to 100% using only skeletal remains if they take into consideration several characteristics at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sesardic | first1 = Neven | title = Race: a social destruction of a biological concept | doi = 10.1007/s10539-009-9193-7 | journal = Biology &amp; Philosophy | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–162 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.638.939 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.W.F. Edwards]] has argued similarly regarding genetic differences in "[[Human genetic diversity: Lewontin's fallacy]]".

===Race and intelligence===
{{Main article|Race and intelligence}}
Researchers have reported significant differences in the average [[IQ]] test scores of various racial groups. The interpretation and causes of these differences are controversial, as researchers disagree about whether this gap is caused by genetic differences. The social interpretations of the race concept is incompatible with the idea that the IQ gap between racial groups is caused by genetic factors, and those who see race as a social construction posit purely environmental and sociological explanations for the gap. Such explanations include different access to education for different racial groups, different social attitudes towards test-taking, [[stereotype threat]], lack of [[effort optimism]] due to low social status and many other proposed explanations. For example, psychologist [[Jefferson Fish]] argues that race is a social construction and argues that for this reason the question of racial differences in intelligence is not scientific, though his opinion has been repeatedly disproven. For example, one might want to compare black-white IQ differences in Brazil with those in the United States. Since many people who are considered black in the U. S. would not be considered black in Brazil, and since many people who are considered white in Brazil would not be considered white in the U. S., such a comparison is not possible.&lt;ref&gt;Fish, J. M.  (Ed.)  (2002).  Race and intelligence: Separating science from myth.  Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Richard Lynn]], however, in his book ''[[Race Differences in Intelligence (book)|Race Differences in Intelligence]]'' does not define races based on current social classification but on ancestral populations. Many current ethnic groups would be mixtures of several races in this classification. [[Arthur Jensen]] and [[J. Philippe Rushton]] have also defined race based on ancestral home, although somewhat differently from Lynn, when speaking of Black–White–East Asian IQ differences in the US. "Blacks (Africans, Negroids) are those who have most of their ancestors from sub-Saharan Africa; Whites (Europeans, Caucasoids) have most of their ancestors from Europe; and East Asians (Orientals, Mongoloids) have most of their ancestors from Pacific Rim countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Rushton| first1 = J.

===Race in biomedicine===
{{Main article|Race in biomedicine}}
There is an active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of race in their research. The primary impetus for considering race in biomedical research is the possibility of improving the prevention and treatment of [[disease]]s by predicting hard-to-ascertain factors on the basis of more easily ascertained characteristics. The most well-known examples of genetically determined disorders that vary in incidence between ethnic groups would be [[sickle cell disease]] and [[thalassemia]] among black and [[Mediterranean]] populations respectively and [[Tay–Sachs disease]] among people of [[Ashkenazi|Ashkenazi Jewish]] descent. Some fear that the use of racial labels in biomedical research runs the risk of unintentionally exacerbating health disparities, so they suggest alternatives to the use of racial taxonomies.

{{Main article|Race in the United States}}
In the United States since its early history, Native Americans, African-Americans and European-Americans were classified as belonging to different races. For nearly three centuries, the criteria for membership in these groups were similar, comprising a person's appearance, his fraction of known non-White ancestry, and his social circle.&lt;ref&gt;See "Chapter 9.

====Race definitions in the United States====
{{Main article|Race and ethnicity in the United States Census}}
The concept of race as used by the Census Bureau reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify. These categories are sociopolitical constructs and should not be interpreted as being scientific or anthropological in nature. They change from one census to another, and the racial categories include both racial and national-origin groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68178.htm "American Indian and Alaska Native persons, percent, 2000"]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207222529/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/meta/long_68178.htm |date=February 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race in Brazil===
{{Main article|Race in Brazil}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Compared to 19th-century United States, 20th-century [[Demographics of Brazil|Brazil]] was characterized by a relative absence of sharply defined racial groups. This pattern reflects a different history and different [[social relations]]. Basically, [[Demographics of Brazil|race in Brazil]] was recognized as the difference between ancestry (which determines genotype) and phenotypic differences. Racial identity was not governed by a rigid descent rule. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Over a dozen racial categories are recognized in conformity with the combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred to appearance, not heredity.

Through this system of racial identification, parents and children and even brothers and sisters were frequently accepted as representatives of opposite racial types. In a fishing village in the state of [[Bahia]], an investigator showed 100 people pictures of three sisters and they were asked to identify the races of each. In only six responses were the sisters identified by the same racial term. Fourteen responses used a different term for each sister. In another experiment nine portraits were shown to a hundred people. Forty different racial types were elicited. It was found, in addition, that a given Brazilian might be called by as many as thirteen different terms by other members of the community. These terms are spread out across practically the entire spectrum of theoretical racial types. A further consequence of the absence of a descent rule was that Brazilians apparently not only disagreed about the racial identity of specific individuals, but they also seemed to be in disagreement about the abstract meaning of the racial terms as defined by words and phrases. For example, 40% of a sample ranked moreno claro as a lighter type than mulato claro, while 60% reversed this order. A further note of confusion is that one person might employ different racial terms to describe the same person over a short time span. The choice of which racial description to use may vary according to both the personal relationships and moods of the individuals involved. The [[Brazilian census]] lists one's race according to the preference of the person being interviewed. As a consequence, hundreds of races appeared in the census results, ranging from blue (which is blacker than the usual black) to pink (which is whiter than the usual white).{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

However, Brazilians are not so naïve to ignore one's racial origins just because of his (or her) better social status. An interesting example of this phenomenon has occurred recently, when the famous [[association football|football (soccer)]] player [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] declared publicly that he considered himself as [[White people|White]], thus linking racism to a form or another of [[class conflict]]. This caused a series of ironic notes on newspapers, which pointed out that he should have been proud of his African origin (which is obviously noticeable), a fact that must have made life for him (and for his ancestors) more difficult, so, being a successful personality was, in spite of that, a victory for him. What occurs in Brazil that differentiates it largely from the US or South Africa, for example, is that black or mixed-race people are, in fact, more accepted in social circles if they have more education, or have a successful life (a euphemism for "having a better salary"). As a consequence, inter-racial marriages are more common, and more accepted, among highly educated [[Afro-Brazilian]]s than lower-educated ones.

So, although the identification of a person by race is far more fluid and flexible in Brazil than in the U.S., there still are racial stereotypes and prejudices. African features have been considered less desirable; Blacks have been considered socially inferior, and Whites superior. These white [[supremacist]] values were a legacy of European colonization and the slave-based [[plantation system]]. The complexity of racial classifications in Brazil is reflective of the extent of [[miscegenation]] in [[Demographics of Brazil|Brazilian society]], which remains highly, but not strictly, [[social stratification|stratified]] along color lines. Henceforth, Brazil's desired image as a perfect "post-racist" country, composed of the "cosmic race" celebrated in 1925 by [[José Vasconcelos]], must be met with caution, as sociologist [[Gilberto Freyre]] demonstrated in 1933 in ''Casa Grande e Senzala''.

===Race in politics and ethics===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2010}}
[[Michel Foucault]] argued the popular historical and political use of a non-[[essentialist]] notion of "race" used in the "[[Philosophy of history#Michel Foucault's analyze of the historical and political discourse|race struggle" discourse]] during the 1688 [[Glorious Revolution]] and under [[Louis XIV]]'s end of reign. In Foucault's view, this discourse developed in two different directions: [[Marxism]], which seized the notion and transformed it into "[[class struggle]]" discourse, and [[racism|racists]], biologists and [[eugenicists]], who paved the way for 20th century "[[state racism]]".

During [[the Enlightenment]], racial classifications were used to justify [[slavery|enslavement]] of those deemed to be of "inferior", non-White races, and thus supposedly best fitted for lives of toil under White supervision. These classifications made the distance between races seem nearly as broad as that between species, easing unsettling questions about the appropriateness of such treatment of humans. The practice was at the time generally accepted by both scientific and lay communities.

[[Arthur Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–1855) was one of the milestones in the new [[racist]] [[discourse]], along with [[Vacher de Lapouge]]'s "anthroposociology" and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803), who applied race to [[nationalism|nationalist]] theory to develop militant [[ethnic nationalism]]. They posited the historical existence of national races such as German and French, branching from basal races supposed to have existed for millennia, such as the [[Aryan race]], and believed political boundaries should mirror these supposed racial ones.

Later, one of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s favorite sayings was, "Politics is applied biology". Hitler's ideas of racial purity led to unprecedented atrocities in Europe. Since then, [[ethnic cleansing]] has occurred in [[Cambodia]], the [[Balkans]], [[darfur conflict|Sudan]], and [[Rwandan Genocide|Rwanda]]. In one sense, ''ethnic cleansing'' is another name for the tribal warfare and mass murder that has afflicted human society for ages.

Racial inequality has been a concern of United States politicians and legislators since the country's founding. In the 19th century most White Americans (including [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]]s) explained racial inequality as an inevitable consequence of biological differences. Since the mid-20th century, political and civic leaders as well as scientists have debated to what extent racial inequality is cultural in origin. Some argue that current inequalities between Blacks and Whites are primarily cultural and historical, the result of past and present racism, [[slavery]] and [[Racial segregation|segregation]], and could be redressed through such programs as [[affirmative action]] and [[Head Start program|Head Start]]. Others work to reduce tax funding of remedial programs for minorities. They have based their advocacy on aptitude test data that, according to them, shows that racial ability differences are biological in origin and cannot be leveled even by intensive educational efforts. In [[Election|electoral politics]], many more ethnic minorities have won important offices in Western nations than in earlier times, although the highest offices tend to remain in the hands of Whites.

In his famous ''[[Letter from Birmingham Jail]]'', [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] observed:
:History is the long and tragic story of the fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] has reminded us, groups are more immoral than individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Letter From Birmingham City Jail (Excerpts) |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/document/letter-from-birmingham-city-jail-excerpts/ |title=Letter From Birmingham City Jail (Excerpts) |publisher=Teaching American History |date=1963-04-16 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King's hope, expressed in his [[I Have a Dream]] speech, was that the [[civil rights]] struggle would one day produce a society where people were not "judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character".

Because of the identification of the concept of race with political oppression, many natural and social scientists today are wary of using the word "race" to refer to human variation, but instead use less emotive words such as "population" and "ethnicity". Some, however, argue that the concept of race, whatever the term used, is nevertheless of continuing utility and validity in scientific research. Science and politics frequently take opposite sides in debates that relate to human intelligence and biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suhay|first=Elizabeth|last2=Jayaratne|first2=Toby Epstein|date=2013|title=Does Biology Justify Ideology?

==Race in law enforcement==

In an attempt to provide general descriptions that may facilitate the job of [[law enforcement officer]]s seeking to apprehend suspects, the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] employs the term "race" to summarize the general appearance (skin color, hair texture, eye shape, and other such easily noticed characteristics) of individuals whom they are attempting to apprehend. From the perspective of law enforcement officers, a description needs to capture the features that stand out most clearly in the perception within the given society.

Thus, in the UK, [[Scotland Yard]] use a classification based on the [[ethnic groups in the UK|ethnic composition]] of [[British society]]: W1 ([[White British]]), W2 ([[White Irish]]), W9 ([[Other White]]); M1 (White and black Caribbean), M2 (White and black African), M3 (White and Asian), M9 (Any other mixed background); A1 (Asian-Indian), A2 (Asian-Pakistani), A3 (Asian-Bangladeshi), A9 (Any other Asian background); B1 (Black Caribbean), B2 (Black African), B3 (Any other black background); O1 (Chinese), O9 (Any other).

In the United States, the practice of [[racial profiling]] has been ruled to be both [[unconstitutional]] and also to constitute a violation of [[civil rights]]. There also an ongoing debate on the relationship between [[Race and crime in the United States|race and crime]] regarding the disproportional representation of certain minorities in all stages of the criminal justice system.

Studies in racial taxonomy based on DNA cluster analysis (See [[Lewontin's Fallacy]]) has led law enforcement to pursue suspects based on their racial classification as derived from their DNA evidence left at the crime scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051115054204/http://transobj.workopolis.com/servlet/Content/fasttrack/20050625/DNA25?section=Biotech|url=http://transobj.workopolis.com:80/servlet/Content/fasttrack/20050625/DNA25?section=Biotech|title=Molecular eyewitness: DNA gets a human face Controversial crime-scene test smacks of racial profiling, critics say - workopolis.com|archivedate=15 November 2005|publisher=|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA analysis has been successful in helping police determine the race of both victims and perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-08-16-dna_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=DNA tests detect race | first1=Richard | last1=Willing | date=2005-08-16 | accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racialization or ethnicization is often borne out of the interaction of a group with a group that it [[Domination (sociology)|dominates]] and ascribes identity for the purpose of continued domination. While it is often borne out of domination, the racialized and ethnicized group often gradually identifies with and even embraces the ascribed identity and thus becomes a self-ascribed race or ethnicity. These processes have been common across the history of [[imperialism]], [[nationalism]], and racial and ethnic hierarchies.

== History of Racialization ==
Racial categories have historically been used as a way to allow an oppressive figure or group discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gans|first=Herbert J.|title=Racialization and racialization research|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4030486/mod_resource/content/2/Racialization%20and%20racialization%20research.pdf|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=341–352|doi=10.1080/01419870.2017.1238497|via=Routledge, Taylor and Francis Group|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Denny|first=Walter Bell|date=Jul-Oct 1983|title=Orientalism in European Art|journal=The Muslim World|volume=73| issue = 3–4|pages=262–277|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1983.tb03268.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of the most prominent examples of [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] work in art is a piece by [[Eugène Delacroix]] titled ''[[Women of Algiers|Women of Algiers in their Apartment]].''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/france/articles/the-top-10-orientalist-artworks/|title=An Introduction To 'Orientalist' Art In 10 Famous Works|last=Morfin|first=Marcelina|work=Culture Trip|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a [[harem]] in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fine [[textile]]s, [[hookah]]s, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through [[Orientalism]] led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Many [[North Africa]]n and [[Middle East]]ern countries were colonized by European nations, such as [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://coldwarstudies.com/2013/01/11/history-of-colonization-in-the-middle-east-and-north-africa-mena-precursor-to-cold-war-conflict/|title=History of Colonization in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA): Precursor to Cold War Conflict|last=|first=|date=|website=coldwarstudies.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These countries were not fully independent until the mid-twentieth century, a time in which [[globalization]] began to rise both economically and politically.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With the rise of globalization came an expanding cultural influence and an increase in [[immigration]] to Western nations. New cultures, ethnic groups, and ideals have contributed to the process of racialization which is familiar in modern society. Racialization is a long process, and members of each group are categorized based on their perceived differences relative to those who are considered elite within a society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another major contributor to the process of racialization is the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; News outlets, films, television shows, and other forms of public communication portray racial groups to often reflect [[stereotype]]s which contribute to the public’s opinion of certain cultural groups. These opinions and stereotypes may become institutionalized and racial groups must then encounter the [[Institutionalized Racism|institutionalized racism]] that is a result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Dominant groups in a society tend to racialize others because new cultural and racial groups are seen as threatening to their society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These threats instill fear into the dominant members of the society due to the possibility of [[downward mobility]] or perceived loss of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While threats can be imagined or real, they are most prominent when there is some other issue in the nation, such as a poorly performing [[economy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The effects of racialization are often more harmful to racial and ethnic groups than the actual racialization itself, a few examples being [[Systemic racism|systemic]] and [[structural racism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further significant research in this area is aiding politicians and policy makers in creating a more equal society that embraces and supports different racial and ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Racialized incorporation ==
The process of racialization can affect newly arriving immigrants as well as their second-generation children in the United States. The concept of racialized incorporation bridges the idea of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] with [[Critical race theory|critical race studies]] in general and the concept of racialization in particular.&lt;ref name="Chaudhary 318–354"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Racialized Incorporation: The Effects of Race and Generational Status on Self-Employment and Industry-Sector Prestige in the United States|journal = International Migration Review|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1747-7379|pages = 318–354|volume = 49|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/imre.12087|language = en|first = Ali R.|last = Chaudhary}}&lt;/ref&gt; While immigrants may possess specific ethnic and cultural identities associated with their countries of origin, once they arrive in the U.S., they are incorporated into a society that is largely organized along the lines of race. The racial hierarchy in the United States is pervasive in many aspects of life including housing, education, and employment. The racialized incorporation perspective argues that regardless of the ethnic and cultural differences across immigrant groups, racial identification is the ultimate and primary principle of social organization in the United States. So an immigrant from Sweden and his/her U.S. born second-generation children are likely to be incorporated into the White mainstream, while an immigrant from Ghana and his/her U.S. born second-generation children are likely to be incorporated into the Black community.  Because the lived experiences of Whites and Blacks in U.S. society diverge in most areas of social life, the racialized category that immigrants and their children are incorporated into will largely determine their experiences and opportunities in the United States. The concept of racialized incorporation is relatively new and was recently applied in a study of self-employment in the United States.&lt;ref name="Chaudhary 318–354"/&gt;

==Racialization of religion==
An ongoing scholarly debate covers the racialization of religious communities. Adherents to [[Judaism]] and [[Islam]] can be racialized when they are portrayed as possessing certain physical characteristics, despite many individual adherents to those religions not visibly sharing in those characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meer|first=Nasar|date=2013-03-01|title=Racialization and religion: race, culture and difference in the study of antisemitism and Islamophobia|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=36|issue=3|pages=385–398|doi=10.1080/01419870.2013.734392|issn=0141-9870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joshi|first=Khyati Y.|date=2006-09-01|title=The Racialization of Hinduism, Islam, and Sikhism in the United States|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|volume=39|issue=3|pages=211–226|doi=10.1080/10665680600790327|issn=1066-5684}}&lt;/ref&gt; This racialization extends to the descendants of the adherents, even though those descendants may often convert away from active observance of the religion of their forebears but also retain the lingering cultural aspects of the religion for familial and community purposes.

The most immediate effect of the racialization of religion is said to be the [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalization]] of such racialization by the descendants of adherents, whereby the descendants of adherents accept and internalize their religiously-influenced familial culture as an ethnoracial distinction and identity. One of the applications of this racialization is [[nationalism]], whereby the created race seeks to assert cultural and [[nation]]al aspirations which are compatible and accommodating to other groups. Another one of the applications of this racialization is [[racism]] and [[discrimination]], whereby those who are racialized are barred from participation in any public or private function of [[society]] due to the negative "attributes" of the race assigned to them.

==Racialization of labor==
The racialization of labor is said to involve the segregation and appointment of workers based on perceived ethnic differences.&lt;ref&gt;Marta Maria Maldonado, {{"'}}It is their nature to do menial labour': the racialization of 'Latino/a workers' by agricultural employers", ''[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]'', vol. 32 no. 6 (July 2009), 1026. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a910770329 Link] (accessed April 14, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; This racialization of labor is said to produce a hierarchical arrangement which limits employee agency and mobility based on their race. The process of racialization is reinforced through presupposed, stereotypical qualities which are imposed upon the racialized person by the racializer.&lt;ref name=Racializationrocess&gt;Marta Maria Maldonado, "Racial Triangulation of Latino/a Workers by Agricultural Employers", ''Human Organization'', Vol. 65 No. 4, Winter 2006, 360. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a910770329 Link] (accessed April 14, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Racialization is then [[Normalization (sociology)|normalized]] by the promotion of "colourblindness" through the use of "soft" language which avoids highlighting ethnic differences.&lt;ref name=Racializationrocess /&gt;

The racialization of labor specially limits [[Labor mobility|labor mobilization]] up the workforce ladder based on race. Dominant racialized labor groups, mainly White/European workers, are generally presented more privileges than subordinate labor groups, mainly Black or Hispanic workers. The subordinate labor groups face the denial of basic citizenship rights, more exploitation, and inferior working conditions. Furthermore, they are less likely to move up in rank within a company or advance to a higher job position.

Members of the dominant race (e.g., whites) benefit from the privileges of whiteness, whether these are material or psychological, and are maintained and reproduced within social systems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murga, A. (2011). The Racialization of Day Labor Work in the U.S. Labor Market: Examining the Exploitation of Immigrant Labor. Journal of Labor Research. doi:10.1007/s12122-014-9191-7|title=Examining the U.S. Labor Market Performance of Immigrant Workers in the Presence of Network Effects|url=|journal=Journal of Labor Research|volume=36|pages=9–26|via=|doi=10.1007/s12122-014-9191-7|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, immigrant workers, especially Latino and Black workers, experience poor working conditions in day labor work. Day laborers experience "race" and this has impacted their integration into the [[Labour economics|labor market]].

Furthermore, research by Edna Bonacich, Sabrina Alimahomed Jake B. Wilson, 2008 regarding the effects of race and criminal background on employment indicates that black men need to work more than twice as hard as white men to secure the same job. Being black in America today is about the same as having a felony conviction in terms of one’s chances of finding a job. Specifically, “the combination of minority status and criminal background appears to intensify employers’ negative reactions, leaving few employment prospects for black ex-offenders (200 applications resulted in only 10 callbacks)”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonacich, E., Alimahomed, S., &amp; Wilson, J. B. (2008). The Racialization of Global Labor. American Behavioral Scientist, 52(3), 342-355. doi:10.1177/0002764208323510|title=The Racialization of Global Labor|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=52|issue=3|pages=342–355|via=|doi=10.1177/0002764208323510|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, According to Chetty, Hendren, Kline, and Saez, the effect of [[race segregation]] impacts the labor market, saying “upward income mobility is significantly lower in areas with larger African American Populations”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Race segregation may lead to divergent economic outcomes due to the fact that areas with larger black population tend to be more segregated by income and race and have adverse effects.

Lastly, the decline of [[Labor-unions|labor unions]] has negatively affected racialization of labor. Those who would have benefited from union membership no longer will as labor unions continue to diminish. In Jake Rosenfeld’s article, ''Little Labor: How Union Decline Is Changing the American Landscape'', he describes the people what no longer can benefit from labor unions: “an immigrant employee who once would have been organized, a female African -American worker no longer able to rely on a union wage to reduce pay gaps with her white counterpart, or a less-educated worker lacking the training, resources, and knowledge to participate in politics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rosenfeld, J. (2014). What Unions No Longer Do. doi:10.4159/harvard.9780674726215|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.4159/harvard.9780674726215|title=What Unions No Longer do|year=2014|isbn=9780674726215}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is less upward mobility when unions are not controlling wages and benefits.

== Racialization in Education ==
Racialization in an educational setting is apparent based on the teacher and the background they come from. The teacher’s race along with their views that came along through [[socialization]] growing up can affect the way the students portray themselves in a classroom setting. It also has to do with the amount of people who come from the same background because the majority of a population will dictate which group is being racialized. An example of students being racialized by their teachers and institutions can be seen through the way high schools teach in America today. Schools tend to teach classes that focus on a more Anglo-Saxon point of view without incorporating any diverse classes that would accommodate for the population of students that come from diverse backgrounds like Latinos, African, and Native Americans.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=San Pedro|first=Timothy|date=2016|title=Youth Voices, Public Spaces, and Civic Engagement: Truth, in the End, Is Different From What We Have Been Taught"Re-Centering Indigenous Knowledges in Public Schooling Spaces|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=68–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Desert View High School in Arizona has a great population of Native American students who wish to learn more about their [[Culture|cultural background]]  and where they came from. However, author Timothy J. San Pedro who wrote “Truth, in the End, Is Different From What We Have Been Taught: Re-Centering Indigenous Knowledges in Public Schooling Spaces” found that the school mainly focuses on the “Americanized” perspective of history that does not tell the whole story on what came to be in the Native American population. For example, San Pedro describes how the Desert View High School has posters of history classes that glorify “explorers” that were really conquerors of people who initially settled in areas that were “discovered” (San Pedro 2016). This idea of limiting the Native American population from learning about themselves forces them to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] to the culture where they are being racialized in an educational setting. They are forced to conform and be put under a racial category among their American teachers and learn things that do not pertain to their culture or [[Identity (social science)|social identity]].

== Racialization and Gender ==
Through the process of racializing [[social group]]s are distinguished and subjected to differential and unequal treatment on the basis of supposedly biological, phenotypic, cultural, and gender characteristics. Racialization can affect anyone in any race. Therefore, racialization and gender can often intersect (Elabor-Idemudia. 1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=The racialization of gender in the social construction of immigrant women in Canada: A case study of African women in a prairie province. Canadian Woman Studies, 19(3), 38-44|last=Elabor-Idemudia|first=P.|date=1999|website=.lib.umich.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=1999|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as [[racism]] and gender intersect or [[discrimination]] and gender intersect it is easy for racialization to overlap with gender. During racialization, certain racial categories are created and distinctive and stereotypical characteristics are attributed to that specific category. Within these categories, there can also be subcategories of racialization such as Caucasian man or African American women. Often immigrants who migrate to the U.S are affected by racialization if they are not white and fit more into a [[minority group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=|title=Mental images and political stories: Tracing the implicit effects of race and gender rhetoric on public opinion (Order No. 3029457).|last=Winter|first=N.J.G|date=2001|website=|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=2001|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, African American women may often be [[stereotype]]d as uneducated, loud, or improper. Through Racialization if a woman of African descent immigrated to the U.S people will attribute those same stereotypes to her because through a racial lens she fits the African American woman category. Therefore, those same stereotypes will be applied to her as well. Racialization combined with gender can also be seen through the actions of the person that is racializing the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/cared/racialization|title=Racialization: Framing and Learning Anti-Racism.|last=Changnon-Greyeyes|first=C.|date=2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such as someone crossing the street so they do not have to walk past men who appear to be African American due to the stereotypes related to African American men.

==Racialization and Incarceration==
Coming to fruition in the 1980s, the United States began to enact extensive legal reforms that worked to create a more punitive society. These reforms include mandatory [[Mandatory sentencing|minimum sentences]], trying juveniles as adults, [[Three-strikes law|three strikes and you’re out laws]], [[Truth in sentencing|truth in sentencing practices]], and many other policies and practices which served to increase our reliance on imprisonment in response to crime. As a result, U.S. society has been pegged with a “[[mass incarceration]]” structure. A recent report has concluded that nearly 1 in 100 U.S. adults are incarcerated and nearly 7.3 million Americans are either in prison or under parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Solomon|title=Prison Spending Outpaces All but Medicaid|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these reforms were intended to apply to all citizens regardless of race, this has not proven to be the reality. Statistically, these punitive reforms have disproportionately impacted African Americans. Specifically, those who are uneducated and/or live in [[low-income]] areas. Some have renamed the emergence of the “mass incarceration” society as rather the emergence of “racialized mass incarceration.” The numbers are much more alarming for African Americans behind bars. Nearly 1 in 15 African Americans are incarcerated and more narrowly 1 in 9 African American Men are incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Justice Fact Sheet|url=http://www.naacp.org/criminal-justice-fact-sheet/|website=NAACP|publisher=NAACP}}&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers point to an obvious discrimination towards blacks in the U.S. criminal justice system. 
	
One clear reason for these disproportionate imprisonment rate can be tied to poverty and social structures. In particular, a pronounced weak attachment to [[Employment|labor]] among many [[working-age]] adults in black communities has fostered a common experience of poverty and economic hardship. Ultimately this has served to create social spaces where bonds of family and community begin to fray and fall apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ditton|first1=Paula|title=Truth in Sentencing in State Prisons|journal=U.S. Department of Justice|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of environments have created higher levels of [[juvenile crime]], drug use, and even violent and gang-oriented crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Institute of Medicine and National Research|first1=Council 2001|title=Juvenile Justice|publisher=The National Academies Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although white Americans too have a history of living in [[poverty]], the average national rate of family disruption and poverty among blacks is two to four times higher than among whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sampson|first1=Robert|title=Toward a Theory of Race, Crime, and Urban Inequality|journal=Harvard|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, another reason for the United States racialized prison system can be seen with the war on drugs. Despite similar rates of drug use among blacks and whites, blacks make up 50% of those incarcerated for drug use compared to only 26% of whites. 
	
While the two examples above point to definite explanations for the United States racialized prison system, ultimately the most salient explanation for disproportionate imprisonment rates is public opinion and [[prejudice]]. Social stereotypes and stigmas have created assumptions about African Americans that make them more susceptible to arrest and imprisonment. These latter factors are often influenced by society’s outlook on the prison system. Most educated, middle to upper-class individuals, are in favor of things such as the [[death penalty]], minimum sentences, and trying juveniles as adults,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bobo|first1=Lawrence|title=Unfair by Design: The War on Drugs, Race, and the Legitimacy of the Criminal Justice System|journal=Brown|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined with social stigmas make blacks unfairly disadvantaged in the realm of [[criminal justice]]. For example, in recent times, these effects can be seen in an increase in [[police brutality]] towards minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wines|first1=Sarah|title=Police Killings Rise Slightly, Though Increased Focus May Suggest Otherwise|website=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistically, it is 2.5 times more likely for blacks to be killed than whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowery|first1=Wesley|title=More Whites killed by police, but blacks 2.5 times more likely to be killed|website=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Owen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|ɪ|n}}; 14 May 1771 – 17 November 1858) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] textile manufacturer, philanthropic social reformer, and one of the founders of [[utopian socialism]] and the [[cooperative]] movement. Owen is best known for his efforts to improve the working conditions of his factory workers and his promotion of experimental socialistic communities. In the early 1800s Owen became wealthy as an investor and eventual manager of a large textile mill at [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]]. (He initially trained as a [[draper]] in [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], Lincolnshire, and worked in [[London]] before relocating at the age of 18 to [[Manchester]] and going into business as a textile manufacturer.) In 1824 Owen travelled to America, where he invested the bulk of his fortune in an experimental socialistic community at [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], Indiana, the preliminary model for Owen's utopian society. The experiment was short-lived, lasting about two years. Other [[Owenite]] utopian communities met a similar fate. In 1828 Owen returned to the [[United Kingdom]] and settled in London, where he continued to be an advocate for the working class. In addition to his leadership in the development of [[cooperative]]s and the trade union movement, he also supported passage of child labour laws and free, co-educational schools.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Newtown Parish Register for births with an entry for Robert Owen, born June 12th 1771 (1294584).jpg|thumb|260px|Baptism record of Robert Owen in the Newtown Parish Register]]

Robert Owen was born in [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]], a small market town in [[Montgomeryshire]], Wales, on 14 May 1771, to Anne (Williams) and Robert Owen. His father was a [[saddle]]r, [[ironmongery|ironmonger]], and local postmaster; his mother was the daughter of a Newtown farming family. Young Robert was the sixth of the family's seven children, two of whom died at a young age. His surviving siblings were William, Anne, John, and Richard.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Arthur H.

Owen received little formal education, but he was an avid reader. He left school at the age of ten and was apprenticed to a [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], Lincolnshire, [[draper]] for four years. He also worked in London draper shops as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, p. 63; Podmore, pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rees&gt;{{cite web| author=Sir James Frederick Rees| title =Owen, Robert ( 1771-1858 ), Utopian Socialist | work =Dictionary of Welsh Biography | publisher =National Library of Wales | date =2007 | url = http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s-OWEN-ROB-1771.html | accessdate =30 August 2017}} (online version)&lt;/ref&gt; Around the age of eighteen, Owen moved to Manchester, where he spent the next twelve years of his life. Initially, he was employed at Satterfield's Drapery in Saint Ann's Square.&lt;ref&gt;Podmore, pp. 23, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A memorial plaque marks the firm's location.

While living in Manchester, Owen borrowed £100 from his brother, William, to enter into a partnership to make [[spinning mule]]s, a new invention for spinning cotton thread, but exchanged his share of the business within a few months for six spinning mules that he operated in a rented factory space.&lt;ref&gt;Podmore, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1792, when Owen was about twenty-one years old, mill-owner [[Peter Drinkwater]] made him manager of the [[Piccadilly Mill]] at Manchester; however, after two years of working for Drinkwater, Owen voluntarily gave up a contracted promise of partnership, left the company, and went into partnership with other entrepreneurs to establish and eventually manage the Chorlton Twist Mills in the [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]] area of Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;Podmore, pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{cite web| author= | title =Robert Owen Timeline | work = | publisher =Robert Owen Museum | date =2008 | url = http://robert-owen-museum.org.uk/time_line| format = | accessdate =29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1790s, Owen's entrepreneurial spirit, management skills, and progressive moral views were emerging. In 1793, he was elected as a member of the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]],&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt; where the ideas of [[Reformation|reformers]] and philosophers of [[age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] were discussed. He also became a committee member of the [[Manchester Board of Health]], which was instigated, principally by [[Thomas Percival]], to promote improvements in the health and working conditions of factory workers.&lt;ref name=Thornber&gt;{{cite web|first=Craig|last=Thornber|title =Thomas Percival, 1740-1804| publisher=Chesire Antiquities| url = https://www.thornber.net/cheshire/ideasmen/percival.html| accessdate = 30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kimberling&gt;{{cite web|first=Clark|last=Kimberling|title =Robert Owen (1771-1858) social reformer, founder of New Harmony| publisher = University of Evansville|url = https://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/bstud/robtowen.html| accessdate =30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
[[File:Robert Owen's House, New Lanark.jpg|thumb|260px|Robert Owen's house in [[New Lanark]], Scotland.]]

During a visit to [[Scotland]], Owen met and fell in love with Ann (or Anne) Caroline Dale, the daughter of [[David Dale]], a [[Glasgow]] philanthropist and the proprietor of New Lanark Mills, a large textile mill in [[New Lanark]], Scotland. Robert and Caroline Owen were married on 30 September 1799. Following their marriage, the Owens established their home in New Lanark, but later moved to Braxfield, Scotland.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Estabrook64&gt;Estabrook, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Dale Owen| title =Threading My Way, Twenty-seven Years of Autobiography | publisher =G.

Robert and Caroline Owen had eight children, the first of whom died in infancy. Their seven surviving children included four sons and three daughters: Robert Dale (1801–77), William (1802–42), Ann (or Anne) Caroline (1805–31), Jane Dale (1805–61), David Dale (1807–60), Richard Dale (1809–90) and Mary (1810–32).&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, pp. 72, 80, 83; {{cite book |author=Victor Lincoln Albjerg |title=Richard Owen: Scotland 1810, Indiana 1890 |series=The Archives of Purdue, no. 2|date=March 1946 |publisher= |location=Lafayette, Indiana |page=16}} See also: {{cite web| author= | title =Richard Owen | work = | publisher =Indiana Department of Administration | date = | url = http://www.in.gov/idoa/2783.htm | accessdate =September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen's four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard, as well as his daughter, Jane Dale, followed their father to the United States, becoming U.S. citizens and permanent residents of New Harmony, Indiana. Owen's wife, Caroline, and two of their daughters, Anne Caroline and Mary, remained in Britain, where they died in the 1830s.&lt;ref name=Estabrook72&gt;Estabrook, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Traces11&gt;Pitzer, "Why New Harmony is World Famous," in ''Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Lanark textile mill==
In July 1799 Owen and his partners bought the New Lanark mill from David Dale, and Owen became the New Lanark mill's manager in January 1800.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Estabrook64/&gt; Encouraged by his success in the management of cotton mills in Manchester, Owen hoped to conduct the New Lanark mill on higher principles than purely commercial ones. David Dale and [[Richard Arkwright]] had established the substantial mill at New Lanark in 1785. With its water power provided by the falls of the [[River Clyde]], the cotton-spinning operation became one of Britain's largest. About 2,000 individuals were associations with the mill; 500 of them were children who were brought to the mill at the age of five or six from the poorhouses and charities of [[Edinburgh]] and Glasgow. Dale, who was known for his benevolence, treated the children well, but the general condition of New Lanark's residents was unsatisfactory. Over the years, Dale and his son-in-law, Owen, worked to improve the factory workers' lives.&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison34&gt;John F. C. Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in {{cite book | author=Donald E.

Many of the workers were in the lowest levels of the population; theft, drunkenness, and other vices were common; education and sanitation were neglected; and most families lived in one room. The respectable country people refused to submit to the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the mills.&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism&gt;{{cite web|first=Alex|last=cullen|title =Adventures in Socialism New Lanark establishment and Orbiston community| date =1891| url =https://archive.org/stream/cu31924030362721/cu31924030362721_djvu.txt| accessdate =30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until a series of [[Truck Acts]] (1831–1887) required employees to be paid in common currency, many employers operated the [[truck system]] that paid workers in total or in part with tokens. The tokens had no monetary value outside the mill owner's "truck shop," where the owners could supply shoddy goods and charge top prices.&lt;ref name="WeekesThesis"&gt;{{cite thesis|first=Richard|last=Weekes|title =The British retail co-operative movement| type=MSa|publisher =University of Central Lancashire| date =2004| url = http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/2932/1/Weekes_2004.pdf| accessdate = 30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to other employers,  Owen's store offered goods at prices slightly above their wholesale cost.&lt;ref name=Estabrook64/&gt;
He also passed on the savings from the bulk purchase of goods to his workers, and placed the sale of alcohol under strict supervision. These principles became the basis for the cooperative shops in Britain, which continue in an altered form to trade today.&lt;ref name=Thornber /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bloy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Marjie|last=Bloy|title =Robert Owen and the Co-operative movement| publisher =A web of English History| date =4 Mar 2016| url =http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/economic/owencoop.htm | accessdate =30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and influence==
Owen tested his social and economic ideas at New Lanark, where he won the confidence of his workers and continued to have great success due to the improved efficiency at the mill. The community also earned an international reputation. Social reformers, statesmen, and royals, including the future Tsar [[Nicholas I of Russia]], visited New Lanark to study its operations and educational methods.&lt;ref name=Estabrook64/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kent Schuette| coauthors = | title =New Harmony, Indiana: Three Great Community Experiments | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =26 | issue =2 | page=45 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Spring 2014| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinions of many of these visitors were favourable.&lt;ref name=Harrison37&gt;Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen's greatest success was his support of youth education and early childcare. As a pioneer of infant care in Britain, especially Scotland, Owen provided an alternative to the "normal authoritarian approach to child education."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America, " in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The manners of the children brought up under his system were beautifully graceful, genial and unconstrained; health, plenty, and contentment prevailed; drunkenness was almost unknown; and illegitimacy extremely rare. Owen's relationship with the workers remained excellent, and all the operations of the mill proceeded with smoothness and regularity. Furthermore, the business was a commercial success.&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism /&gt;&lt;ref name=Estabrook64 /&gt;

However, some of Owen's schemes displeased his partners, forcing him to arrange for other investors to buy his share of the business in 1813 for $800,000 (US).&lt;ref name=Estabrook64/&gt; The new investors, who included [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[William Allen (Quaker)|William Allen]], a well-known [[Quaker]], were content to accept a £5000 return on their capital.&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism /&gt; The ownership change also provided Owen with an opportunity to widen the scope for his philanthropy. He became an advocate for improvements in workers' rights, child labour laws, and free education for children.&lt;ref name=Estabrook64/&gt;

In 1813 Owen authored and published ''A New View of Society, or Essays on the Principle of the Formation of the Human Character'', the first of four essays that he wrote to explain the principles behind his reform-minded and [[socialist]]ic philosophy.&lt;ref name=GS269-70&gt;{{cite book | author=Linda C. Gugin and James E. St. Clair, eds. | title =Indiana's 200: The People Who Shaped the Hoosier State | publisher =Indiana Historical Society Press| year =2015 | location =Indianapolis | pages=269–70 | url = | isbn =978-0-87195-387-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen had originally been a follower of the classical liberal and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] Jeremy Bentham, who believed that free markets, in particular, the right of workers to move and choose their employers, would release the workers from the excessive power of capitalists. However, Owen developed his own, pro-socialist outlook. In addition, Owen, a [[Deism|deist]], criticised organised religion, including the [[Church of England]], and developed a belief system of his own.&lt;ref name=Traces12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ryan Rokicki| coauthors = | title =Science in Utopia: New Harmony's Naturalistic Legacy | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =26 | issue =2 | page=52 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Spring 2014| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen felt that human character is formed by circumstances over which individuals have no control. As a result, individuals cannot be praised or blamed for their behaviour or situation in life. This principle led Owen to the conclude that the secret behind the correct formation of people's characters is to place them under proper environmental influences – physical, moral and social – from their earliest years. These notions of the irresponsibility of humans and of the effect of early influences on an individual's character formed the basis of Owen's system of education and social reform.&lt;ref&gt;Merle Curti, "Robert Owen in American Thought," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relying on his own observations, experiences, and thoughts, Owen considered his view of human nature to be original and "the most basic and necessary constituent in an evolving science of society. "&lt;ref name=Curti61&gt;Curti, "Robert Owen in American Thought," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen's philosophy was influenced by Sir [[Isaac Newton]] 's views on natural law, and his views resembled those of [[Plato]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], [[William Godwin]], [[John Locke]], [[James Mill]], and [[Jeremy Bentham]], among others. Owen did not have the direct influence of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers.&lt;ref name=Curti61/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Panel Discussion," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen's work at New Lanark continued to have significance throughout Britain and in continental Europe. He was a "pioneer in factory reform, the father of distributive cooperation, and the founder of nursery schools."&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; His schemes for the education of his workers included the opening of the Institute for the Formation of Character at New Lanark in 1818. The institute and other educational programmes at New Lanark provided free education from infancy to adulthood.&lt;ref name=GS269-70/&gt;&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt; In addition, he zealously supported factory legislation that culminated in the [[Factory Acts|Cotton Mills and Factories Act]] of 1819. Owen also had interviews and communications with the leading members of the British government, including its premier, Robert Banks Jenkinson, and [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]]. Owen met with many of the rulers and leading statesmen of Europe.&lt;ref name=Dowd&gt;{{cite web|first=Douglas|last=Dowd|title=Robert Owen: British Social Reformer|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]]|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Owen| accessdate= 30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guru&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert Owen|publisher=Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/news/2008/10/31/robert-owen|date=31 Oct 2008|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen also adopted new principles to raise the standard of goods his workers produced. A cube with faces painted in different colours was installed above each machinist's workplace. The colour of the face showed to everyone who saw it the quality and quantity of goods the worker completed. The intent was to provide incentives to workers to do their best. Although it was not a great incentive by itself, the conditions at New Lanark for the workers and their families were idyllic for the time.&lt;ref name=Guru /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dowd /&gt;

===Eight-hour day===
Owen raised the demand for an [[eight-hour day]] in 1810, and instituted the policy at [[New Lanark]]. By 1817 he had formulated the goal of the eight-hour workday and coined the slogan: "Eight hours labour, Eight hours recreation, Eight hours rest."&lt;ref name=Ward&gt;{{Cite web|first=Marguerite|last=Ward|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=3 May 2017|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/03/how-the-8-hour-workday-changed-how-americans-work.html|title=A brief history of the 8-hour workday, which changed how Americans work|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Models for socialism (1817)===
[[File:Robert Owen Statue, Balloon Street, Manchester.jpg|thumb|upright|260px|A statue commemorating Owen in [[Manchester]], in front of [[The Co-operative Bank]].]]

Owen embraced socialism in 1817,  a turning point in his life, and began making specific efforts to implement what he described as his "New View of Society."&lt;ref name=Harrison34/&gt; Owen outlined his position in a report to the committee of the [[United Kingdom House of Commons|House of Commons]] regarding the country's [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Laws]].&lt;ref name=CommitteeReport&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert|last=Owen|title=To the Chairman of The Committee on the Nation's Poor Laws| publisher=University of Texas|url=http://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/368/368owenrptcom.html|date=12 Mar 1817|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, when misery and trade stagnation after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] were capturing the attention of the country, the British government invited Owen to offer his advice on what could be done to alleviate the industrial concerns. Although Owen attributed the immediate causes of misery to the wars, he also argued that the underlying cause of distress was the competition of human labour with machinery and recommended the establishment of self-sufficient communities.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;

Owen proposed that communities of about 1,200 people should be settled on land from {{convert|1000|to|1500|acre|ha|0}}, with all of them living in one large building that had a public kitchen and dining halls. (The size of his proposed community is likely to have been influenced by the size of the village of New Lanark.) Owen also recommended that each family should have its own private apartments and the responsibility for the care of their children until they reached the age of three. Thereafter, children would be raised by the community-at-large, but their parents would have access to them at mealtimes and on other occasions. Owen further suggested that these socialistic communities might be established by individuals, parishes, [[county|counties]], or other governmental units. In every case there would be effective supervision by qualified persons. The work and the enjoyment of its results should be experienced communally. Owen believed that his idea would be the best form for the re-organisation of society in general.&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dowd /&gt; He called his vision for a socialistic utopia the "New Moral World."&lt;ref name=GS269-70/&gt;

Owen's utopian model changed little during his lifetime. His fully developed model considered an association of 500 to 3,000 people as the optimum number for a good working community. While mainly agricultural, it would possess the best machinery, offer a variety of employment, and, as far as possible, be self-contained. Owen further explained that as the number of these communities increased, "unions of them federatively united shall be formed in circle of tens, hundreds and thousands"&lt;ref name="BloyVillages"&gt;{{cite web|first=Marjie|last=Bloy|title =Robert Owen and 'villages of co-operation'| publisher =A web of English History| date =4 Mar 2016| url = http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/ruralife/owenvill.htm| accessdate =30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; linked in a common interest.

===Arguments against Robert Owen and his answers===
Owen always tried to spread his ideas to wider communities. First of all, he started publishing his ideas in newspapers. Owen then sent these newspapers to parliamentarians, politicians all over the country, and other important people. The first negative reactions to his ideas appeared after these newspaper articles were published. 

The opponents of Owen’s ideas thought that Owen’s plans would result in an uncontrollable increase in population and poverty. The other main criticism stated that Owen’s plan and the common use of everything would essentially make the country one large workshop. [[William Hone]] claimed that Owen saw people as unravelled plants from his roots, and that he wanted to plant them into rectangles. Another spokesman accused Owen of wanting to imprison people in workshops like barracks and eradicate their personal independence. 

Owen’s opponents had begun to regard him as an enemy of religion. His influence with the ruling circles, which he had hoped would help him to accomplish his “Plan”, started diminishing and rumours about his lack of religious conviction spread. Owen believed that, unless a change can be made in the character of the individuals and the environment in which they live, these people will be hostile to those around them. As long as such a social order is perpetuated, the positive aspects of Christianity can never be put into practice. Owen also considered it necessary to give people more freedom in order to improve the situation of the poor and working classes. Unless people are better educated, unless they gain more useful information and have permanent employment, they are a danger to the security of the state when given more freedom than the British Constitution of the time. Without having to make any changes in the national institutions, he believed that even merely reorganizing the working classes would result in great benefits. Owen was thus opposed to the views of radicals who wanted to bring about a change in the public's mentality through the expansion of voting rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sosyalizmin öncülerinden Robert Owen: Yaşamı, öğretisi, eylemi|last=Aybay|first=Rona|publisher=YKY|year=2005|isbn=|location=İstanbul|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community experiments in America and Britain==
[[File:New harmony vision.jpg|thumb|350px|[[New Moral World]], Owen's envisioned successor of [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]]. [[Owenism|Owenites]] fired bricks to build it, but it was never constructed.]]

To test the viability of his ideas for self-sufficient working communities, Owen began experiments in communal living in America in 1825. Among the most famous of these was the one established at [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]], Indiana.&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt; Of the 130 identifiable communitarian experiments in America before the [[American Civil War]], at least sixteen were [[Owenism|Owenite]] or Owenite-influenced communities. New Harmony was Owen's earliest and most ambitious experiment.&lt;ref name=Harrison37/&gt;

Owen and his son, William, sailed to America in October 1824 to establish an experimental community in Indiana.&lt;ref name=Leopold21&gt;{{cite book| author=Richard William Leopold | title = Robert Dale Owen, A Biography | publisher =Harvard University Press | series =Harvard Historical Studies | volume =45 | edition = | year =1940 | location =Cambridge, Massachusetts | page=21 | url = | OCLC=774894}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1825 Owen used a portion of his own funds to finalise the purchase of an existing town that included 180 buildings and several thousand acres of land along the Wabash River in [[Indiana]]. (In 1824
[[George Rapp]]'s [[Harmony Society]], the religious group that owned the property and had founded the communal village of Harmony (or Harmonie) on the site in 1814, decided to relocate to [[Pennsylvania]].) Owen renamed it New Harmony and established the village as his preliminary model for a utopian community.&lt;ref name="GS269-70" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Karl J. R.

Owen attempted to gain support for his socialist vision among American thinkers, reformers, intellectuals, and public statesmen. On 25 February and 7 March 1825, Owen delivered addresses in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and others in the U.S. government that outlined his vision and plans for the utopian community at New Harmony, Indiana, as well as his socialist beliefs.&lt;ref name=GS269-70/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, p. 66. See also:{{cite book|author=Robert Owen|title=Manifesto of Robert Owen: The discoverer, Founder, and Promulgator, of the Rational System of Society, and of the Rational Religion |year=1840 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience to hear his ideas included three former [[President of the United States|U.S. presidents]] ([[John Adams]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[James Madison]]), in addition to outgoing U.S. president [[James Monroe]], and president-elect [[John Quincy Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rowland Hill Harvey|title=Robert Owen: Social Idealist|publisher=University of California Press|year=1947|pages=99–100|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His meetings were possibly the first discussions about socialism in the Americas; they were certainly a major step towards the beginnings of discussions about socialist thought in the United States. [[Owenism]], among the first socialist ideologies active in the United States, is considered the starting-point of the modern Socialist movement in the United States.&lt;ref name=WeekesThesis /&gt;&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism /&gt;

Owen convinced [[William Maclure]], a wealthy scientist, philanthropist, and Scot who was living in Philadelphia to join him at New Harmony. Maclure became Owen's financial partner. Maclure's involvement in the project subsequently attracted scientists, educators, and artists such as [[Thomas Say]], [[Charles-Alexandre Lesueur]], and Madame [[Marie Duclos Fretageot]], among others. These individuals helped to establish the utopian community at New Harmony as a centre for educational reform, scientific research, and artistic expression.&lt;ref name=GS269-70/&gt;&lt;ref name=Traces2-25&gt;{{cite journal| author=Amanda S.

Although he intended to build a "Village of Unity and Mutual Cooperation" south of town, his grand plan was never fully realised, and Owen returned to Britain to continue his work. During his long absences from New Harmony, Owen left the experiment under the day-to-day management of his sons, [[Robert Dale Owen]] and William Owen, and his business partner, Maclure. The New Harmony communal experiment proved to be an economic failure, lasting about two years, but it attracted more than a thousand residents by the end of its first year. The socialistic society was dissolved in 1827; however, many of the town's scientists, educators, and artists, and other inhabitants, including Owen's four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard Dale Owen, and his daughter, Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy, resided at New Harmony after the social experiment ended.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=GS269-70/&gt;&lt;ref name=Traces2-25/&gt;

Other utopian experiments in the United States included communal settlements at Blue Spring, near [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], Indiana; [[Yellow Springs, Ohio|Yellow Springs]], Ohio; and the [[Owenism|Owenite]] community of [[Forestville Commonwealth]] at [[Coxsackie (town), New York|Earlton]], New York, as well as other projects in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Tennessee]]. Nearly all of these experiments ended before New Harmony was dissolved in April 1827.&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Branigin, "Robert Owen's New Harmony: An American Heritage," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forestville Commonwealth was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974. See {{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen's utopian communities attracted a mix of people, many of whom had the highest aims; however, their members also included vagrants, adventurers, and crotchety, and other reform-minded enthusiasts. In the words of Owen's son, David Dale Owen, the communities attracted "a heterogeneous collection of Radicals", "enthusiastic devotees to principle," and "honest [[latitudinarians]], and lazy theorists," with "a sprinkling of unprincipled sharpers thrown in."&lt;ref name="clayton"&gt;{{cite book |author=Joseph Clayton |title=Robert Owen: Pioneer of Social Reforms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nuspAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;ots=x2fIRmQvqi&amp;dq=%22a%20heterogeneous%20collection%20of%20radicals%22&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20heterogeneous%20collection%20of%20radicals%22&amp;f=false |year=1908|publisher=A.C. Fifield
|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Josiah Warren]], one of the participants at New Harmony, asserted that community was doomed to failure due to a lack of [[individual sovereignty]] and personal property. In describing the Owenite community, Warren explained: "We had a world in miniature — we had enacted the French revolution over again with despairing hearts instead of corpses as a result.&amp;nbsp;... It appeared that it was nature's own inherent law of diversity that had conquered us&amp;nbsp;... our "united interests" were directly at war with the individualities of persons and circumstances and the instinct of self-preservation&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Warren, ''Periodical Letter II'' (1856)&lt;/ref&gt; Warren's observations on the reasons for the community's failure led to the development of [[American individualist anarchism]], of which he was its original theorist.
&lt;ref name="JosiahWarren"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeff|last=Riggenbach|title=Josiah Warren: The First American Anarchist|date=23 Feb 2011|url=https://mises.org/library/josiah-warren-first-american-anarchist|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have attributed the demise of the New Harmony experiment to a series of disagreements among its members.&lt;ref name=Estabrook68&gt;Estabrook, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social experiments also began in Scotland in 1825, when [[Abram Combe]], an Owenite disciple, attempted the development of a utopian experiment at [[Orbiston, Scotland|Orbiston]], near Glasgow, but the project failed after a trial of about two years.
&lt;ref name="Garnett"&gt;{{cite book|first=Ronald|last=Garnett|title=Co-operation and the Owenite Socialist Communities in Britain, 1825-45|date=1972|publisher=Manchester University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1830s additional experiments in socialistic cooperatives were made in [[Ireland]] and Britain. The most important of these were that at [[Ralahine]], established in 1831 in [[County Clare]], Ireland, and at [[East Tytherley|Tytherley]], begun in 1839 in [[Hampshire]], England. The former proved a remarkable success for three-and-a-half years until the proprietor, having ruined himself by gambling, had to sell his interest in the enterprise. Tytherley, known as Harmony Hall, or Queenwood College, was designed by the architect Joseph Hansom.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Penelope, "The Architectural Achievement of Joseph Aloysius Hansom (1803-1882), Designer of the Hansom Cab, Birmingham Town Hall, and Churches of the Catholic Revival", The Edwin Mellen Press, 2010, p.75 {{ISBN|0-7734-3851-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also failed.

==Return to Britain==

Although Owen made brief visits to the United States, London became his permanent home and the centre of his activities in 1828. After an extended period of friction with William Allen and some of his other business partners, Owen relinquished all of connections to New Lanark.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Estabrook68/&gt; He is often quoted as comment Allen at the time, "All the world is queer save thee and me, and even thou art a little queer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/1828?cat=technology#human_rights_social_justice |title=1828: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=13 July 2009}} See also: {{cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/forums/showthread.php?t=18866 |title=Who said this: "all strange but thee and Me" – Literature Network Forums |publisher=Online-literature.com |date= |accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having invested most of his personal fortune in the failed New Harmony communal experiment, Owen was no longer a wealthy capitalist; however, he remained the head of a vigorous propaganda effort to promote industrial equality, free education for children, and adequate living conditions in factory towns. In addition, he delivered lectures in Europe and published a weekly newspaper to gain support for his ideas.&lt;ref name=Estabrook68/&gt;

In 1832 Owen opened the [[National Equitable Labour Exchange]] system,&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; a [[time-based currency]] in which the exchange of goods was effected by means of labour notes; this system superseded the usual means of exchange and middlemen. The London exchange continued until 1833; a Birmingham branch operated for only a few months until July 1833.
&lt;ref name=UnionHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline|publisher=TUC History Online|url=http://www.unionhistory.info/timeline/Tl_Display.php?Where=Dc1Title+contains+%27National+Equitable+Labour+Exchange+notes%2C+1832+%28front%29%27+|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen also became involved in trade unionism. He briefly served as the leader of the [[Grand National Consolidated Trades Union|Grand National Consolidated Trade Union (GNCTU)]] before its collapse in 1834.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;

Socialism first became current in British terminology in the discussions of the [[Association of all Classes of all Nations]], which Owen formed in 1835&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Royle |year=1998 |title=Robert Owen and the Commencement of the Millennium|page=56|publisher=Manchester University Press|ISBN=0-7190-5426-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as its initial leader.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, ''Robert Owen'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen's [[secularism|secular]] views also gained enough influence among the working classes to cause the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' to comment in 1839 that his principles were the actual creed of a great portion of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=A. |date=1839|title=A letter to the Earl of Durham on Reform in Parliament, by Paying the Elected|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sthMAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal=London and Westminster Review|volume=32|pages=475–508|accessdate=30 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dowd /&gt; However, by 1846, the only long-lasting result of Owen's agitation for social change, carried on through public meetings, pamphlets, periodicals, and occasional treatises, remained the [[cooperative|co-operative]] movement, and for a time even that seemed to have utterly collapsed.&lt;ref name=AdventuresSocialism /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dowd /&gt;&lt;ref name=WeekesThesis /&gt;

==Role in spiritualism==
[[File:Tomb of Robert Owen (1771-1858) - geograph.org.uk - 661997.jpg|thumb|260px|Tomb of Robert Owen, [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]], Powys]]

In 1817, Owen publicly claimed that all religions were false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Richard William Leopold,  | title =Robert Dale Owen, A Biography | publisher = Harvard University Press | series =Harvard Historical Studies | volume =45 | edition = | year =1940 | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts| page=8 | url = | OCLC=774894}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, at the age of 83, Owen converted to [[spiritualism]] after a series of [[Séance|sittings]] with [[Maria B. Hayden]], the American medium  who is credited with introducing spiritualism to England. Owen made a public profession of his new faith in his publication ''The Rational Quarterly Review'' and in ''The future of the Human race; or great glorious and future revolution to be effected through the agency of departed spirits of good and superior men and women'', a pamphlet that he also wrote.&lt;ref name=Spence679/&gt;

Owen claimed to have had mediumistic contact with the spirits of [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and others. He explained that the purpose of these communications was to change "the present, false, disunited and miserable state of human existence, for a true, united and happy state&amp;nbsp;... to prepare the world for universal peace, and to infuse into all the spirit of charity, forbearance and love."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Podmore|title=Robert Owen: A Biography|volume=II|pages=604–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spiritualists]] have claimed that after Owen's death his spirit dictated to the medium [[Emma Hardinge Britten]] in 1871 the "[[Emma Hardinge Britten|Seven Principles of Spiritualism]]," which the Spiritualists' National Union used as "the basis of its religious philosoply."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snui.org/index.php?act=viewDoc&amp;docId=9 |title=History of Spiritualism|publisher=SNU international| format = | accessdate =30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
As Owen grew older and more radical in his views, his influence began to decline.&lt;ref name=Estabrook68&gt;Estabrook, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen published his memoirs, ''The Life of Robert Owen'' (1857), a year prior to his death.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Crowd of people congregated by the grave of Robert Owen at the old parish church, Newtown (1293839).jpg|thumb|260px|Crowds of locals gather to commemorate Robert Owen at his grave in Newtown, 1890s]]

Although he had spent the majority of his life in England and Scotland, Owen returned to his native village of Newtown at the end of his life. He died at Newtown on 17 November 1858, and was buried there on 21 November. With the exception of an annual income drawn from a trust established by his sons in 1844, Owen died penniless.&lt;ref name=Timeline/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, ''Robert Dale Owen, A Biography'', p. 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen was a reformer, philanthropist, community builder, and spiritualist who spent his adult life seeking to improve the lives of others. An advocate of the working class, he improved working conditions of factory workers, which he successfully demonstrated at New Lanark, Scotland; became a leader in trade unionism; promoted social equality through his experimental utopian communities; and supported passage of child labour laws and free education for children.&lt;ref name=Estabrook68/&gt;

Owen was ahead of his time as a social reformer. He offered his vision for a communal society that others could consider and apply as they wished.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race'' (1849), Owen further elaborated that character is formed by a combination of Nature or God and the circumstances of the individual's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Robert Owen | title =Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race, or, The Coming Change from Irrationality to Rationality | publisher =Effingham Wilson | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1849 | location =London | pages =1, 9 | url =  | OCLC=11756751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the beneficial results achieved at New Lanark, Scotland, during his thirty years of work in the community, Owen concluded that a person's "character is not made ''by'', but ''for'' the individual,"&lt;ref&gt;Owen, ''Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race'', p. 29. See also: Harrison, "Robert Owen's Quest for the New Moral World in America," in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and that nature and society are responsible for each person's character and conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Owen, ''Revolution in the Mind and Practice of the Human Race'', p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen's agitation for social change and the Owenites whose work he inspired, including the efforts of his own children, helped to establish and promote long-lasting social reforms in the area of women's and workers' rights; the establishment of free public libraries and museums; childcare and public, co-educational schools; pre-Marxian communism; and the development of the [[cooperative]] and the trade union movement. New Harmony, Indiana, and New Lanark, Scotland, the two towns with which he is most closely associated, remain as lasting reminders of his efforts.&lt;ref name=GS269-70/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Branigin, "Robert Owen's New Harmony" in ''Robert Owen's American Legacy'', pp. 21–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen's legacy of public service continued with his four sons, Robert Dale, William, David Dale, and Richard Dale, and his daughter, Jane, who followed him to America to live at New Harmony, Indiana:
*[[Robert Dale Owen]] (1801–1877), an able exponent of his father's doctrines, managed the New Harmony community after his father returned to Britain in 1825. In addition, he wrote articles and co-edited with [[Frances Wright]] the ''New-Harmony Gazette'' in the late 1820s in Indiana and the ''Free Enquirer'' in the 1830s in [[New York City]]. Owen returned to New Harmony in 1833 and became active in Indiana politics. He was elected to the [[Indiana House of Representatives]] (1836–39 and 1851–53) and [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] (1843–47), and appointed as 1853–58) to [[Naples]]. While serving as a member of [[United States Congress|Congress]], he drafted and helped to secure passage of the bill that founded the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1846. He was elected as a delegate to the [[Constitution of Indiana#Constitutional Convention 2|Indiana Constitutional Convention]] in 1850,&lt;ref name=Rees/&gt;&lt;ref name=Estabrook72-74&gt;Estabrook, pp. 72–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| title =Owen, Robert Dale (1801–1877) | work =Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | publisher =U.S. Congress | date = | url =http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=O000152 | format = | accessdate =12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=| title =Owen, Robert Dale (1801–1877) | work =Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | publisher =U.S. Congress | date = | url =http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=O000152 | format = | accessdate =September 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued in support of widows and married women's property and divorce rights. Owen also favoured legislation for Indiana's tax-supported public school system.&lt;ref name=Traces12/&gt; He later succeeded in passing a state law giving. Like his father, Robert Dale Owe believed in [[spiritualism]], authoring two books on the subject: ''Footfalls on the Boundary of Another World'' (1859) and ''The Debatable Land Between this World and the Next'' (1872).&lt;ref name=Estabrook72/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pancoast and Lincoln, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
*William Owen (1802–1842) came to the United States with his father in 1824.  Because of his business acumen, especially his knowledge of cotton-goods manufacturing, he remained at New Harmony after his father returned to Scotland, and served as an adviser to the community. He also organised New Harmony's Thespian Society in 1827. Owen died of unknown causes at the age of forty.&lt;ref name=Traces11/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jane Dale Owen Fauntleroy (1805–1861) immigrated to the United States in 1833 and settled in New Harmony. She was a musician and an educator who established a school in her home. In 1835 Jane Dale Owen married Robert Henry Fauntleroy, a civil engineer from Virginia who lived at New Harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PL25&gt;{{cite book | author=Elinor Pancoast and Anne E.

*[[David Dale Owen]] (1807–1860) immigrated to the United States in 1827 and resided at New Harmony for several years. He trained as a geologist, natural scientist, and earned a medical degree. David Dale Owen was appointed a United States geologist in 1839. His work included extensive geological surveys in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], more specifically the states of [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Missouri]], and [[Arkansas]], as well as the [[Minnesota Territory]]. His brother, Richard, succeeded him as the state geologist of Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leopold50-51&gt;Leopold, ''Robert Dale Owen, A Biography'', pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Richard Dale Owen]] (1810–1890) immigrated to the United States in 1827 and joined his siblings at New Harmony. He fought in the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1847, taught natural science at Western Military Institute in Tennessee from 1849 to 1859, and earned a medical degree in 1858. During the [[American Civil War]] Owen was a [[colonel]] in the [[Union army]] and served as a commandant of [[Camp Morton]], a prisoner-of-war camp for [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldiers at [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. After the war, Owen served as Indiana's second state geologist. In addition, he was a professor at [[Indiana University]] and chaired its natural science department (1864–79). Owen helped plan [[Purdue University]] and was appointed its first president (1872–74), but resigned before its first classes began and resumed teaching at IU. Owen spent his retirement years conducting research and writing.&lt;ref name=Leopold50-51/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, pp. 343–44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estabrook, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Science Media Centre''' is an organisation which formed in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Lancet|title=Fiona Fox|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61099-0|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61099-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;,
two years after the [[United Kingdom]] [[House of Lords]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on Science and Technology's third report on "Science and Society" in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3810.htm|title=House of Lords - Science and Technology - Third Report|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}}

This report stated that while science was generally reported accurately in the mass media, there was a need for the promotion of more expert information at times when science is under attack in the headlines, mentioning the public reaction to GM crops, in particular.

==Functions==
In order to promote more informed science in the media, the Centre's main function is as a service to journalists, providing background briefings on current scientific issues and facilitating interviews with scientists. Its director is [[Fiona Fox (UK press officer)|Fiona Fox]] who is a former member of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1978)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] and a former contributor to its magazine ''[[Living Marxism]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/19/farmingforthefuture | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Clear intentions | first=Peter | last=Melchett | date=19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The SMC's stated aim is to "facilitate more scientists to engage with the media, in the hope that the public will have improved access to accurate, evidence-based scientific information about the stories of the day".

==Structure==
The setting up of the Science Media Centre was assisted by [[Susan Greenfield]], the director of the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]]. While the Centre is still based in a specially refurbished wing of the Royal Institution, full independence is claimed from all funders and supporters.

The Science Media Centre is funded by over 60 organisations, with individual donations capped at £12,500 per annum. The SMC receives sponsorship from a range of funders including media organisations, universities, scientific and learned societies, the [[Research Councils UK|UK Research Councils]], government bodies, [[Quango]]s, charities, private donors and corporate bodies. For an up-to-date list of funders, see [http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/funding.htm].

==Criticism==

A 2013 article in ''Nature'' stated about the SMC, "Perhaps the biggest criticism of Fox and the SMC is that they push science too aggressively — acting more as a PR agency than as a source of accurate science information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/science-media-centre-of-attention-1.13362|title=Science media: Centre of attention|year=2013|author=Nature|doi=10.1038/499142a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Ronan Bennett]] and [[Alan Rusbridger]] described the SMC as a lobby group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/jun/02/gm.observersciencepages|title=Lobby group 'led GM thriller critics'|author=The Guardian|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other SMCs==
During Professor Greenfield's term as [[Thinker in Residence]] in South Australia, a new [[Australian Science Media Centre]] was set up in [[Adelaide]], Australia in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Origins|url=http://www.aussmc.org/about-us/our-origins/|publisher=Australian Science Media Centre|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkers.sa.gov.au/thinkers/greenfield/impacts.aspx|title=Adelaide Thinkers in Residence - Impacts|publisher=Govt. of South Australia|accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Media Centres now exist in other countries; [[Science Media Centre of Canada|Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], Japan, and Germany. Except for the relation between the Science Media Centre in UK and the Australian Science Media Centre, these centres are independent of each other.

'''Social history''', often called the '''new social history,''' is a field of [[history]] that looks at the lived experience of the past. In its "golden age" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and the United States. In the two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.  Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. Stephen H. Haber, David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security,'' Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the history departments of British and Irish universities in 2014, of the 3410 faculty members reporting, 878 (26%) identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 841 (25%).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/history-online/teachers "History Online:Teachers of History"] accessed 1/21/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old and new social history==
The older social history (before 1960) included numerous topics that were not part of the mainstream historiography of political, military, diplomatic and constitutional history. It was a hodgepodge without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were "social" in the sense of being outside the elite system. [[People's history]] was sometimes so [[Marxism|Marxist]] that non-Marxists were alienated by it. Social history was contrasted with [[political history]], [[intellectual history]] and the history of [[Great man theory|great men]]. English historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, "Without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=English Social History: A Survey of Six Centuries from Chaucer to Queen Victoria|author=[[G. M. Trevelyan]]|publisher=Book Club Associates|year=1973|chapter=Introduction|page=i|isbn=0-582-48488-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as "history with the people put back in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The People's State: East German Society from Hitler to Honecker|author=Mary Fulbrook|location=London|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2005|chapter=Introduction: The people's paradox|page=17|isbn=978-0-300-14424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Social History movement==
The "new social history" exploded on the scene in the 1960s, quickly becoming one of the dominant styles of historiography in the U.S., Britain and Canada.  The French version, promulgated by the [[Annales School]], was very well organized and dominated French historiography, and influenced much of Europe and Latin America. [[Jürgen Kocka]] finds two meanings to "social history."  At the simplest level, it was the subdivision of historiography that focused on social structures and processes.  In this regard it stood in contrast to political or economic history.  The second meaning was broader, and the Germans called it "Gesellschaftsgeschichte."  It is the history of an entire society from a social-historical viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Kocka, ''Industrial Culture and Bourgeois Society: Business, Labor, and Bureaucracy in Modern Germany, 1800-1918'' (New York: Berghahn Books, 1999) pp 275-97, at p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany the "Gesellschaftsgeschichte" movement introduced a vast range of topics, as Kocka, a leader of the [[Bielefeld School]] recalls:
:In the 1960s and 1970s, "social history" caught the imagination of a young generation of historians. It became a central concept -- and a rallying point -- of [[Historical revisionism|historiographic revisionism]]. It meant many things at the same time. It gave priority to the study of particular kinds of phenomena, such as classes and movements, urbanization and industrialization, family and education, work and leisure, mobility, inequality, conflicts and revolutions. It stressed structures and processes over actors and events. It emphasized analytical approaches close to the social sciences rather than by the traditional methods of historical hermeneutics. Frequently social historians sympathized with the causes (as they saw them) of the little people, of the underdog, of popular movements, or of the working class. Social history was both demanded and rejected as a vigorous revisionist alternative to the more established ways of historiography, in which the reconstruction of politics and ideas, the history of events and hermeneutic methods traditionally dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Kocka, ''Industrial Culture and Bourgeois Society'' p. 276&lt;/ref&gt;

Americanist Paul E. Johnson recalls the heady early promise of the movement in the late 1960s:
:The New Social History reached UCLA at about that time, and I was trained as a quantitative social science historian. I learned that "literary" evidence and the kinds of history that could be written from it were inherently elitist and untrustworthy. Our cousins, the Annalistes, talked of ignoring heroes and events and reconstructing the more constitutive and enduring "background" of history. Such history could be made only with quantifiable sources. The result would be a "History from the Bottom Up" that ultimately engulfed traditional history and, somehow, helped to make a Better World. Much of this was acted out with mad-scientist bravado. One well-known quantifier said that anyone who did not know statistics at least through multiple regression should not hold a job in a history department. My own advisor told us that he wanted history to become "a predictive social science."  I never went that far. I was drawn to the new social history by its democratic inclusiveness as much as by its system and precision. I wanted to write the history of ordinary people—to historicize them, put them into the social structures and long-term trends that shaped their lives, and at the same time resurrect what they said and did. In the late 1960s, quantitative social history looked like the best way to do that.&lt;ref&gt;Paul E. Johnson, "Reflections: Looking Back at Social History," ''Reviews in American History'' Volume 39, Number 2, June 2011 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v039/39.2.johnson.html online at [[Project MUSE]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Social Science History Association]] was formed in 1976 to bring together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in social history. It is still active and publishes ''[[Social Science History]]'' quarterly.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ssha.org/ the SSHA website]&lt;/ref&gt; The field is also the specialty of the ''[[Journal of Social History]]'', edited since 1967 by [[Peter Stearns]]&lt;ref&gt;. See [http://chnm.gmu.edu/jsh/ ''Journal of Social History'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It covers such topics as gender relations; race in American history; the history of personal relationships; consumerism; sexuality; the social history of politics; crime and punishment, and history of the senses. Most of the major historical journals have coverage as well.

However, after 1990 social history was increasingly challenged by [[cultural history]], which emphasizes language and the importance of beliefs and assumptions and their causal role in group behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lynn Hunt]] and Victoria Bonnell, eds., ''Beyond the Cultural Turn'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subfields==

===Historical demography===
{{main|Historical demography}}
The study of the lives of ordinary people was revolutionized in the 1960s by the introduction of sophisticated quantitative and demographic methods, often using individual data from the census and from local registers of births, marriages, deaths and taxes, as well as theoretical models from sociology such as [[social mobility]].  H-DEMOG is a daily email discussion group that covers the field broadly.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/~demog/ H-DEMOG]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical demography is the study of population history and demographic processes, usually using census or similar statistical data. It became an important specialty inside social history, with strong connections with the larger field of [[demography]], as in the study of the [[Demographic Transition]].

===Black history===
Black history or [[African-American history]] studies African Americans and Africans in American history. The [[Association for the Study of African American Life and History]] was founded by [[Carter G. Woodson]] in 1915 and has 2500 members and publishes the ''[[Journal of African American History]],'' formerly the ''Journal of Negro History.'' Since 1926 it has sponsored [[Black History Month]] every February.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.asalh.org/ ASALH]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic history===
[[Ethnic history]] is especially important in the U.S. and Canada, where major encyclopedias helped define the field.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom, ed. ''Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups'' (1980) [https://books.google.com/books?id=npQ6Hd3G4kgC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul R.  Magocsi, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Canada's peoples'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=dbUuX0mnvQMC excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the history of ethnic groups (usually not including blacks or Native Americans). 
Typical approaches include critical ethnic studies; comparative ethnic studies; critical race studies; Asian-American, and Latino/a or Chicano/a studies.  In recent years Chicano/Chicana studies has become important as the Hispanic population has become the largest minority in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Rodolfo F. Acuna, ''The Making of Chicana/o Studies: In the Trenches of Academe'' (2011) [https://www.amazon.com/Making-Chicana-Studies-Latinidad-Transnational/dp/0813550025/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor history===
{{main|Labor history (discipline)}}
[[Labor history (discipline)|Labor history]], deals with labor unions and the social history of workers. See for example [[Labor history of the United States]]  The Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History was established: 1971 and has a membership of 1000.  It publishes ''International Labor and Working-Class History''.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ Study Group on International Labor and Working-Class History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518111017/http://www.newschool.edu/gf/history/ilwch/ |date=2015-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; H-LABOR is a daily email-based discussion group formed in 1993 that reaches over a thousand scholars and advanced students.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.h-net.org/~labor/ H-LABOR website]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Labor and Working-Class History Association]] formed in 1988 and publishes ''[[Labor: Studies in Working-Class History]].''

Kirk (2010) surveys labour historiography in Britain since the formation of the Society for the Study of Labour History in 1960. He reports that labour history has been mostly pragmatic, eclectic and empirical; it has played an important role in historiographical debates, such as those revolving around history from below, institutionalism versus the social history of labour, class, populism, gender, language, postmodernism and the turn to politics. Kirk rejects suggestions that the field is declining, and stresses its innovation, modification and renewal. Kirk also detects a move into conservative insularity and academicism. He recommends a more extensive and critical engagement with the kinds of comparative, transnational and global concerns increasingly popular among labour historians elsewhere, and calls for a revival of public and political interest in the topics.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Kirk, "Challenge, Crisis, and Renewal? Themes in the Labour History of Britain, 1960–2010," ''Labour History Review,'' Aug 2010, Vol. 75 Issue 2, pp 162-180&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Navickas, (2011) examines recent scholarship including the histories of collective action, environment and human ecology, and gender issues, with a focus on work by James Epstein, Malcolm Chase, and Peter Jones.&lt;ref&gt;Katrina Navickas, "What happened to class? New histories of labour and collective action in Britain," ''Social History,'' May 2011, Vol. 36 Issue 2, pp 192-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Price, "Histories of Labour and Labour History," ''Labour History Review,'' Dec 2010, Vol. 75 Issue 3, pp 263-270&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's history===
[[Women's history]] exploded into prominence in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.mtsu.edu/~kmiddlet/history/women.html American Women's History: A Research Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now well represented in every geographical topic; increasingly it includes gender history.&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.amazon.com/dp/1405149604 Teresa A. Meade and Merry Wiesner-Hanks, eds. ''A Companion to Gender History'' (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt; Social history uses the approach of women's history to understand the experiences of ordinary women, as opposed to "Great Women," in the past. [[Joan Kelly|Feminist women's historians]] have critiqued early studies of social history for being too focused on the male experience.

===Gender history===
Gender history focuses on the categories, discourses and experiences of femininity and masculinity as they develop over time. Gender history gained prominence after it was conceptualized in 1986 by [[Joan W. Scott]] in her article "Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scott|first=Joan W.|title=Gender: A Useful Category of Historical Analysis|journal=The American Historical Review|year=1986|volume=91|issue=5|pages=1053–1075|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1864376?uid=3739448&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3737720&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101570710027|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.2307/1864376}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social historians use Scott's concept of "perceived differences" to study how gender relations in the past have unfolded and continue to unfold. In keeping with the [[cultural turn]], many social historians are also gender historians who study how discourses interact with everyday experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queensu.ca/skhs/faculty-and-staff/faculty/mary-louise-adams |title=DR. MARY LOUISE ADAMS, PH.D. (TORONTO) |accessdate=31 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the family===
{{see also|History of the family}}
The History of the family emerged as a separate field in the 1970s, with close ties to anthropology and sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara K. Hareven, "The history of the family and the complexity of social change," ''American Historical Review,'' Feb 1991, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp. 95-124&lt;/ref&gt; The trend was especially pronounced in the U.S. and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Comacchio, "'The History of Us': Social Science, History, and the Relations of Family in Canada," ''Labour / Le Travail,'' Fall 2000, Vol. 46, pp. 167-220, with very thorough coverage.&lt;/ref&gt; It emphasizes demographic patterns and public policy, but is quite separate from [[genealogy]], though often drawing on the same primary sources, such as censuses and family records.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://jfh.sagepub.com/ ''Journal of Family History'', quarterly since 1976]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The influential pioneering study ''Women, Work, and Family'' (1978) was done by [[Louise A. Tilly]] and [[Joan W. Scott]]. It broke new ground with their broad interpretive framework and emphasis on the variable factors shaping women's place in the family and economy in France and England. The study considered the interaction of production, or traditional labor, and reproduction, the work of caring for children and families, in its analysis of women's wage labor and thus helped to bring together labor and family history.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Dublin, "Women, Work, and Family: The View from the United States," ''Journal of Women's History,'' Autumn 99, Vol. 11 Issue 3, pp 17-21&lt;/ref&gt;  Much work has been done on the dichotomy in women's lives between the private sphere and the public.&lt;ref&gt;D'Ann Campbell, ''Women at War with America: Private Lives in a Patriotic Era'' (1984)&lt;/ref&gt; For a recent worldwide overview covering 7000 years see Maynes and Waltner's 2012 book and ebook, ''The Family: A World History'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jo Maynes and Ann Beth Waltner, ''The Family: A World History'' (Oxford University Press, 2012) [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=38304 online review]&lt;/ref&gt; For comprehensive coverage of the American case, see Marilyn Coleman and Lawrence Ganong, eds. ''The Social History of the American Family: An Encyclopedia'' (4 vol, 2014).

The [[history of childhood]] is a growing subfield.&lt;ref&gt;Peter N. Stearns, "Social History and World History: Prospects for Collaboration." ''Journal of World History'' 2007 18(1): 43-52. {{ISSN|1045-6007}} Fulltext: [[History Cooperative]] and [[Project Muse]], deals with the history of childhood worldwide. See Peter N. Stearns, ''Childhood in World History'' (2005), A.R. Colon with P. A. Colon, ''A History of Children: A Socio-Cultural Survey across Millennia'' (2001), and Steven Mintz, ''Huck's Raft: A History of American Childhood'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M. Hawes and N. Ray Hiner, "Hidden in Plain View: The History of Children (and Childhood) in the Twenty-First Century," ''Journal of the History of Childhood &amp; Youth,'' Jan 2008, Vol. 1 Issue 1, pp 43-49&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of education===
{{main|History of education|History of education in the United States#Historiography|History of childhood care and education}}
For much of the 20th century, the dominant American historiography, as exemplified by [[Ellwood Patterson Cubberley]] (1868-1941) at Stanford, emphasized the rise of American education as a powerful force for literacy, democracy, and equal opportunity, and a firm basis for higher education and advanced research institutions. It was a story of enlightenment and modernization triumphing over ignorance, cost-cutting, and narrow traditionalism whereby parents tried to block their children's intellectual access to the wider world.  Teachers dedicated to the public interest, reformers with a wide vision, and public support from the civic-minded community were the heroes.  The textbooks help inspire students to become public schools teachers and thereby fulfill their own civic mission.&lt;ref&gt;Sol Cohen, "The history of the history of American education, 1900-1976: The uses of the past." ''Harvard Educational Review'' 46#3 (1976): 298-330. online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence A. Cremin, ''The Wonderful World of Ellwood Patterson Cubberley'' (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

The crisis came in the 1960s, when a new generation of [[New Left]] scholars and students rejected the traditional celebratory accounts, and identified the educational system as the villain for many of America's weaknesses, failures, and crimes. Michael Katz (1939-2014) states they:
:tried to explain the origins of the Vietnam War; the persistence of racism and segregation; the distribution of power among gender and classes; intractable poverty and the decay of cities; and the failure of social institutions and policies designed to deal with mental illness, crime, delinquency, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael B. Katz|title=Reconstructing American Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpeeMe6o5jIC&amp;pg=PA136|year=2009|publisher=Harvard UP|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The old guard fought back and bitter historiographical contests, with the younger students and scholars largely promoting the proposition that schools were not the solution to America's ills, they were in part the cause of Americans problems. The fierce battles of the 1960s died out by the 1990s, but enrollment in education history courses and never recovered.&lt;ref&gt;For a counterattack see Diane Ravitch, ''The Revisionists Revised: A Critique of the Radical Attack on the Schools'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1980s, compromise had been worked out, with all sides focusing on the heavily bureaucratic nature of the American public schooling.&lt;ref&gt;John Hardin Best, ed. ''Historical inquiry in education: A research agenda'' (American Educational Research Association, 1983); The most comprehensive overview of the historiography of American education, with essays by 13 scholars.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years most histories of education deal with institutions or focus on the ideas histories of major reformers,&lt;ref&gt;Three fourths of British studies are institutional, says William Richardson, "British Historiography of Education in International Context at the Turn of the Century, 1996-2006," ''History of Education'', July /Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 569-593,&lt;/ref&gt;  but a new social history has recently emerged, focused on who were the students in terms of social background and social mobility. In the U.S. attention has often focused on minority and ethnic students. In Britain, Raftery et al. (2007) looks at the historiography on social change and education in Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, with particular reference to 19th-century schooling. They developed distinctive systems of schooling in the 19th century that reflected not only their relationship to England but also significant contemporaneous economic and social change. This article seeks to create a basis for comparative work by identifying research that has treated this period, offering brief analytical commentaries on some key works, discussing developments in educational historiography, and pointing to lacunae in research.&lt;ref&gt;Deirdre Raftery, Jane McDermid, and Gareth Elwyn Jones, "Social Change and Education in Ireland, Scotland and Wales: Historiography on Nineteenth-century Schooling," ''History of Education'', July/Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 447-463&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have recently looked at the relationship between schooling and urban growth by studying educational institutions as agents in class formation, relating urban schooling to changes in the shape of cities, linking urbanization with social reform movements, and examining the material conditions affecting child life and the relationship between schools and other agencies that socialize the young.&lt;ref&gt;David A. Reeder, Schooling in the City: Educational History and the Urban Variable," ''Urban History,'' May 1992, Vol. 19 Issue 1, pp 23-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juergen Herbst, "The History of Education: State of the Art at the Turn of the Century in Europe and North America," ''Paedagogica Historica'' 35, no. 3 (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most economics-minded historians have sought to relate education to changes in the quality of labor, productivity and economic growth, and rates of return on investment in education.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sanderson, "Educational and Economic History: The Good Neighbours," ''History of Education,'' July /Sept 2007, Vol. 36 Issue 4/5, pp 429-445&lt;/ref&gt;  A major recent exemplar is Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, ''The Race between Education and Technology'' (2009), on the social and economic history of 20th-century American schooling.

===Urban history===
{{main|Urban history}}
The "new urban history" emerged in the 1950s in Britain and in the 1960s in the U.S. It looked at the "city as process" and, often using quantitative methods, to learn more about the inarticulate masses in the cities, as opposed to the mayors and elites.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Thernstrom and Richard Sennett, eds. ''Nineteenth-century Cities: Essays in the New Urban History'' (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  A major early study was [[Stephan Thernstrom]]'s ''Poverty and Progress: Social Mobility in a Nineteenth Century City'' (1964), which used census records to study [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], 1850-1880. A seminal, landmark book, it sparked interest in the 1960s and 1970s in quantitative methods, census sources,  "bottom-up" history, and the measurement of upward social mobility by different ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Frisch, "''Poverty and Progress:'' A Paradoxical Legacy," ''Social Science History,'' Spring 1986, Vol. 10 Issue 1, pp 15-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other exemplars of the new urban history included Kathleen Conzen,  ''Immigrant Milwaukee, 1836-1860'' (1976); Alan Dawley, ''Class and Community: The Industrial Revolution in Lynn'' (1975; 2nd ed. 2000); Michael B. Katz,  ''The People of Hamilton, Canada West'' (1976);&lt;ref&gt;see [https://www.amazon.com/dp/159740411X/  excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Henry Monkkonen|Eric H. Monkkonen]], ''The Dangerous Class: Crime and Poverty in Columbus Ohio 1860-1865'' (1975); and Michael P. Weber, ''Social Change in an Industrial Town: Patterns of Progress in Warren, Pennsylvania, From Civil War to World War I.'' (1976).

Representative comparative studies include Leonardo Benevolo, ''The European City'' (1993);  Christopher R. Friedrichs, ''The Early Modern City, 1450-1750'' (1995), and James L. McClain, John M. Merriman, and Ugawa Kaoru. eds. ''Edo and Paris'' (1994) (Edo was the old name for Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;They are reviewed in Wolfgang Reinhard, "New Contributions to Comparative Urban History," ''Journal of Early Modern History'' (1997) 1#2 pp 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were no overarching social history theories that emerged developed to explain urban development. Inspiration from urban geography and sociology, as well as a concern with workers (as opposed to labor union leaders), families, ethnic groups, racial segregation, and women's roles have proven useful. Historians now view the contending groups within the city as "agents" who shape the direction of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Marsh and Lizabeth Cohen. "Old Forms, New Visions: New Directions in United States Urban History," ''Pennsylvania History,'' Winter 1992, Vol. 59 Issue 1, pp 21-28&lt;/ref&gt; The subfield has flourished in Australia—where most people live in cities.&lt;ref&gt;Lionel Frost, and Seamus O'Hanlon, "Urban History and the Future of Australian Cities," ''Australian Economic History Review'' March 2009, Vol. 49 Issue 1, pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rural history===
{{main|Rural history}}
[[Agricultural History]] handles the economic and technological dimensions, while [[Rural history]] handles the social dimension.  Burchardt (2007) evaluates the state of modern English rural history and identifies an "orthodox" school, focused on the economic history of agriculture. This historiography has made impressive progress in quantifying and explaining the output and productivity achievements of English farming since the "agricultural revolution."&lt;ref&gt;On British rural history see Jeremy Burchardt, "Agricultural History, Rural History, or Countryside History?"  ''Historical Journal'' 2007 50(2): 465-481. {{ISSN|0018-246X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebratory style of the orthodox school was challenged by a dissident tradition emphasizing the social costs of agricultural progress, notably enclosure, which forced poor tenant farmers off the land. Recently, a new school, associated with the journal ''Rural History,'' has broken away from this narrative of agricultural change, elaborating a wider social history. The work of Alun Howkins has been pivotal in the recent historiography, in relation to these three traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Alun Howkins, ''The Death Rural England'' (2003) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/041513885X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Howkins, like his precursors, is constrained by an increasingly anachronistic equation of the countryside with agriculture. Geographers and sociologists have developed a concept of a "post-productivist" countryside, dominated by consumption and representation that may have something to offer historians, in conjunction with the well-established historiography of the "rural idyll."  Most rural history has focused on the [[Southern United States|American South]]—overwhelmingly rural until the 1950s—but there is a "new rural history" of [[Union (American Civil War)|the North]] as well. Instead of becoming agrarian capitalists, farmers held onto preindustrial capitalist values emphasizing family and community. Rural areas maintained population stability; kinship ties determined rural immigrant settlement and community structures; and the defeminization of farm work encouraged the rural version of the "women's sphere." These findings strongly contrast with those in the old frontier history as well as those found in the new urban history.&lt;ref&gt;Hal S. Barron, "Rediscovering the Majority: The New Rural History of the Nineteenth-Century North," ''Historical Methods,'' Fall 1986, Vol. 19 Issue 4, pp 141-152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{main|Historiography of religion}}
The historiography of religion focuses mostly on theology and church organization and development. Recently the study of the social history or religious behavior and belief has become important.&lt;ref&gt;John T. McGreevy,  "Faith and Morals in the Modern United States, 1865-Present." Reviews in American History 26.1 (1998): 239-254. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/reviews_in_american_history/v026/26.1mcgreevy.html online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social history in Europe==

===France===
{{main|Annales School}}
Social history has dominated French historiography since the 1920s, thanks to the central role of the [[Annales School]].  Its journal ''Annales'' focuses attention on the synthesizing of historical patterns identified from social, economic, and cultural history, statistics, medical reports, family studies, and even psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Burke, ''The French Historical Revolution: The Annales School 1929–89'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{see also|Bielefeld School|Historiography of Germany}}
Social history developed within West German historiography during the 1950s-60s as the successor to the national history discredited by [[National Socialism]].  The German brand of "history of society" - ''Gesellschaftsgeschichte'' - has been known from its beginning in the 1960s for its application of sociological and political modernization theories to German history. [[Modernization theory]] was presented by [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] (1931-2014) and his [[Bielefeld School]] as the way to transform "traditional" German history, that is, national political history, centered on a few "great men," into an integrated and comparative history of German society encompassing societal structures outside politics. Wehler drew upon the modernization theory of [[Max Weber]], with concepts also from [[Karl Marx]], [[Otto Hintze]], [[Gustav Schmoller]], [[Werner Sombart]] and [[Thorstein Veblen]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Fletcher,  "Recent Developments in West German Historiography: the Bielefeld School and its Critics." ''[[German Studies Review]]'' 1984 7(3): 451-480. {{DOI|10.2307/1428885}} [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1428885 in Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s German historians of society, led by Wehler and [[Jürgen Kocka]] at the "Bielefeld school"  gained dominance in Germany by applying both modernization theories and social science methods. From the 1980s, however, they were increasingly criticized by proponents of the "cultural turn" for not incorporating culture in the history of society, for reducing politics to society, and for reducing individuals to structures. Historians of society inverted the traditional positions they criticized (on the model of Marx's inversion of Hegel). As a result, the problems pertaining to the positions criticized were not resolved but only turned on their heads. The traditional focus on individuals was inverted into a modern focus on structures, the traditional focus on culture was inverted into a modern focus on structures, and traditional emphatic understanding was inverted into modern causal explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Lorenz, "'Won't You Tell Me, Where Have All the Good Times Gone'? On the Advantages and Disadvantages of Modernization Theory for History." ''Rethinking History'' 2006 10(2): 171-200. {{ISSN|1364-2529}} Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hungary===
Before World War II, political history was in decline and an effort was made to introduce social history in the style of the French [[Annales School]].  After the war only Marxist interpretations were allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Erős Vilmos|hu}}, "In the lure of Geistesgeschichte : the theme of decline in Hungarian historiography and historical thinking in the first half of the twentieth century". ''[[European Review of History]]'' (2015) 22#3 pp 411-432. {{doi|10.1080/13507486.2014.986435}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the [[End of communism in Hungary (1989)|end of Communism in Hungary]] in 1989. [[Marxist historiography]] collapsed and social history came into its own, especially the study of the demographic patterns of the early modern period. Research priorities have shifted toward [[urban history]] and the conditions of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Interlanguage link multi|Gyáni Gábor|hu}}, "Trends in contemporary Hungarian historical scholarship," ''[[Social History (journal)|Social History]],'' (2009) 34#2 pp 250-260&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
When [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Communism ended]] in 1991, large parts of the [[Soviet archives]] were opened.  The historians' data base leapt from a limited range of sources to a vast array of records created by modern bureaucracies. Social history flourished.  The old [[Marxist historiography]] collapsed overnight.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sheila Fitzpatrick]],  "Impact of the Opening of Soviet Archives on Western Scholarship on Soviet Social History." ''[[Russian Review]]'' 74#3 (2015): 377-400. {{DOI|10.1111/russ.12021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
{{main|Social history of Canada}}
Social history had a "golden age" in Canada in the 1970s, and continues to flourish among scholars. Its strengths include demography, women, labour, and urban studies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael S.  Cross, [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/social-history/ "Social History,"] ''Canadian Encyclopedia'' (2008) online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael S. Cross and Gregory S. Kealey, eds. ''Readings in Canadian Social History'' (5 vol., 1983), articles by scholars&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Horn and Sabourin, Ronald, eds. ''Studies in Canadian Social History'' (1974). 480 pp. articles by scholars&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political history==
While the study of elites and political institutions has produced a vast body of scholarship, the impact after 1960 of social historians has shifted emphasis onto the politics of ordinary people—especially voters and collective movements. Political historians responded with the "new political history," which has shifted attention to political cultures. Some scholars have recently applied a cultural approach to political history.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Pasley, Andrew W. Robertson, and David Waldstreicher, eds. ''Beyond the Founders: New Approaches to the Political History of the Early American Republic'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some political historians complain that social historians are likely to put too much stress on the dimensions of class, gender and race, reflecting a leftist political agenda that assumes outsiders in politics are more interesting than the actual decision makers.&lt;ref&gt;Romain Huret, "All in the Family Again? Political Historians and the Challenge of Social History," ''Journal of Policy History'', July 2009, Vol. 21 Issue 3, pp 239-263&lt;/ref&gt;

Social history, with its leftist political origins, initially sought to link state power to everyday experience in the 1960s. Yet by the 1970s, social historians increasingly excluded analyses of state power from its focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parthasarathi|first=Prasannan|title=The State and Social History|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2006|volume=39|issue=3|pages=771–778|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/journal_of_social_history/v039/39.3parthasarathi.pdf|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.1353/jsh.2006.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social historians have recently engaged with political history through studies of the relationships between state formation, power and everyday life with the theoretical tools of [[cultural hegemony]] and [[governmentality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunn|first=Simon|title=From Hegemony to Governmentality:  Changing Conceptions of Power in Social History|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2006|volume=39|issue=3|pages=705–720|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_social_history/v039/39.3gunn.html|accessdate=17 December 2012|doi=10.1353/jsh.2006.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social stress''' is [[stress (biological)|stress]] that stems from one's relationships with others and from the social environment in general.&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;Simandan, D., 2018.

Vol. 200, pp. 258-261. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Appraisal theory|appraisal]] theory of emotion, stress arises when a person evaluates a situation as personally relevant and perceives that s/he does not have the resources to cope or handle the specific situation.&lt;ref&gt;

There are three main categories of social stressors.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, S., 2017. Social stress.

== Definitions ==
Researchers define social stress and social stressors in various ways.  Wadman, Durkin, and Conti-Ramsden (2011) defined social stress as "the feelings of discomfort or anxiety that individuals may experience in social situations, and the associated tendency to avoid potentially stressful social situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress in young people with specific language impairment|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140197110001016|journal = Journal of Adolescence|date = 2011-06-01|pages = 421–431|volume = 34|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.adolescence.2010.06.010|first = Ruth|last = Wadman|first2 = Kevin|last2 = Durkin|first3 = Gina|last3 = Conti-Ramsden}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ilfield (1977) defined social stressors as "circumstances of daily social roles that are generally considered problematic or undesirable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Current social stressors and symptoms of depression|journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry|date = 1977-02-01|issn = 0002-953X|pmid = 835737|pages = 161–166|volume = 134|issue = 2|doi = 10.1176/ajp.134.2.161|first = F.

== Measurement ==
Social stress is typically measured through self-report questionnaires.  In the laboratory, researchers can induce social stress through various methods and protocols.

=== Self-reports ===
There are several questionnaires used to assess environmental and psychosocial stress.  Such self-report measures include the Test of Negative Social Exchange,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ruehlman | first=Linda S. |author2=Karoly, Paul  | title=With a little flak from my friends: Development and preliminary validation of the Test of Negative Social Exchange (TENSE) | journal=Psychological Assessment | year=1991  | volume=3 | issue=1 | pages=97–104 | doi=10.1037/1040-3590.3.1.97}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Marital Adjustment Test,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Locke | first=Harvey J. |author2=Wallace, Karl M.  | title=Short Marital-Adjustment and Prediction Tests: Their Reliability and Validity | journal=Marriage and Family Living| date=August 1959 | volume=21 | issue=3 | page=251 | doi=10.2307/348022 | jstor=348022}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Risky Families Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Shelley E |author2=Lerner, Jennifer S |author3=Sage, Rebecca M |author4=Lehman, Barbara J |author5= Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Early environment, emotions, responses to stress, and health | journal=Journal of Personality | date=December 2004 | volume=72 | issue=6 | pages=1365–1393 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00300.x | pmid=15509286 | url=http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/lernerlab/files/taylor_lerner_sage_lehman_seeman_2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Holmes–Rahe Stress Inventory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The social readjustment rating scale|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0022399967900104|journal = Journal of Psychosomatic Research|pages = 213–218|volume = 11|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/0022-3999(67)90010-4|first = Thomas H.|last = Holmes|first2 = Richard H.|last2 = Rahe|pmid=6059863|date=August 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Trierer Inventar zur Erfassung von chronischem Streß (TICS): Skalenkonstruktion, teststatistische Überprüfung und Validierung der Skala Arbeitsüberlastung|url = http://econtent.hogrefe.com/doi/abs/10.1026//0012-1924.45.1.8|journal = Diagnostica|date = 1999-01-01|issn = 0012-1924|pages = 8–19|volume = 45|issue = 1|doi = 10.1026//0012-1924.45.1.8|first = Peter|last = Schulz|first2 = Wolff|last2 = Schlotz}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Daily Stress Inventory,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A daily stress inventory: Development, reliability, and validity|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00845128|journal = Journal of Behavioral Medicine|date = 1987-02-01|issn = 0160-7715|pages = 61–73|volume = 10|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/BF00845128|first = Phillip J.|last = Brantley|first2 = Craig D.|last2 = Waggoner|first3 = Glenn N.|last3 = Jones|first4 = Neil B.|last4 = Rappaport}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Job Content Questionnaire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ): An instrument for internationally comparative assessments of psychosocial job characteristics.|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1076-8998.3.4.322|journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology|pages = 322–355|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.1037/1076-8998.3.4.322|first = Robert|last = Karasek|first2 = Chantal|last2 = Brisson|first3 = Norito|last3 = Kawakami|first4 = Irene|last4 = Houtman|first5 = Paulien|last5 = Bongers|first6 = Benjamin|last6 = Amick}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Perceived Stress Scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Global Measure of Perceived Stress|journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior|date = 1983-12-01|pages = 385–396|volume = 24|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2136404|first = Sheldon|last = Cohen|first2 = Tom|last2 = Kamarck|first3 = Robin|last3 = Mermelstein|jstor=2136404|pmid=6668417}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Stress and Adversity Inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Slavich, G.

In addition to self-report questionnaires, researchers can employ structured interview assessments. The Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS) is one of the most popular instruments used in research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Measuring Stress: A Guide for Health and Social Scientists|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6NDhBwAAQBAJ|publisher = Oxford University Press|date = 1997-11-17|isbn = 9780190283889|first = Sheldon|last = Cohen|first2 = Ronald C.|last2 = Kessler|first3 = Lynn Underwood|last3 = Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social origins of depression: A study of psychiatric disorder in women|last = Brown|first = George William|publisher = Tavistock|year = 1978|isbn = 0-422-76310-1|location = London|pages = |last2 = Harris|first2 = Tirril}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this type of measure is to probe the participant to elaborate on his/her stressful life events, rather than answering singular questions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The UCLA Life Stress Interview (LSI), which is similar to the LEDS, includes questions about romantic partners, closest friendships, other friendships, and family relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hammen Lab at UCLA|url = http://hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu/interview.html|website = hammenlab.psych.ucla.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Induction ===
In [[mouse model|rodent models]], [[social disruption]] and [[social defeat]] are two common social stress paradigms. In the social disruption paradigm, an aggressive rodent is introduced into a cage housing male rodents that have already naturally established a social hierarchy. The aggressive "intruder" disrupts the social hierarchy, causing the residents social stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social stress induces glucocorticoid resistance in macrophages|url = http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/280/6/R1799|journal = American Journal of Physiology.

In human research, the [[Trier social stress test|Trier Social Stress Task]] (TSST) is widely used to induce social stress in the laboratory. In the TSST, participants are told that they have to prepare and give a speech about why they would be a great candidate for their ideal job.  The experimenter films the participant while s/he gives the speech and informs the participant that a panel of judges will evaluate that speech.  After the public speaking component, the experimenter administers a mathematics task that involves counting backwards by certain increments.  If the participant makes a mistake, the experimenter prompts him/her to start again.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kirschbaum | first=C |author2=Pirke, K M |author3=Hellhammer, D H  | title=The 'Trier Social Stress Test'—a tool for investigating psychobiological stress responses in a laboratory setting | journal=Neuropsychobiology | year=1993 | volume=28 | issue=1–2 | pages=76–81 | pmid=8255414 | url=http://p113367.typo3server.info/uploads/media/lit9304.pdf | doi=10.1159/000119004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of negative evaluation is the social stressor. Researchers can measure the stress response by comparing pre-stress salivary cortisol levels and post-stress salivary cortisol levels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Other common stress measures used in the TSST are self-report measures like the [[State-Trait Anxiety Inventory]] and physiological measures like heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;Spielberger, C.

In a laboratory conflict discussion, couples identify several specific areas of conflict in their relationship.  The couples then pinpoint a couple topics to discuss later on in the experiment (ex. finances, child-rearing).  Couples are told to discuss the conflict(s) for 10 minutes while being videotaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ditzen | first1 = B. | last2 = Schaer | first2 = M. | last3 = Gabriel | first3 = B. | last4 = Bodenmann | first4 = G. | last5 = Ehlert | first5 = U. | last6 = Heinrichs | first6 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Intranasal oxytocin increases positive communication and reduces cortisol levels during couple conflict | url = | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 9| pages = 728–731 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2008.10.011 | pmid=19027101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brouwer and Hogervorst (2014) designed the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST) to induce stress in the laboratory setting.  After viewing neutral images with subsequent 1-minute rest periods, the participant is instructed to sing a song after the next 1-minute rest period is complete.  Researchers found that skin conductance and heart rate are significantly higher during the post-song message interval than the previous 1-minute intervals.  The stress levels are comparable to that induced in the Trier Social Stress Task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A new paradigm to induce mental stress: the Sing-a-Song Stress Test (SSST) |journal = Frontiers in Neuroscience|date = 2014-07-29|issn = 1662-4548|pmc = 4114180|pmid = 25120425|volume = 8|doi = 10.3389/fnins.2014.00224|first = Anne-Marie|last = Brouwer|first2 = Maarten A.|last2 = Hogervorst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical indicators of stress in large groups===

A statistical indicator of stress, simultaneous increase of [[variance]] and [[correlations]], was proposed for diagnosis of stress and successfully used in physiology and finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorban|first1=A.N.|last2=Smirnova|first2=E.V.|last3=Tyukina|first3=T.

''"Introduction to econophysics: correlations and complexity in finance."' Cambridge university press; 1999 Nov 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Its applicability for early diagnosis of social stress in large groups was demonstrated by the analysis of crises. It was examined in the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 [[Ukrainian crisis|Ukrainian economic and political crisis]]. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rybnikov|first1=S.R.|last2=Rybnikova|first2=N.A.|last3=Portnov|first3=B.A.|title=Public fears in Ukrainian society: Are crises predictable?|journal=Psychology &amp; Developing Societies|date=March 2017|volume=29|issue=1|pages=98–123|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315918065_Public_fears_in_Ukrainian_society_Are_crises_predictable|doi=10.1177/0971333616689398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health ==

Research has consistently demonstrated that social stress increases risk for developing negative [[mental health]] outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, S., 2017. Social stress. New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; One [[prospective study]] asked over fifteen hundred Finnish employees whether they had "considerable difficulties with [their] coworkers/superiors/inferiors during the last 6 months, 5 years, earlier, or never".&lt;ref name=romanov&gt;{{cite journal | last=Romanov | first=K |author2=Appelberg, K |author3=Honkasalo, M L |author4= Koskenvuo, M  | title=Recent interpersonal conflict at work and psychiatric morbidity: a prospective study of 15,530 employees aged 24-64 | journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research | date=February 1996 | volume=40 | issue=2 | pages=169–176 | pmid=8778399 | doi=10.1016/0022-3999(95)00577-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information on suicides, hospitalizations due to [[psychosis]], suicidal behavior, alcohol intoxication, depressive symptoms, and medication for chronic psychiatric disorders was then gathered from the national registries of mortality and morbidity. Those who had experienced conflict in the workplace with coworkers or supervisors in the last five years were more likely to be diagnosed with a psychiatric condition.&lt;ref name=romanov /&gt;

Research on the [[LGBT|LGB]] population has suggested that people who identify as LGB suffer more from mental health disorders, such as [[substance abuse]] and [[mood disorder]]s, compared to those who identify as heterosexual.&lt;ref name="Meyer 674–697"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prejudice, Social Stress, and Mental Health in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Populations: Conceptual Issues and Research Evidence|journal = Psychological Bulletin|date = 2003-09-01|issn = 0033-2909|pmc = 2072932|pmid = 12956539|pages = 674–697|volume = 129|issue = 5|doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674|first = Ilan H.|last = Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers deduce that the LGB people's higher risk of mental health issues derives from their stressful social environments.  [[Minority group]]s can face high levels of stigma, prejudice, and discrimination on a regular basis, therefore leading to the development of various mental health disorders.&lt;ref name="Meyer 674–697"/&gt;

=== Anxiety ===
The biological basis for [[anxiety disorder]]s is rooted in the consistent activation of the stress response.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Fear, which is the defining emotion of an anxiety disorder, occurs when someone perceives a situation (a stressor) as threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shin | first1 = L.

If a person has difficulty regulating this stress response, it may activate inappropriately. Stress can therefore arise when a real stressor is not present or when something isn't actually threatening.  This can lead to the development of an anxiety disorder ([[panic attack]]s, [[social anxiety]], [[OCD]], etc.).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neuroscience|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=75NgwLzueikC|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2007-01-01|isbn = 9780781760034|first = Mark F.|last = Bear|first2 = Barry W.|last2 = Connors|first3 = Michael A.|last3 = Paradiso}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anxiety disorder]] is defined as the fear of being judged or evaluated by others, even if no such threat is actually present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Anxiety Disorder {{!}} Anxiety and Depression Association of America, ADAA|url = http://www.adaa.org/social-anxiety-disorder|website = www.adaa.org|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Long-term effects ===
Social stress occurring early in life can have [[psychopathological]] effects that develop or persist in adulthood. One [[longitudinal study]] found that children were more likely to have a psychiatric disorder (e.g. anxiety, depressive, disruptive, personality, and substance use disorders) in late adolescence and early adulthood when their parents showed more maladaptive child-rearing behaviors (e.g., loud arguments between parents, verbal abuse, difficulty controlling anger toward the child, lack of parental support or availability, and harsh punishment). Child [[temperament]] and parental psychiatric disorders did not explain this association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Johnson | first=J G |author2=Cohen, P |author3=Kasen, S |author4=Smailes, E |author5= Brook, J S  | title=Association of maladaptive parental behavior with psychiatric disorder among parents and their offspring | journal=Archives of General Psychiatry | date=May 2001 | volume=58 | issue=5 | pages=453–460 | pmid=11343524 | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.58.5.453}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have documented the robust relationships between children’s social stress within the family environment and depression, [[aggression]], [[antisocial behavior]], [[anxiety]], [[suicide]], and hostile, oppositional, and delinquent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Repetti | first=Rena L |author2=Taylor, Shelley E |author3=Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Risky families: family social environments and the mental and physical health of offspring | journal=Psychological Bulletin | date=March 2002 | volume=128 | issue=2 | pages=330–366 | pmid=11931522 | url=http://taylorlab.psych.ucla.edu/2002_%20Risky%20Families_Family%20Social%20Environments%20and%20the%20Mental%20and%20Physical%20Health%20of%20Offspring.pdf | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relapse and recurrence ===
Social stress can also exacerbate current psychopathological conditions and compromise recovery. For instance, patients recovering from depression or [[bipolar disorder]] are two times more likely to relapse if there is familial tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miklowitz | first1 = D.

Research has also found a robust relationship between various social stressors and aspects of physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = G. | last2 = Chen | first2 = E. | last3 = Cole | first3 = S.

=== Mortality ===
Social status, a macro-social stressor, is a robust predictor of death. In a study of over 1700 British civil servants, [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) was inversely related to mortality. Those with the lowest SES have worse health outcomes and greater mortality rates than those with the greatest SES.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marmot | first=M G |author2=Rose, G |author3=Shipley, M |author4= Hamilton, P J  | title=Employment grade and coronary heart disease in British civil servants | journal=Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | date=December 1978 | volume=32 | issue=4 | pages=244–249 | pmid=744814 | pmc=1060958 | doi=10.1136/jech.32.4.244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have replicated this relationship between SES and mortality in a range of diseases, including infectious, digestive, and respiratory diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Adler | first=N E |author2=Boyce, T |author3=Chesney, M A |author4=Cohen, S |author5=Folkman, S |author6=Kahn, R L |author7= Syme, S L  | title=Socioeconomic status and health.

Similarly, social stressors in the micro-environment are also linked to increased mortality. A seminal longitudinal study of nearly 7,000 people found that socially isolated people had greater risk of dying from any cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Berkman | first=L F |author2=Syme, S L  | title=Social networks, host resistance, and mortality: a nine-year follow-up study of Alameda County residents | journal=American Journal of Epidemiology | date=February 1979 | volume=109 | issue=2 | pages=186–204 | pmid=425958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social support]], which is defined as "the comfort, assistance, and/or information one receives through formal or informal contacts with individuals or groups",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallston | first1 = B.

=== Morbidity ===
Social stress also makes people more sick. People who have fewer social contacts are at greater risk for developing illness, including cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Seeman | first=T E | title=Health promoting effects of friends and family on health outcomes in older adults | journal=American Journal of Health Promotion | date=August 2000 | volume=14 | issue=6 | pages=362–370 | pmid=11067571 | doi=10.4278/0890-1171-14.6.362}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lower one’s social status, the more likely he or she is to have a [[cardiovascular disease|cardiovascular]], [[gastrointestinal disease|gastrointestinal]], [[Musculoskeletal diseases|musculoskeletal]], [[Neoplastic disease|neoplastic]], [[Pulmonary disease|pulmonary]], [[Renal disease|renal]], or other [[chronic disease]]s.

In one laboratory study, researchers interviewed participants to determine whether they had been experiencing social conflicts with spouses, close family members and friends. They then exposed the participants to the [[common cold virus]] and found that participants with conflict-ridden relationships were two times more likely to develop a cold than those without such social stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cohen | first=S |author2=Frank, E |author3=Doyle, W J |author4=Skoner, D P |author5=Rabin, B S |author6= Gwaltney, J M, Jr  | title=Types of stressors that increase susceptibility to the common cold in healthy adults | journal=Health Psychology | date=May 1998 | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=214–223 | pmid=9619470 | url=http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~scohen/types%20of%20stressors.pdf | doi=10.1037/0278-6133.17.3.214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social support, especially in terms of support for socioeconomic stressors, is inversely related to physical morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Stress: Theory and Research|journal = Annual Review of Sociology|date = 1992-01-01|pages = 15–38|volume = 18|first = Carol S.|last = Aneshensel|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.18.1.15|jstor=2083444}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study that investigated social determinants of health in an urban slum in India found that social exclusion, stress, and lack of social support are significantly related to illnesses, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pawar | first1 = A.

=== Long-term effects ===
Exposure to social stress in childhood can also have long-term effects, increasing risk for developing diseases later in life. In particular, adults who were maltreated (emotionally, physically, sexually abused or neglected) as children report more disease outcomes, such as [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[diabetes]], and [[hypertension]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rich-Edwards | first=Janet W | author2=Spiegelman, Donna; Lividoti Hibert, Eileen N; Jun, Hee-Jin; Todd, Tamarra James; Kawachi, Ichiro; Wright, Rosalind J | title=Abuse in childhood and adolescence as a predictor of type 2 diabetes in adult women | journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine | date=December 2010 | volume=39 | issue=6 | pages=529–536 | doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2010.09.007 | pmid=21084073 | pmc=3003936}}&lt;/ref&gt; or greater severity of those outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wegman | first=Holly L |author2=Stetler, Cinnamon  | title=A meta-analytic review of the effects of childhood abuse on medical outcomes in adulthood | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=October 2009 | volume=71 | issue=8 | pages=805–812 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181bb2b46 | pmid=19779142 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/71/8/805.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adverse Childhood Experiences (study)|Adverse Childhood Experiences study]] (ACE), which includes over seventeen thousand adults, also found that there was a 20% increase in likelihood for experiencing [[heart disease]] for each kind of chronic familial social stressor experienced in childhood, and this was not due to typical risk factors for heart disease such as demographics, smoking, exercise, [[adiposity]], diabetes, or hypertension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dong | first=Maxia |author2=Giles, Wayne H |author3=Felitti, Vincent J |author4=Dube, Shanta R |author5=Williams, Janice E |author6=Chapman, Daniel P |author7= Anda, Robert F  | title=Insights Into Causal Pathways for Ischemic Heart Disease: Adverse Childhood Experiences Study | journal=Circulation | date=28 September 2004 | volume=110 | issue=13 | pages=1761–1766 | doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000143074.54995.7F | pmid=15381652 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/110/13/1761.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recovery and other disease ===
Social stress has also been tied to worse health outcomes among patients who already have a disease.

== Physiology ==

Social stress leads to a number of physiological changes that mediate its relationship to physical health.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the short term, the physiological changes outlined below are adaptive, as they enable the stressed organism to cope better. Dysregulation of these systems or repeated activation of them over the long-term can be detrimental to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=McEwen | first=B S |author2=Stellar, E  | title=Stress and the individual: Mechanisms leading to disease | journal=Archives of Internal Medicine | date=27 September 1993 | volume=153 | issue=18 | pages=2093–2101 | pmid=8379800 | url=http://yalerei.org/intmed/resources/docs/McEwen.pdf | doi=10.1001/archinte.153.18.2093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sympathetic nervous system ===
The [[sympathetic nervous system]] (SNS) becomes activated in response to stress. Sympathetic arousal stimulates the [[adrenal medulla|medulla]] of the [[adrenal glands|medulla]] to secrete [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]] into the blood stream, which facilitates the [[fight-or-flight response]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Blood pressure, heart rate, and sweating increase, [[vasoconstriction|veins constrict]] to allow the heart to beat with more force, arteries leading to muscles dilate, and blood flow to parts of the body not essential for the fight or flight response decreases. If stress persists in the long run, then blood pressure remains elevated, leading to hypertension and [[atherosclerosis]], both precursors to [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Sapolsky, R. M. (1994). Why zebras don't get ulcers: A guide to stress, stress related diseases, and coping. New York: W.H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of animal and human studies have confirmed that social stress increases risk for negative health outcomes by increasing SNS activity.

=== Hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical axis (HPA) ===
In response to stress, the [[hypothalamus]] releases [[corticotropin-releasing hormone]] (CRH), stimulating the [[anterior pituitary]] to release [[adrenocorticotropic hormone]] (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the [[adrenal cortex]] to secrete [[glucocorticoids]], including [[cortisol]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Social stress can lead to adverse health outcomes by chronically activating the HPA axis or disrupting the HPA system.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are a number of studies that link social stress and indications of a disrupted HPA axis; for instance, monkey infants neglected by their mothers show prolonged cortisol responses following a challenging event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dettling | first=A |author2=Pryce, C R |author3=Martin, R D |author4= Döbeli, M  | title=Physiological Responses to parental separation and a strange situation are related to parental care received in juvenile Goeldi's monkeys (''Callimico goeldii'') | journal=Developmental Psychobiology | date=July 1998 | volume=33 | issue=1 | pages=21–31 | pmid=9664169 | doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2302(199807)33:1&lt;21::aid-dev3&gt;3.0.co;2-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inflammation ===
[[Inflammation]] is an immune response that is critical to fighting infections and repairing injured tissue. Although acute inflammation is adaptive, chronic inflammatory activity can contribute to adverse health outcomes, such as hypertension,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Niskanen | first=Leo |author2=Laaksonen, David E |author3=Nyyssönen, Kristiina |author4=Punnonen, Kari |author5=Valkonen, Veli-Pekka |author6=Fuentes, Ricardo |author7=Tuomainen, Tomi-Pekka |author8=Salonen, Riitta |author9= Salonen, Jukka T   | title=Inflammation, abdominal obesity, and smoking as predictors of hypertension | journal=Hypertension | date=December 2004 | volume=44 | issue=6 | pages=859–865 | doi=10.1161/01.HYP.0000146691.51307.84 | pmid=15492131 | url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/44/6/859.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; atherosclerosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Amar | first=Jacques |author2=Fauvel, Josette |author3=Drouet, Ludovic |author4=Ruidavets, Jean Bernard |author5=Perret, Bertrand |author6=Chamontin, Bernard |author7=Boccalon, Henri |author8= Ferrieres, Jean  | title=Interleukin 6 is associated with subclinical atherosclerosis: a link with soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 | journal=Journal of Hypertension | date=June 2006 | volume=24 | issue=6 | pages=1083–1088 | doi=10.1097/01.hjh.0000226198.44181.0c | pmid=16685208}}&lt;/ref&gt; coronary heart disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cesari | first=Matteo | author2=Penninx, Brenda W J H; Newman, Anne B; Kritchevsky, Stephen B; Nicklas, Barbara J; Sutton-Tyrrell, Kim; Rubin, Susan M; Ding, Jingzhong; Simonsick, Eleanor M; Harris, Tamara B; Pahor, Marco | title=Inflammatory markers and onset of cardiovascular events: results from the Health ABC study | journal=Circulation | date=11 November 2003 | volume=108 | issue=19 | pages=2317–2322 | doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000097109.90783.FC | pmid=14568895 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/108/19/2317.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ridker | first=P M |author2=Rifai, N |author3=Stampfer, M J |author4= Hennekens, C H  | title=Plasma concentration of interleukin-6 and the risk of future myocardial infarction among apparently healthy men | journal=Circulation | date=18 April 2000 | volume=101 | issue=15 | pages=1767–1772 | pmid=10769275 | url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/101/15/1767.long | doi=10.1161/01.cir.101.15.1767}}&lt;/ref&gt; depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Raison | first=Charles L |author2=Capuron, Lucile |author3=Miller, Andrew H  | title=Cytokines sing the blues: inflammation and the pathogenesis of depression | journal=Trends in Immunology | date=January 2006 | volume=27 | issue=1 | pages=24–31 | doi=10.1016/j.it.2005.11.006 | pmid=16316783 | pmc=3392963}}&lt;/ref&gt; diabetes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wellen | first=Kathryn E |author2=Hotamisligil, Gökhan S  | title=Inflammation, stress, and diabetes | journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation | date=May 2005 | volume=115 | issue=5 | pages=1111–1119 | doi=10.1172/JCI25102 | pmid=15864338 | pmc=1087185}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Coussens | first=Lisa M |author2=Werb, Zena  | title=Inflammation and cancer | journal=Nature | date=19 December 2002 | volume=420 | issue=6917 | pages=860–867 | doi=10.1038/nature01322 | pmid=12490959 | pmc=2803035| bibcode=2002Natur.420..860C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rakoff-Nahoum | first=Seth | title=Why Cancer and Inflammation? | journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine | date=December 2006 | volume=79 | issue=3–4 | pages=123–130 | pmid=17940622 | pmc=1994795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has elucidated a relationship between different social stressors and [[cytokines]] (the markers of inflammation). Chronic social stressors, such as caring for a spouse with dementia, lead to greater circulating levels of [[Interleukin 6|cytokine interleukin-6]] (IL-6),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kiecolt-Glaser | first=Janice K |author2=Preacher, Kristopher J |author3=MacCallum, Robert C |author4=Atkinson, Cathie |author5=Malarkey, William B |author6= Glaser, Ronald  | title=Chronic stress and age-related increases in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | date=22 July 2003 | volume=100 | issue=15 | pages=9090–9095 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1531903100 | pmid=12840146 | pmc=166443|bibcode=2003PNAS..100.9090K }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas acute social stress tasks in the laboratory have been shown to elicit increases in [[proinflammatory cytokines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Steptoe | first=Andrew |author2=Hamer, Mark |author3=Chida, Yoichi  | title=The effects of acute psychological stress on circulating inflammatory factors in humans: a review and meta-analysis | journal=Brain, Behavior, and Immunity | date=October 2007 | volume=21 | issue=7 | pages=901–912 | doi=10.1016/j.bbi.2007.03.011 | pmid=17475444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when faced with another type of social stress, namely social evaluative threat, participants showed increases in IL-6 and a soluble receptor for [[tumor necrosis factor-α]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Slavich | first=George M. |author2=Way, Baldwin M. |author3=Eisenberger, Naomi I. |author4= Taylor, Shelley E.  | title=Neural sensitivity to social rejection is associated with inflammatory responses to social stress | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | date=17 August 2010 | volume=107 | issue=33 | pages=14817–14822 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1009164107 | pmid=20679216 | pmc=2930449| bibcode=2010PNAS..10714817S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dickerson | first=Sally S |author2=Gable, Shelly L |author3=Irwin, Michael R |author4=Aziz, Najib |author5= Kemeny, Margaret E  | title=Social-evaluative threat and proinflammatory cytokine regulation: an experimental laboratory investigation | journal=Psychological Science | date=October 2009 | volume=20 | issue=10 | pages=1237–1244 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02437.x | pmid=19754527 | pmc=2761517}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Miller | first=Gregory E |author2=Rohleder, Nicolas |author3=Stetler, Cinnamon |author4= Kirschbaum, Clemens  | title=Clinical depression and regulation of the inflammatory response during acute stress | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=October 2005 | volume=67 | issue=5 | pages=679–687 | doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000174172.82428.ce | pmid=16204423 | url=http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/67/5/679.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in inflammation may persist over time, as studies have shown that chronic relationship stress has been tied to greater IL-6 production 6 months later&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Miller | first=Gregory E |author2=Rohleder, Nicolas |author3=Cole, Steve W  | title=Chronic interpersonal stress predicts activation of pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways 6 months later | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=January 2009 | volume=71 | issue=1 | pages=57–62 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e318190d7de | pmid=19073750 | pmc=2720615}}&lt;/ref&gt; and children reared in a stressful family environment marked by neglect and conflict tend to show elevated levels of [[C-reactive protein]], a marker of IL-6, in adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Taylor | first=Shelley E |author2=Lehman, Barbara J |author3=Kiefe, Catarina I |author4= Seeman, Teresa E  | title=Relationship of early life stress and psychological functioning to adult C-reactive protein in the coronary artery risk development in young adults study | journal=Biological Psychiatry | date=15 October 2006 | volume=60 | issue=8 | pages=819–824 | doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2006.03.016 | pmid=16712805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interactions of physiological systems ===
There is extensive evidence that the above physiological systems affect one another's functioning. For instance, cortisol tends to have a suppressive effect on inflammatory processes, and proinflammatory cytokines can also activate the HPA system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Wilder | first=R L | title=Neuroendocrine-immune system interactions and autoimmunity | journal=Annual Review of Immunology | year=1995 | volume=13 | pages=307–338 | doi=10.1146/annurev.iy.13.040195.001515 | pmid=7612226}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sympathetic activity can also [[upregulate]] inflammatory activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jan | first=Badar U |author2=Coyle, Susette M |author3=Macor, Marie A |author4=Reddell, Michael |author5=Calvano, Steve E |author6= Lowry, Stephen F  | title=Relationship of basal heart rate variability to in vivo cytokine responses after endotoxin exposure | journal=Shock | date=April 2010 | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=363–368 | doi=10.1097/SHK.0b013e3181b66bf4 | pmid=20407404 | pmc=2980578}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Marsland | first=Anna L |author2=Gianaros, Peter J |author3=Prather, Aric A |author4=Jennings, J Richard |author5=Neumann, Serina A |author6= Manuck, Stephen B  | title=Stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines covaries inversely with heart rate variability | journal=Psychosomatic Medicine | date=November 2007 | volume=69 | issue=8 | pages=709–716 | doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181576118 | pmid=17942840}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the relationships among these physiological systems, social stress may also influence health indirectly via affecting a particular physiological system that in turn affects a different physiological system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2016">'''Societal innovation''' refers to a systemic change in the interplay of the [[Sovereign state|state]] and [[civil society]]. It is a relative of [[social innovation]], but differs from it by considering the state to be an important co-creator in achieving [[sustainable]] systemic change. In this sense, the term's origins lie beyond the traditional anglosaxon understanding for the concept of [[social innovation]]. 

The term has been used in research, see e.g.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Cova, Christian Svanfeldt, Societal innovations and the postmodern aestheticization of everyday life, International Journal of Research in Marketing, Volume 10, Issue 3, August 1993, Pages 297-310, ISSN 0167-8116, 10.1016/0167-8116(93)90012-N.

but also in some official reports and documents of the European Union, where societal innovation is considered as an answer to societal challenges. A formal definition exists 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lehtola|first=Ville V.|author2=Ståhle, Pirjo|title=Societal innovation at the interface of the state and civil society|journal=Innovation: The European Journal of Social Science Research|date=15 January 2014|pages=1–23|doi=10.1080/13511610.2014.863995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''A societal innovation introduces a novel economic and/or social improvement to people’s''
''everyday life. It brings a (radical or incremental) systemic change to society’s structures or''
''modes of operation, and it is legitimated by the majority of societal stakeholders.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8513">[[File:DiffusionOfInnovation.png|thumb|[[Everett Rogers|Rogers]]{{'}} [[normal distribution|bell curve]]]]
The '''technology adoption lifecycle''' is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical [[normal distribution]] or "bell curve". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called "[[innovators]]", followed by "[[early adopters]]". Next come the '''early majority''' and '''late majority''', and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called "Laggards" or "phobics." For example, a phobic may only use a cloud service when it is the only remaining method of performing a required task, but the phobic may not have an in-depth technical knowledge of how to use the service.

The [[demographic]] and [[psychological]] (or "[[psychographic]]") profiles of each adoption group were originally specified by the North Central Rural Sociology Committee, Subcommittee for the Study of the Diffusion of Farm Practices, by agricultural researchers Beal and Bohlen in 1957.&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
The report summarized the categories as:&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
* [[innovators]] – had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented
* [[early adopter]]s – younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous
* early majority – more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbours
* late majority – older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active
* laggards – very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated

The model has subsequently been adapted for many areas of technology adoption in the late 20th century.

==Adaptations of the model==
The model has spawned a range of adaptations that extend the concept or apply it to specific domains of interest.

In his book ''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'', [[Geoffrey Moore]] proposes a variation of the original lifecycle. He suggests that for discontinuous innovations, which may result in a Foster disruption based on s-curve, there is a gap or chasm between the first two adopter groups (innovators/early adopters), and the vertical markets.

Disruption as it is used today are of the [[Clayton M. Christensen]] variety. These disruptions are not s-curve based. 

In [[educational technology]], Lindy McKeown has provided a similar model (a pencil metaphor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm Pencil metaphor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128192012/http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm |date=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) describing the [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] uptake in education. In [[medical sociology]], Carl May has proposed [[normalization process theory]] that shows how technologies become embedded and integrated in health care and other kinds of organisation.

Wenger, White and Smith, in their book ''Digital habitats: Stewarding technology for communities'', talk of technology stewards: people with sufficient understanding of the technology available and the technological needs of a community to steward the community through the technology adoption process.&lt;ref&gt;

Rayna and Striukova (2009) propose that the choice of initial market segment has crucial importance for crossing the chasm, as adoption in this segment can lead to a cascade of adoption in the other segments. This initial market segment has, at the same time, to contain a large proportion of visionaries, to be small enough for adoption to be observed from within the segment and from other segment and be sufficiently connected with other segments. If this is the case, the adoption in the first segment will progressively cascade into the adjacent segments, thereby triggering the adoption by the mass-market.&lt;ref&gt; Rayna, Thierry, Striukova, Ludmila and Landau, Samuel, Crossing the Chasm or Being Crossed Out: The Case of Digital Audio Players (March 7, 2009). International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 36-54, July-September 2009. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392691&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One way to model product adoption&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis. (2008) [http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures/lecture04.pdf Science of the Web] lectures at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; is to understand that people's behaviours are influenced by their peers and how widespread they think a particular action is. For many format-dependent technologies, people have a non-zero payoff for adopting the same technology as their closest friends or colleagues. If two users both adopt product A, they might get a payoff ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0; if they adopt product B, they get ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. But if one adopts A and the other adopts B, they both get a payoff of&amp;nbsp;0.

A threshold can be set for each user to adopt a product. Say that a node v in a graph has d neighbors: then v will adopt product A if a fraction p of its neighbors is greater than or equal to some threshold. For example, if v's threshold is 2/3, and only one of its two neighbors adopts product A, then v will not adopt A. Using this model, we can deterministically model product adoption on sample networks.

==History==
The technology adoption lifecycle is a [[sociological]] model that is an extension of an earlier model called ''the diffusion process'', which was originally published in 1957 by Joe M. Bohlen, George M. Beal and [[Everett M. Rogers]] at [[Iowa State University]] and which was originally published only for its application to [[agriculture]] and [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957&gt;{{cite journal

'''Technology society and life''' or '''technology and culture''' refers to cyclical co-dependence, co-influence, and co-production of [[technology]] and [[society]] upon the other (technology upon culture, and vice versa). This synergistic relationship occurred from the dawn of humankind, with the invention of simple tools and continues into modern technologies such as the [[printing press]] and [[computer]]s. The academic discipline studying the impacts of science, technology, and society, and vice versa is called [[science and technology studies]].

==Pre-historical==
The importance of [[stone tool]]s, circa 2.5 million years ago, is considered fundamental in the human development in the [[hunting hypothesis]].

Primatologist, [[Richard Wrangham]], theorizes that the [[control of fire by early humans]] and the associated development of [[cooking]] was the spark that radically changed human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Texts such as ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' suggest that early advances in plant agriculture and husbandry fundamentally shifted the way that collective groups of individuals, and eventually societies, developed.

==Modern examples and effects==
Technology has become a huge part in society and day-to-day life. When societies know more about the development in a technology, they become able to take advantage of it. When an innovation achieves a certain point after it has been presented and promoted, this technology becomes part of the society.The use of technology in education provides students with technology literacy, information literacy, capacity for life-long learning and other skills necessary for the 21st century workplace. &lt;ref name=Puricelli&gt;{{harv|Puricelli|2011|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital technology]] has entered each process and activity made by the [[social system]]. In fact, it constructed another worldwide [[communication system]] in addition to its origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rückriem|2009|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1982 study by ''[[The New York Times]]'' described a technology assessment study by the [[Institute for the Future]], "peering into the future of an electronic world." The study focused on the emerging videotex industry, formed by the marriage of two older technologies, communications and computing. It estimated that 40 percent of American households will have two-way videotex service by the end of the century. By comparison, it took television 16 years to penetrate 90 percent of households from the time commercial service was begun.

Since the creation of [[computer]]s achieved an entire better approach to transmit and store [[data]]. Digital technology became commonly used for downloading music and watching movies at home either by [[DVD]]s or purchasing it online.
Digital music records are not quite the same as traditional recording media. Obviously, because [[digital media|digital]] ones are reproducible, portable and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Katz|2010|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states started to implement education technology in schools, universities and colleges. According to the statistics, in the early beginnings of 1990s the use of Internet in schools was ,on average, 2-3%. Continuously, by the end of 1990s the evolution of technology increases rapidly and reaches to 60%, and by the year of 2008 nearly 100% of schools use Internet on educational form. According to ISTE researchers, technological improvements can lead to numerous achievements in classrooms. E-learning system, collaboration of students on project based learning, and technological skills for future results in motivation of students. 

Although these previous examples only show a few of the positive aspects of technology in society, there are negative side effects as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Lynden|first1 = Burke|title = Generation Y Heavily Dependent On Technology, Promotes Laziness|url = http://www.thejambar.com/generation-y-heavily-dependent-on-technology-promotes-laziness/|website = The Jambar|accessdate = 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this virtual realm, social media platforms such as [[Instagram]], [[Instagram|Facebook]], and [[Snapchat]] have altered the way [[Millennials|Generation Y culture]] is understanding the world and thus how they view themselves. In recent years, there has been more research on the development of social media depression in users of sites like these. "Facebook Depression" is when users are so affected by their friends' posts and lives that their own jealousy depletes their sense of self-worth. They compare themselves to the posts made by their peers and feel unworthy or monotonous because they feel like their lives are not nearly as exciting as the lives of others.&lt;ref name=Puricelli/&gt;

Another instance of the negative effects of technology in society, is how quickly it is pushing younger generations into maturity. With the world at their fingertips, children can learn anything they wish to. But with the uncensored sources from the [[internet]], without proper supervision, children can be exposed to explicit material at inappropriate ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woollaston|first1=Victoria|title=Kids ARE growing up faster today - and it's all down to technology|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2834559/Kids-growing-faster-today-s-technology-Facebook-mobile-phones-causing-young-people-mature-quickly-poll-reveals.html|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes in the forms of premature interests in experimenting with makeup or opening an email account or social media page—all of which can become a window for predators and other dangerous entities that threaten a child's innocence. Technology has a serious effect on youth's health. The overuse of technology is said to be associated with sleep deprivation which is linked to obesity and poor academic performance in the lives of adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi med J. 2016 pages 436-439&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and technological development==
[[File:Doel Kerncentrale.JPG|thumb|Nuclear reactor, [[Doel]], [[Belgium]]]]

In ancient history, [[economics]] began when spontaneous exchange of goods and services was replaced over time by deliberate trade structures. Makers of arrowheads, for example, might have realized they could do better by concentrating on making arrowheads and barter for other needs. Regardless of goods and services bartered, some amount of technology was involved&amp;mdash;if no more than in the making of shell and bead jewelry. Even the shaman's potions and sacred objects can be said to have involved some technology. So, from the very beginnings, technology can be said to have spurred the development of more elaborate economies.Technology is seen as primary source in economic development.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, and Daria Khaltourina. [https://www.academia.edu/35443515/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Compact_Macromodels_of_the_World_System_Growth._Moscow_KomKniga_2006 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''] {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advancement and economic growth are related to each other.The level of technology is important to determine the economic growth.It is the technological process which keeps the economy moving.

In the modern world, superior technologies, resources, geography, and history give rise to robust economies; and in a well-functioning, robust economy, economic excess naturally flows into greater use of technology. Moreover, because technology is such an inseparable part of human society, especially in its economic aspects, funding sources for (new) technological endeavors are virtually illimitable. However, while in the beginning, technological investment involved little more than the time, efforts, and skills of one or a few men, today, such investment may involve the collective labor and skills of many millions.

===Funding===
Consequently, the sources of funding for large technological efforts have dramatically narrowed, since few have ready access to the collective labor of a whole society, or even a large part. It is conventional to divide up funding sources into governmental (involving whole, or nearly whole, social [[Organization|enterprises]]) and private (involving more limited, but generally more sharply focused) business or individual enterprises.

====Government funding for new technology====
The government is a major contributor to the development of new technology in many ways. In the United States alone, many government agencies specifically invest billions of dollars in new technology.

[In 1980, the UK government invested just over six million pounds in a four-year program, later extended to six years, called the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]] (MEP), which was intended to give every school in Britain at least one computer, software, training materials, and extensive teacher training. Similar programs have been instituted by governments around the world.]

Technology has frequently been driven by the military, with many modern applications developed for the military before they were adapted for civilian use. However, this has always been a two-way flow, with industry often developing and adopting a technology only later adopted by the military.

Entire government agencies are specifically dedicated to research, such as America's [[National Science Foundation]], the United Kingdom's [[List of UK government scientific research institutes|scientific research institutes]], America's [[Small Business Innovation Research|Small Business Innovative Research]] effort. Many other government agencies dedicate a major portion of their budget to research and development.

====Private funding====
[[Research and development]] is one of the smallest areas of investments made by corporations toward new and innovative technology.
&lt;!--source needed--&gt;

Many foundations and other nonprofit organizations contribute to the development of technology. In the [[OECD]], about two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 98 percent and 10 percent, respectively, by [[University|universities]] and government. But in poorer countries such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly less. The U.S. government spends more than other countries on military research and development, although the proportion has fallen from about 30 percent in the 1980s to less than 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723051956/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |date=July 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 founding of [[Kickstarter]] allows individuals to receive funding via [[crowdsourcing]] for many technology related products including both new physical creations as well as documentaries, films, and webseries that focus on [[technology management]]. This circumvents the corporate or government oversight most inventors and artists struggle against but leaves the accountability of the project completely with the individual receiving the funds.

===Other economic considerations===
* [[Appropriate technology]], sometimes called "intermediate" technology, more of [[Index of economics articles|an economics concern]], refers to compromises between central and expensive technologies of [[Developed country|developed nations]] and those that [[Developing country|developing nations]] find most effective to deploy given an excess of labour and scarcity of cash.
*[[Persuasive technology|Persuasion technology]]: In [[economics]], definitions or assumptions of progress or [[economic growth|growth]] are often related to one or more assumptions about technology's economic influence. Challenging prevailing assumptions about technology and its usefulness has led to alternative ideas like [[uneconomic growth]] or [[Quality of life|measuring well-being]]. These, and economics itself, can often be described as technologies, specifically, as persuasion technology.

==Sociological factors and effects==
{{See also|Social construction of technology}}

===Values===
The implementation of technology influences the [[Value (ethics)#Personal and cultural values|values]] of a society by changing expectations and realities. The implementation of technology is also influenced by values. There are (at least) three major, interrelated values that inform, and are informed by, technological innovations:
*[[Mechanism (philosophy)|Mechanistic world view]]: Viewing the universe as a collection of parts (like a machine), that can be individually analyzed and understood.&lt;ref name = McGinn&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of [[reductionism]] that is rare nowadays. However, the "neo-mechanistic world view" holds that nothing in the universe cannot be understood by the human intellect. Also, while all things are greater than the sum of their parts (e.g., even if we consider nothing more than the information involved in their combination), in principle, even this excess must eventually be understood by human intelligence. That is, no [[Divinity|divine]] or [[Vitalism|vital]] principle or essence is involved.
*[[Efficiency (economics)|Efficiency]]: A value, originally applied only to machines, but now applied to all aspects of society, so that each element is expected to attain a higher and higher percentage of its maximal possible performance, output, or ability.
*Social [[progress]]: The belief that there is such a thing as social progress, and that, in the main, it is beneficent. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the subsequent explosion of technology, almost all societies believed in a [[cyclical theory]] of social movement and, indeed, of all history and the universe. This was, obviously, based on the cyclicity of the seasons, and an agricultural economy's and society's strong ties to that cyclicity. Since much of the world is closer to their agricultural roots, they are still much more amenable to cyclicity than progress in history. This may be seen, for example, in Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar's modern social cycles theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metafuture.org/sarkar/prabhat.htm | title=Prabhat rainjan sarkar's social cycles, world unity and peace; Renaissance 2000 honoring Sarkar's 75th Anniversary, LA 1 | work=Metafuture.org | accessdate=July 6, 2016 | author=Galtung, Johan}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a more westernized version of social cyclicity, see ''Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069'' (Paperback) by Neil Howe and William Strauss; Harper Perennial; Reprint edition (September 30, 1992); {{ISBN|0-688-11912-3}}, and subsequent books by these authors.

====Institutions and groups====
Technology often enables organizational and bureaucratic group structures that otherwise and heretofore were simply not possible. Examples of this might include:
*The rise of very large organizations: e.g., governments, the military, health and social welfare institutions, supranational corporations.
*The commercialization of leisure: sports events, products, etc. (McGinn)
*The almost instantaneous dispersal of information (especially news) and entertainment around the world.

===International===
Technology enables greater knowledge of international issues, values, and cultures. Due mostly to mass transportation and mass media, the world seems to be a much smaller place, due to the following:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
*Globalization of ideas
*Embeddedness of values
*Population growth and control

==Environment==
{{Main article|Environmental technology}}
Technology provides an understanding, and an appreciation for the world around us.

Most modern technological processes produce unwanted by products in addition to the desired products, which is known as industrial waste and pollution. While most material waste is re-used in the industrial process, many forms are released into the environment, with negative environmental side effects, such as pollution and lack of sustainability. Different social and political systems establish different balances between the value they place on additional goods versus the disvalues of waste products and pollution. Some technologies are designed specifically with the environment in mind, but most are designed first for economic or ergonomic effects. Historically, the value of a clean environment and more efficient productive processes has been the result of an increase in the wealth of society, because once people are able to provide for their basic needs, they are able to focus on less tangible goods such as clean air and water.

The effects of technology on the environment are both obvious and subtle. The more obvious effects include the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources (such as petroleum, coal, ores), and the added [[pollution]] of air, water, and land. The more subtle effects include debates over long-term effects (e.g., global warming, deforestation, natural habitat destruction, coastal wetland loss.)

Each wave of technology creates a set of waste previously unknown by humans: [[toxic waste]], [[radioactive waste]], [[electronic waste]].

One of the main problems is the lack of an effective way to remove these pollutants on a large scale expediently. In nature, organisms "recycle" the wastes of other organisms, for example, plants produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, oxygen-breathing organisms use oxygen to metabolize food, producing carbon dioxide as a by-product, which plants use in a process to make sugar, with oxygen as a waste in the first place. No such mechanism exists for the removal of technological wastes.

==Construction and shaping==

===Choice===
Society also controls technology through the choices it makes. These choices not only include consumer demands; they also include:
*the channels of distribution, how do products go from raw materials to consumption to disposal;
*the cultural beliefs regarding style, freedom of choice, consumerism, materialism, etc.;
*the economic values we place on the environment, individual wealth, government control, capitalism, etc.

According to Williams and Edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Williams|Edge|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the construction and shaping of technology includes the concept of choice (and not necessarily conscious choice). Choice is inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the making of those artifacts and systems.

The idea here is that a single technology may not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, technology could be a garden of forking paths, with different paths potentially leading to different technological outcomes. This is a position that has been developed in detail by [[Judy Wajcman]]. Therefore, choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

===Autonomous technology===
In one line of thought, technology develops autonomously, in other words, technology seems to feed on itself, moving forward with a force irresistible by humans. To these individuals, technology is "inherently dynamic and self-augmenting."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Ellul]] is one proponent of the irresistibleness of technology to humans. He espouses the idea that humanity cannot resist the temptation of expanding our knowledge and our technological abilities. However, he does not believe that this seeming autonomy of technology is inherent. But the perceived autonomy is because humans do not adequately consider the responsibility that is inherent in technological processes.

[[Langdon Winner]] critiques the idea that [[Radovan Richta|technological evolution]] is essentially beyond the control of individuals or society in his book Autonomous Technology. He argues instead that the apparent autonomy of technology is a result of "technological somnambulism," the tendency of people to uncritically and unreflectively embrace and utilize new technologies without regard for their broader social and political effects.

===Government===
Individuals rely on governmental assistance to control the side effects and negative consequences of technology.
*Supposed independence of government. An assumption commonly made about the government is that their governance role is neutral or independent. However, some argue that governing is a political process, so government will be influenced by political winds of influence. In addition, because government provides much of the funding for technological research and development, it has a vested interest in certain outcomes. Other point out that the world's biggest ecological disasters, such as the [[Aral Sea]], [[Chernobyl]], and [[Lake Karachay]] have been caused by government projects, which are not accountable to consumers.
*Liability. One means for controlling technology is to place responsibility for the harm with the agent causing the harm. Government can allow more or less legal liability to fall to the organizations or individuals responsible for damages.
*Legislation. A source of controversy is the role of industry versus that of government in maintaining a clean environment. While it is generally agreed that industry needs to be held responsible when pollution harms other people, there is disagreement over whether this should be prevented by legislation or civil courts, and whether ecological systems as such should be protected from harm by governments.

Recently, the social shaping of technology has had new influence in the fields of [[E-Science|e-science]] and [[e-social science]] in the United Kingdom, which has made centers focusing on the social shaping of [[Science and technology studies|science and technology]] a central part of their funding programs.

[[File:Winn Army Community Hospital Pharmacy Stays Online During Power Outage.jpg| thumb | alt=Pharmacists filling prescriptions at a computer | Pharmacy personnel deliver [[medical prescription]]s electronically; remote delivery of [[prescription drugs]] is a feature of '''telepharmacy'''.]]
'''Telepharmacy''' is the delivery of [[pharmaceutical care]] via [[telecommunications]] to patients in locations where they may not have direct contact with a [[pharmacist]]. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of [[telemedicine]], as implemented in the field of [[pharmacy]]. Telepharmacy services include [[drug therapy]] monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization for [[prescription drugs]], and monitoring of [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formulary]] compliance with the aid of [[teleconferencing]] or [[videoconferencing]]. [[Remote dispensing]] of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities.

The term can also refer to the use of videoconferencing in pharmacy for other purposes, such as providing education, training, and management services to pharmacists and pharmacy staff remotely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Angaran | first = DM | title = Telemedicine and Telepharmacy: Current Status and Future Implications | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 15 Jul 1999 | volume = 56 | pages = 1405–1426 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/56/14/1405.abstract | issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and drawbacks==
A primary appeal of telepharmacy is its potential to expand access to pharmacy care in smaller rural communities, some of which cannot support a full-time pharmacist or cannot easily recruit a pharmacist to reside in their region. Telepharmacy can potentially give patients in remote locations access to professional pharmacy care that could not be received locally, which can lower costs and improve patient safety through better patient counseling, drug administration monitoring,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Staff | title = Telepharmacy Increases the Safety of Chemotherapy Preparation | journal = [[US Pharmacist]] | date = 19 November 2007 | volume = 32 | number = 11 | page = 73 | url = http://www.uspharmacist.com/content/c/10195/?t=men's_health,chemotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compliance monitoring. Sharing of pharmacists between sites can also decrease costs in existing facilities, which might no longer need to employ a full-time pharmacist.

The potential costs of telepharmacy are broadly the same as those associated with all forms of [[telemedicine]]: potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Friesner | first = Daniel L. | last2 = Scott | first2 = David M. | last3 = Rathke | first3 = Ann M. | last4 = Peterson | first4 = Charles D. | last5 = Anderson | first5 = Howard C. | title = Do remote community telepharmacies have higher medication error rates than traditional community pharmacies?

==Implementation==
The implementation of telepharmacy varies by region and jurisdiction. Factors including geography, laws and regulations, and economics influence its implementation.

===Australia===
A form of telepharmacy has been in use by [[Australia]]'s [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]] since 1942. Medical chests containing medications and equipment are placed in remote communities where they can be administered to patients during a [[telehealth]] consultation. Some 3,500 chests were distributed around Australia as of 2006. In one year, [[Queensland]] recorded 21,470 telehealth consultations, of which 13.7% resulted in administration of a medication from a medical chest. The medication types administered most often are [[antibiotic]]s, [[analgesic]]s and [[gastrointestinal medication]]s. This system improves access to both emergency and routine medical care in remote parts of Australia and reduces the need for patients to travel to seek medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Rural Remote Health |year=2008 |issue=Apr-Jun |volume=8 |page=937 |title=Tele-pharmacy in remote medical practice: the Royal Flying Doctor Service Medical Chest Program |last1=Margolis |first1=S. A. |last2=Ypinazar |first2=V. A. |pmid=18489239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application of telepharmacy in Queensland has been the provision of pharmaceutical reviews in rural hospitals that lack on-staff pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clinicalpharmacy.org.uk/volume1_2/2010/july/july10_commentary.pdf |title=Telepharmacy — opportunity or threat? |first=James |last=Davies |journal=The British Journal of Clinical Pharmacy |volume=2 |date=July–August 2010 |pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although broader use of telepharmacy could help alleviate a shortage of pharmacists, Australia has lagged the United States in its implementation of telepharmacy, partly because doctors, nurses, and other health care workers provide pharmacy services in rural and remote areas where there are no pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/telepharmacy/KimberPetersonTelepharmacy.pdf |title=Telepharmacy—Enabling Technology to Provide Quality Pharmacy Services in Rural and Remote Communities |first1=
Michael B |last1=Kimber |first2=Gregory M |last2=Peterson |journal=Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research |volume=36 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=128–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Implementation of telepharmacy in the United States began in the 2000s. A combination of factors, including [[Medicare Part D|changes in Medicare reimbursement for medications]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Radford | first = Andrea | last2 = Slifkin | first2 = Rebecca | last3 = Fraser | first3 = Roslyn | last4 = Mason | first4 = Michelle | last5 = Mueller | first5 = Keith | title = The Experience of Sole Community Rural Independent Pharmacies with Medicare Part D: Reports from the Field | journal = Policy Paper P2006-3 | publisher = RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis | date = November 2006 | url = http://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/rural/pubs/report/WP87.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Recession|recession of 2007&amp;ndash;8]], led to a decline in the number of independent pharmacies in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boyle | first = Kaitlin | last2 = Ullrich | first2 = Fred | last3 = Mueller | first3 = Keith | title = Independently owned pharmacy closures in rural America, 2003&amp;ndash;2010 | journal = Rural Policy Brief | publisher = RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis | date = June 2011 | url = http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/rupri/publications/policybriefs/2011/Independent%20Pharmacies.pdf| format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the need for alternative means of delivering pharmacy in services in rural communities lacking a full-time pharmacist, several [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] and [[northwestern United States|northwestern]] states with extensive rural areas have led much of the development of policy and implementation methods for telepharmacy.

In 2001, North Dakota became the first U.S. state to pass regulations allowing retail pharmacies to operate without requiring a pharmacist to be physically present. The next year, state agencies and grants established the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project, which now supports more than fifty remote retail and hospital pharmacy sites throughout North Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The North Dakota Telepharmacy Project | url = http://www.ndsu.edu/telepharmacy/ | publisher = North Dakota State University | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this program, a licensed pharmacist at a central site communicates with remote site [[pharmacy technician]]s and patients through [[videoconferencing]]. A 2004 study of the program found that telepharmacy delivered the same quality of pharmacy services as traditional facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Peterson | first = Charles D. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = Howard C., Jr | title = The North Dakota Telepharmacy Project: Restoring and retaining pharmacy services in rural communities | journal = Journal of Pharmacy Technology | year = 2004 | volume = 20 | pages = 28–39 | url = http://www.jpharmtechnol.com/abstracts/volume20/January-February/28.html | doi=10.1177/875512250402000107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a study of the operation of one North Dakota telepharmacy business from 2002 through 2004 found that, while medication inventory turnover was lower than the industry average, the remote sites were able to be operated profitably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Khan | first = Shamima | last2 = Snyder | first2 = Herbert W. | last3 = Rathke | first3 = Ann M. | last4 = Scott | first4 = David M. | last5 = Peterson | first5 = Charles D. | title = Is there a successful business case for telepharmacy? | journal = Telemedicine Journal and e-Health | publisher = [[American Telemedicine Association]] | date = April 2008 | volume = 14 | number = 3 | pages = 235–244 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2007.0045 | pmid=18570546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success and expansion of this program were an inspiration and model for programs and laws in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolpack | first = Dave | title = Telepharmacy project expands across country | newspaper = [[USA Today]] | date = 12 September 2008 | url = http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-12-virtual-pharmacy_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Community Health Association of Spokane, a network of [[community health centers]] in [[Spokane, Washington]], started a telepharmacy program in 2001. The program delivers remote medication dispensing and health counseling to patients at six urban and rural clinics; remote site personnel are connected to pharmacists at the base site by [[videoconferencing]]. A survey found that most patients at the remote sites strongly agreed or agreed that they would have had difficulty affording their medications without this program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clifton | first = G. Dennis | last2 = Byer | first2 = Heather | last3 = Heaton | first3 = Kristi | last4 = Haberman | first4 = Deborah J. | last5 = Gill | first5 = Harbir | title = Provision of Pharmacy Services to Underserved Populations Via Remote Dispensing and Two-Way Videoconferencing | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = Dec 15, 2003 | volume = 60 | pages = 2577–2582 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/60/24/2577.abstract | issue=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaska Native Medical Center]], a hospital in [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], providing telehealth services to [[Alaska Native]] populations, established a telepharmacy program in 2003 to improve its pharmaceutical services in rural native settlements. The [[American Society of Health-System Pharmacists]] gave the program its 2006 Award for Excellence in Medication-Use Safety, concluding that the use of telepharmacy had improved access to pharmaceutical care and enabled pharmacists to monitor medication safety and encourage medication adherence, as well as making pharmacy care more cost-effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ashpfoundation.org/MainMenuCategories/Awards/AwardforExcellenceinMedicationUseSafety/2006AwardsRecipients.aspx | title = 2006 Awards Recipients | publisher = ASHP Foundation | accessdate = 6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] Bureau of Medicine operates a large-scale telepharmacy program for the use of service personnel. After piloting the program in 2006 at [[Naval Hospital Pensacola]] in Florida and Naval Hospital Bremerton in Washington, in 2010 the Navy expanded it to more sites throughout the world. This program represents the largest implementation of telepharmacy to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Traynor | first = Kate | title = Navy takes Telepharmacy Worldwide | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 15 July 2010 | volume = 67 | pages = 1134–1136 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/67/14/1134.full | doi = 10.2146/news100051 | issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]] passed a Telehealth Advancement Act in 2011 to update the state's legal definitions of telehealth, simplify approval processes for telehealth services, and broaden the range of medical services that may be provided via telehealth. The law establishes legal parity between the direct and remote delivery of pharmacy care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Telehealth Advancement Act | publisher = Center for Connected Health Policy, California | url = http://cchpca.org/telehealth-advancement-act | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iowa]]'s first telepharmacy opened in September 2012 after receiving a three-year waiver from the Iowa Board of Pharmacy that allows the facility to operate without a pharmacist on-site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Miller | first = Vanessa | title = Telepharmacy could save rural Iowa sites | newspaper = [[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]] | location = Cedar Rapids, Iowa | date = 18 October 2012 | url = http://thegazette.com/2012/10/18/pharmacy-draft/ | accessdate = 23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study of the various American states' [[rural health]] offices found that telepharmacy in rural medical facilities varied in prevalence across the United States but was still not widespread, and that many states had not yet clearly defined regulations for telepharmacy in hospitals.&lt;ref name="Casey1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Casey | first = Michelle M. | last2 = Sorensen | first2 = Todd D. | last3 = Elias | first3 = Walter | last4 = Knudson | first4 = Alana | last5 = Gregg | first5 = Walter | title = Current practices and state regulations regarding telepharmacy in rural hospitals | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | date = 1 July 2010 | volume = 67 | pages = 1085-1092 | url = http://www.ajhp.org/content/67/13/1085.abstract | doi = 10.2146/ajhp090531 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption and implementation of telepharmacy methods has been slow compared to the spread of the basic technologies involved ([[internet access]], [[Data compression|audio/video compression]] algorithms, [[microphones]] and [[video cameras]]), despite periodic predictions of a forthcoming boom in the industry. Aside from more intangible factors (such as physicians' and pharmacists' personal uneasiness with the lack of physical interaction with patients), the major obstacles to telepharmacy implementation appear to have been the lack of clear legal regulations for telepharmacy, and the lack of network and software systems to manage (and secure) all of the data used in a professional pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Davis | first = Stephania H. | title = What's holding up the telemedicine explosion? | journal = Connected Planet | date = 1 June 1998 | url = http://connectedplanetonline.com/mag/telecom_whats_holding_telemedicine/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, many of the telepharmacy facilities in active operation were operating as pilot programs or under temporary waivers issued by state regulators because many states still had no clear legal framework for the regulation of remote pharmaceutical sites without pharmacists. Even in states that had regulated retail telepharmacy practices, regulations were often not in place to permit the implementation of telepharmacy in hospital settings.&lt;ref name="Casey1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casey2"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Casey | first = Michelle M. | last2 = Elias | first2 = Walter | last3 = Knudson | first3 = Alana | last4 = Gregg | first4 = Walter | title = Implementation of Telepharmacy in Rural Hospitals: Potential for Improving Medication Safety | journal = Final Report #8 | publisher = Upper Midwest Rural Health Research Center | year = 2008 | url = https://www.nodakpharmacy.com/pdfs/UMRHfirstDose.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some pharmacy facilities that might otherwise consider telepharmacy, the cost and complexity of the infrastructure needed to manage patient data across multiple sites can be prohibitive. In addition to the computer hardware required for patient data storage, distribution and teleconferencing, telepharmacy programs must deploy network security tools and procedures adequate to [[Protected health information|protect patient medical information]] in compliance with [[HIPAA]] and other patient privacy regulations. In 2010 the North Dakota Telepharmacy Project estimated that the computer hardware needed for a typical retail installation costs US$17,300 per site, with an additional cost of US$5,000 to buy a mobile cart for a hospital installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last = Rathke | first = Ann | title = North Dakota Telepharmacy Project: An Update | booktitle = North Dakota Pharmacist Association Convention | date = 23–25 April 2010 | location = Minot, North Dakota | publisher = NDTP | url = http://www.ndsu.edu/fileadmin/telepharmacy/NDTP_PPt__Update.pdf | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

Adoption of telepharmacy in [[Canada]] began as a response to a nationwide shortage of pharmacists. Canada's first telepharmacy service was started by a hospital in [[Cranbrook, British Columbia]], in June 2003 in order to assist a hospital in a nearby town that was unable to hire a pharmacist. To meet the need for service, a hospital pharmacist in Cranbrook began using telepharmacy technology to oversee pharmacy technicians at the other hospital. A similar service was subsequently extended to other small hospitals in the province; it is also used to provide coverage when a hospital's sole pharmacist is absent due to illness or vacation.&lt;ref name=CADTH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadth.ca/products/environmental-scanning/health-technology-update/issue2/telepharmacy |title=Virtual pharmacists provide long-distance care |journal=Health Technology Update |issue=2 |date=January 2006 |publisher=Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Remote dispensing]] machines for medication began operation in [[Ontario]], Canada, in 2007. After a patient inserts a prescription into the dispensing machine, the prescription is scanned and the patient is connected by telephone videoconference to a pharmacist at a remote site. The pharmacist reviews the prescription, discusses the patient's medication history, and authorizes the machine to dispense medication to the patient. The machines proved successful, with one assessment revealing that 96% of patients using them had their prescription filled in under five minutes.&lt;ref name="BJCP"/&gt; As of 2009, a hospital in [[Ontario]], Canada, was using telepharmacy services in addition to retaining a pharmacist at the hospital; the telepharmacist reviews medication orders, while the on-site pharmacist works with patients and oversees medication safety in the facility. Thus telepharmacy support allows the on-site pharmacist to focus on the more sensitive and nuanced tasks for which physical presence is most helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ross Memorial Hospital, Lindsay, Ontario | journal = Canadian Journal of Hospital Pharmacy | date = September–October 2009 | volume = 62 | number = 5 | page = 424 | pmc=2830020 | pmid=22478928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===

After their success in Canada, remote medication dispensing machines were scheduled to be tested at several hospital locations in the [[United Kingdom]] beginning in 2010.&lt;ref name="BJCP"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.clinicalpharmacy.org.uk/volume1_2/2010/july/july10_news_feature.pdf| title=Remote dispensing machines to be tested in UK hospitals |journal=The British Journal of Clinical Pharmacy |volume=2 |date=July–August 2010 |pages=203–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Maxor National Pharmacy Services, a U.S. company, reported that its remote dispensing machines for medication were being used in [[Bahrain]], [[Belgium]], [[Cuba]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[Guam]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Spain]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amarillo.com/blog-post/bizstream/2013-04-24/maxor-expands-puerto-rico-operations |title=Maxor expands Puerto Rico operations |author=Maxor National Pharmacy Services Corp. |date=April 25, 2013 |type=press release |work=Amarillo Globe-News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Mannings]] drugstores became the first in [[Hong Kong]] to use videoconferencing to allow patients at outlets without full-time pharmacists to consult with pharmacists at other sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Tele-Pharmacy on Show at Mannings Stores in Hong Kong | journal = Thistle: The Magazine of [[Jardine Matheson]] | year = 2010 | volume = 3 | page = 8 | url = http://www.jardines.com/assets/files/NewsAndEvents/thistle/10_vol3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''timeline of the American Old West''' is a chronology ordered list of events significant to the development of the American West as a region of the United States prior to 1912. The term "[[American Old West]]" refers to a vast geographical area and lengthy time period of imprecise boundaries, and historians' definitions vary. The events in this timeline occurred primarily in the contiguous portion of the modern United States west of the [[Mississippi River]], and mostly in the period between the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803 and the admission of the last [[contiguous United States|mainland states]] into the Union in 1912. A small section summarizing early exploration and settlement prior to 1803 is included to provide a foundation for later developments. Rarely, events significant to the history of the West but which occurred within the modern boundaries of Canada and Mexico are included as well.

Western North America was inhabited for millennia by various groups of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and later served as a [[frontier]] to European powers, beginning with [[Spain|Spanish]] colonization in the 16th century. [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], and [[Russia]]n claims followed in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the [[American Revolution]], the newly independent [[United States]] began securing [[American frontier|its own frontier]] from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] westward for settlement and economic investment by American citizens. The long [[territorial evolution of the United States|history of American expansion]] into these lands has played a central role in shaping American culture, iconography, and the modern national identity, and remains a popular topic for study by scholars and historians.

Events listed below are notable developments for the region as a whole, not just for a particular state or smaller subdivision of the region; as historians Hine and Faragher put it, they "tell the story of the creation and defense of communities, the use of the lands, the development of markets, and the formation of states.... It is a tale of conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Robert V.|last2=Faragher|first2=John Mack|title=The American West : a new interpretive history|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=0300078358|page=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For almost three centuries after Columbus' voyages to the New World, much of western North America remained unsettled by European colonists, despite various territorial claims made by imperialist nations. Europeans interest in the vast territory was motivated by the search for precious metals, especially gold, and the fur trade, with miners, trappers, and hunters among the first people of European descent to permanently settle in the West.&lt;ref name=RMUtley/&gt;{{rp|150}} The early years were also a period of scientific exploration and survey, such that by 1830 the rough outline of the western half of the continent had been mapped to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=RMUtley&gt;Robert M.

While primarily dominated by men throughout history, women have been represented in the field of comedy since the mid 1700s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.wsupress.wayne.edu/books/detail/laughing-feminism|title=Laughing Feminism Subversive Comedy in Frances Burney and Maria Edgeworth|date=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|last1=Bilger|first1=Audrey|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=We Killed: The Rise of Women in American Comedy|date=2002|publisher=Sarah Crichton Books|last1=Kohen|first1=Yael}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy]], or creative works with the intention of humor, is thought to have originated in ancient Greek theatre in 425 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhaawA_m9SEC&amp;pg=PR9|title=Lysistrata|last=Aristophanes|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Nick Hern Books|isbn=978-1-85459-325-2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the first figures to enter the field, however, were faced with resistance and discrimination.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|work=MAKERS|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/01/hitchens200701|title=Why Women Aren't Funny|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=Vanity Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of humor in women was previously thought to have meant the ability to laugh at a man's joke, rather than tell the joke herself.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When women did finally enter comedy (in its various forms), it was seen as niche, thus making bookings hard to come by.

Early acts were often based in the standard roles of women as a housewife and mother.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Comedy was tailored to what men would find to be both funny and non-threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As women gained slow acceptance to their presence in comedy, they were able to expand the topics that they covered.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since then, women have made significant gains in the field, having found fame through stand-up, television, movies, and writing.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women such as [[Amy Schumer]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Wanda Sykes]], [[Gina Barreca]] and many others have contributed to the world of comedy, spanning both time and medium.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As comedic license has grown, comedy has become a tool within the scope of [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; By reclaiming a previously male-exclusive art form, female comedians are able to use patriarchal structure against itself.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Today, feminist comedy draws attention to female issues such as [[menstruation]], [[rape]], [[gender inequality]], beauty norms, and [[machismo]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; As a readily acceptable and understandable medium of communication, comedy lends itself to the feminist movement, allowing women's issues to be more wide-spread in general society.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Comedic forms==

===Stand-up===
Stand-up comedy is a form of comedy in which performers act in front of a live audience, creating an interactive dependency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dz-hsuL3r_QC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=stand%20up&amp;f=false|title=Look Who's Laughing: Gender and Comedy|last=Finney|first=Gail|date=1994-01-01|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9782881246449|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes range from short one-liners to longer monologues. The comedic form requires a takeover the stage, in order for the comedian's material to "kill."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For women, the direct contact with the audience puts their womanhood on display. Many female comedians choose to wear loose-fitting clothing to take their femininity out of the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bitchmedia.org/post/here-is-whats-scary-about-being-a-female-stand-up-comic|title=Here is What's Scary About Being a Female Stand-Up Comic. {{!}} Bitch Media|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late night television===
[[File:SamanthaBeeFeb2011.jpg|thumb|[[Samantha Bee]] at a [[Hudson Union Society]] event in February 2011]]
American late night television (''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'' etc...) has been dominated by white men for almost its entire existence. With the exception of ''[[Full Frontal with Samantha Bee|Full Frontal]]'' with [[Samantha Bee]], no woman has had a late night show on a major network of her own. The platform allows a variety of comedic  (monologues and shorts) and political (interviews and exposés) opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alexandra-popken/why-its-time-for-a-woman-_b_6813704.html|title=Why It's Time for a Woman to Host a Late Night Talk Show|last=Popken|first=Alexandra|date=2015-03-06|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mic.com/articles/137160/why-are-there-so-few-female-late-night-hosts#.migMKG8nY|title=Why Are There So Few Female Late-Night Hosts?|last=Mic|work=Mic|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
Film in general, as well as comedic film, continues to show the gender imbalance of other forms of comedy. In 2014, a study found that there were 2.24 male characters for every one female character. Of the movies surveyed, only 30.9% of the speaking characters were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/soraya-chemaly/20-mustknow-facts-about-g_b_5869564.html|title=20 Facts Everyone Should Know About Gender Bias in Movies|last=Chemaly|first=Soraya|date=2014-09-24|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, one of the major storylines in the film industry (the romantic comedy), consistently follows traditional female roles, relegating women to simply searching for a male partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/04/14/romantic-comedies-failing-women_n_7026302.html|title=How Romantic Comedies Are Failing Women (And How To Fix It)|last=Karlin|first=Lily|date=2015-04-14|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender imbalance==
The gender imbalance between men and women can be found all over, even on Wikipedia. The page: [[list of comedians]] show a much higher number of males than females.

===In pay===
In the [[United States]], there is a large gender gap between men and women in comedy with regards to both pay and number.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ozy.com/acumen/stand-ups-gender-gap/4661|title=It's Really No Joke|last=Humphries|first=Will|work=OZY|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, all ten of the top ten paid comedians were male, bringing in a total of $173 million.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2016, one female entered the list: [[Amy Schumer]], at number two.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://etcanada.com/photos/170240/forbes-list-of-highest-paid-comedians-for-2016/#image-170249|title=Forbes’ List Of Highest-Paid Comedians For 2016|last=Crisp|first=Gavin|website=etcanada.com|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In appearances===
A study in 2017 found a large gender imbalance in UK comedic panel shows, with only 31% of the appearances. However, the same study also found marked improvement since 1989, when the statistic was 3%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://strudel.org.uk/panelshows/index.html|title=UK Panel Show Gender Breakdown|website=strudel.org.uk|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the UK industry website Chortle lists 269 female comedian as compared to 1,279 male comedians.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Imbalance can also be seen at the level of the comedy club. For example, the prestigious New York comedy club [[Carolines on Broadway|Carolines]] featured 20% female performers to 80% male in 2014.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Within the writers room, gender imbalance persists. Women made up only 10 percent of writers working on the top 250 domestic grossing films of 2010 and 15 percent of writers and 18 percent of creators in prime-time television during the 2010–2011 season.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In South Korea, of 70 comedic variety shows, 13 had all male hosts and guests, and 23 with all male hosts, meaning that more than half of these shows lack female hosts.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Only two shows had all females hosts and guests.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Shows without hosts often try to model marriages by pairing up male and female celebrities.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; While this does achieve some sense of gender balance, it uses very traditional roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Gendering of humor==
The early female figures in stand up, such as [[Phyllis Diller]], were able to enter the mainstream through their willingness to self-deprecate and declare themselves ugly. Other early female comediennes, such as [[Mae West]] and [[Helen Kane]], used [[sex appeal]] to attract male audiences. In other words, they were able to enter, but on the terms of male comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queens of comedy: Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Joan Rivers, and the new generation of funny women|last=Horowitz|first=Susan|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More modern female comedians cite a need to tailor their comedy to what men would find to be funny, with change in this mentality only coming very recently.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

===In stand-up===
[[Stand-up comedy|Stand up comedy]], in particular, is described as a masculine art form.&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/documentary/womenincomedy|title=Women in Comedy|access-date=2017-02-25|language=en|newspaper=MAKERS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words that are used to describe success are often violent, such as ''killed'' or ''annihilated.''&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The performer must take charge of the stage, claiming it as their own via the phallic symbol of the microphone.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The structure of joke is often centered on an attack on another party. The aggression that such an art form necessitates is encouraged in males but discouraged in females.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karen|first=Stoddard|year=1977|title="WOMEN HAVE NO SENSE OF HUMOR" AND OTHER MYTHS: A CONSIDERATION OF FEMALE STAND-UP COMICS, 1960–1976|journal=American Humor|volume=4|pages=|jstor=42594582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination against women==
In many societies around the world, a woman's role has affected her flexibility in comedy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caliskan|first=Sevda|date=1995-01-01|title=Is There Such a Thing as Women's Humor?|journal=American Studies International|volume=33|issue=2|pages=49–59|jstor=41279344}}&lt;/ref&gt; In countries that historically view women as inferior to men, comedy is seen as a masculine discipline.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The common perception that women aren't funny pervades all aspects of comedy, including stand-up, television, and movies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The comedy establishment, influenced by patriarchal society, has relegated women to the "side of tears and loss." Systematic sexism can be found at the level of audience members, bookers, agents, and male comics.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2015/10/discrimination-female-comedians/|title=The unfunny things that happen to funny women|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a powerful social tool, comedy brings women outside of the traditional role that has been defined as theirs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Women have experience everything from [[Heckler|heckling]] audience members calling them gendered terms like bitches or sluts, to being invited to fake comedic festivals (so the organizer could have sex with the female comedian), to being introduced in roasts as the girl that "slept with one of the judges."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Feminist tool==
Humor has been used a tool of feminism both for its ability to point out patriarchy and the structures it creates as well as identify the common female experience.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bing|first=Janet|year=2004|title=Is Feminist Humor an Oxymoron?|url=http://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=english_fac_pubs|journal=Women and Language|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction must be made between female humor and feminist humor. Female humor is self-deprecatory, turning inwards to the performer herself.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor, by contrast, looks outwards at the societal structures that demean women. It is aggressive and pointed, using comedic language formerly reserved for men only as a tool of liberation.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Feminist humor is to be an agent of change for women by drawing attention to their lowered position in society.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knobloch|first=Susan|date=1996-01-01|title=Review of The Unruly Woman: Gender and the Genres of Laughter|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=50|issue=2|pages=58–60|doi=10.2307/1213431|jstor=1213431}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Bing argues that for feminist humor to be most effective at its goal of change, it should be inclusive, rather than divisive.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Divisive humor, or jokes that focus on male structures or male-bashing, do not advance feminism, but rather continue to marginalize females.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Inclusive humor that riffs off of the shared experience of women, can be subversive without the negative effects of divisive humor.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Bing continues to say that when humor falls into this inclusive comedy it contributes to feminism by first, contradicting the age old stereotype that women cannot be funny, and second, by undermining the status quo.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Humor itself can be used to make strong structural changes in a society. Many times humor has been used to subvert hierarchical structures. For example, the [[Guerrilla Girls]] used humor to point out the patriarchal, unchanging nature of the Tony awards, which give the majority of their prizes to men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It also functions to establish an in-group (those making and understanding the joke) and an out-group (those on the receiving end).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Through this process, humor can create solidarity within a group, but can also make another feel excluded.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; For women, this can serve to strengthen them as a community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Representation worldwide==

===Bangladesh===
Outside of the United States, women have been having similar experiences in their attempts to enter field of comedy, colored by their own cultural influences. One such women is [[Farhana Muna]], a Bangladeshi Muslim comic.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Her material is focused on Bangladeshi life and culture, from parties to relatives commenting on weight loss. According to Muna, she often feels constrained by what is deemed appropriate or not for a Bangladeshi Muslim women. She must watch what she says and wears. Muna reemphasized the sentiment that there is a wider range of comedy acceptable for men. She has also faced criticism for her actions, including her choice to not wear the [[hijab]], with people calling her a bad Muslim. However, she continues her comedic work due to the community of women that she has met through it. Muna sees comedy as a collective platform of expression, a way to share her experiences in a relatable way.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/anushay-hossain/becoming-munatic-how-a-ba_b_9283354.html|title=Becoming Munatic: How a Bangladeshi Woman is Changing the Rules of Comedy Online|last=Hossain|first=Anushay|date=2016-02-22|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Women have been on the rise in India's comedy as recently as 2016. In a country that has deeply entrenched patriarchal values, these female comedians face great amounts of cultural animosity.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scoopwhoop.com/Female-Stand-Up-Comedians-India/#.n0ztf1urd|title=These Female Comedians Are Taking The Stand-Up Industry By Storm, One Joke At A Time|last=ScoopWhoop|date=2016-04-22|work=ScoopWhoop|access-date=2017-04-07|language=En}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this discrimination women such as [[Aditi Mittal]] and [[Neeti Palta]] have found success in an industry that did not readily accept them.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

===South Korea===
In [[South Korea]], female comedians do not encounter many comedic opportunities.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/asia/korean-tv-gender-imbalance-1202019919/|title=Korean TV’s Gender Imbalance No Laughing Matter|last=Kil|first=Sonia|date=2017-04-03|work=Variety|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two television programs are completely hosted by females, with the other major television opportunity being couples shows. South Korean TV shows only offer gender balance when women are in gendered roles.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Producers see men as more advantageous hires as the shows' audiences are majority women. Additionally, there was a worry that audiences would react badly to strong women in television.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; As the woman's movement grows in South Korea, so too do the opportunities for women. Rather than featuring beautiful women as prizes to be won by males contestants, new shows such as ''[[Sister's Slam Dunk|Sisters' Slam Dunk]]'' (which premiered in 2016) feature women working together to solve problems.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==Figures==
=== Phyllis Diller ===
One of the most prominent early figures in American female comedy, [[Phyllis Diller]] made her comedic debut at the Purple Onion Comedy Club in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/phyllis-diller-9542308#breakthrough-role|title=Phyllis Diller|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stand-up routines focused on the problems of the suburban [[housewife]], a previous unaddressed area by male comics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; By opening acknowledging her lack of physical attractiveness and by incorporating self-deprecation into her routines, Diller was able to enter comedy in a time when funny and attractive women were seen as threatening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, by confining her comedy to her inability to fulfill her traditional role, she reinforced female stereotypes rather than dismissing them.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Joan Rivers===
[[Joan Rivers]] (active from 1959–2014) was one of the first female comedians to utilize the "talk/conversational" method, one that was suited to television talk shows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike [[Phyllis Diller]], who was quite unlike her comedic personality, the comedy of Joan Rivers more closely reflected her personality. She often drew on her own personal experiences as a self-proclaimed Jewish princess.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Unlike her predecessors, Rivers did not downplay her attractiveness, but rather incorporated it into her riffs on life as a single woman.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Still, her comedy was focused on the traditional problems of a women (trying to find a boyfriend and husband, being a good wife etc).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Jane Curtin===
[[Jane Curtin]] was a part of the inaugural class of [[Not Ready For Prime Time Players|Not Ready for Prime Time Players]] on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1975. On SNL, she was the anchor for Weekend Update and started in many well known skits including ''Coneheads''.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jane-curtin-222399|title=Jane Curtin|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Weekend Update, she served as the liberal counterpart to Dan Aykroyd’s conservative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/womens-blog/2015/feb/16/saturday-night-live-40-eight-feminist-milestones|title=Saturday Night Live at 40: Eight feminist milestones|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=2015-02-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, when asked about the environment at [[Saturday Night Live]], Curtin said that female writers faced an extremely difficult battle, especially when cast member like [[John Belushi]] were actively working against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/womens-blog/2015/feb/16/saturday-night-live-40-eight-feminist-milestones|title=Saturday Night Live at 40: Eight feminist milestones|last=Henderson|first=Danielle|date=2015-02-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; While fundamentally believing that women are not capable of humor, he also would sabotage pieces written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2011/04/jane_curtain_reveals_john_belu.html|title=Jane Curtin Says John Belushi Was a Total Sexist|date=2011-04-12|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this atmosphere, Jane Curtin had a very successful career at SNL and went on to work on sitcoms, Broadway, and various movies.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

===Tina Fey===
[[File:Amy Poehler and Tina Fey by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Female comedians [[Tina Fey]] (left) and [[Amy Poehler]] (right) at an event from the movie ''[[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]]'']]
Figures such as [[Tina Fey]] have paved the way in the modern era for large-scale growth in female comedy.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauzen|first=Martha|date=2014-01-02|title=The Funny Business of Being Tina Fey: Constructing a (feminist) comedy |journal=Feminist Media Studies| volume=14|issue=1|pages=106–117|doi=10.1080/14680777.2012.740060|issn=1468-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her public appointment as the first female head writer of [[Saturday Night Live]] placed her in a position to serve as a feminist comedy icon.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Many of her sketches became iconic, particularly her satirical portrayal of Vice Presidential Candidate [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flowers|first=Arhlene A.|last2=Young|first2=Cory L.|date=2010-01-01|title=Parodying Palin: How Tina Fey’s Visual and Verbal Impersonations Revived a Comedy Show and Impacted the 2008 Election|journal=Journal of Visual Literacy|volume=29|issue=1|pages=47–67|doi=10.1080/23796529.2010.11674673|issn=1051-144X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her comedic writing ([[Mean Girls]], [[30 Rock]], [[Bossypants]], [[Baby Mama (film)|Baby Mama]], Date Night etc...), in addition to achieving great public notice, was well received by critics.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

===Miranda Hart===
[[Miranda Hart]] is a female comedian from the UK. She is most well-known for her television series ''[[Miranda (TV series)|Miranda]].'' Her awkward and clumsy character in the show is a embodiment of all the society neuroses that women face in daily life.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/dec/01/miranda-hart-tv-queen-uncool|title=Miranda Hart – TV's queen of uncool|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|date=2010-12-02|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a style of comedy makes her into an everywoman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Gd6_BwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=miranda+hart+comedy&amp;ots=V1My1fB1Yb&amp;sig=Fsgbg21vUl-k_8m6zx_oWUIfwr4#v=onepage&amp;q=miranda%20hart%20comedy&amp;f=false|title=Twenty-first Century Feminism: Forming and Performing Femininity|last=Nally|first=C.|last2=Smith|first2=A.|date=2015-02-27|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137492852|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart herself sees a divide in comedy, with some using comedy as a tool to increase their coolness (others) and some using comedy as a tool for clowning around (her).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; By staying within the clowning realm of comedy, she achieved a cult following.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
