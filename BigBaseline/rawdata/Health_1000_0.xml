An '''admission, discharge, and transfer''' ('''ADT''') '''system''' is a backbone system for the structure of other types of business systems. An ADT system is one of four types of core business systems: ADT, financial, scheduling, and [[Acute medicine|acuity]] (McGonigle, D., &amp; Mastrain, K., 2012). Core business systems are systems used in a health care facility for financial payment, [[quality improvement]], and encouraging [[best practices]] that research has proven beneficial. 

Used in health care, an ADT system is usually the foundation for other types of [[health care informatics|health care information systems]] because it holds valuable patient information such as a [[medical record]] number, age, name, and contact information. Using the ADT system, patient information can be shared, [[medical privacy|when appropriate]], with other health care facilities and systems (McGonigle, D., &amp; Mastrain, K., 2012). ADT systems can also be used as an alert system upon a patient's admission (Pittet, D., Safran, E., et al., 1996). This can be helpful if a patient has had a [[medical history|history]] of an infectious disease or heart ailments. When admitted, the ADT system may alert the admitting staff that the patient needs to be in an [[Hospital-acquired infection#Isolation|isolation room]] or on a cardiac floor, for example.

'''Asbestos''' is a set of six naturally occurring [[silicate minerals]],&lt;ref name=Alleman&amp;Mossman1997/&gt; which all have in common their [[eponymous]] [[asbestiform]] [[Crystal habit|habit]]: i.e. long (roughly 1:20 [[aspect ratio]]), thin [[fibrous]] [[crystal]]s, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic "fibrils" that can be released by [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] and other processes.&lt;ref name="gee" /&gt; They are commonly known by their colors, as ''blue asbestos'', ''brown asbestos'', ''white asbestos'', and ''green asbestos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTF5USvN9vk&amp;t=63s|title=What is asbestos?|work=Cancer Society|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asbestos mining existed more than 4,000 years ago, but large-scale mining began at the end of the 19th century, when manufacturers and builders began using asbestos for its desirable physical properties.&lt;ref name=Alleman&amp;Mossman1997/&gt; Some of those properties are [[Absorption (acoustics)|sound absorption]], average [[tensile strength]], affordability, and [[flame-retardant|resistance to fire]], heat, and electricity. It was used in such applications as [[electrical insulation]] for hotplate wiring and in [[building insulation]]. When asbestos is used for its resistance to fire or heat, the fibers are often mixed with cement or woven into fabric or mats. These desirable properties made asbestos very widely used. Asbestos use continued to grow through most of the 20th century  until public knowledge of the health hazards of asbestos dust led to its outlawing by courts and legislatures in mainstream construction and [[fireproofing]] in most countries.

[[Inhalation]] of asbestos fibers can cause serious and fatal illnesses including [[lung cancer]], [[mesothelioma]], and [[asbestosis]] (a type of [[pneumoconiosis]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131022130439/http://www.jpc-se.org/documents/01.JPC-SE-Position_Statement_on_Asbestos-June_4_2012-Summary_and_Appendix_A_English.pdf Position Statement on Asbestos from the Joint Policy Committee of the Societies of Epidemiology (JPC-SE)], approved June 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = BrancheArbejdsmiljøRådet for Bygge &amp; Anlæg | title = Når du støder på asbest | series = Branchevejledning | date = February 2009 | location = Copenhagen | pages = 6–7 | language = Danish | url = http://www.bar-ba.dk/Kemikalier-stoev/De%20farlige%20stoffer/Materialer/~/media/Bygge%20og%20Anl%C3%A6g/PDF/BVL_pdf/Asbest_1.ashx | isbn = 978-87-7952-118-6 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110106220833/http://www.bar-ba.dk/Kemikalier-stoev/De%20farlige%20stoffer/Materialer/~/media/Bygge%20og%20Anl%C3%A6g/PDF/BVL_pdf/Asbest_1.ashx | archivedate = 6 January 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concern of asbestos-related illness in modern times began with the 20th century and escalated during the 1920s and 1930s. By the 1980s and 1990s, asbestos trade and use were heavily restricted, phased out, or banned outright in an increasing number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://asbestosremovalnow.com/asbestos-banning-timeline/|title=Timeline Of Asbestos Bans|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the severity of asbestos-related diseases, the material has extremely widespread use in many areas. Continuing long-term use of asbestos after harmful health effects were known or suspected, and the slow emergence of symptoms decades after exposure ceased, made [[Asbestos and the law|asbestos litigation]] the longest, most expensive mass [[tort]] in U.S. history though a much lesser legal issue in most other countries involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Best|first1=Richard|title=Liability for Asbestos Related Disease in England and Germany|url=https://germanlawjournal.com/pdfs/Vol04No07/PDF_Vol_04_No_07_661-683_Private_Best.pdf|website=germanlawjournal.com|accessdate=July 29, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226143257/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/pdfs/Vol04No07/PDF_Vol_04_No_07_661-683_Private_Best.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asbestos-related [[legal liability|liability]] also remains an ongoing concern for many manufacturers, [[insurance industry|insurers and reinsurers]]. On July 12, 2018, a Missouri jury ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay a record $4.69 billion to 22 women who alleged the company’s talc-based products, including its baby powder, contain asbestos and caused them to develop ovarian cancer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-cancer-lawsuit/jury-orders-jj-to-pay-4-7-billion-in-missouri-asbestos-cancer-case-idUSKBN1K234U|title=Jury orders J&amp;J to pay $4.7 billion in Missouri asbestos cancer case|last=Bellon|first=Tina|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-07-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Asbestos derives from the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ἄσβεστος, meaning “unquenchable” or “inextinguishable”.&lt;ref name=Alleman&amp;Mossman1997&gt;{{Cite journal|date=July 1997 |author=Alleman, James E. |author2=Mossman, Brooke T |title=Asbestos Revisited |journal=[[Scientific American]] |pages=54–57 |url=http://virlab.virginia.edu/Nanoscience_class/lecture_notes/Lecture_14_Materials/Asbestos_CNT/Sci%20Am%20-%20Asbestos%20Revisited%20-%20July%201997.pdf |accessdate=26 November 2010 |bibcode=1997SciAm.277a..70A |volume=277 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0797-70 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603095555/http://www.virlab.virginia.edu/Nanoscience_class/lecture_notes/Lecture_14_Materials/Asbestos_CNT/Sci%20Am%20-%20Asbestos%20Revisited%20-%20July%201997.pdf |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bostock&amp;Riley1856&gt;{{Cite book |year=1856 |author=[[John Bostock (physician)|Bostock, John]] |translator=[[Henry Thomas Riley|Riley, H.

==Types and associated fibers==
Six mineral types are defined by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) as "asbestos" including those belonging to the [[serpentine subgroup|serpentine]] class and those belonging to the amphibole class. All six asbestos mineral types are known to be human [[carcinogens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/eleventh/profiles/s016asbe.pdf |title=Asbestos, CAS No. 1332-21-4 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429155522/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/eleventh/profiles/s016asbe.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="epa2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=D Wayne|last2=Crump|first2=Kenny S|title=Final draft:technical support document for a protocol to assess asbestos-related risk|publisher =U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|year=2003|location=Washington DC|page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visible fibers are themselves each composed of millions of microscopic "fibrils" that can be released by [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] and other processes.&lt;ref name="gee" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Serpentine===
Serpentine class fibers are curly. [[Chrysotile]] is the only member of the serpentine class.
[[File:Epa 450 2-78-014 march 1978 asbestos comparison.JPG|thumb|Size of asbestos fibers compared to other particles (USEPA, March 1978)]]

====Chrysotile====
[[Chrysotile]], [[CAS registry number|CAS No.]] 12001-29-5, is obtained from [[serpentinite]] rocks which are common throughout the world. Its idealized [[chemical formula]] is [[Magnesium|Mg]]{{sub|3}}([[Silicon|Si]]{{sub|2}}[[Oxygen|O]]{{sub|5}})([[Hydroxide|OH]]){{sub|4}}.&lt;ref name="qsqlui"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/Pollution/asbestos?sitearea=PED|title=What is asbestos?|work=American Cancer Society|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysotile appears under the microscope as a white fiber.

Chrysotile has been used more than any other type and accounts for about 95% of the asbestos found in buildings in America.&lt;ref name=wdnr&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestos – History and Uses|date=31 August 2007|publisher=Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228042633/http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/aw/air/reg/asbestos/asbes3.htm |archivedate=28 December 2007|url=http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/aw/air/reg/asbestos/asbes3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chrysotile is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can be spun and woven into fabric. The most common use was corrugated asbestos cement roofing primarily for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found in sheets or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. Chrysotile has been a component in [[joint compound]] and some plasters. Numerous other items have been made containing chrysotile including brake linings, fire barriers in fuseboxes, pipe insulation, floor tiles, residential shingles, and gaskets for high temperature equipment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Amphibole===
Amphibole class fibers are needle-like. [[Amosite]], [[crocidolite]], [[tremolite]], [[anthophyllite]] and [[actinolite]] are members of the amphibole class.

====Amosite====
[[Amosite]], CAS No. 12172-73-5, often referred to as brown asbestos, is a [[trade name]] for the amphiboles belonging to the [[cummingtonite]]-[[grunerite]] [[solid solution]] series, commonly from South Africa, named as a partial [[acronym]] for "Asbestos Mines of South Africa". One formula given for amosite is [[iron|Fe]]&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Amosite is seen under a microscope as a grey-white vitreous fiber. It is found most frequently as a fire retardant in thermal insulation products, [[asbestos insulating board]] and ceiling tiles.&lt;ref name="wdnr"/&gt;

====Crocidolite====
[[Crocidolite]], CAS No. 12001-28-4, commonly known as blue asbestos, is the fibrous form of the amphibole [[riebeckite]], found primarily in southern Africa, but also in Australia and Bolivia. One formula given for crocidolite is [[sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe{{su|p=[[Oxidation number|II]]|b=3}}Fe{{su|p=[[Oxidation number|III]]|b=2}}Si&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;([[hydroxyl|OH]])&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Crocidolite is seen under a microscope as a blue fiber.

[[Crocidolite]] commonly occurs as soft [[friability|friable]] fibers. Asbestiform amphibole may also occur as soft friable fibers but some varieties such as amosite are commonly straighter. All forms of asbestos are fibrillar in that they are composed of fibers with breadths less than 1 [[micrometre|micrometer]] in bundles of very great widths. Asbestos with particularly fine fibers is also referred to as "amianthus".

==History of use==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
People have used asbestos for thousands of years to create flexible objects, such as napkins, that resist fire. In the modern era, companies began producing asbestos consumer goods on an industrial scale. Now people recognize the health hazard that asbestos poses, and it is banned or strictly regulated around the world. 
===Early uses===
Asbestos use dates back at least 4,500 years, when the inhabitants of the Lake [[Juojärvi]] region in East [[Finland]] strengthened earthenware pots and cooking utensils with the asbestos mineral anthophyllite (see [[Asbestos-ceramic]]).&lt;ref name=Ross&amp;Nolan2003&gt;{{Cite book |year=2003 |author=Ross, Malcolm |author2=Nolan, Robert P |last-author-amp=yes |chapter=History of asbestos discovery and use and asbestos-related disease in context with the occurrence of asbestos within the ophiolite complexes|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYHEEWhye94C&amp;pg=PA447|editor=Dilek, Yildirim|editor2=Newcomb, Sally|title=Ophiolite Concept and the Evolution of Geological Thought|series=Special Paper 373|place=Boulder, Colorado|publisher=[[Geological Society of America]]|isbn=0-8137-2373-6|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eYHEEWhye94C&amp;printsec=frontcover }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first descriptions of a material that may have been asbestos is in [[Theophrastus]], ''On Stones'', from around 300 BC, although this identification has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Caley | first1 = Earl R. | last2 = Richards | first2 = John F.

It is much more probable that Theophrastus is referring to the well-known brown fibrous [[lignite]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both modern and ancient [[Greek language|Greek]], the usual name for the material known in English as "asbestos" is ''amiantos'' ("undefiled", "pure"), which was adapted into the French ''amiante'' and Portuguese ''amianto''. In [[modern Greek]], the word ἀσβεστος or ασβέστης stands consistently and solely for [[lime (mineral)|lime]].

The term ''asbestos'' is traceable to Roman naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]]'s manuscript ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', and his use of the term ''asbestinon'', meaning "unquenchable".&lt;ref name=Alleman&amp;Mossman1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bostock&amp;Riley1856/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ross&amp;Nolan2003/&gt; While Pliny or his nephew [[Pliny the Younger]] is popularly credited with recognising the detrimental effects of asbestos on human beings,&lt;ref name="Env_Chem"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barbalace|first=Roberta C.|url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/asbestoshistory2004.html |title=History of Asbestos |publisher=Environmentalchemistry.com|date=22 October 1995|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; examination of the primary sources reveals no support for either claim.&lt;ref name=Maines2005&gt;{{cite book|last=Maines|first=Rachel|title=Asbestos and Fire: Technological Trade-offs and the Body at Risk|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5r2jEGLvxP4C|page=7|year=2005|isbn=0-8135-3575-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial era===
[[File:Asbestos mining 1876.jpg|thumb|right|Industrial scale asbestos mining began in 1878 in [[Thetford Mines|Thetford township]], [[Quebec]]. By 1895, mining was increasingly mechanized.]]
The large scale asbestos industry began in the mid-19th century. Early attempts at producing asbestos paper and cloth in Italy began in the 1850s, but were unsuccessful in creating a market for such products. Canadian samples of asbestos were displayed in London in 1862, and the first companies were formed in England and Scotland to exploit this resource. Asbestos was first used in the manufacture of yarn, and German industrialist Louis Wertheim adopted this process in his factories in Germany.

Industrial scale mining began in the [[Thetford Mines|Thetford hills]], [[Quebec]] from the 1870s.

The use of asbestos became increasingly widespread towards the end of the 19th century, when its diverse applications included fire retardant coatings, concrete, bricks, pipes and fireplace cement, heat, fire, and acid resistant gaskets, pipe insulation, ceiling insulation, fireproof drywall, flooring, roofing, lawn furniture, and drywall joint compound. In 2011 it was reported that over 50% of UK houses still contained asbestos, despite a ban on asbestos products some years earlier.&lt;ref name="guardian2011"&gt;Don, Andrew (1 May 2011) [https://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/may/01/asbestos-hidden-health-hazard Asbestos: the hidden health hazard in millions of homes].

In Japan, particularly after [[World War II]], asbestos was used in the manufacture of [[ammonium sulfate]] for purposes of rice production, sprayed upon the ceilings, iron skeletons, and walls of railroad cars and buildings (during the 1960s), and used for energy efficiency reasons as well. Production of asbestos in Japan peaked in 1974 and went through ups and downs until about 1990, when production began to drop dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hvbg.de/e/asbest/konfrep/konfrep/repbeitr/morinaga_en.pdf |author=Morinaga, Kenji |work=European Conference 2003 |title=Asbestos in Japan |format=PDF |accessdate=12 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719043338/http://www.hvbg.de/e/asbest/konfrep/konfrep/repbeitr/morinaga_en.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s researchers began to notice a large number of early deaths and lung problems in asbestos-mining towns. The first such study was conducted by H. Montague Murray at the [[Charing Cross Hospital]], [[London]], in 1900, in which a postmortem investigation of a young man who had died from [[pulmonary fibrosis]] after having worked for 14 years in an asbestos textile factory, discovered asbestos traces in the victim's lungs. [[Adelaide Anderson]], the Inspector of Factories in Britain, included asbestos in a list of harmful industrial substances in 1902. Similar investigations were conducted in France and Italy, in 1906 and 1908, respectively.&lt;ref name="Selikoff2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ARKaW4uP9BgC|title=Asbestos and Disease |author=Selikoff, Irving J. |year=1978|publisher=Elsevier|pages=20–32|isbn=9780323140072 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar legislation followed in the U.S. about ten years later.

Approximately 100,000 people in the United States have died, or are terminally ill, from asbestos exposure related to ship building. In the [[Hampton Roads]] area, a shipbuilding center, mesothelioma occurrence is seven times the national rate.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Bill (6 May 2001) [https://web.archive.org/web/20071012143526/http://hamptonroads.com/pilotonline/special/asbestos/intro.html "Shipbuilding's Deadly Legacy: Introduction: Horrible Toll Could Have Been Avoided"] ''Virginian-Pilot'' Norfolk, Virginia (newspaper); from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of tons of asbestos were used in World War II ships to insulate piping, boilers, steam engines, and steam turbines. There were approximately 4.3 million shipyard workers in the United States during WWII; for every 1,000 workers about 14 died of mesothelioma and an unknown number died from asbestosis.&lt;ref name=hamptonroads&gt;Burke, Bill (6 May 2001) [http://www.asbestos-attorney.com/pilot3-1.htm "Shipyards, a Crucible for Tragedy: Part 1: How the war created a monster"] ''Virginian-Pilot'' Norfolk, Virginia (newspaper)&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government and asbestos industry have been criticized for not acting quickly enough to inform the public of dangers, and to reduce public exposure. In the late 1970s, court documents proved that asbestos industry officials knew of asbestos dangers since the 1930s and had concealed them from the public.&lt;ref name=hamptonroads/&gt;

In Australia, asbestos was widely used in construction and other industries between 1946 and 1980. From the 1970s there was increasing concern about the dangers of asbestos, and its use was phased out. Mining ceased in 1983. The use of asbestos was phased out in 1989 and banned entirely in December 2003. The dangers of asbestos are now well known in Australia and there is help and support for sufferers from asbestosis or mesothelioma.&lt;ref&gt;Lavelle, Peter (29 April 2004) [http://www.abc.net.au/health/library/stories/2004/04/29/1828906.htm Australian Broadcasting Corporation Fact File: Asbestos].

===Usage by industry and product type===
{{ref section|date=April 2018}}
====Serpentine group====
Serpentine minerals have a sheet or layered structure. Chrysotile is the only asbestos mineral in the serpentine group. In the United States, chrysotile has been the most commonly used type of asbestos. According to the U.S. EPA Asbestos Building Inspectors Manual, chrysotile accounts for approximately 95% of asbestos found in buildings in the United States.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Chrysotile is often present in a wide variety of products and materials, including:

Japan is moving in the same direction, but at a slower pace.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

====Amphibole group====

Amphiboles including [[amosite]] (brown asbestos) and [[crocidolite]] (blue asbestos) were formerly used in many products until the early 1980s. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Tremolite]] asbestos constituted a contaminant of many if not all naturally occurring chrysotile deposits. The use of all types of asbestos in the amphibole group was banned in much of the Western world by the mid-1980s, and in Japan by 1995.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umt.edu/bioethics/libbyhealth/Resources/Legal%20Resources/international_ban_asbestos.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Some products that included amphibole types of asbestos included the following:

*Low density insulating board (often referred to as AIB or asbestos insulating board) and ceiling tiles;
*Asbestos-cement pipe (still manufactured in some parts of the world&lt;ref&gt;[https://dir.indiamart.com/impcat/asbestos-cement-pipes.html]&lt;/ref&gt;);
*[[Asbestos_cement]] sheets and pipes for construction, casing for water and electrical/telecommunication services;
*Thermal and chemical insulation (e.g., fire rated doors, limpet spray, lagging and gaskets).

Cigarette manufacturer [[Lorillard]] ([[Kent (cigarette)|Kent's]] [[cigarette filter|filtered cigarette]]) used crocidolite asbestos in its "Micronite" filter from 1952 to 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/filter.asp Cigarette Filter Danger]. Snopes.com. Retrieved 10 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

While mostly chrysotile asbestos fibers were once used in automobile [[brake pads]], shoes, and [[clutch|clutch discs]], contaminants of amphiboles were present. Since approximately the mid-1990s, brake pads, new or replacement, have been manufactured instead with linings made of ceramic, carbon, metallic and [[Aramid|aramid fiber]] ([[Twaron]] or [[Kevlar]]—the same material used in [[bulletproof vest]]s).

Artificial Christmas snow, known as flocking, was previously made with asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Otway|first=Helen|title=1001 unbelievable Facts|year=2005|publisher=Capella|isbn=978-1-84193-783-0|page=191|chapter=Unbelievable Random Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as an effect in films including ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and department store window displays and it was marketed for use in private homes under  brand names that included "Pure White", "Snow Drift" and "White Magic".&lt;ref name=ems&gt;[http://www.ems-asbestos.co.uk/asbestos-in-fake-snow-wizard-of-oz-1939/ Asbestos in Fake Snow Wizard of Oz].

===Construction===

====Developed countries====
[[File:Asbestos ceiling.jpg|thumb|right|Older decorative ceilings, similar to this one, may contain small amounts of [[white asbestos]].]]
[[File:Durabestos advertisement.jpg|thumb|right|1929 newspaper advertisement from Perth, Western Australia, for [[asbestos sheeting]] for residential building construction.]]
The use of asbestos in new construction projects has been banned for health and safety reasons in many developed countries or regions, including the European Union, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, and New Zealand. A notable exception is the United States, where asbestos continues to be used in construction such as cement asbestos pipes. The 5th Circuit Court prevented the EPA from banning asbestos in 1991 because EPA research showed the ban would cost between $450 and 800 million while only saving around 200 lives in a 13-year timeframe, and that the EPA did not provide adequate evidence for the safety of alternative products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openjurist.org/947/f2d/1201/corrosion-proof-fittings-v-environmental-protection-agency 947 F. 2d 1201 – Corrosion Proof Fittings v. Environmental Protection Agency]. Openjurist.org. Retrieved 10 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the mid-1980s, small amounts of white asbestos were used in the manufacture of [[Artex]], a decorative stipple finish,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asbestossurveyingltd.co.uk/where_asbestos_ceiling_artex.htm ''Where can asbestos be found'', Asbestos Surveying Ltd, Birmingham, UK, 2 08 2008]. Retrieved 29 Dec 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; however, some of the lesser-known suppliers of Artex were still adding white asbestos until 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artex.co.uk/ Artex website], Click the "Asbestos in Artex" button.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the ban, asbestos was widely used in the construction industry in thousands of materials. Some are judged to be more dangerous than others due to the amount of asbestos and the material's friable nature. Sprayed coatings, pipe insulation and Asbestos Insulating Board (AIB) are thought to be the most dangerous due to their high content of asbestos and friable nature. Many older buildings built before the late 1990s contain asbestos. In the United States, there is a minimum standard for asbestos surveys as described by [[ASTM]] Standard E 2356–04. In the UK the [[Health and Safety Executive]] have issued guidance called HSG264 describing how surveys should be completed although other methods can be used if they can demonstrate they have met the regulations by other means.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/books/hsg264.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency includes some but not all asbestos-contaminated facilities on the Superfund National Priorities list (NPL). Renovation and demolition of asbestos-contaminated buildings is subject to EPA [[NESHAP]] and OSHA Regulations. Asbestos is not a material covered under [[CERCLA]]'s innocent purchaser defense. In the UK, the removal and disposal of asbestos and of substances containing it are covered by the [[Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/asbestos/regulations.htm ''Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006'', Health and Safety Executive, London, UK, Undated]. Retrieved 29 Dec 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. asbestos consumption hit a peak of 804,000 tons in 1973; world asbestos demand peaked around 1977, with 25 countries producing nearly 4.8 million metric tons annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.asbestos.com/asbestos/history/|title=History of Asbestos|accessdate=2016-04-07|publisher=Asbestos.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In older buildings (e.g. those built prior to 1999 in the UK, before white asbestos was banned), asbestos may still be present in some areas. Being aware of asbestos locations reduces the risk of disturbing asbestos.&lt;ref name="Wrekin housing trust pdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrekinhousingtrust.org.uk/publications/leaflets/Asbestos%20in%20the%20Home%20Booklet%2006-20061.pdf|title=Asbestos in the home booklet. Wrekin housing trust.|accessdate=26 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Removal of asbestos building components can also remove the fire protection they provide, therefore fire protection substitutes are required for proper fire protection that the asbestos originally provided.&lt;ref name="Wrekin housing trust pdf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandwell.gov.uk/info/415/pollution_control-asbestos/483/asbestos_removal Asbestos Removal].

====Outside Europe and North America====
Some countries, such as [[India]], Indonesia, China, Russia and [[Brazil]], have continued widespread use of asbestos. The most common is corrugated asbestos-cement sheets or "A/C sheets" for roofing and for side walls. Millions of homes, factories, schools or sheds and shelters continue to use asbestos. Cutting these sheets to size and drilling holes to receive 'J' bolts to help secure the sheets to roof framing is done on-site. There has been no significant change in production and use of A/C sheets in [[developing country|developing countries]] following the widespread restrictions in developed nations{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}.

====11 September 2001 attacks====
{{See also|Health effects arising from the September 11 attacks}}
As [[New York City]]'s [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] collapsed following the [[September 11 attacks]], [[Lower Manhattan]] was blanketed in a mixture of building debris and combustible materials. This complex mixture gave rise to the concern that thousands of residents and workers in the area would be exposed to known hazards in the air and in the dust, such as asbestos, lead, glass fibers, and pulverized concrete.&lt;ref name="stephenson2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephenson|first=John B.|title=World Trade Center : preliminary observations on EPA's second program to address indoor contamination (GAO-07-806T) : testimony before the [[Subcommittee on Superfund and Environmental Health]], [[U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works]]|date=20 Jun 2007|publisher=U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]]|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,000 tons of asbestos are thought to have been released into the air following the buildings' destruction.&lt;ref name="tg20091111"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/11/cancer-new-york-rescuers |title=9/11's delayed legacy: cancer for many of the rescue workers |last=Pilkington |first=Ed |date=11 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512181338/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/11/cancer-new-york-rescuers |archive-date=12 May 2017 |dead-url=yes |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=10 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inhalation of a mixture of asbestos and other toxicants is thought to be linked to the unusually high death rate from cancer of emergency service workers since the disaster.&lt;ref name="tg20091111"/&gt; Thousands more are now thought to be at risk of developing cancer due to this exposure with those who have died so far being only the "tip of the iceberg".&lt;ref name="tg20091111"/&gt; Some commentators have criticised authorities for using asbestos in the buildings' construction.

In May 2002, after numerous cleanup, dust collection, and air monitoring activities were conducted outdoors by EPA, other federal agencies, New York City, and the state of New York, New York City formally requested federal assistance to clean and test residences in the vicinity of the World Trade Center site for airborne asbestos.&lt;ref name="stephenson2007"/&gt;

===Asbestos contaminants in other products===

====Vermiculite====
[[Vermiculite]] is a hydrated laminar magnesium-aluminum-iron silicate which resembles [[mica]]. It can be used for many industrial applications and has been used as insulation. Some deposits of vermiculite have been found to be contaminated with small amounts of asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/verm.html |title=EPA Asbestos Contamination In Vermiculite |publisher=Epa.gov|date=28 June 2006|accessdate=12 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100111080049/http://www.epa.gov/asbestos/pubs/verm.html| archivedate= 11 January 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One vermiculite mine operated by [[W. R. Grace and Company]] in [[Libby, Montana]] exposed workers and community residents to danger by mining vermiculite contaminated with asbestos, typically [[richterite]], [[winchite]], [[actinolite]] or [[tremolite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meeker|first=G.P |title=The Composition and Morphology of Amphiboles from the Rainy Creek Complex, Near Libby, Montana|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70024962|journal=American Mineralogist |year=2003 |volume=88 |issue=11–12 |pages=1955–1969 |doi=10.2138/am-2003-11-1239|bibcode=2003AmMin..88.1955M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermiculite contaminated with asbestos from the Libby mine was used as insulation in residential and commercial buildings through Canada and the United States. W. R. Grace and Company's loose-fill vermiculite was marketed as [[Zonolite]] but was also used in sprayed-on products such as [[Monokote]].

In 1999 the EPA began cleanup efforts in Libby and now the area is a [[Superfund]] cleanup area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/libby/ |title=Libby Asbestos – US EPA Region 8 |publisher=Epa.gov |accessdate=12 January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205101037/http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/libby/ |archivedate=5 February 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA has determined that harmful asbestos is released from the mine as well as through other activities that disturb soil in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/region8/superfund/libby/risk.html|title=Risk Assessment – US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov|date=22 December 2008|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Talc====
[[File:A laboratory heat spreader made of asbestos, over Teclu burner.jpg|thumb|A laboratory [[Heatproof mat|heat spreader]] made of asbestos, on tripod over a [[Teclu burner]].]]
[[Talc]] can sometimes be contaminated with asbestos due to the proximity of asbestos ore (usually tremolite) in underground talc deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Van Gosen, Bradley S., Lowers, Heather A., Sutley, Stephen J. |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1092/ |title=A USGS Study of Talc Deposits and Associated Amphibole Asbestos Within Mined Deposits of the Southern Death Valley Region, California|publisher=Pubs.usgs.gov|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1973, US federal law required all talc products to be asbestos-free,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/29/is-it-safe-to-use-talcum-baby-powder-ovarian-cancer-johnson-johnson|title=Is it safe to use talcum powder?|last=Dillner|first=Luisa|date=2016-02-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today there is strict quality control in the production of talc products, separating cosmetic-grade talc (e.g. talcum powder) from industrial-grade talc (often used in friction products) has largely eliminated this issue for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/996/is-talcum-powder-asbestos|title=The Straight Dope: Is talcum powder asbestos?|website=www.straightdope.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, tests in a certified asbestos-testing laboratory found the tremolite form of amphibole asbestos used to be found in three out of eight popular brands of children's [[crayon]]s that were made partly from talc: [[Crayola]], Prang, and RoseArt.&lt;ref name="seattlepi-a"&gt;{{cite news|title=Major brands of kids' crayons contain asbestos, tests show|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=23 May 2000|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/052300-02.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304003203/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/052300-02.htm|archivedate=4 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Crayola crayons, the tests found asbestos levels around 0.05% in ''Carnation Pink'' and 2.86% in ''Orchid''; in Prang crayons, the range was from 0.3% in ''Periwinkle'' to 0.54% in ''Yellow''; in Rose Art crayons, it was from 0.03% in ''Brown'' to 1.20% in ''Orange''. Overall, 32 different types of crayons from these brands used to contain more than trace amounts of asbestos, and eight others contained trace amounts. The [[Art and Creative Materials Institute]], a [[trade association]] which tested the safety of crayons on behalf of the makers, initially insisted the test results must have been incorrect, although they later said they do not test for asbestos.&lt;ref name="seattlepi-a" /&gt; In May 2000, Crayola said tests by Richard Lee, a materials analyst whose testimony on behalf of the asbestos industry has been accepted in lawsuits over 250 times, found its crayons tested negative for asbestos.&lt;ref name="seattlepi-b" /&gt; In spite of that, in June 2000 Binney &amp; Smith, the maker of Crayola, and the other makers agreed to stop using talc in their products, and changed their product formulations in the United States.&lt;ref name="seattlepi-b"&gt;{{cite news|title=Crayon firms agree to stop using talc|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=13 June 2000|url=http://www.carollsmith.com/pdf/crayonfirm.pdf|author1=Schneider, Andrew  |author2=Smith, Carol }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mining company, R T Vanderbilt Co of [[Gouverneur (town), New York|Gouverneur, New York]], which supplied the talc to the crayon makers, states that "to the best of our knowledge and belief" there is no asbestos in its talc.&lt;ref name="seattlepi-c"&gt;{{cite news|title=Old dispute rekindled over content of mine's talc|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=30 May 2000|url=http://o.seattlepi.com/national/cra30.shtml}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However media reports claim that the [[United States Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) had found asbestos in four talc samples tested in 2000.&lt;ref name="seattlepi-a"/&gt; The Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health subsequently wrote to the news reporter, stating that "In fact, the abbreviation ND (non detect) in the laboratory report – indicates no asbestos fibers actually were found in the samples."&lt;ref&gt;McAteer, J.

During the 1980s and again in the 1990s it was suggested at times that the process of making asbestos cement could "neutralize" the asbestos, either via chemical processes or by causing cement to attach to the fibers and changing their physical size; subsequent studies showed that this was untrue, and that decades-old asbestos cement, when broken, releases asbestos fibers identical to those found in nature, with no detectable alteration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/hsl_pdf/2007/hsl0711.pdf Investigation of the chrysotile fibres in an asbestos cement sample (2006) - HSL/2007/11], p.26 onward]&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to asbestos in the form of fibers is always considered dangerous. Working with, or exposure to, material that is [[friable]], or materials or works that could cause release of loose asbestos fibers, is considered high risk. In general, people who become ill from inhaling asbestos have been regularly exposed in a job where they worked directly with the material.

The most common diseases associated with chronic exposure to asbestos are [[asbestosis]] and [[mesothelioma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/asbestos/asbestos/health_effects/ ATSDR – Asbestos – Health Effects]. (1 April 2008). ATSDR Home. Retrieved 24 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substitutes for asbestos in construction==
[[Glass wool|Fiberglass]] insulation was invented in 1938 and is now the most commonly used type of [[building insulation materials|insulation material]]. The safety of this material has also been called into question due to similarities in material structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rachel.org/?q=en/node/3999|title=Fiber Glass: A Carcinogen That's Everywhere|date=31 May 1995|work=Rachel's News|publisher=Environmental Research Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] removed fiberglass from its list of possible human carcinogens in 2001&lt;ref&gt;[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Classification/ClassificationsGroupOrder.pdf Agents Classified by the IARC Monographs, Volumes 1–111]. iarc.fr&lt;/ref&gt; and a scientific review article from 2011 claimed epidemiology data was inconsistent and concluded that the IARC's decision to downgrade the carcinogenic potential of fiberglass was valid (however, this study was funded by sponsored research contract from the North American Insulation Manufacturer’s Association).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2011.02.009| pmid = 21345360| title = Fiber glass exposure and human respiratory system cancer risk: Lack of evidence persists since 2001 IARC re-evaluation| journal = [[Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]]| volume = 60| issue = 1| pages = 84–92| year = 2011| last1 = Marsh | first1 = G.

In 1978, a highly texturized fiberglass fabric was invented by [[Bal Dixit]], called [[Zetex (fabric)|Zetex]]. This fabric is lighter than asbestos, but offers the same bulk, thickness, hand, feel, and abrasion resistance as asbestos. The fiberglass was texturized to eliminate some of the problems that arise with fiberglass, such as poor abrasion resistance and poor seam strength.&lt;ref&gt;Dixit, B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=JkaAypWOi0AC&amp;pg=PA446 "Performance of Protective Clothing: Development and Testing of Asbestos Substitutes,"] Performance of Protective Clothing, ASTM STP 900, R. L. Barker and G. C. Coletta, Eds., American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, 1986, pp. 446–460 {{ISBN|0-8031-0461-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, [[mineral wool]] and [[glass wool]] are the main insulators in houses.

Many companies that produced asbestos-cement products that were reinforced with asbestos fibers have developed products incorporating organic fibers. One such product was known as "[[Eternit]]" and another "Everite" now use "[[Nutec]]" fibers which consist of organic fibers, [[portland cement]] and [[silica]]. [[Cement-bonded wood fiber]] is another substitute. Stone fibers are used in gaskets and friction materials.

Another potential fiber is [[polybenzimidazole]] or PBI fiber. [[Polybenzimidazole fiber]] is a [[synthetic fiber]] with a high [[melting point]] of {{convert|760|C}} that also does not ignite. Because of its exceptional thermal and chemical stability, it is often used by [[fire departments]] and [[space agencies]].

==Recycling and disposal==
[[File:AsbestosContainment.JPG|right|thumb|Old [[Wailuku]] Post Office sealed off for [[asbestos removal]]]]
Asbestos alternatives for industrial use include sleeves, rope, tape, fabric, textiles and [[insulation batt materials]] made from [[fiberglass]] and silica.

In most developed countries, asbestos is typically disposed of as [[hazardous waste]] in [[landfill site]]s.

The [[demolition]] of buildings containing large amounts of asbestos based materials pose particular problems for builders and property developers – such buildings often have to be deconstructed piece by piece, or the asbestos has to be painstakingly removed before the structure can be razed by mechanical or explosive means. One such example is the [[Red Road Flats]] in [[Glasgow]], Scotland which used huge amounts of asbestos cement board for wall panelling – here British health and safety regulations stipulate that asbestos material has to be removed to a landfill site via an approved route at certain times of the day in specially adapted vehicles.

In the United States, the EPA governs the removal and disposal of asbestos strictly. Companies that remove asbestos must comply with EPA licensing. These companies are called EPA licensed asbestos contractors. Anytime one of these asbestos contractors performs work a test consultant has to conduct strict testing to ensure the asbestos is completely removed. 

Asbestos can be recycled by transforming it into harmless [[silicate glass]]. A process of thermal decomposition at {{cvt|1000|-|1250|°C|-2}} produces a mixture of non-hazardous silicate phases, and at temperatures above {{cvt|1250|°C|-2}} it produces silicate glass.&lt;ref name="gualtieri"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0955-2219(99)00290-3| title = Thermal decomposition of asbestos and recycling in traditional ceramics| journal = Journal of the European Ceramic Society| volume = 20| issue = 9| pages = 1409–1418| year = 2000| last1 = Gualtieri | first1 = A.

There have been numerous studies that have attempted, with varying degrees of success, to show links between birth weight and later-life conditions, including [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[obesity]], [[tobacco smoking]], and [[intelligence]]. Low birth weight is associated with [[neonatal infection]] and [[infant mortality]].

==Abnormalities==
*A [[low birth weight]] can be caused either by a [[preterm birth]] (low gestational age at birth) or of the infant being [[small for gestational age]] (slow prenatal growth rate), or a combination of both.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/low-birthweight.aspx|title=Low birthweight|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A very large birth weight is usually caused by the infant having been [[large for gestational age]].

==Determinants==
[[File:Weight vs gestational Age.jpg|thumb|Relation of weight and [[gestational age]]{{where|date=September 2016}}.]]

=== Genetics ===
There are two genetic loci that have been strongly linked to birth weight, [[ADCY5]] and [[CCNL1]], as well  four that show some evidence ([[CDKAL1]], HHEX-IDE, [[GCK (gene)|GCK]], and [[TCF7L2]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freathy|first=Rachel M|last2=Mook-Kanamori|first2=Dennis O|last3=Sovio|first3=Ulla|last4=Prokopenko|first4=Inga|last5=Timpson|first5=Nicholas J|last6=Berry|first6=Diane J|last7=Warrington|first7=Nicole M|last8=Widen|first8=Elisabeth|last9=Hottenga|first9=Jouke Jan|date=2010-04-06|title=Variants in ADCY5 and near CCNL1 are associated with fetal growth and birth weight|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.567|journal=Nature Genetics|language=En|volume=42|issue=5|pages=430–435|doi=10.1038/ng.567|issn=1061-4036|pmc=2862164|pmid=20372150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaghootkar|first=Hanieh|last2=Freathy|first2=Rachel|date=May 2012|title=Genetic origins of low birth weight|url=|journal=Paediatrics|volume=15|issue=3|pages=258–264|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryckman|first=Kelli K.|last2=Feenstra|first2=Bjarke|last3=Shaffer|first3=John R.|last4=Bream|first4=Elise N.A.|last5=Geller|first5=Frank|last6=Feingold|first6=Eleanor|last7=Weeks|first7=Daniel E.|last8=Gadow|first8=Enrique|last9=Cosentino|first9=Viviana|date=January 2012|title=Replication of a Genome-Wide Association Study of Birth Weight in Preterm Neonates|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022347611007670|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|volume=160|issue=1|pages=19–24.e4|doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.07.038|issn=0022-3476|pmc=3237813|pmid=21885063}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[heritability]] of birth weight ranges from 25-40 %.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clausson|first=Britt|last2=Lichtenstein|first2=Paul|last3=Cnattingius|first3=Sven|date=March 2000|title=Genetic influence on birthweight and gestational length determined by studies in offspring of twins|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|volume=107|issue=3|pages=375–381|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2000.tb13234.x|issn=1470-0328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunde|first=A.|last2=Melve|first2=K.

[[Foetal]] genes influence how the fetus grows in [[In utero|utero]], and the maternal genes influence how the environment affects the growing fetus.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Maternal Health===
The [[health]] of the mother, particularly during the pregnancy. [[Intercurrent diseases in pregnancy]] are sometimes associated with decreased birth weight. For example, [[Celiac disease]] confers an [[odds ratio]] of low birth weight of approximately 1.8.&lt;ref name="TersigniCastellani2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tersigni C, Castellani R, de Waure C |title=Celiac disease and reproductive disorders: meta-analysis of epidemiologic associations and potential pathogenic mechanisms |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=582–93 |year=2014 |pmid=24619876 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain medications ( high blood pressure, epilepsy, etc. )can put a mother at a higher risk for delivering a low birth weight baby.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Giving birth to a child when you are younger than 15 or older than 35 puts you at a higher risk to have a low-birth weight baby.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hrsa"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mchb.hrsa.gov/chusa11/hstat/hsi/pages/201lbw.html |title=Low Birth Weight |website=Child Health USA 2011 |access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple births, where a mother has more than one child at one time,  can also  be a determinant in birth weight as  each baby is likely to be outside the AGA (appropriate for gestational age). Multiple births put children at a higher rate to have low birth weight (56.6%) compared to children born in a single birth ( 6.2%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Low birth weight can also vary by maternal age. In 2008 the rate of low birth weight was the highest in babies born to women at an age that is younger than 15 years old which is 12.4 percent.&lt;ref name="hrsa"/&gt; Women aged 40–54 had a rate of low birth weight at 11.8 percent.

===Environmental Factors===
Environmental factors, including exposure of the mother to [[secondhand smoke]]&lt;ref name="sg-report"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44324/ | title = The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General | publisher = [[Surgeon General of the United States]] | date = 2006-06-27 | accessdate = 2014-06-16}} pp.&amp;nbsp;198&amp;ndash;205&lt;/ref&gt; can be a factor in determining the birth weight of child.

== Neonatal Care ==
Most babies admitted to the [[Neonatal intensive care unit|NICU]] are born before 37 weeks of pregnancy or have low birth weight which is less than 5.5 pounds.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=the-neonatal-intensive-care-unit-nicu-90-P02389|title=The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|website=Stanford Children Health |language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could also have a medical condition that requires special care. In the United States nearly half a million babies are born preterm because of this many of these babies also have low birth weights.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; There are four levels of care in the neonatal care units. [[Intensive care unit|Intensive Care]], High Dependency Care, Low Dependency, and Transitional Care are the four levels:&lt;ref name="LiverpoolWhat"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolwomens.nhs.uk/our-services/neonatal-care/what-is-neonatal-care/|title=What is neonatal care?|website=Liverpools Womens NHS Foundation Trust |language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Intensive Care: For babies with serious problems. This includes babies born three months early and have extremely low birth weight.
* High Dependency Care: For babies with less serious problem, but who still may not to be looked after or babies that are recovering from a critical illness.
* Low Dependency Care: For babies that do not need a continuous supervision.
* Transitional Care: For babies that still need medical treatment, but are well enough to be called for at their mother’s bedside.

==Influence on the first few years of life==
Children born with an abnormally low birth weight can have significant problems within the first few years of life. They may have trouble gaining weight, obtaining adequate nutrition, and supporting a strong immune system. They also have higher risks for mortality, behavior problems, and mental deficiencies.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Low birth weight babies are more likely to develop the following conditions after birth compared to normal birth weight babies:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* Breathing problems ( [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome)]]
* Bleeding in the brain ([[Intraventricular hemorrhage|Intraventricular Hemorrage)]]
* [[Patent ductus arteriosus]] (PDA)
* [[Necrotizing enterocolitis]]
* [[Retinopathy of prematurity]]
* [[Neonatal jaundice|Jaundice]]
* Infections

That said, the effects of low birth weight on a child's first few years of life are often intertwined with other maternal, environmental, and genetic factors and most effects of low birth weight are only slightly negatively significant on a child's life when these factors are controlled for.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Datar|first=Ashlesha|last2=Jacknowitz|first2=Alison|date=2009-03-24|title=Birth Weight Effects on Children's Mental, Motor, and Physical Development: Evidence from Twins Data|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=780–794|doi=10.1007/s10995-009-0461-6|issn=1092-7875|pmc=2855622|pmid=19308711}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these factors are controlled, the only significant effect low birth weight has on a child's development is physical growth in the early years and the likelihood of being underweight compared to normal birth weight babies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Influence on adult life==
Studies have been conducted to investigate how a person's birth weight can influence aspects of their future life. This includes theorised links with [[obesity]], [[diabetes]] and [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].

===Obesity and Diabetes===
A baby born small or large for gestational age (either of the two extremes) is thought to have an increased risk of [[obesity]] in later life,&lt;ref name="title3 stages of childhood may predict obesity risk - Fitness - MSNBC.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8088161/ |title=3 stages of childhood may predict obesity risk - Fitness - MSNBC.com |accessdate=2007-11-28 |format= |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singhal A, Wells J, Cole TJ, Fewtrell M, Lucas A |title=Programming of lean body mass: a link between birth weight, obesity, and cardiovascular disease? |journal=Am J Clin Nutr |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=726–30 |date=1 March 2003|pmid=12600868 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/77/3/726 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/77.3.726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was also shown that this relationship is fully explained by maternal weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parsons TJ, Power C, Manor O |title=Fetal and early life growth and body mass index from birth to early adulthood in 1958 British cohort: longitudinal study |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |issue=7325 |pages=1331–5 |date=December 2001|pmid=11739217 |pmc=60670 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7325/1331 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7325.1331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middle aged adults with low birth weight present with a higher chance of obesity and diabetes.

== Around the World ==
There is much variation regarding birth weight within continents, countries, and cities.  Even though over 20 million babies are born each year with low birth weight, it is hard to know the exact number as more than half of babies born in the world are not weighed at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/low-birthweight/|title=Low birthweight - UNICEF DATA|work=UNICEF DATA|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baby’s weight is an indicator of the mother and babies health. In 2013 22 million newborns had low birth weight, around 16 percent of all babies globally.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/low-birthweight/|title=Low BirthWeight |website=UNICEF DATA|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data on low birth weight is adjusted to account for under reporting. South Asia has the highest rate of babies not weighted at birth with 66 percent, but also have the highest low birth weight at 28 percent worldwide.&lt;ref name="unicef"/&gt; West and Central Africa and least developed countries are next with 14 percent low birth weight worldwide.&lt;ref name="unicef"/&gt;

More than 96.5% of low birth weight babies are born in developing countries around the world.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because low birth weight babies can require more extensive care, it places a financial burden on communities.

== Prevention ==
The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organizatio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n (WHO) recently announced an initiative to have a thirty percent reduction in low birth weight worldwide. This is public health priority, as birth weight can have short and long term effects. WHO estimates that worldwide, 15-20 % of all births each year are considered low birth weight, which is about 20 million births.&lt;ref name="WHOnutrition"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/globaltargets2025_policybrief_lbw/en/|title=Global Nutrition Targets 2025: Low birth weight policy brief|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of prenatal care is very important to help prevent low birth weight and early medical problems. Going to regular doctor’s visits is very important for the health of the mother and the baby. At the visits the OB/GYN will be checking maternal nutrition and weight gain because that is linked with the baby’s weight gain. The mother having a healthy diet is essential for the baby. Maintaining good nutrition by taking folic acid which is found in fruits and vegetables is linked to premature births and low birth weight.  Alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs should also be avoided during pregnancy because they can also lead to poor growth and other complications. By seeing the doctor they are also able to monitor pre-existing medical illnesses to make sure they are under control during pregnancy. Mothers with [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] are more likely to have infants with low birth weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.healthxchange.sg/women/pregnancy/low-birth-weight-babies-prevention|title=Low and Very Low Birth Weight Babies:Prevention Tips for Expectant Mothers|website=HealthXchange|language=en=GB|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One essential action to increase normal birth weights is to have affordable ,accessible, and culturally sensitive prenatal care worldwide. This is essential not just for treating low birth weight, but also preventing it.  Other prevention efforts include: [[smoking cessation]] programs, food-distribution systems, stress reduction and social service supports.&lt;ref name="WHOnutrition" /&gt;

'''The Blue Button''' is a system for patients to view online and download their own [[personal health record]]s.  Several Federal agencies, including the [[United States Department of Defense|Departments of Defense]], [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]], and [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]], implemented this capability for their beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/BlueButton |title=Blue Button &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203042534/http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations/BlueButton |archivedate=2012-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Blue Button has pledges of support from numerous health plans and some vendors of personal health record vendors across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;See: "Growth of Blue Button," infra.&lt;/ref&gt; Data from Blue Button-enabled sites can be used to create portable medical histories that facilitate dialog among health care providers, caregivers, and other trusted individuals or entities.

Currently widespread Blue Button usage supports downloading human-readable data in ASCII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fridsma|first=Doug|title=Health IT Standards Committee Update  November 13, 2012|url=http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/hitsc_nov13_2012_fridsma.pdf|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebuttonplus.org/|title=Blue Button Implementation Guide|work=bluebuttonplus.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; an implementation guide for data holders and developers to enable automated data exchange among Blue Button+ compliant applications using structured data formats. Blue Button+ is designed to enhance the ways consumers get and share their health information in human-readable and machine-readable formats; and to enable the use of this information in third-party applications.

==History==
===Origins===
The Blue Button initiative began during the [[Markle Foundation]] Work Group on Consumer Engagement meeting in New York City on January 27, 2010.&lt;ref name=Nazi2&gt;{{cite web|last=Nazi|first=Kim M.|title=VA’s Blue Button: Empowering People With Their Data|url=http://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/866/vas-blue-button-empowering-people-with-their-data/|publisher=Vantage Point|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   At the time, [[Meaningful Use]] was newly authorized and dominated health care IT dialogue in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihealthbeat.org/articles/2010/3/2/meaningful-use-tops-list-of-concerns-in-new-health-it-survey.aspx?topic=ehrs|title='Meaningful Use' Tops List of Concerns in New Health IT Survey|work=ihealthbeat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Members of the Markle Connecting for Health Community felt that while Meaningful Use criteria embraced patient engagement, the rules should also “[c]onsider individuals as information participants—not as mere recipients, but as information contributors, knowledge creators, and shared decision makers and care planners.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collaborative Comments on the Proposed EHR Incentives Program|url=http://www.markle.org/sites/default/files/20100315_ehrincent_cms0033p.pdf|publisher=Markle Connecting for Health, Engleberg Center for Health Care Reform at Brookings, Center for American Progress|accessdate=March 27, 2012|page=11|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Markle convened the Work Group on Consumer Engagement to focus on using [[health information technology]] (IT) to achieve this kind of patient engagement.&lt;ref name=Markle2&gt;{{cite web|title=Markle Connecting for Health Work Group on Consumer Engagement|url=http://www.markle.org/health/experts-impact/work-group-consumer-engagement|publisher=The Markle Foundation|accessdate=March 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The January 2010 meeting included representatives from private industry, not-for-profit foundations, and the federal government.&lt;ref name=Markle2 /&gt; Kim Nazi, performance and evaluation manager for VA's My HealtheVet [[personal health record]] (PHR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=John|title=An uncertain prognosis for personal health records|url=http://fcw.com/Articles/2011/05/09/FEAT-personal-health-records.aspx?Page=3|publisher=Federal Computer Week|accessdate=March 27, 2012|page=3|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   and a VA representative to the Work Group, said the attendees were from diverse backgrounds and that the discussion was “passionate”.&lt;ref name=Nazi2 /&gt;

The Department of Defense (DoD) first provided secure on-line access to patient health information in December 2009 with its TriCare Online (TOL) portal. In 2010, the DoD rebranded under the "Blue Button" construct and enabled health record downloads as well as access. The DoD has added additional health record information over time and continues to enhance its Blue Button features.

The Work Group discussed many challenges related to engaging patients: numerous health IT data standards, [[data confidentiality]] and privacy laws, and fortress-like health databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levin|first=Peter|title=Blue Button Challenge|url=http://www.iom.edu/Activities/PublicHealth/HealthData/2011-JUN-09/Opening-Session/Administrator.aspx|accessdate=2012-03-27|location=The Health Data Initiative Forum|date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   VA [[Chief Technology Officer]] (CTO) Peter Levin, also an attendee at the Markle Work Group meeting, described trying to balance the benefits of data standards with getting a solution to patients quickly.  He assessed that it was only when the group decided to break the problem down into the simplest possible solutions that they were able to progress.&lt;ref name=Levin2&gt;{{cite web|last=Levin|first=Peter|title=VA eHealth University 2010 podcast|url=http://www.podcast.tv/video-episodes/day-2-peter-l-levin-12902557.html|accessdate=2012-03-27|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A central theme emerged from the dialogue: give patients their data. HHS CTO and U.S. CTO [[Todd Park]] summarized the decision as:  "Look, there's all this complicated stuff happening with health information.  But why can't we just do this: why can't we just let an American get a copy of their own information?  [A]nd don't worry about the format, don't worry about the standards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Park|first=Todd|title=Citizen Centric Health: How Public/Private Partnerships are Changing the Game|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/showcase/details.aspx?uuid=731a3c54-58ec-4ef8-a23b-154ae79097fc|accessdate=2012-03-27|location=Microsoft Connected Health Conference|date=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The group agreed to create a large, prominent button that would represent data liquidity and access.&lt;ref name=Nazi2 /&gt;

===Implementation===
In August 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] announced that Veterans could soon “go to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] [[VistA#Patient Web Portal|website]], click a simple blue button, download or print your personal health records, so you have them when you need them and can share them with your doctors  . . . .”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.va.gov/open/videos/BlueButton.asx&lt;/ref&gt;

VA launched the Blue Button later that month (see "Growth of Blue Button", below).  In October 2010, US Chief Technology Officer [[Aneesh Chopra]], Health &amp; Human Services Chief Technology Officer [[Todd Park]], and VA Chief Technology Officer Dr. [[Peter L. Levin]] announced that VA and HHS’s Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services were offering Blue Button downloads to Veterans and to Medicare beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;Aneesh Chopra, Todd Park, and Peter L. Levin (2010-10-07). "‘Blue Button’ Provides Access to Downloadable Personal Health Data | The White House". Whitehouse.gov.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue Button was designed to empower patients with their own health data and improve the quality of patient-clinician interactions with the expectation that these would contribute to enhanced quality of life, better treatment outcomes and potential reduction in costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/video/blue-button-and-ehrs-vermont|title=Video- Blue Button Initative [sic] and EHRs in Vermont - Providers &amp; Professionals - HealthIT.gov|work=healthit.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bluebuttondata.org/faq.php&lt;/ref&gt;  The framework on which Blue Button is based—including patient empowerment, data security and privacy protection – draws heavily on work by the Markle Foundation’s collaborative of industry stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markle.org/health/markle-common-framework/connecting-consumers|title=Markle - Connecting Consumers|work=markle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the Blue Button trademark was transferred from the Veterans Administration to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncvhs.hhs.gov/120920tr.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standardization &amp; Interoperability ===

In 2012, efforts began by the Standards &amp; Interoperability Framework&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.siframework.org/Automate+Blue+Button+Initiative |title= Automate Blue Button Initiative |publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services / Office of the National Coordinator |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to standardize the content formats and transport mechanisms for Blue Button data in order to make them more interoperable between health data-holding organizations, patients, and patient-authorized 3rd-parties such as physicians, caregivers, as well as applications and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fridsma |first=Doug |url=http://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/electronic-health-and-medical-records/blue-button-initiative-enhancing-consumer-access-health-information/ |title=Call for Participation in the Automate Blue Button Initiative: Enhancing Consumer Access to Health Information |publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services / Office of the National Coordinator |date=2012-08-09 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, ONC unveiled the [http://www.bluebuttonplus.org/ Blue Button+ Implementation Guide] to provide guidance to both data holders and third-party application developers to enable automated data exchange and data parsing features. The Blue Button+ implementation guide specifies appropriate structured data formats, transmission protocols, and APIs for developers to use when creating applications that rely on automated exchange of Blue Button-accessible health record data.

== Functions ==
The Blue Button is a symbol on a website —for example, an online patient portal provided by a health care provider or insurer — that patients may use to download their health information. Depending on the implementation, users can download a variety of information in multiple formats, including text and PDF. At the Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans can download their self-entered information, such as additional insurance, and information from their medical record, including medications, allergies, and lab results.&lt;ref name="Departmentof"&gt;Department of Veterans Affairs Blue Button Website&lt;/ref&gt; They can also download their military personnel information like occupation specialty and pay details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stegon |first=David |url=http://fedscoop.com/vas-blue-button-now-includes-service-records/ |title=VA’s Blue Button Now Includes Service Records |publisher=FedScoop |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users of Department of Defense's [[TRICARE]] Online can use the Blue Button to download their medications, allergies, and lab results as a PDF or text file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marshall |first=Patrick |url=http://gcn.com/articles/2011/10/17/tricare-blue-button-profile-main.aspx |title=DOD's TRICARE Blue Button simplifies accessing medications, allergies and lab results - Government Computer News |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations like Medicare or [[Aetna]] offer health claims information as a downloadable text file.

Using Blue Button, patients have an easy way to retrieve and keep track of their health. Blue Button offers physicians an easy way to provide that data to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalehealth.org/ckfinder/userfiles/files/Pledge%20Community%20Webinar%20-%202-28-12.pdf|title=Center for Patient and Family-Centered Care|work=nationalehealth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The simplicity of the Blue Button format allows users to carry their health information which ever way suits them—print, thumb drive, or on their smart phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=September 5, 2011 at 2:23 am Greg Frisilone says: |url=http://craigconnects.org/2011/08/blue-button-%C2%AE-gives-access-to-health-information.html |title=Blue Button ® gives access to health information |publisher=craigconnects |date=2011-08-27 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers can create applications to enhance the use of this data, such as the application offered by [[Northrop Grumman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.is.northropgrumman.com/by_solution/health_it/advanced_health/mobile_health/va_mobile/index.html |title=VA Mobile Blue Button App |publisher=Is.northropgrumman.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Growth of Blue Button==

VA launched the Blue Button function on its patient portal, My HealtheVet, in August, 2010.&lt;ref name="va.gov"&gt;https://www.myhealth.va.gov/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  By May 2012, more than 500,000 individual (unique) Veterans had used the Blue Button to download their data. They opt-in to be able to download their health data, first by registering for a My HealtheVet account, and second, by validating their identity for privacy and security reasons, &lt;ref name="va.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="myhealth_FAQ"&gt;https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/anonymous.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_nfto=false&amp;_pageLabel=faqsHome&lt;/ref&gt; which includes appointment information, prescriptions and medications, laboratory results, vital signs and readings, military health history, and military occupations.&lt;ref name="myhealth_FAQ"/&gt;  In August 2012, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that the Blue Button has one million registered patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2378 |title=Blue Button Reaches One Million Registered Patients |publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) launched its version of Blue Button in September, 2010 on the My Medicare patient portal, giving 40 million beneficiaries online access to their Medicare claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mymedicare.gov/|title=MyMedicare.gov:  Portal of Personalized Information|work=mymedicare.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Department of Defense also added a Blue Button function to its Tricare Online patient portal in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tricareonline.com/portal/page/portal/TricareOnline/Portal&lt;/ref&gt;

In July, 2011, the VA Innovation Initiative (VAi2)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.va.gov/vai2/&lt;/ref&gt;  sponsored the Blue Button for All Americans Contest to encourage widespread use and assure that all Veterans had access to their Blue Button health data regardless of whether they sought care from VA or from a private non-VA health care provider.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2137|title=News Releases - Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|author=Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|work=va.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2011-07-18/pdf/2011-18014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  In October, 2011, McKesson Corporation’s Relay Health Division won VA’s Blue Button contest by adding Blue Button functions to the patient portals which it offers through its 200,000 physician and 2,000 hospital clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/relayhealth%E2%80%99s-phr-wins-blue-button-contest|title=RelayHealth’s PHR wins Blue Button contest|work=Healthcare IT News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=2188|title=News Releases - Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|author=Office of Public and Intergovernmental Affairs|work=va.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.relayhealth.com/news-and-events/blog/RelayHealth-Donating-Blue-Button-For-All-Americans-Prize-to-Wounded-Warrior-Project.html|title=RelayHealth Donating 'Blue Button For All Americans' Prize to Wounded Warrior Project - RelayHealth|author=Jim Greene|work=relayhealth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These represent slightly less than one third of physicians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Healthcare/Physicians-and-surgeons.htm|title=Physicians and Surgeons|date=8 January 2014|work=bls.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; and slightly more than one third of hospitals in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aha.org/research/rc/stat-studies/fast-facts.shtml|title=Fast Facts on US Hospitals|work=aha.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, 2011, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation launched a website to advocate cross-industry use of the Blue Button; its website collects the pledges of industry adopters of the technology, including United Health Care, Humana, Patients Like Me, Walgreens, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bluebuttondata.org/|title=Blue Button redirect|work=bluebuttondata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of those pledging support, Aetna, announced in September 2011 that it had added the Blue Button function to its patient portal, and in addition offered its beneficiaries the ability to share their Blue Button downloads with Aetna providers.  At the time, Aetna said it served more than 36 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.aetna.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=110617&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1606005&amp;highlight=|title=News Releases|work=aetna.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; United Health Group began offering Blue Button downloads to its commercial health plan beneficiaries in July, 2012, rolling out the capability to its customers.  The company expects 26 million plan beneficiaries will have access to Blue Button downloads by mid-2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedhealthgroup.com/newsroom/news.aspx?id=90e6efb4-b596-4a54-8fb7-4fa2ae03bc1d|title=UnitedHealth Group - Newsroom|author=UnitedHealth Group|work=unitedhealthgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other private sector organizations contributed to the growth of Blue Button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.aol.com/2011/11/22/vas-blue-button-innovation-takes-private-healthcare-sector-by-s/|title=VA’s Blue Button Innovation Takes Private Healthcare Sector By Storm|work=Breaking Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example:
* Iatric Systems, Inc., a hospital-focused EHR vendor, includes the Blue Button on the patient portals of its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iatric.com/PtAccess|title=PtAccess Patient Portal Meets Meaningful Use|work=iatric.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Humetrix, Inc., offers a mobile Blue Button application through which patients can send their Blue Button data directly to their physicians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humetrix.com/ibb.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Microsoft HealthVault]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/healthvault/bluebutton.aspx|title=HealthVault|publisher=Microsoft|work=Microsoft HealthVault}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dossia]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dossia.org/blog/101-dossia-ready-to-accept-blue-button-data-from-cms-va&lt;/ref&gt; which are patient-controlled repositories of personal health information, each accept Blue Button data.
* Napersoft, Inc., a consumer communications management software company, uses Blue Button in its Talk2Health product to transmit data between patients, payers and providers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marketwatch.com/story/napersoft-selected-as-presenter-at-health-data-initiative-forum-iii-the-health-datapalooza-2012-05-22&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management announced that it had requested all federal employee health benefit plans to add the Blue Button function to their patient portals.&lt;ref name=OPM-employees&gt;http://www.opm.gov/news/blue-button-added-to-health-insurance-carriers-for-federal-employees,1744.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opm.gov/carrier/carrier_letters/2011/2011-21.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  FEHB’s health benefit plans are offered by more than 200 insurance carriers and serve approximately eight million federal employees (including Members of Congress), their families, and retirees.&lt;ref name=OPM-employees/&gt;

In May 2012, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] announced the White House [[Presidential Innovation Fellows]] which will focus on five program areas including expanding Blue Button capabilities nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Ferenstein|first=Gregory|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/23/the-21st-century-gold-rush-announced-at-disrupt-raw-data/ |title=The 21st Century Gold Rush Announced At Disrupt: Raw Data |publisher=techcrunch.com |date=2012-05-23 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT wants to expand Blue Button to any patient in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burns|first=Ed|url=http://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/news/2240163116/ONC-looks-to-make-Blue-Button-public-boost-patient-engagement|title=ONC looks to make Blue Button public, boost patient engagement|website=searchhealthit.techtarget.com|date=2012-09-12|accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the ONC launched the Automate Blue Button Standards and Interoperability Framework Initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Riccardi|first=Lygeia|last2=Fridsma|first2=Doug|url=http://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/electronic-health-and-medical-records/blue-button-initiative-enhancing-consumer-access-health-information/|title=Call for Participation in the Automate Blue Button Initiative: Enhancing Consumer Access to Health Information|date=2012-08-09|accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which culminated in 2013 with the release of the Blue Button+ Implementation Guide.&lt;ref name=introducing-bbplus/&gt;

In 2012, ONC held the Blue Button Mashup Challenge to encourage the development of third-party applications that increase the usefulness of data downloaded via Blue Button. The first-prize winner, iBlueButton, is a smart phone app that takes data from Medicare’s online portal and organizes it into an easier to read, easier to navigate format. The second-prize winner, ID BlueButton, is a tablet-based application that parses health information downloaded through Blue Button and presents it in a form that more clearly shows changes in health indicators and medication use over time. The third-prize winner, InstantPHR, is a web app that uses data downloaded through Blue Button to automatically populate personal health records in Microsoft HealthVault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blue Button Mashup Challenge|url=http://www.health2con.com/devchallenge/blue-button-mash-up-challenge/|work=Health 2.0 Developer Challenge|publisher=Health 2.0, LLC|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Blue Button+ ==

Blue Button+ extends the Blue Button concept to include a standardized data format and additional functionality for trusted, automated exchange of health data, and advanced parsing of health data to improve human readability.&lt;ref name=introducing-bbplus&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham-Jones|first1=Pierce|last2=Panchadsaram|first2=Ryan|title=Introducing Blue Button+|url=http://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/health-innovation/introducing-blue-button/|work=Health IT Buzz|publisher=Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT|accessdate=12 January 2014|date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013,{{Citation needed|reason=source needed for release date|date=January 2014}} ONC released the Blue Button+ Implementation Guide, offering guidance and a toolkit for both data holders (such as health care providers and insurers) and third-party application developers seeking to add this functionality to their products and services. The Blue Button+ Implementation Guide is the result of a collaboration among more than 68 volunteer organizations.&lt;ref name=introducing-bbplus/&gt;

SMART Platforms, Harvard Medical School, and Boston Children’s Hospital built a proof-of-concept Blue Button+ app called Growth-tastic. With Growth-tastic, parents can view charts of their child’s height, weight, and BMI trended over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamilton|first=Laura|title=Engaging Patients with Blue Button+|url=http://www.additiveanalytics.com/blog/engaging-patients-blue-button/|work=Additive Analytics Blog|publisher=Additive Analytics, LLC|date=30 October 2013|accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage and Licensing ==

Originally, in 2010, organizations needed a license to use the Blue Button marks. As of September 2012, application and licensing is no longer required.  Usage of the Blue Button logo and brand is free, but must conform to the established [http://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/blue-button/blue-button-image%20 usage guidelines set by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services].

== Green Button and Red Button ==

Blue Button is part of a larger “My Data Initiative” that aims to empower consumers with the tools and information they need to make optimal choices.  Other, similar "button" projects include the Green Button (for personal energy usage data) and the Red Button (for personal educational data).

In September 2011, US CTO Aneesh Chopra challenged the energy industry to model a Green Button, off the successful Blue Button, where energy providers would give energy users their consumption data in an easy to read and use format at the click of the button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aneesh Chopra |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/09/15/modeling-green-energy-challenge-after-blue-button |title=Modeling a Green Energy Challenge after a Blue Button &amp;#124; The White House |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2012, two major California utilities—Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric—announced their implementation of Green Button.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greenbuttondata.org/greenabout.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324121214/http://www.greenbuttondata.org/greenabout.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-03-24 |title=Green Button — About |publisher=Greenbuttondata.org |date=2011-09-15 |accessdate=2012-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy customers can manage their consumption via their smart phones using the standard Green Button data format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Witkin |first=Jim |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/a-phone-app-for-turning-down-the-thermostat/# |title=Pushing the Green Button for Energy Savings - NYTimes.com |location=Silicon Valley (Calif) |publisher=Green.blogs.nytimes.com |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Institute of Standards and Technology awarded a contract to HyperTek Inc. to work with developers and users to expand the Green Button initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Marks|url=http://www.nextgov.com/emerging-tech/emerging-tech-blog/2012/09/green-button-initiative-gets-down-work/58214/?oref=voicesmodule|title=GREEN BUTTON INITIATIVE GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS|date=2012-09-19|accessdate=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related initiatives ==

In healthcare, there is a related proposal for a Green Button, as a way for doctors to use summarized patient data for real time decision making at the point of care.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/33/7/1229.full&lt;/ref&gt; A related, patient-driven, green button initiative to promote the donation of medical data analogous to donation of organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://e-patients.net/archives/2011/07/the-green-button-idea-support-app-development-with-a-donate-my-data-button.html|title=The Green Button idea: support app development with a “Donate My Data” button - e-Patients.net|work=e-patients.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Department of Defense's implementation of the Blue Button was awarded one of the 10 GCN 2011 awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McCloskey |first=Paul |url=http://gcn.com/Articles/2011/08/05/2011-GCN-Award-Winners.aspx?Page=3 |title=10 agency projects win 2011 GCN Awards |publisher=gcn.com |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2012-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Blue Button team was selected as a finalist by the Partnership for Public Service for the Citizen Services Medal for their contributions to implementing Blue Button at Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://servicetoamericamedals.org/SAM/finalists11/csm/nazi.shtml |title=Kim M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3704">'''Bob Sang''' (27 March 1948 - 5 June 2009) was appointed by [[London South Bank University]] as the UK's first professor of Patient and Public Involvement in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=407188&amp;sectioncode=26&lt;/ref&gt; He had also been a Visiting Fellow at [[CENTRIM]].&lt;ref&gt;http://centrim.mis.brighton.ac.uk/news/sang-memorial&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at the [[University of East Anglia]] but failed his chemistry degree there. He later returned to studying and completed a public administration degree at the [[University of Sussex]].

He was a pioneer of the idea of involving patients, service users and the public in health and social care, describing himself as a 'constructive subversive'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthpolicyinsight.com/?q=node/298&lt;/ref&gt;

Sang was a prolific networker and writer, contributing articles&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;as_epq=bob+sang&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=Bob+Sang&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_sdt=1&amp;as_subj=bio&amp;as_subj=med&amp;as_subj=bus&amp;as_subj=soc&amp;as_sdts=5&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; to journals including ''Health Policy Insight'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthpolicyinsight.com/?q=node/304&lt;/ref&gt; ''British Journal of Healthcare Management'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bjhcm.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Journal of Integrated Care''&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cluster=6670628938121356481&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2000&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Health Service Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hsj.co.uk/bob-sang/1240.contributor&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a career which combined academia, research and working in mental health, he established his own independent consultancy, Sang Jacobsson. His work through Sang Jacobsson included mentoring, training, policy work, facilitation and analysis, and was mainly for clients in the NHS and the UK health economy.

Sang was the co-founder with Jane Keep of the Engaging Communities Learning Network&lt;ref&gt;http://www.networks.nhs.uk/networks.php?pid=19&lt;/ref&gt; for the National Association of Primary and Care Trusts (NatPaCT), which was part of the now-closed [[NHS Modernisation Agency]]. The Engaging Communities Learning Network was designed to help NHS [[primary care trust]]s (PCTs) share good practice and learning about patient and public involvement and engagement.

He provided professional supervision to the ground-breaking Health Foundation Leadership Fellows Scheme which over five years directly involved patients and users in the leadership development of 64 NHS clinicians and managers.

He died of [[acute pancreatitis]] on 5 June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/jul/02/bob-sang-obituary&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of condoms, as of most forms of [[contraception]], can be assessed two ways. ''Perfect use'' or ''method'' effectiveness rates only include people who use condoms properly and consistently. ''Actual use'', or ''typical use'' effectiveness rates are of all condom users, including those who use condoms incorrectly or do not use condoms at every act of intercourse. Rates are generally presented for the first year of use.&lt;ref name="hatcher"&gt;{{cite book |first=RA |last=Hatcher |author2=Trussel, J |author3=Nelson, AL |year=2007 |title=Contraceptive Technology |edition=19th |publisher=Ardent Media | location=New York | isbn=1-59708-001-2 | url=http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html |accessdate=2009-07-26|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531095926/http://www.contraceptivetechnology.com/table.html |archivedate = May 31, 2008|deadurl=yes|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commonly the [[Pearl Index]] is used to calculate effectiveness rates, but some studies use [[decrement table]]s.&lt;ref name="kippley"&gt;{{cite book | first=John | last=Kippley |author2=Kippley, Sheila | year=1996 | title=The Art of Natural Family Planning | edition=4th addition | publisher=The Couple to Couple League | location=Cincinnati, OH | isbn=0-926412-13-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|141}}

Condoms are widely recommended for the prevention of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s (STIs). They have been shown to be effective in reducing infection rates in both men and women. While not perfect, the condom is effective at reducing the transmission of organisms that cause [[AIDS]], [[genital herpes]], [[cervical cancer]], [[genital wart]]s, [[syphilis]], [[chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]], and other diseases.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood"&gt;{{cite web |title=Condom |publisher=Planned Parenthood | year=2008 |url=http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/condom-10187.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Condoms are often recommended as an adjunct to more effective birth control methods (such as [[IUD]]) in situations where STD protection is also desired.&lt;ref name=DualProtection&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cates, W.|author2=Steiner, M.

According to a 2000 report by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), consistent use of latex condoms reduces the risk of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] transmission by approximately 85% relative to risk when unprotected, putting the seroconversion rate (infection rate) at 0.9 per 100 person-years with condom, down from 6.7 per 100 person-years.&lt;ref name="workshop"&gt;{{cite conference|last=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |authorlink=National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases |title=Workshop Summary: Scientific Evidence on Condom Effectiveness for Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Prevention |pages=13–15 |date=2001-07-20 |location=Hyatt Dulles Airport, Herndon, Virginia |url=https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dmid/documents/condomreport.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009022150/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/organization/dmid/documents/condomreport.pdf |archivedate=2010-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis published in 2007 from the [[University of Texas Medical Branch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003255|author1=Cayley, W.E. |author2=Davis-Beaty, K.|year=2007|title=Effectiveness of Condoms in Reducing Heterosexual Transmission of HIV (Review)|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. |editor1-last=Weller|editor1-first=Susan C|journal=Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=World Health Organization Department of Reproductive Health and Research (WHO/RHR) &amp; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health/Center for Communication Programs (CCP), INFO Project|year=2007|title=Family Planning: A Global Handbook for Providers|publisher=INFO Project at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health|url=http://www.infoforhealth.org/globalhandbook/index.shtml|page=200|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827081805/http://www.infoforhealth.org/globalhandbook/index.shtml|archivedate=2009-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found similar risk reductions of 80–95%.

The 2000 NIH review concluded that condom use significantly reduces the risk of [[gonorrhea]] for men.&lt;ref name="workshop" /&gt; A 2006 study reports that proper condom use decreases the risk of transmission of [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) to women by approximately 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Winer, R |author2=Hughes, J |author3=Feng, Q |author4=O'Reilly, S |author5=Kiviat, N |author6=Holmes, K |author7=Koutsky, L |title=Condom use and the risk of genital human papillomavirus infection in young women |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa053284 |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=354 |issue=25 |pages=2645–54 |year=2006 |pmid=16790697 |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/25/2645 |accessdate=2007-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421144623/http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/25/2645 |archivedate=2007-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study in the same year found consistent condom use was effective at reducing transmission of [[Herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex virus-2]] also known as genital herpes, in both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wald |first1=Anna |title=The Relationship between Condom Use and Herpes Simplex Virus Acquisition |journal=Annals of Internal Medicine |volume=143 |pages=707–713 |year=2005 |pmid=16287791 |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/143/10/707 |accessdate=2007-04-07 |last2=Langenberg |first2=AG |last3=Krantz |first3=E |last4=Douglas Jr |first4=JM |last5=Handsfield |first5=HH |last6=Dicarlo |first6=RP |last7=Adimora |first7=AA |last8=Izu |first8=AE |last9=Morrow |first9=RA |last10=Lawrence |first10=C |issue=10 |doi=10.7326/0003-4819-143-10-200511150-00007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328204310/http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/143/10/707 |archivedate=2007-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a condom is effective in limiting exposure, some disease transmission may occur even with a condom. Infectious areas of the genitals, especially when symptoms are present, may not be covered by a condom, and as a result, some diseases like HPV and herpes may be transmitted by direct contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Villhauer |first=Tanya |title=Condoms Preventing HPV? |publisher=University of Iowa Student Health Service/Health Iowa |date=2005-05-20 |url=http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |accessdate=2009-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314084306/http://www.uistudenthealth.com/question/default.aspx?q=738 |archivedate=2010-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary effectiveness issue with using condoms to prevent STDs, however, is inconsistent use.&lt;ref name="badnews" /&gt;

Condoms may also be useful in treating potentially [[cervical cancer|precancerous cervical changes]].

Among people who intend condoms to be their form of birth control, pregnancy may occur when the user has sex without a condom. The person may have run out of condoms, or be traveling and not have a condom with them, or simply dislike the feel of condoms and decide to "take a chance". This type of behavior is the primary cause of typical use failure (as opposed to method or perfect use failure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Steiner, M |author2=Cates, W |author3=Warner, L |title=The real problem with male condoms is nonuse | journal = Sex Transm Dis | volume = 26 | issue = 8 |pages=459–62 |year=1999 | pmid = 10494937 | doi = 10.1097/00007435-199909000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
[[File:CondomUse2 alternative.jpg|thumb|Illustrations showing how to put on a condom]]
Male condoms are usually packaged inside a foil or plastic wrapper, in a rolled-up form, and are designed to be applied to the tip of the penis and then unrolled over the [[erection|erect]] penis. It is important that some space be left in the tip of the condom so that semen has a place to collect; otherwise it may be forced out of the base of the device. Most condoms have a teat end for this purpose. After use, it is recommended the condom be wrapped in tissue or tied in a knot, then disposed of in a trash receptacle.&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal" /&gt; Condoms are used to reduce the likelihood of pregnancy during intercourse and to reduce the likelihood of contracting sexually-transmitted infections (STIs). Condoms are also used during fellatio to reduce the likelihood of contracting STIs.

Some couples find that putting on a condom interrupts sex, although others incorporate condom application as part of their foreplay. Some men and women find the physical barrier of a condom dulls sensation. Advantages of dulled sensation can include prolonged erection and delayed ejaculation; disadvantages might include a loss of some sexual excitement.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood" /&gt; Advocates of condom use also cite their advantages of being inexpensive, easy to use, and having few side effects.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fwhc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Male Condom |publisher=Feminist Women's Health Center |date=October 18, 2007 |url=http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |accessdate=2007-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121011004/http://www.fwhc.org/birth-control/condom.htm |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sex education ===
Condoms are often used in [[sex education]] programs, because they have the capability to reduce the chances of pregnancy and the spread of some sexually transmitted diseases when used correctly. A recent [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) press release supported the inclusion of information about condoms in sex education, saying "''comprehensive sexuality education programs... discuss the appropriate use of condoms''", and "''promote condom use for those who are sexually active''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Based on the research, comprehensive sex education is more effective at stopping the spread of HIV infection, says APA committee |publisher=American Psychological Association |date=February 23, 2005 |url=http://www.apa.org/releases/sexeducation.html |accessdate=2006-08-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811000127/http://www.apa.org/releases/sexeducation.html |archivedate=August 11, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infertility treatment {{anchor|Infertility treatment}} ===
&lt;!-- [[Conception device]] links to anchor Infertility treatment --&gt;
Common procedures in [[infertility]] treatment such as [[semen analysis]] and [[Artificial insemination|intrauterine insemination]] (IUI) require collection of semen samples. These are most commonly obtained through [[masturbation]], but an alternative to masturbation is use of a special ''collection condom'' to collect semen during sexual intercourse.

Collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane, as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm. Many men prefer collection condoms to masturbation,{{cn|date=November 2018}} and some religions prohibit masturbation entirely. Also, compared with samples obtained from masturbation, semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts, sperm motility, and percentage of sperm with normal morphology. For this reason, they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis, and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as intracervical or intrauterine [[Artificial insemination|insemination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sofikitis NV, Miyagawa I |title=Endocrinological, biophysical, and biochemical parameters of semen collected via masturbation versus sexual intercourse |journal=J.

For fertility treatments, a collection condom may be used to collect semen during [[sexual intercourse]] where the semen is provided by the woman's partner. Private [[sperm donors]] may also use a collection condom to obtain samples through masturbation or by sexual intercourse with a partner and will transfer the ejaculate from the collection condom to a specially designed container. The sperm is transported in such containers, in the case of a donor, to a recipient woman to be used for insemination, and in the case of a woman's partner, to a fertility clinic for processing and use. However, transportation may reduce the fecundity of the sperm. Collection condoms may also be used where semen is produced at a sperm bank or fertility clinic.

''Condom therapy'' is sometimes prescribed to infertile couples when the female has high levels of [[antisperm antibodies]]. The theory is that preventing exposure to her partner's semen will lower her level of antisperm antibodies, and thus increase her chances of pregnancy when condom therapy is discontinued. However, condom therapy has not been shown to increase subsequent pregnancy rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0272.1979.tb02229.x |vauthors=Franken D, Slabber C |title=Experimental findings with spermantibodies: condom therapy (a case report) | journal = Andrologia | volume = 11 | issue = 6 |pages=413–6 |year=1979 | pmid = 532982}}&lt;br /&gt;

IMPORTANT: When adding a new listing, please include a reliable source that discusses the use.

Condoms excel as multipurpose containers and barriers because they are waterproof, elastic, durable, and (for military and espionage uses) will not arouse suspicion if found.

Ongoing military utilization began during World War II, and includes covering the muzzles of rifle barrels to prevent fouling,&lt;ref name="dday"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ambrose, Stephen E |title=D-Day, June 6, 1944: the climactic battle of World War II |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-671-71359-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; the waterproofing of firing assemblies in underwater demolitions,&lt;ref&gt;Couch, D (2001).

Condoms have also been used to [[drug smuggling|smuggle]] [[alcohol]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and other drugs across borders and into prisons by filling the condom with drugs, tying it in a knot and then either swallowing it or inserting it into the [[rectum]]. These methods are very dangerous and potentially lethal; if the condom breaks, the drugs inside become absorbed into the bloodstream and can cause an overdose.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;A 41-year-old man has been remanded in custody after being stopped on Saturday by customs officials at the Norwegian border at Svinesund.

[[File:Préservatif féminin.jpg|thumb|right|A female condom]]

Male condoms have a tight ring to form a seal around the penis while female condoms usually have a large stiff ring to prevent them from slipping into the [[body orifice]]. The Female Health Company produced a female condom that was initially made of polyurethane, but newer versions are made of [[nitrile rubber|nitrile]]. Medtech Products produces a female condom made of latex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avert.org/female-condom.htm |title=The Female Condom |publisher=AVERT |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228152904/http://www.avert.org/female-condom.htm |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materials ===

==== Natural latex ====
[[File:Condom unrolled durex.jpg|thumb|375px|An unrolled latex condom]]

Latex has outstanding elastic properties: Its [[tensile strength]] exceeds 30&amp;nbsp;MPa, and latex condoms may be stretched in excess of 800% before breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Relationship of condom strength to failure during use | journal = PIACT Prod News | volume = 2 | issue = 2 |pages=1–2 |year=1980 | pmid = 12264044 |author1=Program for the Introduction and Adaptation of Contraceptive Technology PIACT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] set standards for condom production (ISO 4074, Natural latex rubber condoms), and the [[European Union|EU]] followed suit with its [[European Committee for Standardization|CEN]] standard (Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices). Every latex condom is tested for holes with an electric current. If the condom passes, it is rolled and packaged. In addition, a portion of each batch of condoms is subject to water leak and air burst testing.&lt;ref name="badnews"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nordenberg |first=Tamar |title=Condoms: Barriers to Bad News |journal=FDA Consumer magazine |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=March–April 1998 |url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/HIVandAIDSActivities/ucm126370.htm |accessdate=2007-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308051921/http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ByAudience/ForPatientAdvocates/HIVandAIDSActivities/ucm126370.htm |archivedate=2010-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the advantages of latex have made it the most popular condom material, it does have some drawbacks. Latex condoms are damaged when used with oil-based substances as [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], such as [[petroleum jelly]], [[cooking oil]], [[baby oil]], [[mineral oil]], [[skin lotion]]s, [[Sunscreen|suntan lotions]], [[cold cream]]s, [[butter]] or [[margarine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42331/1/1885960018_eng.pdf Essentials of Contraceptive Technology &gt; Chapter 11 Condoms] From the Knowledge for Health Project, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

In May 2009 the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] granted approval for the production of condoms composed of [[Vytex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=FDA Clearance for Envy Natural Rubber Latex Condom Made with Vytex NRL |publisher=Vystar |date=2009-05-06 |url=http://www.vytex.com/BizDocs/R-EnvyFDA_Clearance.pdf |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007172424/http://www.vytex.com/BizDocs/R-EnvyFDA_Clearance.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; latex that has been treated to remove 90% of the [[antibody generator|proteins responsible for allergic reactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Vytex Works |publisher=Vystar |year=2009 |url=http://www.vytex.com/Consumers/howvytexworks.aspx?pageid=C8 |accessdate=2009-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530223349/http://www.vytex.com/Consumers/howvytexworks.aspx?pageid=C8 |archivedate=2010-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An allergen-free condom made of synthetic latex (polyisoprene) is also available.&lt;ref name="isoprenepr" /&gt;

==== Synthetic ====
The most common non-latex condoms are made from [[polyurethane]]. Condoms may also be made from other synthetic materials, such as [[AT-10 resin]], and most recently [[polyisoprene]].&lt;ref name="isoprenepr"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Lifestyles Condoms Introduces Polyisoprene Non-latex |publisher=HealthNewsDigest.com |date=2008-07-31 |url=http://healthnewsdigest.com/news/New_Product_460/Lifestyles_Condoms_printer.shtml |accessdate=2008-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823054656/http://healthnewsdigest.com/news/New_Product_460/Lifestyles_Condoms_printer.shtml |archivedate=2008-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyurethane condoms tend to be the same width and thickness as latex condoms, with most polyurethane condoms between 0.04&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.07&amp;nbsp;mm thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Condoms |work=Condom Statistics and Sizes |date=2008-03-12 |url=http://blog.condomman.com/articles/condom-use/all-you-need-to-know-on-condom-statistics-and-sizes/ |accessdate=2012-05-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525205018/http://blog.condomman.com/articles/condom-use/all-you-need-to-know-on-condom-statistics-and-sizes/ |archivedate=2013-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyurethane can be considered better than latex in several ways: it conducts heat better than latex, is not as sensitive to temperature and ultraviolet light (and so has less rigid storage requirements and a longer shelf life), can be used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]], is less allergenic than latex, and does not have an odor.&lt;ref name="nonlatex"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nonlatex vs Latex Condoms: An Update | journal = The Contraception Report | volume = 14 | issue = 2 |publisher=Contraception Online|date=September 2003|url=http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243|accessdate=2006-08-14 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060926035226/http://www.contraceptiononline.org/contrareport/article01.cfm?art=243 |archivedate = September 26, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyurethane condoms have gained [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approval for sale in the United States as an effective method of contraception and HIV prevention, and under laboratory conditions have been shown to be just as effective as latex for these purposes.&lt;ref name="AlicePolyLatex"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are polyurethane condoms as effective as latex ones? |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=February 22, 2005 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1842.html |accessdate=2007-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070530000038/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1842.html |archivedate=May 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, polyurethane condoms are less elastic than latex ones, and may be more likely to slip or break than latex,&lt;ref name="nonlatex" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AlicePoly"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prefers polyurethane protection |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=March 4, 2005 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1203.html |accessdate=2007-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609115429/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/1203.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; lose their shape or bunch up more than latex,&lt;ref name="PPAA"&gt;{{cite news|title=Allergic to Latex?

Polyisoprene is a synthetic version of natural rubber latex. While significantly more expensive,&lt;ref name="isopreneglove"&gt;{{cite web | title = Polyisoprene Surgical Gloves | publisher = SurgicalGlove.net | year = 2008 | url = http://www.surgicalglove.net/polyisoprene.html | accessdate = 2008-08-24 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080918193917/http://www.surgicalglove.net/polyisoprene.html | archivedate = 2008-09-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has the advantages of latex (such as being softer and more elastic than polyurethane condoms)&lt;ref name="isoprenepr" /&gt; without the protein which is responsible for latex allergies.&lt;ref name="isopreneglove" /&gt; Like polyurethane condoms, polyisoprene condoms are said to do a better job of transmitting body heat. Unlike polyurethane condoms, they cannot be used with an oil-based lubricant.&lt;ref name="PPAA" /&gt;

==== Lambskin ====
Condoms made from [[sheep]] [[intestine]]s, labeled "lambskin", are also available. Although they are generally effective as a contraceptive by blocking sperm, it is presumed that they are likely less effective than latex in preventing the transmission of agents that cause [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]], because of pores in the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Boston Women's Health Book Collective |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves: A New Edition for a New Era |publisher=Touchstone |location=New York, NY |year=2005 |isbn=0-7432-5611-5 |page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the idea that intestines, by their nature, are porous, permeable membranes, and while sperm are too large to pass through the pores, viruses—such as [[HIV]], [[herpes]], and [[genital warts]]—are small enough to pass through.&lt;ref name="PPAA" /&gt; However, there are to date no clinical data confirming or denying this theory. Some believe that lambskin condoms provide a more "natural" sensation, and they lack the allergens that are inherent to latex, but because of their lesser protection against infection, other hypoallergenic materials such as [[polyurethane]] are recommended for latex-allergic users and/or partners. Lambskin condoms are also significantly more expensive than other types and as slaughter by-products they are also not [[vegetarian]].

=== Spermicide ===
Some latex condoms are lubricated at the manufacturer with a small amount of a [[nonoxynol-9]], a [[spermicide|spermicidal chemical]]. According to [[Consumer Reports]], condoms lubricated with spermicide have no additional benefit in preventing pregnancy, have a shorter shelf life, and may cause [[urinary tract infection|urinary-tract infections]] in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Condoms: Extra protection |work=ConsumerReports.org |date=February 2005 |url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2005/02/eng0502tcv.htm?resultPageIndex=1&amp;resultIndex=1&amp;searchTerm=condom |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110317120248/http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2005/02/eng0502tcv.htm?resultPageIndex=1&amp;resultIndex=1&amp;searchTerm=condom |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-17 |accessdate=2009-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, application of separately packaged spermicide ''is'' believed to increase the contraceptive efficacy of condoms.&lt;ref name="simultaneous" /&gt;

Nonoxynol-9 was once believed to offer additional protection against STDs (including HIV) but recent studies have shown that, with frequent use, nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of HIV transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nonoxynol-9 and the Risk of HIV Transmission |work=HIV/AIDS Epi Update |publisher=Health Canada, Centre for Infectious Disease Prevention and Control |date=April 2003 |url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/epiu-aepi/hiv-vih/nonoxynol-eng.php |accessdate=2006-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929172125/http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/epiu-aepi/hiv-vih/nonoxynol-eng.php |archivedate=2009-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] says that spermicidally lubricated condoms should no longer be promoted.

=== Ribbed and studded ===
[[File:Kondom - abgerollt - hängend.jpg|thumb|75px|A ribbed condom]]
Textured condoms include studded and ribbed condoms which can provide extra sensations to both partners. The studs or ribs can be located on the inside, outside, or both; alternatively, they are located in specific sections to provide directed stimulation to either the [[g-spot]] or [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]]. Many textured condoms which advertise "mutual pleasure" also are bulb-shaped at the top, to provide extra stimulation to the penis.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=Condom Types: A look at different condom styles|url=http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/tp/CondomTypes.htm|last=Stacey|first=Dawn|accessdate=2008-12-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219035952/http://contraception.about.com/od/malecondom/tp/CondomTypes.htm|archivedate=2008-12-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women experience irritation during vaginal intercourse with studded condoms.

=== Other ===
The [[anti-rape condom]] is another variation designed to be worn by women. It is designed to cause pain to the attacker, hopefully allowing the victim a chance to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rape-aXe: Questions and answers |publisher=Rape-aXe |year=2006 |url=http://www.antirape.co.za/questions.htm |accessdate=2009-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503104839/http://www.antirape.co.za/questions.htm |archivedate=2009-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[collection condom]] is used to collect semen for fertility treatments or sperm analysis. These condoms are designed to maximize sperm life.

Some condom-like devices are intended for entertainment only, such as glow-in-the dark condoms. These [[novelties|novelty]] condoms may not provide protection against pregnancy and STDs.&lt;ref name="planned parenthood" /&gt;

== Prevalence ==
The prevalence of condom use varies greatly between countries. Most surveys of contraceptive use are among married women, or women in informal unions. Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in that country, condoms account for almost 80% of contraceptive use by married women. On average, in developed countries, condoms are the most popular method of birth control: 28% of married contraceptive users rely on condoms. In the average less-developed country, condoms are less common: only 6–8% of married contraceptive users choose condoms.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Family Planning Worldwide: 2008 Data Sheet |publisher=Population Reference Bureau |year=2008 |url=http://www.prb.org/pdf08/fpds08.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-06-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911033118/http://www.prb.org/pdf08/fpds08.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-11 |df= }} Data from surveys 1997–2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

{{Main|History of condoms}}
[[File:De Morbo Gallico.jpg|thumb|A page from ''De Morbo Gallico'' (On the French Disease), Gabriele Falloppio's treatise on syphilis. Published in 1564, it describes what is possibly the first use of condoms.]]

=== Before the 19th century ===
Whether condoms were used in ancient civilizations is debated by archaeologists and historians.&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;{{cite book | first=Aine | last=Collier | year=2007 |title=The Humble Little Condom: A History | publisher=Prometheus Books | location=Amherst, NY | isbn=978-1-59102-556-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|11}} In ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, pregnancy prevention was generally seen as a woman's responsibility, and the only well documented contraception methods were female-controlled devices.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|17,23}} In Asia before the 15th century, some use of [[glans]] condoms (devices covering only the head of the penis) is recorded. Condoms seem to have been used for contraception, and to have been known only by members of the upper classes. In China, glans condoms may have been made of oiled silk paper, or of lamb intestines. In Japan, they were made of tortoise shell or animal horn.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|60–1}}

In 16th-century Italy, anatomist and physician [[Gabriele Falloppio]] wrote a treatise on [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|51,54–5}} The earliest documented strain of syphilis, first appearing in Europe in a 1490s outbreak, caused severe symptoms and often death within a few months of contracting the disease.&lt;ref name=Scars_of_Venus&gt;{{cite book | author=Oriel, JD |title=The Scars of Venus: A History of Venereology | location=London | publisher= Springer-Verlag | year=1994 |isbn=0-387-19844-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Diamond1&gt;{{cite book |author=Diamond, Jared | year=1997 | title=Guns, Germs and Steel | location=New York |publisher=W.W.

The cloths he described were sized to cover the [[Glans penis|glans of the penis]], and were held on with a ribbon.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|51,54–5}}&lt;ref name=pai&gt;{{cite web|title=Special Topic: History of Condom Use |publisher=Population Action International |year=2002 |url=http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |accessdate=2008-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714101959/http://www.populationaction.org/Publications/Reports/Condoms_Count/Special_Topic_History_of_Condom_Use.shtml |archivedate=14 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Falloppio claimed that an experimental trial of the linen sheath demonstrated protection against syphilis.&lt;ref name="youssef"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Youssef |first=H |date=1 April 1993|title=The history of the condom | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 86|pages=226–228 | pmid = 7802734|issue=4|pmc=1293956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, the use of penis coverings to protect from disease is described in a wide variety of literature throughout Europe. The first indication that these devices were used for birth control, rather than disease prevention, is the 1605 theological publication ''De iustitia et iure'' (On justice and law) by Catholic theologian [[Leonardus Lessius]], who condemned them as immoral.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|56}} In 1666, the English Birth Rate Commission attributed a recent downward fertility rate to use of "condons", the first documented use of that word (or any similar spelling).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|66–8}} (Other early spellings include "condam" and "quondam", from which the Italian derivation "guantone" has been suggested, from "guanto", "a glove."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=condom |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118222011/http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=condom |archivedate=2017-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[File:Condom 1900.jpg|left|thumb|A condom made from animal intestine circa 1900]]
In addition to linen, condoms during the [[Renaissance]] were made out of intestines and bladder. In the late 16th century, Dutch traders introduced condoms made from "fine leather" to Japan. Unlike the horn condoms used previously, these leather condoms covered the entire penis.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|61}}

[[File:Condoomgebruik in de 19e eeuw.png|right|thumb|170px|[[Giacomo Casanova]] tests his condom for holes by inflating it]]
[[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] in the 18th century was one of the first reported using "assurance caps" to prevent impregnating his mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;Fryer P. (1965) 'the Birth controllers', London: Secker and Warburg and Dingwall EJ. (1953) 'Early contraceptive sheaths' BMJ, Jan 1: 40–1 in Lewis M. 'A Brief history of condoms' in Mindel A. (2000) 'Condoms', BMJ books&lt;/ref&gt;

From at least the 18th century, condom use was opposed in some legal, religious, and medical circles for essentially the same reasons that are given today: condoms reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, which some thought immoral or undesirable for the nation; they do not provide full protection against sexually transmitted infections, while belief in their protective powers was thought to encourage sexual promiscuity; and, they are not used consistently due to inconvenience, expense, or loss of sensation.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|73,86–8,92}}

Despite some opposition, the condom market grew rapidly. In the 18th century, condoms were available in a variety of qualities and sizes, made from either linen treated with chemicals, or "skin" (bladder or intestine softened by treatment with [[sulfur]] and [[lye]]).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|94–5}} They were sold at pubs, barbershops, chemist shops, open-air markets, and at the theater throughout Europe and Russia.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|90–2,97,104}} They later spread to America, although in every place there were generally used only by the middle and upper classes, due to both expense and lack of sex education.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|116–21}}

=== 1800 through 1920s ===
[[File:El Paral·lel 1894-1939- exhibit at CCCB in Barcelona (78).JPG|thumb|An old-fashioned condom package]]
The early 19th century saw contraceptives promoted to the poorer classes for the first time. Writers on contraception tended to prefer other methods of birth control to the condom. By the late 19th century many feminists expressed distrust of the condom as a contraceptive, as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone. They advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women, such as diaphragms and spermicidal douches.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|152–3}} Other writers cited both the expense of condoms and their unreliability (they were often riddled with holes, and often fell off or broke), but they discussed condoms as a good option for some, and as the only contraceptive that also protected from disease.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|88,90,125,129–30}}

Many countries passed laws impeding the manufacture and promotion of contraceptives.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|144,163–4,168–71,193}} In spite of these restrictions, condoms were promoted by traveling lecturers and in newspaper advertisements, using euphemisms in places where such ads were illegal.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|127,130–2,138,146–7}} Instructions on how to make condoms at home were distributed in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|126,136}} Despite social and legal opposition, at the end of the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|173–4}}

[[File:Surgeon Sage Says.jpg|left|thumb|200px|During World War I, the U.S. military was the only one that did not promote condom use. Posters such as these were intended to promote abstinence.]]
Beginning in the second half of the 19th century, American rates of sexually transmitted diseases skyrocketed. Causes cited by historians include effects of the [[American Civil War]], and the ignorance of prevention methods promoted by the [[Comstock laws]].&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|137–8,159}} To fight the growing epidemic, sex education classes were introduced to public schools for the first time, teaching about venereal diseases and how they were transmitted.

The stigma against victims of these diseases was so great that many hospitals refused to treat people who had syphilis.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|176}}

[[File:Condom with manual from 1813.jpg|thumb|400px|Condom (and manual) from 1813]]
The German military was the first to promote condom use among its soldiers, beginning in the later 19th century.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|169,181}} Early 20th century experiments by the American military concluded that providing condoms to soldiers significantly lowered rates of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|180–3}} During [[World War I]], the United States and (at the beginning of the war only) Britain were the only countries with soldiers in Europe who did not provide condoms and promote their use.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|187–90}}

In the decades after World War I, there remained social and legal obstacles to condom use throughout the U.S. and Europe.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|208–10}} Founder of psychoanalysis [[Sigmund Freud]] opposed all methods of birth control on the grounds that their failure rates were too high. Freud was especially opposed to the condom because he thought it cut down on sexual pleasure. Some feminists continued to oppose male-controlled contraceptives such as condoms. In 1920 the Church of England's [[Lambeth Conferences#Sixth Conference (1920)|Lambeth Conference]] condemned all "unnatural means of conception avoidance". London's Bishop [[Arthur Winnington-Ingram]] complained of the huge number of condoms discarded in alleyways and parks, especially after weekends and holidays.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|211–2}}

However, European militaries continued to provide condoms to their members for disease protection, even in countries where they were illegal for the general population.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|213–4}} Through the 1920s, catchy names and slick packaging became an increasingly important marketing technique for many consumer items, including condoms and cigarettes.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|197}} Quality testing became more common, involving filling each condom with air followed by one of several methods intended to detect loss of pressure.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|204,206,221–2}} Worldwide, condom sales doubled in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|210}}

=== Rubber and manufacturing advances ===
In 1839, [[Charles Goodyear]] discovered a way of processing natural [[rubber]], which is too stiff when cold and too soft when warm, in such a way as to make it elastic. This proved to have advantages for the manufacture of condoms; unlike the sheep's gut condoms, they could stretch and did not tear quickly when used. The [[vulcanized rubber|rubber vulcanization]] process was patented by Goodyear in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reprinted from ''India Rubber World'' |title=CHARLES GOODYEAR—The life and discoveries of the inventor of vulcanized India rubber |journal=Scientific American Supplement |issue=787 |publisher=Munn &amp; Co. |location=New York |date=1891-01-31 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14009 |accessdate=2008-06-08 }}&lt;br /&gt;

Besides this type, small rubber condoms covering only the [[glans]] were often used in England and the United States. There was more risk of losing them and if the rubber ring was too tight, it would constrict the penis. This type of condom was the original "capote" (French for condom), perhaps because of its resemblance to a woman's bonnet worn at that time, also called a [[Bonnet (headgear)|capote]].

For many decades, rubber condoms were manufactured by wrapping strips of raw rubber around penis-shaped molds, then dipping the wrapped molds in a chemical solution to cure the rubber.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|148}} In 1912, Polish inventor [[Julius Fromm]] developed a new, improved manufacturing technique for condoms: dipping glass molds into a raw rubber solution.&lt;ref name="billy" /&gt; Called ''cement dipping'', this method required adding gasoline or benzene to the rubber to make it liquid.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|200}} [[Latex]], rubber suspended in water, was invented in 1920. Latex condoms required less labor to produce than cement-dipped rubber condoms, which had to be smoothed by rubbing and trimming. The use of water to suspend the rubber instead of [[gasoline]] and [[benzene]] eliminated the fire hazard previously associated with all condom factories. Latex condoms also performed better for the consumer: they were stronger and thinner than rubber condoms, and had a shelf life of five years (compared to three months for rubber).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|199–200}}

Until the twenties, all condoms were individually hand-dipped by semi-skilled workers. Throughout the decade of the 1920s, advances in the automation of the condom assembly line were made. The first fully automated line was patented in 1930. Major condom manufacturers bought or leased conveyor systems, and small manufacturers were driven out of business.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|201–3}} The skin condom, now significantly more expensive than the latex variety, became restricted to a niche high-end market.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|220}}

=== 1930 to present ===
In 1930 the Anglican Church's [[Lambeth Conferences#Seventh: 1930|Lambeth Conference]] sanctioned the use of birth control by married couples. In 1931 the [[National Council of Churches|Federal Council of Churches]] in the U.S. issued a similar statement.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|227}} The Roman Catholic Church responded by issuing the encyclical ''[[Casti connubii]]'' affirming its opposition to all contraceptives, a stance it has never reversed.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|228–9}} In the 1930s, legal restrictions on condoms began to be relaxed.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|216,226,234}}&lt;ref name="note"&gt;{{cite web |title=Biographical Note |work=The Margaret Sanger Papers |publisher=Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College, Northampton, Mass. |year=1995 |url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html |accessdate=2006-10-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912180741/http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss43_bioghist.html |archivedate=2006-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But during this period [[Italian fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]] increased restrictions on condoms (limited sales as disease preventatives were still allowed).&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|252,254–5}} During the Depression, condom lines by Schmid gained in popularity. Schmid still used the cement-dipping method of manufacture which had two advantages over the latex variety. Firstly, cement-dipped condoms could be safely used with oil-based [[Personal lubricant|lubricants]]. Secondly, while less comfortable, these older-style rubber condoms could be reused and so were more economical, a valued feature in hard times.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|217–9}} More attention was brought to quality issues in the 1930s, and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] began to regulate the quality of condoms sold in the United States.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|223–5}}

Throughout [[World War II]], condoms were not only distributed to male U.S. military members, but also heavily promoted with films, posters, and lectures.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|236–8,259}} European and Asian militaries on both sides of the conflict also provided condoms to their troops throughout the war, even Germany which outlawed all civilian use of condoms in 1941.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|252–4,257–8}} In part because condoms were readily available, soldiers found a number of [[#Other uses|non-sexual uses]] for the devices, many of which continue to this day. After the war, condom sales continued to grow. From 1955–1965, 42% of Americans of reproductive age relied on condoms for birth control. In Britain from 1950–1960, 60% of married couples used condoms. The [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]] became the world's most popular method of birth control in the years after its 1960 début, but condoms remained a strong second. The U.S. [[United States Agency for International Development|Agency for International Development]] pushed condom use in developing countries to help solve the "world population crises": by 1970 hundreds of millions of condoms were being used each year in India alone.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|267–9,272–5}}(This number has grown in recent decades: in 2004, the government of India purchased 1.9 billion condoms for distribution at family planning clinics.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=AP |last=Sharma |title=Annual Report of the Tariff Commission |page=9 |publisher=India government |year=2006 |url=http://tc.nic.in/areports/annualreport-2005-06.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619062117/http://tc.nic.in/areports/annualreport-2005-06.pdf |archivedate=2009-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Etymology and other terms ===
The term ''condom'' first appears in the early 18th century. Its etymology is unknown.
In popular tradition, the invention and naming of the condom came to be attributed to an associate of England's [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], one "Dr. Condom" or "Earl of Condom". There is however no evidence of the existence of such a person, and condoms had been used for over one hundred years before King Charles II ascended to the throne.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|54,68}}

== Society and culture ==

Some [[moral]] and [[scientific]] criticism of condoms exists despite the many benefits of condoms agreed on by [[scientific consensus]] and sexual health experts.

Condom usage is typically recommended for new couples who have yet to develop full trust in their partner with regard to STDs. Established couples on the other hand have few concerns about STDs, and can use other methods of birth control such as [[birth control pill|the pill]], which does not act as a barrier to intimate sexual contact. Note that the polar debate with regard to condom usage is attenuated by the target group the argument is directed. Notably the age category and stable partner question are factors, as well as the distinction between heterosexual and homosexuals, who have different kinds of sex and have different risk consequences and factors.

Among the prime objections to condom usage is the blocking of erotic sensation, or the intimacy that barrier-free sex provides. As the condom is held tightly to the skin of the penis, it diminishes the delivery of stimulation through rubbing and friction. Condom proponents claim this has the benefit of making sex last longer, by diminishing sensation and delaying male ejaculation. Those who promote condom-free heterosexual sex (slang: "[[Bareback (sex)|bareback]]") claim that the condom puts a prophylactic barrier between partners, diminishing what is normally a highly sensual, intimate, and spiritual connection between partners.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] opposes all kinds of sexual acts outside of marriage, as well as any sexual act in which the chance of successful conception has been reduced by [[direct and intentional]] acts (for example, [[Human sterilization|surgery to prevent conception]]) or foreign objects (for example, condoms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanæ Vitæ |author=[[Pope Paul VI]] |date=1968-07-25 |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |accessdate=2009-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xI2Wz6n5?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of condoms to prevent [[Sexually Transmitted Infections|STI]] transmission is not specifically addressed by Catholic doctrine, and is currently a topic of debate among theologians and high-ranking Catholic authorities.

In a November 2011 interview, Pope Benedict XVI discussed for the first time the use of condoms to prevent STI transmission. He said that the use of a condom can be justified in a few individual cases if the purpose is to reduce the risk of an HIV infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Jonathan Wynne-Jones |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/the-pope/8148944/The-Pope-drops-Catholic-ban-on-condoms-in-historic-shift.html |title=The Pope drops Catholic ban on condoms in historic shift |publisher=The Telegraph |date=20 November 2010 |accessdate=20 November 2010 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122052824/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/the-pope/8148944/The-Pope-drops-Catholic-ban-on-condoms-in-historic-shift.html |archivedate=22 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave as an example male prostitutes. There was some confusion at first whether the statement applied only to homosexual prostitutes and thus not to heterosexual intercourse at all. However, [[Federico Lombardi]], spokesman for the Vatican, clarified that it applied to heterosexual and transsexual prostitutes, whether male or female, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/world/europe/24pope.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Rachel | last1=Donadio | first2=Laurie | last2=Goodstein | title=Vatican Confirms Shift on Condoms as AIDS Prevention | date=2010-11-23 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221084914/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/world/europe/24pope.html | archivedate=2017-02-21 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, also clarify that the Vatican's principles on sexuality and contraception had not been changed.

=== Scientific and environmental ===
More generally, some scientific researchers have expressed objective concern over certain ingredients sometimes added to condoms, notably [[talc]] and [[nitrosamine]]s. Dry dusting powders are applied to latex condoms before packaging to prevent the condom from sticking to itself when rolled up. Previously, talc was used by most manufacturers, but [[cornstarch]] is currently the most popular dusting powder.&lt;ref name="fhi4"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Caroline E |title=Chapter 4: Recent Advances in the Research, Development and Manufacture of Latex Rubber Condoms |journal=The Latex Condom: Recent Advances, Future Directions |publisher=Family Health International |url=http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/booksReports/latexcondom/recentadvances.htm |accessdate=2007-04-08 |year=1998 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405095036/http://www.fhi.org/en/RH/Pubs/booksReports/latexcondom/recentadvances.htm |archivedate=2007-04-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Talc is known to be toxic if it enters the abdominal cavity (i.e., via the [[vagina]]). Cornstarch is generally believed to be safe; however, some researchers have raised concerns over its use as well.&lt;ref name="fhi4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wright, H |author2=Wheeler, J |author3=Woods, J |author4=Hesford, J |author5=Taylor, P |author6=Edlich, R |title=Potential toxicity of retrograde uterine passage of particulate matter |journal=J Long Term Eff Med Implants |volume=6 |issue=3–4 |pages=199–206 |year=1996 |pmid=10167361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the large-scale use of disposable condoms has resulted in concerns over their environmental impact via [[littering]] and in [[landfills]], where they can eventually wind up in [[wildlife]] environments if not [[incinerated]] or otherwise permanently disposed of first. Polyurethane condoms in particular, given they are a form of [[plastic]], are not [[biodegradable]], and latex condoms take a very long time to break down. Experts, such as [[AVERT]], recommend condoms be disposed of in a garbage receptacle, as flushing them down the toilet (which some people do) may cause plumbing blockages and other problems.&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmentally-friendly condom disposal |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]] |date=December 20, 2002 |url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2311.html |accessdate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020050953/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/2311.html |archivedate=October 20, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avert.org/condom.htm |title=Using Condoms, Condom Types &amp; Condom Sizes |publisher=AVERT |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621222629/http://www.avert.org/condom.htm |archivedate=2009-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the plastic and foil wrappers condoms are packaged in are also not biodegradable. However, the benefits condoms offer are widely considered to offset their small landfill mass.&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal" /&gt; Frequent condom or wrapper disposal in public areas such as a parks have been seen as a persistent litter problem.&lt;ref name="power"&gt;{{cite web|last=Power |first=Robert |title=The black plastic bag of qualitative research |work=BMJ.com |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/eletters/318/7175/48#1918 |accessdate=2007-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030729223328/http://bmj.com/cgi/eletters/318/7175/48 |archivedate=July 29, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While biodegradable,&lt;ref name="AliceDisposal" /&gt; latex condoms damage the environment when disposed of improperly. According to the Ocean Conservancy, condoms, along with [[marine debris|certain other types of trash]], cover the [[coral reef]]s and smother [[sea grass]] and other bottom dwellers. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] also has expressed concerns that many animals might mistake the litter for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hightower |first1=Eve |last2=Hall |first2=Phoebe |title=Clean sex, wasteful computers and dangerous mascara&amp;nbsp;– Ask E |journal=[[E–The Environmental Magazine]] |date=March–April 2003 |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 |accessdate=2007-10-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227050429/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1594/is_2_14/ai_98469962 |archivedate=2007-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural barriers to use ===
In much of the [[Western world]], the introduction of [[combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]] in the 1960s was associated with a decline in condom use.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|267–9,272–5}} In [[Japan]], oral contraceptives were not approved for use until September 1999, and even then access was more restricted than in other industrialized nations.&lt;ref name="cbs"&gt;{{cite news |author=Hayashi, Aiko |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |title=Japanese Women Shun The Pill |publisher=CBS News |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2006-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629074107/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/20/health/main637523.shtml |archivedate=2006-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps because of this restricted access to hormonal contraception, Japan has the highest rate of condom usage in the world: in 2008, 80% of contraceptive users relied on condoms.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt;

Cultural attitudes toward [[gender roles]], [[contraception]], and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] vary greatly around the world, and range from extremely conservative to extremely liberal. But in places where condoms are misunderstood, mischaracterised, demonised, or looked upon with overall cultural disapproval, the prevalence of condom use is directly affected. In less-developed countries and among less-educated populations, misperceptions about how disease transmission and conception work negatively affect the use of condoms; additionally, in cultures with more traditional gender roles, women may feel uncomfortable demanding that their partners use condoms.

As an example, [[Latino]] immigrants in the United States often face cultural barriers to condom use. A study on female HIV prevention published in the ''Journal of Sex Health Research'' asserts that Latino women often lack the attitudes needed to negotiate safe sex due to traditional gender-role norms in the Latino community, and may be afraid to bring up the subject of condom use with their partners. Women who participated in the study often reported that because of the general [[machismo]] subtly encouraged in Latino culture, their male partners would be angry or possibly [[domestic violence|violent]] at the woman's suggestion that they use condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gomez |first=Cynthia A |year=1996 |title=Gender, Culture, and Power: Barriers to HIV-Prevention Strategies for Women |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=355–362 |author2=Marín |doi=10.1080/00224499609551853 |jstor=3813287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar phenomenon has been noted in a survey of low-income [[African-American|American black]] women; the women in this study also reported a fear of violence at the suggestion to their male partners that condoms be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kalichman |first1=Seth C. | last2 = Williams | first2 = Ernestine A. | last3 = Cherry | first3 = Charsey | last4 = Belcher | first4 = Lisa | last5 = Nachimson | first5 = Dena | title = Sexual coercion, domestic violence, and negotiating condom use among low-income African American women | journal = [[Journal of Women's Health]] | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 371–378 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.1998.7.371 | date = April 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A telephone survey conducted by [[Rand Corporation]] and [[Oregon State University]], and published in the ''[[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]]'' showed that belief in [[AIDS conspiracy theories]] among United States black men is linked to rates of condom use. As conspiracy beliefs about AIDS grow in a given sector of these black men, consistent condom use drops in that same sector. Female use of condoms was not similarly affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sexualhealth.e-healthsource.com/?p=news1&amp;id=523594 |title=AIDS Conspiracy Theory Belief Linked to Less Condom Use |last=Dotinga |first=Randy |publisher=SexualHealth.com |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702133205/http://sexualhealth.e-healthsource.com/?p=news1&amp;id=523594 |archivedate=2010-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the African continent, condom promotion in some areas has been impeded by anti-condom campaigns by some Muslim&lt;ref name="northeast kenya" /&gt; and Catholic clerics.&lt;ref name="catholicafrica" /&gt; Among the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] in [[Tanzania]], condom use is hampered by an aversion to "wasting" sperm, which is given sociocultural importance beyond reproduction. Sperm is believed to be an "elixir" to women and to have beneficial health effects. Maasai women believe that, after conceiving a child, they must have sexual intercourse repeatedly so that the additional sperm aids the child's development. Frequent condom use is also considered by some Maasai to cause impotence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coast |first=Ernestina |year=2007 |title=Wasting semen: context and condom use among the Maasai |journal=Culture, Health, and Sexuality |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2502/1/Wasting_semen-context_and_condom_use_among_the_Maasai(LSERO).pdf |accessdate=2009-07-26 |doi=10.1080/13691050701208474 |pmid=17612958 |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=387–401 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524091500/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/2502/1/Wasting_semen-context_and_condom_use_among_the_Maasai(LSERO).pdf |archivedate=2011-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women in Africa believe that condoms are "for prostitutes" and that respectable women should not use them.&lt;ref name="northeast kenya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74336 |title=Muslim opposition to condoms limits distribution |date=Sep 17, 2007 |publisher=PlusNews |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003165407/http://www.plusnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=74336 |archivedate=2007-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few clerics even promote the idea that condoms are deliberately laced with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pius-kamau/islam-condoms-and-aids_b_120418.html |title=Islam, Condoms and AIDS |last=Kamau |first=Pius |date=August 24, 2008 |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=2009-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115211414/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pius-kamau/islam-condoms-and-aids_b_120418.html |archivedate=November 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, possession of many condoms has been used by police to accuse women of engaging in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guza |first1=Megan |title=Condoms criminalized in Allegheny County prostitution cases |url=http://triblive.com/local/allegheny/13690556-74/condoms-criminalized-in-allegheny-county-prostitution-cases |accessdate=6 June 2018 |publisher=Trib Live |date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Big2014&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-bill-would-bar-condoms-proof-prostitution |title=NY bill would bar condoms as proof of prostitution |last1=KLEPPER |first1=DAVID |date=27 April 2014 |work=Associated Press |accessdate=27 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427210304/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/ny-bill-would-bar-condoms-proof-prostitution |archivedate=27 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS]] has condemned this practice and there are efforts to end it.&lt;ref name=Big2014 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wurth|first=MH|author2=Schleifer, R |author3=McLemore, M |author4=Todrys, KW |author5= Amon, JJ |title=Condoms as evidence of prostitution in the United States and the criminalization of sex work.|journal=Journal of the International AIDS Society|date=May 24, 2013|volume=16|page=18626|pmid=23706178 |pmc=3664300 |doi=10.7448/ias.16.1.18626}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2012/10/07/city-cease-using-condoms-evidence-prostitution-cases |title=City to cease using condoms as evidence in prostitution cases |last1=Chanoff |first1=Yael |date=7 October 2014 |website=www.sfbg.com |publisher=San Francisco Bay Guardian |accessdate=27 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428022226/http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2012/10/07/city-cease-using-condoms-evidence-prostitution-cases |archivedate=28 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, technology mogul [[Bill Gates]] offered a US$100,000 grant through his foundation for a condom design that "significantly preserves or enhances pleasure" to encourage more males to adopt the use of condoms for safer sex. The grant information states: "The primary drawback from the male perspective is that condoms decrease pleasure as compared to no condom, creating a trade-off that many men find unacceptable, particularly given that the decisions about use must be made just prior to intercourse. Is it possible to develop a product without this stigma, or better, one that is felt to enhance pleasure?". The project has been named the "Next Generation Condom" and anyone who can provide a "testable hypothesis" is eligible to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Gates offers $100,000 grant for improved condoms|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/|accessdate=2 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=24 March 2013|author=Jessica Chasmar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504144403/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/mar/24/bill-gates-offers-100000-grant-improved-condoms/|archivedate=4 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle-Eastern couples who have not had children, because of the strong desire and social pressure to establish fertility as soon as possible within marriage, rarely use condoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 3649633|title= The Sociocultural Context of Condom Use Within Marriage in Rural Lebanon|last1= Kulczycki|first1= Andrzej|date= 4 December 2004 |journal=Studies in Family Planning |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=246–260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, India restricted TV advertisements for condoms to between the hours of 10PM to 6AM.

One analyst described the size of the condom market as something that "boggles the mind". Numerous small manufacturers, nonprofit groups, and government-run manufacturing plants exist around the world.&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|322,328}} Within the condom market, there are several major contributors, among them both for-profit businesses and philanthropic organizations. Most large manufacturers have ties to the business that reach back to the end of the 19th century.

A [[spray-on condom]] made of latex is intended to be easier to apply and more successful in preventing the transmission of diseases. {{as of|2009}}, the spray-on condom was not going to market because the drying time could not be reduced below two to three minutes.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news | last = Lefevre | first = Callie | title = Spray-On Condoms: Still a Hard Sell | work = TIME Magazine | date = 2008-08-13 | url = http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1832445,00.html | accessdate = 2009-07-26 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090523103504/http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1832445,00.html | archivedate = 2009-05-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spraytv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sf.tv/var/videoplayer.php?videourl=http%3A%2F%2Freal.xobix.ch%2Framgen%2Fsfdrs%2F10vor10%2F2006%2F10vor10_29112006.rm%3Fstart%3D0%3A23%3A35.732%26amp%3Bend%3D0%3A27%3A02.140 |title=Spray-On-Condom |accessdate=2006-12-03 |publisher=Schweizer Fernsehen News |date=November 29, 2006 |format=streaming video [Real format] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206171909/http://www.sf.tv/var/videoplayer.php?videourl=http%3A%2F%2Freal.xobix.ch%2Framgen%2Fsfdrs%2F10vor10%2F2006%2F10vor10_29112006.rm%3Fstart%3D0%3A23%3A35.732%26amp%3Bend%3D0%3A27%3A02.140 |archivedate=December 6, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spray"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spraykondom.de/spraycondom/index.php? |title=Spray-On-Condom |accessdate=2006-12-03 |publisher=Institut für Kondom-Beratung |year=2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211204724/http://www.spraykondom.de/spraycondom/index.php |archivedate=2006-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Invisible Condom, developed at [[Université Laval]] in Quebec, Canada, is a gel that hardens upon increased temperature after insertion into the vagina or rectum. In the lab, it has been shown to effectively block HIV and herpes simplex virus. The barrier breaks down and liquefies after several hours. {{as of|2005}}, the invisible condom is in the clinical trial phase, and has not yet been approved for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Safety, Tolerance and Acceptability Trial of the Invisible Condom in Healthy Women |work=ClinicalTrials.gov |publisher=U.S. National Institutes of Health |date=August 2005 |url=http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 |accessdate=2006-08-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829080802/http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/gui/show/NCT00136643?order=6 |archivedate=2006-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also developed in 2005 is a condom treated with an erectogenic compound. The drug-treated condom is intended to help the wearer maintain his erection, which should also help reduce slippage. If approved, the condom would be marketed under the Durex brand. {{as of|2007}}, it was still in [[clinical trials]].&lt;ref name="collier" /&gt;{{Rp|345}} In 2009, Ansell Healthcare, the makers of Lifestyle condoms, introduced the X2 condom lubricated with "Excite Gel" which contains the amino acid l-arginine and is intended to improve the strength of the erectile response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifestyles.com/condoms.php |title=Condoms: Lifestyles Condoms |publisher=Lifestyles.com |accessdate=2012-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109010100/http://www.lifestyles.com/condoms.php |archivedate=2011-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">'''Condoms, needles, and negotiation''', also known as the '''CNN approach''', is a [[harm reduction]] approach to reducing the rate of transmission of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s such as [[HIV/AIDS]] by:
* Providing [[condom]]s and teaching [[negotiation]] of [[safer sex]] with partners
* Providing clean needles to reduce transmission from [[drug injection|injection drug use]]

In contrast with the [[abstinence, be faithful, use a condom]], or "ABC" approach to this problem, the "CNN" approach aims primarily at reducing the rate of transmission among high-risk groups such as women in areas where women have low levels of social power, prostitutes and their clients, and intravenous drug users.

==Criticisms==
Pope [[Benedict XVI]] has strongly criticized reduction policies with regards to HIV/AIDS, saying that "it is a tragedy that cannot be overcome by money alone, that cannot be overcome through the distribution of condoms, which even aggravates the problems".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1012144/Condoms-'not-the-answer-to-AIDS':-Pope Condoms 'not the answer to AIDS': Pope]&lt;/ref&gt; This position has been widely criticised for misrepresenting and oversimplifying the role of condoms in preventing infections.&lt;ref&gt;The papal position on condoms and HIV. Douglas Kamerow, BMJ 2009 338: b1217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roehr, B. (2009). Pope claims that condoms exacerbate HIV and AIDS problem. Published 25 March 2009, {{doi|10.1136/bmj.b1206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experts, including the Director of Harvard University's AIDS Prevention Research Project, have supported the Pope's position.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5987155.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ultrasound of human fetus, 8 weeks and 1 day.jpg|thumb|An ultrasound showing a fetus measured to have a crown-rump length of 1.67 cm, and estimated to have a gestational age of 8 weeks and 1 day]]

'''Crown-rump length''' ('''CRL''') is the measurement of the length of human [[embryo]]s and [[fetus]]es from the top of the head (crown) to the bottom of the buttocks (rump). It is typically determined from [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasound imagery]] and can be used to estimate [[gestational age]].

==Measuring==
[[File:Crown-rump length by gestational age.png|thumb|300px|Diagram showing crown-rump length by [[gestational age]]. The blue line is the [[mean]] and the green area delimits the 3rd versus the 97th [[percentile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ohuma EO, Papageorghiou AT, Villar J, Altman DG |title=Estimation of gestational age in early pregnancy from crown-rump length when gestational age range is truncated: the case study of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project |journal=BMC Med Res Methodol |volume=13 |issue= |pages=151 |year=2013 |pmid=24314232 |pmc=4029763 |doi=10.1186/1471-2288-13-151 |url=}}
&lt;br&gt;Crown rump length before a gestational age of 9 weeks is extrapolated by assuming a crown rump length of 0 at a gestational age of 2 weeks, corresponding to an [[:en:embryonic age|embryonic age]] of 0 weeks. This extrapolated part is blurred because of uncertain values.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The embryo and fetus float in the [[amniotic fluid]] inside the [[uterus]] of the mother usually in a curved posture resembling the letter ''C''. The measurement can actually vary slightly if the fetus is temporarily stretching (straightening) its body. The measurement needs to be in the natural state with an unstretched body which is actually ''C'' shaped. The measurement of CRL is useful in determining the [[gestational age]] (menstrual age starting from the first day of the last menstrual period) and thus the expected date of delivery (EDD). Different babies do grow at different rates and thus the gestational age is an approximation. Recent evidence has indicated that CRL growth (and thus the approximation of gestational age) may be influenced by maternal factors such as age, [[Smoking and pregnancy|smoking]], and folic acid intake. Early in [[pregnancy]] it is accurate within +/- 4 days but later in pregnancy due to different growth rates, the accuracy is less. In that situation, other parameters can be used in addition to CRL. The length of the [[umbilical cord]] is approximately equal to the CRL throughout pregnancy.

Gestational age is not the same as fertilization age. It takes about 14 days from the first day of the last menstrual period for [[Conception (biology)|conception]] to take place and thus for the [[conceptus]] to form. The age from this point in time (conception) is called the fertilization age and is thus 2 weeks shorter than the gestational age. Thus a 6-week gestational age would be a 4-week fertilization age. Some authorities however casually interchange these terms {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} and the reader is advised to be cautious. An average gestational period (duration of pregnancy from the first day of the last menstrual period up to delivery) is 280 days. On average, this is 9 months and 6 days.

===Typical measurements===
{| border="1"
|+ Gestational Age for CRL
! Age !! CRL 
|-
| 6.1 Weeks: || 0.45&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 7.1 Weeks: || 1.0&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 8.0 Weeks: || 1.9&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 9.2 Weeks: || 2.15&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
|9.6 Weeks: ||2.9&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 10.5 Weeks: || 4.0&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 12.2 Weeks: || 5.5&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 13.2 Weeks: || 6.90&amp;nbsp;cm
|-
| 14.0 Weeks: || 8.0&amp;nbsp;cm

|}

The following formula is an approximation that can be used up to 14 weeks of gestational age, with CRL in [[millimetre|mm]] and gestational age in days:&lt;ref name="LoughnaChitty2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loughna|first1=Pam|last2=Chitty|first2=Lyn|last3=Evans|first3=Tony|last4=Chudleigh|first4=Trish|title=Fetal Size and Dating: Charts Recommended for Clinical Obstetric Practice|journal=Ultrasound|volume=17|issue=3|year=2009|pages=160–166|issn=1742-271X|doi=10.1179/174313409X448543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gestational age = (CRL x 1.037)&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; x 8.052 + 23.73

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7979">'''Dignity of risk''' is the idea that [[self-determination]] and the right to take reasonable risks are essential for [[dignity]] and [[self esteem]] and so should not be impeded by excessively-cautious [[caregiver]]s, concerned about their [[duty of care]]. The concept is applicable to adults who are under care such as [[elderly care|elderly]] people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-22/risky-activities-could-improve-quality-of-life-for-elderly/6939166 |author=Norman Hermant |title=Dignity of Risk: Elderly should be allowed to do 'risky' activities to improve lifestyle, professor says - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2015-11-22 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[disability |disabled]] people,&lt;ref name=Coda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codasouth.org/807-2/ |title=Duty of Care and Dignity of Risk - Coda South - Choice. Opportunity. Diversity. Ability |publisher=Coda South |date=2013-09-15 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people with [[mental health]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Parsons |url=http://www.openforum.com.au/dignity-of-risk-the-right-to-self-governance-for-people-with-mental-illness/ |title=Dignity of Risk: The right to self-governance for people with mental illness |publisher=Openforum |date= |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The concept was first articulated in a 1972 article ''The dignity of risk and the mentally retarded'' by Robert Perske:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Overprotection may appear on the surface to be kind, but it can be really evil. An oversupply can smother people emotionally, squeeze the life out of their hopes and expectations, and strip them of their dignity. Overprotection can keep people from becoming all they could become. Many of our best achievements came the hard way: We took risks, fell flat, suffered, picked ourselves up, and tried again. Sometimes we made it and sometimes we did not. Even so, we were given the chance to try. Persons with special needs need these chances, too. Of course, we are talking about prudent risks. People should not be expected to blindly face challenges that, without a doubt, will explode in their faces. Knowing which chances are prudent and which are not – this is a new skill that needs to be acquired. On the other hand, a risk is really only when it is not known beforehand whether a person can succeed. The real world is not always safe, secure, and predictable, it does not always say “please,” “excuse me”, or “I’m sorry”. Every day we face the possibility of being thrown into situations where we will have to risk everything … In the past, we found clever ways to build avoidance of risk into the lives of persons living with disabilities. Now we must work equally hard to help find the proper amount of risk these people have the right to take. We have learned that there can be healthy development in risk taking and there can be crippling indignity in safety!&lt;ref name=Perske&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perske|first1=R|title=The dignity of risk and the mentally retarded.|journal=Mental retardation|date=February 1972|volume=10|issue=1|pages=24–7|pmid=5059995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conflict with duty of care==
{{expand section|date=July 2017}}
Allowing people under care to take risks is often perceived to be in conflict with the caregivers' [[duty of care]]. Finding a balance between these competing considerations can be difficult when formulating policies and guidelines for caregiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interchangewa.org.au/opinion/duty-care-dignity-risk/ |title=Duty of care and the dignity of risk &amp;#124; Interchange |publisher=Interchangewa.org.au |date=2016-05-04 |author=Wendel Bamford |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coda/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perske/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianageingagenda.com.au/2016/05/11/balancing-act-dignity-risk-vs-duty-care/ |author=Jackie Keast |title=A balancing act: dignity of risk vs. duty of care |publisher=Australian Ageing Agenda |date=2016-05-11 |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ibrahim|first1=Joseph E|last2=Davis|first2=Marie-Claire|title=Impediments to applying the ‘dignity of risk’ principle in residential aged care services|journal=Australasian Journal on Ageing|date=September 2013|volume=32|issue=3|pages=188–193|doi=10.1111/ajag.12014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems of overprotection==
[[File:Wheelchair rugby game 2.jpg|thumb|[[Wheelchair rugby]] is a [[contact sport|full contact sport]] played by wheelchair users. In spite of the protective features of the wheelchairs, the risk of injury is significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bauerfeind|first1=Joanna|last2=Koper|first2=Magdalena|last3=Wieczorek|first3=Jacek|last4=Urbański|first4=Piotr|last5=Tasiemski|first5=Tomasz|title=Sports Injuries in Wheelchair Rugby – A Pilot Study|journal=Journal of Human Kinetics|date=1 January 2015|volume=48|issue=1|doi=10.1515/hukin-2015-0098}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Overprotection of people with disabilities causes low [[self-esteem]] and underachievement because of lowered expectations that come with overprotection. Internalisation of low expectations causes the disabled person to believe that they are less capable than others in similar situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanders|first1=KY|title=Overprotection and lowered expectations of persons with disabilities: the unforeseen consequences.|journal=Work (Reading, Mass.)|date=2006|volume=27|issue=2|pages=181–8|pmid=16971765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In elderly people, overprotection can result in learned dependency and a decreased ability for [[self-care]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennie|first1=David C.|title=Preventive care for elderly people|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, Angleterre|isbn=9780521436298|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It is possible to deliver physical care that has positive outcomes and returns a person to full function, yet, if during that care they have not been involved, allowed to make choices and respectfully assisted with activities of daily living, it may be possible to cause psychological damage through undermining that person's dignity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fenton|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Mitchell|first2=Theresa|title=growing old with dignity: a concept analysis|journal=Nursing Older People|date=June 2002|volume=14|issue=4|pages=19–21|doi=10.7748/nop2002.06.14.4.19.c2212|pmid=12094515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Independent living ==
The right to fail and the dignity of risk is one of the basic tenets of the philosophy of the [[independent living|independent living movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deegan|first1=Patricia E.|title=The Independent Living Movement and people with psychiatric disabilities: Taking back control over our own lives.|journal=Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal|date=1992|volume=15|issue=3|pages=3–19|doi=10.1037/h0095769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ==
The first of eight "guiding principles" of the United Nations' [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] states: "Respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy including the freedom to make one’s own choices, and independence of persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guiding Principles of the Convention |publisher=United Nations - Division for Social Policy and Development |url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/disabilities/convention-on-the-rights-of-persons-with-disabilities/guiding-principles-of-the-convention.html|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42102">The '''Global Burden of Disease Study''' ('''GBD''') is a comprehensive regional and global research program of [[disease burden]] that assesses [[death|mortality]] and [[disability]] from major diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s. GBD is a collaboration of over 1,800 researchers from 127 countries. Under principal investigator [[Christopher J.L. Murray]], GBD is based out of the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] (IHME) at the [[University of Washington]] and funded by the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does a $100 million public health data revolution look like?|url=http://www.tedmed.com/talks/show?id=17751|website=TEDMED}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Global Burden of Disease Study began in 1990 as a single [[World Bank]]-commissioned&lt;ref name="sign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/announcement/institute-health-metrics-and-evaluation-and-world-health-organization-sign-new |title=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and World Health Organization sign new agreement |publisher=[[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] |accessdate=January 29, 2017 |date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; study, now called GBD 1990.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt; The original project quantified the health effects of more than 100 diseases and injuries for eight regions of the world, giving estimates of [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] by age, sex, and region. It also introduced the [[disability-adjusted life year]] (DALY) as a new metric to quantify the burden of diseases, injuries, and [[risk factor]]s,&lt;ref name="pruss-ustun2003"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Annette|last1=Prüss-Üstün|first2=C.|last2=Mathers|first3=Carlos|last3=Corvalán|first4=A.|last4=Woodward|title=Assessing the environmental burden of disease at national and local levels: Introduction and methods|year=2003|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=9241546204|series=WHO Environmental Burden of Disease Series|volume=1|url=http://www.who.int/quantifying_ehimpacts/publications/9241546204/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutgbd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/about/en/index.html|title=About the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) project|work=Health statistics and health information systems|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="globalburden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/global_burden_of_disease/en/|title=Global burden of disease|publisher=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; to aid comparisons. GBD 1990 was "institutionalized" at the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the research was "conducted mainly by researchers at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and WHO".&lt;ref name="sign" /&gt;

In 2000–2002, the 1990 study was updated by WHO to include a more extensive analysis using a framework known as ''comparative risk factor assessment''.&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;

The WHO estimates were again updated for 2004 in ''The global burden of disease: 2004 update'' (published in 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GBD_report_2004update_full.pdf |title=''The global burden of disease: 2004 update'' |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Global health risks'' (published in 2009).&lt;ref name="aboutgbd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/global_burden_disease/GlobalHealthRisks_report_Front.pdf |title=''Global health risks: mortality and burden of disease attributable to selected major risks'' |year=2009 |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==

The GBD has three specific aims:

#To systematically incorporate information on non-fatal outcomes into the assessment of the health status (using a time-based measure of healthy years of life lost due either to premature mortality or to years lived with a disability, weighted by the severity of that disability)
#To ensure that all estimates and projections were derived on the basis of objective epidemiological and demographic methods, which were not influenced by advocates.
#To measure the burden of disease using a metric that could also be used to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions. The metric chosen was the DALY.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The burden of disease can be viewed as the gap between current health status and an ideal situation in which everyone lives into old age free of disease and disability. Causes of the gap are premature mortality, disability and exposure to certain risk factors that contribute to illness.

==Results==

The 2013 report showed that global [[life expectancy]] for both sexes increased from 65.3 years in 1990, to 71.5 years in 2013,&lt;ref name="Lancet2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators| date=2014|title=Global, regional, and national age–sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|journal=The Lancet|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–171|issn=0140-6736|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmid=25530442|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the number of deaths increased from 47.5 million to 54.9 million over the same interval.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; Progress varied widely across [[demographic]] and national groups. Reductions in age-standardised death rates for [[cardiovascular diseases]] and [[cancers]] in high-income regions, and reductions in child deaths from [[diarrhoea]], [[lower respiratory infections]] and neonatal causes in low-income regions drove the changes. [[HIV/AIDS]] reduced life expectancy in southern [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

For most communicable causes of death both numbers of deaths and age-standardised death rates fell, while for most non-communicable causes, demographic shifts increased numbers of deaths but decreased age-standardised death rates.

Global deaths from injury increased by 10.7%, from 4.3 million deaths in 1990 to 4.8 million in 2013; but age-standardised rates declined over the same period by 21%.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt; For some causes of more than 100,000 deaths per year in 2013, age-standardised death rates increased between 1990 and 2013, including HIV/AIDS, [[pancreatic cancer]], [[atrial fibrillation]] and flutter, drug use disorders, [[diabetes]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell anaemias]]. Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, neonatal causes and malaria remain in the top five causes of death in children younger than 5 years. The most important [[pathogens]] are [[rotavirus]] for diarrhoea and [[pneumococcus]] for lower respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Lancet2014" /&gt;

GBD 2015 found that for the first time, annual deaths from [[measles]] had fallen below 100,000 in 2013 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.plos.org/speakingofmedicine/2016/11/16/vaccinations-vaccine-science-and-a-new-us-president/ |title=Vaccinations, Vaccine Science, and a New US President {{!}} Speaking of Medicine |publisher=[[PLOS]] |date=November 17, 2016 |accessdate=January 31, 2017 |author=Peter Hotez |quote=Those results include new findings just released by the Gates Foundation-supported Global Burden of Disease 2015 Mortality and Causes of Death Collaborators that found a 75 percent reduction in global measles mortality over the last decade such that (for the first time ever) fewer than 100,000 children died from measles in 2013 and 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl3&amp;pii=S0140673614616822 |title=Table 3: Selected causes of global child deaths in 1990 and 2013 |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableImage?tableId=tbl5&amp;pii=S0140673616310121 |title=Table 5: Global deaths in 2005 and 2015 for all ages and both sexes combined and age-standardised death rates, with percentage change between 2005 and 2015 for 249 causes |accessdate=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also found that the global annual rate of new HIV infections has largely stayed the same during the past 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/global-rate-of-new-hiv-infections-hasn-t-fallen-in-a-decade-1.20305 |publisher=Nature News &amp; Comment |title=Global rate of new HIV infections hasn't fallen in a decade |accessdate=February 2, 2017 |author=Nisha Gaind |date=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GBD 2015 also introduced the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) as a measure of a location's socio-demographic development that takes into account average income per person, educational attainment, and [[total fertility rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/global-burden-disease-study-2015-gbd-2015-socio-demographic-index-sdi-1980%E2%80%932015 |title=Global Burden of Disease Study 2015 (GBD 2015) Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) 1980–2015 |website=GHDx |accessdate=February 7, 2017 |publisher=[[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/09/there-s-a-new-ranking-of-the-healthiest-countries-how-is-yours-doing/ |title=There's a new ranking of the healthiest countries.

Denis McGarry]] and [[Joseph J. Katz|Joseph Katz]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=J.|last2=McGarry|first2=J. D.|date=December 1, 1984|title=The glucose paradox.

The glucose paradox demonstrates the importance of the chemical compound [[lactic acid]] in the biochemical process of [[carbohydrate metabolism]]. The paradox is that the large amount of glycogen (10%) found in the liver cannot be explained by the liver's small absorption of glucose. After the body's digestion of [[Carbohydrate|carbohydrates]] and the entering the [[circulatory system]] in the form of glucose, some will be absorbed directly into the [[muscle tissue]] and will be converted into lactic acid throughout the [[Anaerobic energy|anaerobic energy system]], rather than going directly to the liver and being converted into glycogen. The lactic acid is then taken and converted by the liver, forming the material for [[Liver glycogen phosphorylase|liver glycogen]]. The majority of the body's liver glycogen is produced indirectly, rather than directly from glucose in the [[blood]]. Under normal [[Physiological condition|physiological conditions]], glucose is a poor [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] compound and use by the liver is limited.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Joesph|last2=Kuwajima|first2=Masamichi|last3=Foster|first3=David W.|last4=McGarry|first4=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6380">The '''Grossman model of health demand''' is a model for studying the demand for health and medical care outlined by [[Michael Grossman (economist)|Michael Grossman]] in a monograph in 1972 entitled: ''The demand for health: A theoretical and empirical investigation''. The model based demand for medical care on the interaction between a demand function for health and a production function for health. Andrew Jones, Nigel Rice, and Paul Contoyannis call the model the "founding father of demand for health models".&lt;ref name="JRC2012"&gt;Jones, Andrew M. Rice, Nigel, and Contoyannis, Paul. ''The Dynamics of Health'' in Jones, Andrew M., ed. The Elgar companion to health economics. Edward Elgar Publishing, 2012. p15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model==
In this model, health is a durable capital good which is inherited and depreciates over time. Investment in health takes the form of medical care purchases and other inputs and depreciation is interpreted as natural deterioration of health over time.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman 1972&lt;/ref&gt; In the model, health enters the utility function directly as a good people derive pleasure from and indirectly as an investment which makes more healthy time available for market and non-market activities.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

The model creates a dynamic system of equations which can be cast as an optimization problem where utility is optimized over gross investment in health in each period, consumption of medical care, and time inputs in the gross investment function in each period. In this way, the length of life of the agent is partially endogenous to the model.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

Dynamic optimization problems are often optimized using comparative statics, setting partial derivatives of the outcome function of interest, in this case the utility function, equal to zero. When the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to health consumption is assumed to equal zero, the resulting sub-model is the investment model. Solutions to the problem of this sub-model generally show that the rate of return on health capital must equal the opportunity cost of said capital. Thus, increases in the depreciation rate over time cause the optimal stock of health to decrease. If the marginal efficiency of capital curve is inelastic, gross investment grows over time. In practical terms, this model thus predicts that older people will have more sick time and time spent on increasing health and have higher medical expenditures than younger people. Another implication is that since increases in wages shift the marginal efficiency of capital curve to the right and increases the curve's slope, an increase in wage will increase the demand for health capital.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

==Theoretical expansions==
The Grossman model was extended in a number of directions. Among the first to include uncertainty in the model were Charles Phelps and Maureen Cropper.&lt;ref&gt;Phelps, Charles E. "Demand for reimbursement insurance." In The role of health insurance in the health services sector, pp. 115-162. NBER, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cropper, Maureen L. "Health, investment in health, and occupational choice." Journal of Political Economy 85, no. 6 (1977): 1273-1294.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between education and health was expanded in the model by Isaac Ehrlich.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Isaac. On the interaction between education and health and the concept of human capital. Mimeo., Jan, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the relationship between education and medical care demand, one important question is whether the marginal efficiency of capital elasticity with respect to education is less than or greater than one. If the curve is elastic (elasticity greater than one), education will increase medical care demand. On the other hand, if the curve is inelastic, education will decrease medical care demand.&lt;ref name="JRC2012"/&gt;

Jan Acton expanded the time constraint by including travel and waiting time in health care.&lt;ref&gt;Acton, Jan Paul. "Nonmonetary factors in the demand for medical services: some empirical evidence." Journal of Political Economy 83, no. 3 (1975): 595-614.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman1982"&gt;Grossman 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical estimation==
Important empirical studies into these components include the RAND Health Insurance Study led by [[Joseph Newhouse]] in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. This study sought to estimate income, money price, and time price elasticities of demand for medical care.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Willard G., Joseph P. Newhouse, Naihua Duan, Emmett B. Keeler, and Arleen Leibowitz. "Health insurance and the demand for medical care: evidence from a randomized experiment." The American economic review (1987): 251-277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman1982"/&gt; Another important study was the Oregon Health Insurance in the late 2000s and also estimated the role of public health provision on healthcare demand and was led by [[Katherine Baicker]] and [[Amy Finkelstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, Amy, Sarah Taubman, Bill Wright, Mira Bernstein, Jonathan Gruber, Joseph P. Newhouse, Heidi Allen, Katherine Baicker, and Oregon Health Study Group. "The Oregon health insurance experiment: evidence from the first year." The Quarterly journal of economics 127, no. 3 (2012): 1057-1106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In the model, health is neither a pure investment good nor a pure consumption good, but health stock benefits the agent in two ways, directly increasing utility and second by increasing healthy time available for other activities. One early criticism is that framing health as a dicotomous concept is intuitively wrong in that health is simultaneously both and health provides both alternatives simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Muurinen, Jaana-Marja. "Demand for health: a generalised Grossman model." Journal of Health economics 1, no. 1 (1982): 5-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Signs and symptoms of HIV/AIDS}}
There are three main stages of HIV infection: acute infection, clinical latency and AIDS.&lt;ref name=AIDS2010GOV/&gt;

=== Acute infection ===
[[File:Symptoms of acute HIV infection.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|alt=A diagram of a human torso labelled with the most common symptoms of an acute HIV infection|Main symptoms of acute HIV infection]]
The initial period following the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV, primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome.&lt;ref name=M121/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; Many individuals develop an [[influenza-like illness]] or a [[Infectious mononucleosis|mononucleosis-like illness]] 2–4 weeks after exposure while others have no significant symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diseases and disorders|year=2008|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=Tarrytown, NY|isbn=978-0-7614-7771-6|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HRJOElZch8C&amp;pg=PA25 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; Symptoms occur in 40–90% of cases and most commonly include [[fever]], [[lymphadenopathy|large tender lymph nodes]], [[pharyngitis|throat inflammation]], a [[rash]], headache, tiredness, and/or sores of the mouth and genitals.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; The rash, which occurs in 20–50% of cases, presents itself on the trunk and is [[maculopapular]], classically.&lt;ref name=Deut2010/&gt; Some people also develop [[opportunistic infections]] at this stage.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting or [[diarrhea]] may occur.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; Neurological symptoms of [[peripheral neuropathy]] or [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] also occurs.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; The duration of the symptoms varies, but is usually one or two weeks.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt;

Due to their [[Nonspecific symptoms#Types|nonspecific]] character, these symptoms are not often [[Medical diagnosis#Pattern recognition|recognized]] as signs of HIV infection.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; --&gt; Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many common [[infectious disease]]s with overlapping symptoms.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; --&gt; Thus, it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting with an [[Fever of unknown origin|unexplained fever]] who may have risk factors for the infection.&lt;ref name=M118&gt;Mandell, Bennett, and Dolan (2010). Chapter 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical latency ===

{{Risk of acquiring HIV}}
HIV is transmitted by three main routes: [[human sexual activity|sexual contact]], significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding (known as [[vertical transmission]]).&lt;ref name=TransmissionM2007/&gt; There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to [[feces]], nasal secretions, saliva, [[sputum]], sweat, tears, urine, or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood.&lt;ref name=AFP2007k&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kripke C | title = Antiretroviral prophylaxis for occupational exposure to HIV | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 76 | issue = 3 | pages = 375–6 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17708137 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to be [[Coinfection|co-infected]] by more than one strain of HIV—a condition known as [[HIV superinfection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Kuyl AC, Cornelissen M | title = Identifying HIV-1 dual infections | journal = Retrovirology | volume = 4 | pages = 67 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17892568 | pmc = 2045676 | doi = 10.1186/1742-4690-4-67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual ===
&lt;!--Overview --&gt;
The most frequent mode of transmission of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person.&lt;ref name=TransmissionM2007/&gt; Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via [[Heterosexuality|sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex]];&lt;ref name=TransmissionM2007/&gt; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. {{as of|2014}}, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among [[men who had sex with men]] (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses).&lt;ref name=CDC2016Bi/&gt; In the US, gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay and bisexual men.&lt;ref name=CDC2016Bi&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among Gay and Bisexual Men|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/group/msm/cdc-hiv-msm.pdf|access-date=1 January 2017|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161218225712/https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/group/msm/cdc-hiv-msm.pdf|archive-date=December 18, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 15% of gay and bisexual men have HIV while 28% of transgender women test positive in the US.&lt;ref name=CDC2016Bi/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDC2016Today/&gt;

[[HIV]] is the cause of the spectrum of disease known as HIV/AIDS. HIV is a [[retrovirus]] that primarily infects components of the human [[immune system]] such as CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cells, [[macrophage]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. It directly and indirectly destroys CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cells.&lt;ref name=Alimonti&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alimonti JB, Ball TB, Fowke KR | title = Mechanisms of CD4+ T lymphocyte cell death in human immunodeficiency virus infection and AIDS | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 84 | issue = Pt 7 | pages = 1649–61 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12810858 | doi = 10.1099/vir.0.19110-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV is now known to spread between CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cells by two parallel routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang C, Zhou S, Groppelli E, Pellegrino P, Williams I, Borrow P, Chain BM, Jolly C | title = Hybrid spreading mechanisms and T cell activation shape the dynamics of HIV-1 infection | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = e1004179 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25837979 | pmc = 4383537 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004179 | arxiv = 1503.08992 | bibcode = 2015PLSCB..11E4179Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter.&lt;ref name="Zhang"/&gt; HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread.&lt;ref name=Jolly&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jolly C, Kashefi K, Hollinshead M, Sattentau QJ | title = HIV-1 cell to cell transfer across an Env-induced, actin-dependent synapse | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 199 | issue = 2 | pages = 283–93 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14734528 | pmc = 2211771 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20030648 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sattentau&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sattentau Q | title = Avoiding the void: cell-to-cell spread of human viruses | journal = Nature Reviews.

Two [[Subtypes of HIV|types of HIV]] have been characterized: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is the virus that was originally discovered (and initially referred to also as LAV or HTLV-III). It is more [[virulence|virulent]], more [[infectivity|infective]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilbert PB, McKeague IW, Eisen G, Mullins C, Guéye-NDiaye A, Mboup S, Kanki PJ | title = Comparison of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infectivity from a prospective cohort study in Senegal | journal = Statistics in Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 4 | pages = 573–93 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12590415 | doi = 10.1002/sim.1342 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally. The lower infectivity of HIV-2 as compared with HIV-1 implies that fewer people exposed to HIV-2 will be infected per exposure. Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission, HIV-2 is largely confined to [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name="Reeves"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reeves JD, Doms RW | title = Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 | journal = The Journal of General Virology | volume = 83 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1253–65 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12029140 | doi = 10.1099/0022-1317-83-6-1253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hiv replication cycle.gif|thumb|upright=1.4|HIV replication cycle]]

After the virus enters the body there is a period of rapid [[viral replication]], leading to an abundance of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood.&lt;ref name=Piatak&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piatak M, Saag MS, Yang LC, Clark SJ, Kappes JC, Luk KC, Hahn BH, Shaw GM, Lifson JD | title = High levels of HIV-1 in plasma during all stages of infection determined by competitive PCR | journal = Science | volume = 259 | issue = 5102 | pages = 1749–54 | date = March 1993 | pmid = 8096089 | doi = 10.1126/science.8096089 | bibcode = 1993Sci...259.1749P }}&lt;/ref&gt; This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. The acute [[viremia]] is almost invariably associated with activation of [[cytotoxic T cell|CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells]], which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or [[seroconversion]]. The CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell counts recover. A good CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.&lt;ref name=Pantaleo1998&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pantaleo G, Demarest JF, Schacker T, Vaccarezza M, Cohen OJ, Daucher M, Graziosi C, Schnittman SS, Quinn TC, Shaw GM, Perrin L, Tambussi G, Lazzarin A, Sekaly RP, Soudeyns H, Corey L, Fauci AS | title = The qualitative nature of the primary immune response to HIV infection is a prognosticator of disease progression independent of the initial level of plasma viremia | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 254–8 | date = January 1997 | pmid = 8990195 | pmc = 19306 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.1.254 | bibcode = 1997PNAS...94..254P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, HIV causes AIDS by depleting [[T helper cell|CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells]]. This weakens the immune system and allows [[opportunistic infection]]s. T cells are essential to the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells.

During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the immune system to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Deenan |last=Pillay |first2=Anna Maria |last2=Genetti |first3=Robin A. |last3=Weiss|editor-first=Arie J. |editor-last=Zuckerman |display-editors=etal  |title=Principles and practice of clinical virology |year=2007|publisher=Wiley|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=978-0-470-51799-4|page=905 |chapter=Human Immunodeficiency Viruses |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4il2mF7JG1sC&amp;pg=PA905|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected, the bulk of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection, especially in the intestinal mucosa, which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body.&lt;ref name="pmid15365095"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mehandru S, Poles MA, Tenner-Racz K, Horowitz A, Hurley A, Hogan C, Boden D, Racz P, Markowitz M | title = Primary HIV-1 infection is associated with preferential depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes from effector sites in the gastrointestinal tract | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 200 | issue = 6 | pages = 761–70 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15365095 | pmc = 2211967 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20041196 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the preferential loss of mucosal CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells is that the majority of mucosal CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells express the [[CCR5]] protein which HIV uses as a [[co-receptor]] to gain access to the cells, whereas only a small fraction of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells in the bloodstream do so.&lt;ref name="pmid15365096"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brenchley JM, Schacker TW, Ruff LE, Price DA, Taylor JH, Beilman GJ, Nguyen PL, Khoruts A, Larson M, Haase AT, Douek DC | title = CD4+ T cell depletion during all stages of HIV disease occurs predominantly in the gastrointestinal tract | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 200 | issue = 6 | pages = 749–59 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15365096 | pmc = 2211962 | doi = 10.1084/jem.20040874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[CCR5#CCR5-Δ32|specific genetic change]] that alters the [[CCR5]] protein when present in both [[chromosomes]] very effectively prevents HIV-1 infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olson WC, Jacobson JM | title = CCR5 monoclonal antibodies for HIV-1 therapy | journal = Current Opinion in HIV and AIDS | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 104–11 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19339948 | pmc = 2760828 | doi = 10.1097/COH.0b013e3283224015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV/AIDS is diagnosed via laboratory testing and then staged based on the presence of [[AIDS defining clinical condition|certain signs or symptoms]].&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; HIV screening is recommended by the [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] for all people 15&amp;nbsp;years to 65&amp;nbsp;years of age including all pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moyer VA | title = Screening for HIV: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement | journal = Annals of Internal Medicine | volume = 159 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–60 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23698354 | doi = 10.7326/0003-4819-159-1-201307020-00645 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness.&lt;ref name=Deut2010/&gt; In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.&lt;ref name=Deut2010/&gt;

=== HIV testing ===
Most people infected with HIV develop specific [[antibodies]] (i.e. [[seroconversion|seroconvert]]) within three to twelve weeks after the initial infection.&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; Diagnosis of primary HIV before seroconversion is done by measuring HIV-[[RNA]] or [[P24 antigen#Antigen tests|p24 antigen]].&lt;ref name=M118/&gt; Positive results obtained by antibody or [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by PCR.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;

Antibody tests in children younger than 18&amp;nbsp;months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of [[Maternal Passive Immunity#Naturally acquired passive immunity|maternal antibodies]].&lt;ref name=ChildDiag2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kellerman S, Essajee S | title = HIV testing for children in resource-limited settings: what are we waiting for? | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = e1000285 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20652012 | pmc = 2907270 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000285 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing.&lt;ref name=ChildDiag2010/&gt; In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009, between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their HIV status.&lt;ref name=UN2011Eighty&gt;UNAIDS 2011 pg. 70–80&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% of men and women in Sub-Saharan countries were tested&lt;ref name=UN2011Eighty/&gt; which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.&lt;ref name=UN2011Eighty/&gt;

===Classifications===
Two main clinical staging systems are used to classify HIV and HIV-related disease for [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] purposes: the [[WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease]],&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; and the [[CDC classification system for HIV infection]].&lt;ref name=CDCCase2008/&gt; The CDC's classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries. Since the WHO's staging system does not require laboratory tests, it is suited to the resource-restricted conditions encountered in developing countries, where it can also be used to help guide clinical management. Despite their differences, the two systems allow comparison for statistical purposes.&lt;ref name=M121/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=CDCCase2008/&gt;

* Stage I: HIV infection is [[asymptomatic]] with a CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cell count (also known as CD4 count) greater than 500 per microlitre (µl or cubic mm) of blood.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt; May include generalized lymph node enlargement.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;

* Stage III: Advanced symptoms which may include unexplained [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] [[diarrhea]] for longer than a month, severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis of the lung, and a CD4 count of less than 350/µl.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;
* Stage IV or AIDS: severe symptoms which include [[toxoplasmosis]] of the brain, [[candidiasis]] of the [[esophagus]], [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], [[bronchus|bronchi]] or [[lung]]s and [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. A CD4 count of less than 200/µl.&lt;ref name=WHOCase2007/&gt;

* Unknown: if insufficient information is available to make any of the above classifications

For surveillance purposes, the AIDS diagnosis still stands even if, after treatment, the CD4&lt;SUP&gt;+&lt;/SUP&gt; T cell count rises to above 200 per µL of blood or other AIDS-defining illnesses are cured.&lt;ref name="M121"/&gt;

In 1983, two separate research groups led by [[Robert Gallo]] and [[Luc Montagnier]] declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting people with AIDS, and published their findings in the same issue of the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name=Gallo&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallo RC, Sarin PS, Gelmann EP, Robert-Guroff M, Richardson E, Kalyanaraman VS, Mann D, Sidhu GD, Stahl RE, Zolla-Pazner S, Leibowitch J, Popovic M | title = Isolation of human T-cell leukemia virus in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4599 | pages = 865–7 | date = May 1983 | pmid = 6601823 | doi = 10.1126/science.6601823 | bibcode = 1983Sci...220..865G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Montagnier &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barré-Sinoussi F, Chermann JC, Rey F, Nugeyre MT, Chamaret S, Gruest J, Dauguet C, Axler-Blin C, Vézinet-Brun F, Rouzioux C, Rozenbaum W, Montagnier L | title = Isolation of a T-lymphotropic retrovirus from a patient at risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) | journal = Science | volume = 220 | issue = 4599 | pages = 868–71 | date = May 1983 | pmid = 6189183 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.6189183 | bibcode = 1983Sci...220..868B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gallo claimed that a virus his group had isolated from a person with AIDS was strikingly similar in [[Virus structure|shape]] to other [[human T-lymphotropic virus]]es (HTLVs) his group had been the first to isolate. Gallo's group called their newly isolated virus HTLV-III. At the same time, Montagnier's group isolated a virus from a person presenting with swelling of the [[lymph node]]s of the neck and [[asthenia|physical weakness]], two characteristic symptoms of AIDS. Contradicting the report from Gallo's group, Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV-I. Montagnier's group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV).&lt;ref name="Basavapathruni_2007"/&gt; As these two viruses turned out to be the same, in 1986, LAV and HTLV-III were renamed HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|veditors=Aldrich R, Wotherspoon G |title=Who's who in gay and lesbian history |year=2001|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-22974-6|page=154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KA7_1s6w-QC&amp;pg=PA154 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific proposed high-risk transmission channels, allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society, depend on the proposed timing of the animal-to-human crossing. Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to circa 1910.&lt;ref name=Worobey2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Worobey M, Gemmel M, Teuwen DE, Haselkorn T, Kunstman K, Bunce M, Muyembe JJ, Kabongo JM, Kalengayi RM, Van Marck E, Gilbert MT, Wolinsky SM | title = Direct evidence of extensive diversity of HIV-1 in Kinshasa by 1960 | journal = Nature | volume = 455 | issue = 7213 | pages = 661–4 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18833279 | pmc = 3682493 | doi = 10.1038/nature07390 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v455/n7213/pdf/nature07390.pdf | bibcode = 2008Natur.455..661W }} (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of [[colonialism]] and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of [[prostitution]], and the accompanying high frequency of [[genital ulcer disease]]s (such as [[syphilis]]) in nascent colonial cities.&lt;ref name=Sousa2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Sousa JD, Müller V, Lemey P, Vandamme AM | title = High GUD incidence in the early 20 century created a particularly permissive time window for the origin and initial spread of epidemic HIV strains | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = e9936 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20376191 | pmc = 2848574 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0009936 | editor1-last = Martin | editor1-first = Darren P. | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...5.9936S }}&lt;/ref&gt; While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are low under regular circumstances, they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] causing genital ulcers. Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers, to the degree that, as of 1928, as many as 45% of female residents of eastern [[Kinshasa]] were thought to have been prostitutes, and, as of 1933, around 15% of all residents of the same city had [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=Sousa2010 /&gt;

{{main|Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS}}
[[File:Ryan White.jpg|thumb|alt=A teenage male with the hand of another resting on his left shoulder smiling for the camera|[[Ryan White]] became a [[poster child]] for HIV after being expelled from school because he was infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ryan-White |title=Ryan White, an American AIDS Victim |publisher=''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' |date=November 7, 2013 |access-date=July 16, 2015 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722112020/http://www.britannica.com/biography/Ryan-White |archive-date=July 22, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
AIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways, including [[shunning|ostracism]], [[Social rejection|rejection]], discrimination and avoidance of HIV infected people; compulsory HIV testing without prior [[consent]] or protection of [[confidentiality]]; violence against HIV infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV; and the [[quarantine]] of HIV infected individuals.&lt;ref name="UNAIDS2006Ch4"/&gt; Stigma-related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing, returning for their results, or securing treatment, possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name="Ogden"&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Ogden J, Nyblade L |website=[[International Center for Research on Women]] |year=2005 |title=Common at its core: HIV-related stigma across contexts |url=http://www.icrw.org/docs/2005_report_stigma_synthesis.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=February 15, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217044825/http://www.icrw.org/docs/2005_report_stigma_synthesis.pdf |archive-date=February 17, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIDS stigma has been further divided into the following three categories:
* ''Instrumental AIDS stigma''—a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness.&lt;ref name=Herek1999&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Herek GM, Capitanio JP |journal=American Behavioral Scientist |year=1999 |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/abs99_sp.pdf |format=PDF |title=AIDS Stigma and sexual prejudice |access-date=March 27, 2006 |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=1130–1147 |doi=10.1177/0002764299042007006 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409034211/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/abs99_sp.pdf |archive-date=April 9, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Symbolic AIDS stigma''—the use of HIV/AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease.&lt;ref name="Herek1999" /&gt;
* ''Courtesy AIDS stigma''—stigmatization of people connected to the issue of HIV/AIDS or HIV-positive people.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Snyder M, Omoto AM, Crain AL |title=Punished for their good deeds: stigmatization for AIDS volunteers |journal=American Behavioral Scientist |year=1999 |pages=1175–1192 |volume=42 |issue=7 |doi=10.1177/0002764299042007009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, AIDS stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas, particularly those associated with homosexuality, [[bisexuality]], [[promiscuity]], prostitution, and [[Intravenous drug use (recreational)|intravenous drug use]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharma |first=A.K. |title=Population and society |publisher=Concept Pub.

In many [[Developed country|developed countries]], there is [[AIDS and homosexuality|an association between AIDS and homosexuality or bisexuality]], and this association is correlated with higher levels of sexual prejudice, such as [[homophobia|anti-homosexual]]/[[biphobia|bisexual]] attitudes.&lt;ref name="Herek2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herek GM, Capitanio JP, Widaman KF | title = HIV-related stigma and knowledge in the United States: prevalence and trends, 1991-1999 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 92 | issue = 3 | pages = 371–7 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11867313 | pmc = 1447082 | doi = 10.2105/AJPH.92.3.371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a perceived association between AIDS and all male-male sexual behavior, including sex between uninfected men.&lt;ref name="Herek1999" /&gt; However, the dominant mode of spread worldwide for HIV remains heterosexual transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = De Cock KM, Jaffe HW, Curran JW | title = The evolving epidemiology of HIV/AIDS | journal = AIDS | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 1205–13 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22706007 | doi = 10.1097/QAD.0b013e328354622a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, as part of an overall reform of marriage and population legislation, it became legal for people with AIDS to marry in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=China relaxes laws on love and marriage |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1439403/China-relaxes-laws-on-love-and-marriage.html |access-date=October 24, 2013 |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=August 21, 2003 |author=Richard Spencer |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131108082647/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1439403/China-relaxes-laws-on-love-and-marriage.html |archive-date=November 8, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care. It is estimated that as of 2007 there were 12&amp;nbsp;million [[AIDS orphan]]s.&lt;ref name=M117/&gt; Many are cared for by elderly grandparents.&lt;ref name=Greener&gt;{{Cite book| author = Greener R| year = 2002| title = State of The Art: AIDS and Economics| chapter = AIDS and macroeconomic impact| editor = S, Forsyth| pages = 49–55| publisher = IAEN| url = http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACP969.pdf| deadurl = no| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121012090520/http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNACP969.pdf| archive-date = October 12, 2012| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to work after beginning treatment for HIV/AIDS is difficult, and affected people often work less than the average worker. [[Unemployment]] in people with HIV/AIDS also is associated with [[suicidal ideation]], memory problems, and social isolation. Employment increases [[self-esteem]], sense of dignity, confidence, and [[quality of life]] for people with HIV/AIDS. Anti-retroviral treatment may help people with HIV/AIDS work more, and may increase the chance that a person with HIV/AIDS will be employed (low quality evidence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinson R, Okpo E, Mngoma N | title = Interventions for improving employment outcomes for workers with HIV | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = CD010090 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 26022149 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010090.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By affecting mainly young adults, AIDS reduces the taxable population, in turn reducing the resources available for [[government spending|public expenditures]] such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy. This causes a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans. This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.&lt;ref name=Greener /&gt;

At the household level, AIDS causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare. A study in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] showed that households having a person with HIV/AIDS spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households. This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment.&lt;ref name="WBank"&gt;

Some religious organizations have claimed that prayer can cure HIV/AIDS. In 2011, the BBC reported that some churches in London were claiming that prayer would cure AIDS, and the [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]]-based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reported that several people stopped taking their medication, sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor, leading to a number of deaths.&lt;ref name=BBC18102011&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14406818|title=Church HIV prayer cure claims 'cause three deaths'|date=October 18, 2011|access-date=October 18, 2011|publisher=BBC News|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018164909/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-14406818|archive-date=October 18, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Synagogue Church Of All Nations]] advertised an "anointing water" to promote God's healing, although the group denies advising people to stop taking medication.&lt;ref name=BBC18102011 /&gt;

=== Criminal transmission ===
{{Main|Criminal transmission of HIV}}
Criminal transmission of HIV is the [[intention (criminal law)|intentional]] or [[recklessness (law)|reckless]] infection of a person with the [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV). Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the United States, have laws that criminalize HIV transmission or exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV-Specific Criminal Laws|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/exposure.html|website=cdc.gov|access-date=November 22, 2014|date=June 30, 2014|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031203041/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/exposure.html|archive-date=October 31, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others may charge the accused under laws enacted before the HIV pandemic.

===Misconceptions===
{{Main|Misconceptions about HIV/AIDS|Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories}}
There are many [[misconceptions about HIV and AIDS]].

Several discredited [[conspiracy theories]] have held that HIV was created by scientists, either inadvertently or deliberately. [[Operation INFEKTION]] was a worldwide Soviet [[active measures]] operation to spread the claim that the United States had created HIV/AIDS. Surveys show that a significant number of people believed – and continue to believe – in such claims.&lt;ref name="infektion"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boghardt|first=Thomas|title=Operation INFEKTION  Soviet Bloc Intelligence and Its AIDS Disinformation Campaign|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol53no4/soviet-bloc-intelligence-and-its-aids.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|year=2009|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514230328/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol53no4/soviet-bloc-intelligence-and-its-aids.html|archive-date=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
{{Main|HIV/AIDS research}}
HIV/AIDS research includes all [[medical research]] which attempts to prevent, treat, or cure HIV/AIDS along with fundamental research about the nature of [[HIV]] as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.

Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral [[health interventions]] such as [[sex education]], and [[drug development]], such as research into [[microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases]], [[HIV vaccines]], and [[antiretroviral drugs]]. Other medical research areas include the topics of [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]], [[post-exposure prophylaxis]], and [[circumcision and HIV]]. Public health officials, researchers, and programs can gain a more comprehensive picture of the barriers they face, and the efficacy of current approaches to HIV treatment and prevention, by tracking standard HIV indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/eval/indicators/index.htm|title=Indicators - Program Evaluation - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of common indicators is an increasing focus of development organizations and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.measureevaluation.org/community-based-indicators|title=Community-Based Indicators for HIV Programs — MEASURE Evaluation|website=www.measureevaluation.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hiv/data/en/|title=Data and statistics|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GHS-pictogram-skull.svg|thumb|[[Skull and crossbones (poison)|Skull and crossbones]], a common symbol for poison and other sources of [[Death|lethal danger]] ([[GHS hazard pictograms]])]]

'''Hazard symbols''' or '''warning symbols''' are recognisable [[symbol]]s designed to warn about hazardous or dangerous materials, locations, or objects, including electric currents, poisons, and [[radioactivity]]. The use of hazard symbols is often regulated by law and directed by [[standards organisation]]s. Hazard symbols may appear with different colors, backgrounds, borders and supplemental information in order to specify the type of hazard and the level of threat (for example, [[toxicity class]]es).  Warning symbols are used in many places in lieu of or addition to written warnings as they are quickly recognized (faster than reading a written warning) and more commonly understood (the same symbol can be recognized as having the same meaning to speakers of different languages).

==Generic warning symbol==
{{further|Warning sign}}
[[Image:Achtung.svg|thumb|80px|alt=German road warning sign|German road warning symbol]]

On roadside [[warning sign]]s, an [[exclamation mark]] is often used to draw attention to a generic warning of danger, hazards, and the unexpected. In Europe, this type of sign is used if there are no more-specific signs to denote a particular hazard.&lt;ref name="A series european traffic signs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dik/english/traffic/signs/Aa.html|title=A series european traffic signs}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used for traffic signs, it is accompanied by a supplementary sign describing the hazard, usually mounted under the exclamation mark.

This symbol has also been more widely adopted for generic use in many other contexts not associated with road traffic. It often appears on hazardous equipment or in instruction manuals to draw attention to a precaution, when a more-specific warning symbol is not available.

==Poison symbol==
{{Main|Skull and crossbones (poison)}}
[[Image:Skull and crossbones.svg|thumb|80px|alt=Skull and crossbones|Skull and crossbones]]
The skull-and-crossbones symbol (☠), consisting of a [[human skull]] and two bones crossed together behind the skull, is today generally used as a warning of danger, particularly in regard to [[poison]]ous substances.

The symbol, or some variation thereof, specifically with the bones (or swords) below the skull, was also featured on the [[Jolly Roger]], the traditional [[flag]] of European and American seagoing [[pirate]]s. It is also part of the Canadian [[Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System|WHMIS]] home symbols placed on containers to warn that the contents are poisonous.

In the United States, due to concerns that the skull-and-crossbones symbol's association with pirates might encourage children to play with toxic materials, the [[Mr. Yuk]] symbol is also used to denote poison.

==Ionizing radiation symbol== 	 &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Trefoil]] --&gt;
{{anchor|ISO 21482|Radioactive sign}}
The '''international radiation symbol''' (also known as the [[trefoil]]) first appeared in 1946, at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|University of California, Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="Origin of the Radiation Warning Symbol (Trefoil)"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/radwarnsymbstory.htm|title=Origin of the Radiation Warning Symbol (Trefoil)}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was rendered as [[magenta]], and was set on a [[blue]] background. The original version used in America is magenta against a yellow background, and it is drawn with a central circle of radius ''R'', an internal radius of 1.5''R'' and an external radius of 5''R'' for the blades, which are separated from each other by 60°. The trefoil is black in the international version, which is also used in America.&lt;ref name="Biohazard and radioactive symbol, design and proportions"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf |title=Biohazard and radioactive symbol, design and proportions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231181252/http://www.michigan.gov/documents/CIS_WSH_part476_54539_7.pdf |archivedate=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign is commonly referred to as a [[radioactivity]] warning sign, but it is actually a warning sign of [[ionizing radiation]]. Ionizing radiation is a much broader category than radioactivity alone, as many non-radioactive sources also emit potentially dangerous levels of ionizing radiation. This includes x-ray apparatus, radiotherapy linear accelerators, and particle accelerators. [[Non-ionizing radiation]] can also reach potentially dangerous levels, but this warning sign is different from the trefoil ionizing radiation warning symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carexcanada.ca/en/ionizing_radiation/#regulations_and_guidelines|title=Ionizing Radiation |publisher=CAREX Canada|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 15, 2007, two groups—the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)—jointly announced the adoption of a new [[ionizing radiation]] warning symbol to supplement the traditional trefoil symbol. The new symbol, to be used on sealed radiation sources, is aimed at alerting anyone, anywhere to the danger of being close to a strong source of ionizing radiation.&lt;ref&gt;''This symbol is included in ISO 21482:2007. ISO International Standards are protected by copyright and may be purchased from ISO or its members (please visit www.iso.org for more information). ISO has not reviewed the accuracy or veracity of this information.'' {{Cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/radiationsymbol.html|title=New Symbol Launched to Warn Public About Radiation Dangers|accessdate=2007-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts, on a red background, a black trefoil with waves of radiation streaming from it, along with a black [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]], and a running figure with an arrow pointing away from the scene. The radiating trefoil suggests the presence of radiation, while the red background and the skull and crossbones warn of the danger. The figure running away from the scene is meant to suggest taking action to avoid the labeled material. The new symbol is not intended to be generally visible, but rather to appear on internal components of devices that house radiation sources so that if anybody attempts to disassemble such devices they will see an explicit warning not to proceed any further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2007/radiationsymbol.html|title=New Symbol Launched to Warn Public About Radiation Dangers|work=IAEA|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Jun262007/snt200706259363.asp|title=Deccan Herald – Drop it|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210212755/http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Jun262007/snt200706259363.asp|archivedate=2009-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Biohazard symbol.svg|thumb|left|80px|alt=Biohazard symbol|Biohazard symbol used since 1966]]

The '''biohazard symbol''' is used in the labeling of biological materials that carry a significant health risk ([[Biological hazard|biohazards]]), including viral samples and used [[hypodermic needles]] (see [[sharps waste]]).&lt;ref name=BiohazardScience&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The biohazard symbol was developed by the [[Dow Chemical Company]] in 1966 for their containment products.&lt;ref name="waterloo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm|title=Biohazard Symbol History|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716160837/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charles Baldwin,&lt;ref name="waterloo"/&gt; an environmental-health engineer who contributed to its development: "We wanted something that was memorable but meaningless, so we could educate people as to what it means." In an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1967, the symbol was presented as the new standard for all biological hazards ("biohazards"). The article explained that over 40 symbols were drawn up by Dow artists, and all of the symbols investigated had to meet a number of criteria: "(i) striking in form in order to draw immediate attention; (ii) unique and unambiguous, in order not to be confused with symbols used for other purposes; (iii) quickly recognizable and easily recalled; (iv) easily stenciled; (v) symmetrical, in order to appear identical from all angles of approach; and (vi) acceptable to groups of varying ethnic backgrounds." The chosen scored the best on nationwide testing for memorability.&lt;ref name=BiohazardScience&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=CL|author2=Runkle, RS|title=Biohazards symbol: development of a biological hazards warning signal.|journal=Science|date=Oct 13, 1967|volume=158|issue=3798|pages=264–5|doi=10.1126/science.158.3798.264|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|accessdate=29 August 2011|pmid=6053882|bibcode=1967Sci...158..264B|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324190420/http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/1967-10-13-Science-paper-Biohazard-Symbol.pdf|archivedate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometry===
All parts of the biohazard sign can be drawn with a [[compass and straightedge]]. The basic outline of the symbol is a plain [[trefoil]], which is three circles overlapping each other equally like in a triple [[Venn diagram]] with the overlapping parts erased. The [[diameters|diameter]] of the overlapping part is equal to half the [[radii|radius]] of the three circles. Then three inner circles are drawn in with {{frac|2|3}} radius of the original circles so that it is [[tangent]] to the outside three overlapping circles. A tiny circle in center has a [[diameter]] {{frac|1|2}} of the radius of the three inner circles, and [[Arc (geometry)|arcs]] are erased at 90°, 210°, and 330°. The arcs of the inner circles and the tiny circle are connected by a line. Finally, the ring under is drawn from the distance to the [[perimeter]] of the [[equilateral triangle]] that forms between the centers of the three intersecting circles. An outer circle of the ring under is drawn and finally enclosed with the arcs from the center of the inner circles with a shorter radius from the inner circles.&lt;ref name="Biohazard and radioactive symbol, design and proportions"/&gt;

==Chemical symbols==
A '''chemical hazard symbol''' is a [[pictogram]] applied to containers of dangerous [[chemical compound]]s to indicate the specific hazard, and thus the required precautions. There are several systems of labels, depending on the purpose, such as on the container for end use, or on a vehicle during transportation. 

===GHS symbols and statements===
{{main|GHS hazard pictograms}}
The [[United Nations]] has designed [[GHS hazard pictograms]] and [[GHS hazard statements]] to [[Harmonization|internationally harmonize]] chemical hazard warnings. Several European countries have started to implement these new global standards, but older warning symbols are still used in many parts of the world.

===Europe===
{{main|European hazard symbols}}
European standards are set by:
* [[CLP Regulation|CLP regulation]] (2008) for chemical containers, following international GHS recommendations; see European [[GHS hazard statements|CLP/GHS hazard symbols]]
* [[European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road]] (ADR) for additional packaging for transportation. Vehicles carrying dangerous goods must be equipped with orange signs, where the upper code number identifies the type of hazard, and the lower code number identifies the specific substance. These symbols cannot be readily interpreted without the aid of a table to translate the numerical codes.

{{see also|Toxic Substances Control Act}}

The US-based [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA) has a standard [[NFPA 704]] using a diamond with four colored sections each with a number indicating severity 0—4 (0 for no hazard, 4 indicates a severe hazard). The red section denotes flammability. The blue section denotes health risks. Yellow represents reactivity (tendency to explode). The white section denotes special hazard information. One example of a special hazard would be the capital letter W crossed out (pictured left), indicating it is water reactant.

==Non-standard symbols==
[[Image:High voltage warning sign Beromuenster.JPG|thumb|Sign on a fence around the [[Beromünster]] Reserve Broadcasting Tower in Switzerland, warning of high voltage and lethal danger]]
A large number of warning symbols with non-standard designs are in use around the world.

Some warning symbols have been redesigned to be more comprehensible to children, such as the [[Mr. Ouch]] (depicting an electricity danger as a snarling, spiky creature) and [[Mr. Yuk]] (a green frowny face sticking its tongue out, to represent poison) designs in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4539">'''Heterogeneous medical condition''' in medicine are those [[medical condition]]s which have several [[etiologies]], like [[hepatitis]] or [[diabetes]]. Medical conditions are normally defined pathologically (liver inflammation) or clinically (excessive urination) and not etiologically, and therefore it is normal to have more than one cause for them. The word is used as an opposition to [[homogeneous]], meaning that given a group of patients, the disease is the same for all of them.

When a condition is heterogeneous, it is normally divided in [[endotype]]s.

==Endotype==
{{main|endotype}}
An '''endotype''' is a subtype of a condition, which is defined by a distinct functional or [[Pathobiology|pathobiological]] mechanism. This is distinct from a [[Phenotype (clinical medicine)|phenotype]], which is any observable characteristic or trait of a [[disease]], such as [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], development, biochemical or physiological properties, or behavior, without any implication of a mechanism. It is envisaged that [[patient]]s with a specific endotype present themselves within phenotypic clusters of diseases.

One example is asthma, which is considered to be a [[syndrome]], consisting of a series of endotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lötvall |first1=Jan |last2=Akdis |first2=Cezmi A. |last3=Bacharier |first3=Leonard B. |last4=Bjermer |first4=Leif |last5=Casale |first5=Thomas B. |last6=Custovic |first6=Adnan |last7=Lemanske Jr. |first7=Robert F. |last8=Wardlaw |first8=Andrew J. |last9=Wenzel |first9=Sally E. |last10=Greenberger |first10=Paul A. |title=Asthma endotypes: A new approach to classification of disease entities within the asthma syndrome |journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology |date=February 2011 |volume=127 |issue=2 |pages=355–360 |doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2010.11.037 |pmid=21281866}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the concept of [[disease entity]]

==Heterogeneity in medical conditions==

The term '''medical condition''' is a [[nosology|nosological]] broad term that includes all diseases, disorders, injuries and [[syndrome]]s, and it is specially suitable in the last case, in which it is not possible to speak about a single disease associated to the clinical course of the patient.

While the term ''medical condition'' generally includes mental illnesses, in some contexts the term is used specifically to denote any illness, injury, or disease except for mental illnesses. The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM), the widely used psychiatric manual that defines all [[mental disorder]]s, uses the term ''general medical condition'' to refer to all diseases, illnesses, and injuries except for [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders |edition=4th |location=Washington, DC |author=American Psychiatric Association. Task Force on DSM-IV |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage is also commonly seen in the psychiatric literature. Some [[health insurance]] policies also define a ''medical condition'' as any illness, injury, or disease except for psychiatric illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinsurancepage.co.uk/expat-insurance-glossary.html |title=Expat Insurance Glossary by The Insurance Page |accessdate=2008-11-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027142342/http://www.theinsurancepage.co.uk/expat-insurance-glossary.html |archivedate=2008-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As it is more [[value-neutral]] than terms like ''disease'', the term ''medical condition'' is sometimes preferred by people with health issues that they do not consider deleterious. It is also preferred when etiology is not unique, because the word disease is normally associated to the cause of the clinical problems. On the other hand, by emphasizing the medical nature of the condition, this term is sometimes rejected, such as by proponents of the [[autism rights movement]].

The term is also used in specialized areas of the medicine. A genetic or allelic heterogeneous condition is one where the same disease or condition can be caused, or contributed to, by varying different genes or alleles. In clinical trials and statistics the concepts of homogeneous and heterogeneous populations is important. The same applies for [[epidemiology]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23759">The '''Hispanic paradox''', or '''Latino paradox''', also known as the "epidemiologic paradox," refers to the [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] finding that [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] tend to have health outcomes that "[[paradox]]ically" are comparable to, or in some cases better than, those of their U.S. [[Non-Hispanic whites|non-Hispanic White]] counterparts, even though Hispanics have lower average income and education. (Low [[Socioeconomic status|socioeconomic]] status is almost universally associated with worse population health and higher death rates everywhere in the world.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Franzini L, Ribble JC, Keddie AM |title=Understanding the Hispanic paradox |journal=Ethn Dis |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=496–518 |year=2001 |pmid=11572416}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox usually refers in particular to low mortality among Latinos in the [[United States]] relative to non-Hispanic Whites.&lt;ref name="Abraido-Lanza, A. 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.89.10.1543 |title=The Latino mortality paradox: A test of the "salmon bias" and healthy migrant hypotheses |year=1999 |last1=Abraído-Lanza |first1=Ana F |last2=Dohrenwend |first2=Bruce P |last3=Ng-Mak |first3=Daisy S |last4=Turner |first4=J Blake |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=89 |issue=10 |pages=1543–8 |pmid=10511837 |pmc=1508801}}&lt;/ref&gt; First coined the ''Hispanic Epidemiological Paradox'' in 1986 by Kyriakos Markides,&lt;!-- Incorrect or invalid reference.

The specific cause of the phenomenon is poorly understood, although the decisive factor appears to be place of birth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/4010766 |first1=Bruce |last1=Bower |year=1998 |title=Immigrants go from health to worse |journal=Science News |volume=154 |issue=12 |pages=180|jstor=4010766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/4015677 |first1=Bruce |last1=Bower |year=2004 |title=Immigration blues: Born in the USA: Mental-health deficit |journal=Science News |volume=166 |issue=25–26 |pages=387–8|jstor=4015677 }}&lt;/ref&gt; raising the possibility that differing birthing or neonatal practices might be involved via a lack of breastfeeding combined with birth trauma imprinting (both common in American obstetrics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Winkel R |title=Munchausen Obstetrics |accessdate=April 23, 2010 |url=http://www.math.missouri.edu/~rich/MGM/birthUSA3.txt}}{{MEDRS|date=July 2013}}{{self-published inline|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and consequent mental and physical illness, the latter compounded by the impact of psychological problems on the capacity for social networking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berkman |first1=Lisa F. |last2=Syme |first2=S.

Historical differences in [[smoking]] habits by ethnicity and place of birth may explain much of the paradox, at least at adult ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Blue L, Fenelon A |title=Explaining low mortality among US immigrants relative to native-born Americans: the role of smoking |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=786–93 |date=June 2011 |pmid=21324939 |pmc=3147070 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyr011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others have proposed that the lower mortality of Hispanics could reflect a slower biological aging rate of Hispanics.&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"/&gt; However, some believe that there is no Hispanic Paradox, and that inaccurate counting of Hispanic deaths in the United States leads to an underestimate of Hispanic or Latino mortality.&lt;ref name=pmid16380579&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smith DP, Bradshaw BS |title=Rethinking the Hispanic paradox: death rates and life expectancy for US non-Hispanic White and Hispanic populations |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=96 |issue=9 |pages=1686–92 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16380579 |pmc=1551967 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2003.035378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistical findings ==

===Mortality===
Though they are often at lower socioeconomic standing, most [[Hispanic]] groups, excepting Puerto Ricans, demonstrate lower or equal levels of mortality to their non-Hispanic White counterparts.&lt;ref name="Turra &amp; Goldman 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turra |first1=Cassio M. |last2=Goldman |first2=Noreen |year=2007 |title=Socioeconomic Differences in Mortality Among U.S. Adults: Insights Into the Hispanic Paradox |journal=The Journals of Gerontology: Series B |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=S184–92 |pmid=17507594 |doi=10.1093/geronb/62.3.S184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Center for Disease Control]] reported in 2003 that Hispanic’s mortality rate was 25 percent lower than [[non-Hispanic whites]] and 43 percent lower than African Americans.&lt;ref name="Chung, Juliet 2006"/&gt; This mortality advantage most commonly found among middle-aged and elderly Hispanics. The death  rates of Hispanics to non-Hispanic whites was found to exceed 1.00 in the twenties, decreases by age 45, then is severely reduced to 0.75-.90 by at age 65, persisting until death. When controlling for socioeconomic factors, the health advantage gap for [[Mexican Americans]], the largest Hispanic population in the US, increases noticeably.&lt;ref name="Turra &amp; Goldman 2007"/&gt;

Hispanics do not have a mortality advantage over non-Hispanic Whites in all mortality rates; they have higher rates for mortality from [[liver disease]], [[cervical cancer]], [[AIDS]], [[homicide]] (males), and [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name="Abraido-Lanza, A. 1999"/&gt;

===Infant mortality===
Another important indicator of health is the [[infant mortality rate]], which is also either equal or better in Hispanic Americans than in non-Hispanic Americans. A study by Hummer, et al. found that infants born to Mexican Immigrant women in the United States have about a 10% lower mortality in the first hour, first day, and first week than that of infants born to non-Hispanic white, U.S.-born women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/dem.2007.0028 |title=Paradox Found (Again): Infant Mortality Among the Mexican-Origin Population in the United States |year=2007 |last1=Hummer |first1=Robert A. |last2=Powers |first2=Daniel A. |last3=Pullum |first3=Starling G. |last4=Gossman |first4=Ginger L. |last5=Frisbie |first5=W.

== Reasons for the paradox ==

=== Socio-economic factors ===
According to Alder and Estrove (2006), the more socioeconomically advantaged individuals are, the better their health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08101.x |title=Socioeconomic Status and Health: What We Know and What We Don't |year=1999 |last1=Adler |first1=Nancy E. |last2=Ostrove |first2=Joan M. |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=896 |pages=3–15 |pmid=10681884|bibcode=1999NYASA.896....3A }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Access to health insurance and preventative medical services are one of the main reasons for socioeconomic health disparities. Economic hardship within the household can cause distress and affect parenting, causing health problems among children leading to depression, substance abuse, and behavior problems. Low socioeconomic status is correlated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. Mental health disorders are an important health problem for those of low socioeconomic status; they are two to five times more likely to suffer from a diagnosable disorder than those of high socioeconomic status, and are more likely to face barriers to getting treatment.  Furthermore, this lack of treatment for mental disorders can affect educational and employment opportunities and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/about/gr/issues/socioeconomic/ses-health.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021040636/http://www.apa.org/about/gr/issues/socioeconomic/ses-health.pdf |archivedate=October 21, 2012 |title=Socioeconomic Status and Health |publisher=APA Public Interest Government Relations Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Residential segregation ===
Important to the understanding of migrant community health is the increasingly stratified American society, manifested in [[residential segregation]].  Beginning in the 1970s, the low to moderate levels of income segregation in the United States began to degrade.&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Massey |first1=Douglas S. |chapter=The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DmN-Zq-WPIC&amp;pg=PA173 |pages=173–87 |year=2004 |editor1-first=C. Michael |editor1-last=Henry |title=Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-12984-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the rich became richer, so did their neighborhoods. This trend was inversely reflected in the poor, as their neighborhoods became poorer. As sociologist Douglas Massey explains, “As a result, poverty and affluence both became more concentrated geographically.”&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 2004"/&gt; Professor of public administration and economics John Yinger writes that “one way for poor people to win the spatial competition for housing is to rent small or low-quality housing.” However, he continues, low-quality housing often features serious health risks such as lead paint and animal pests. Though lead-based paint was deemed illegal in 1978, it remains on the walls of older apartments and houses, posing a serious neurological risk to children. [[Asthma]], a possible serious health risk, also has a clear link to poverty. Moreover, asthma attacks have been associated with certain aspects of poor housing quality such as the presence of cockroaches, mice, dust, dust mites, mold, and mildew. The 1997 [[American Housing Survey]] found that signs of rats or mice are almost twice as likely to be detected in poor households as in non-poor households.&lt;ref name=Yinger2009&gt;{{cite book |last1=Yinger |first1=John |chapter=Housing Discrimination and Residential Segregation as Causes of Poverty |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuy6JGuLdi0C&amp;pg=PA359 |pages=359–91 |editor1-first=Sheldon H. |editor1-last=Danziger |editor2-first=Robert H. |editor2-last=Haveman |year=2009 |title=Understanding Poverty |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03017-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hypotheses ==

===Barrio advantage===
One hypothesis for the Hispanic Paradox proposes that living in the same neighborhood as people with similar ethnic backgrounds confers significant advantages to one’s health. In a study of elderly [[Mexican-Americans]], those living in areas with a higher percentage of Mexican-Americans had lower seven-year mortality as well as a decreased prevalence of medical conditions, including [[stroke]], [[cancer]], and [[hip fracture]].&lt;ref name=Barrio&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.94.10.1807 |title=Neighborhood Context and Mortality Among Older Mexican Americans: Is There a Barrio Advantage? |year=2004 |last1=Eschbach |first1=Karl |last2=Ostir |first2=Glenn V. |last3=Patel |first3=Kushang V. |last4=Markides |first4=Kyriakos S. |last5=Goodwin |first5=James S. |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=1807–12 |pmid=15451754 |pmc=1448538}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these neighborhoods' relatively high rates of poverty due to lack of formal education and a preponderance of low paying service sector jobs, residents do not suffer from the same mortality and morbidity levels seen in similarly disadvantaged socioeconomic neighborhoods. These neighborhoods do have intact family structures, community institutions, and [[kinship]] structures that span households, all of which are thought to provide significant benefits to an individual’s health.&lt;ref name=Barrio /&gt; These social network support structures are especially important to the health of the elderly population as they deal with declining physical function. Another reason for this phenomenon could be that those Hispanic-Americans that live among those of similar cultural and social backgrounds are shielded from some of the negative effects of assimilation to American culture.&lt;ref name=Barrio /&gt;

===Acculturation===

The extent of a Hispanic American’s [[acculturation]] in the United States, or their [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] to mainstream American culture, is relative to his or her health.&lt;ref name="Abraido-Lanza, A. 1999"/&gt; One of the main negative effects of acculturation on health has been on substance abuse. More assimilated Latinos have higher rates of [[illicit drug]] use, alcohol consumption, and smoking, especially among women.&lt;ref name="acculturation and health"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.publhealth.26.021304.144615 |title=ACCULTURATION AND LATINO HEALTH IN THE UNITED STATES: A Review of the Literature and its Sociopolitical Context |year=2005 |last1=Lara |first1=Marielena |last2=Gamboa |first2=Cristina |last3=Kahramanian |first3=M. Iya |last4=Morales |first4=Leo S. |last5=Hayes Bautista |first5=David E. |journal=Annual Review of Public Health |volume=26 |pages=367–97 |pmid=15760294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another negative effect of acculturation is changes in diet and [[nutrition]]. More acculturated Latinos eat less fruits, vegetables, vitamins, fiber and protein and consume more fat than their less acculturated counterparts.&lt;ref name="acculturation and health" /&gt; One of the most significant impacts of acculturation on Latino health is birth outcomes. Studies have found that more acculturated Latinas have higher rates of low [[birthweight]], [[premature births]], [[teenage pregnancy]] and undesirable [[prenatal]] and [[postnatal]] behaviors such as smoking or drinking during pregnancy, and lower rates of breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="acculturation and health" /&gt; Acculturation and greater time in the United States has also been associated with negative [[mental health]] impacts. US-born Latinos or long term residents of the United States had higher rates of mental illness than recent Latino immigrants.&lt;ref name="Mental health facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=Latino Community Mental Health Fact Sheet|url=http://www.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Find_Support/Multicultural_Support/Annual_Minority_Mental_Healthcare_Symposia/Latino_MH06.pdf|publisher=Nami Multicultural Action Center|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324011410/http://www.nami.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Find_Support/Multicultural_Support/Annual_Minority_Mental_Healthcare_Symposia/Latino_MH06.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, foreign-born Mexican Americans are at significantly lower risk of [[suicide]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] than those born in the United States.&lt;ref name="Mental health facts" /&gt; The increased rates of mental illness is thought to be due to increased distress associated with alienation, discrimination and Mexican Americans attempting to advance themselves economically and socially stripping themselves of traditional resources and ethnically-based social support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0277-9536(90)90070-9 |title=Adverse effects of acculturation: Psychological distress among Mexican American young adults |year=1990 |last1=Kaplan |first1=Mark S. |last2=Marks |first2=Gary |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1313–9 |pmid=2287960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Healthy migrant effect===
The “healthy migrant effect” hypothesizes that the selection of healthy Hispanic immigrants into the United States is reason for the paradox.&lt;ref name="Abraido-Lanza, A. 1999"/&gt; International immigration statistics demonstrate that the mortality rate of immigrants is lower than in their country of origin. In the United States, foreign-born individuals have better self-reported health than American-born respondents. Furthermore, Hispanic immigrants have better health than those living in the US for a long amount of time.

===Salmon bias===
A second popular hypothesis, called the “Salmon Bias”, attempts to factor in the occurrence of returning home.&lt;ref name="Abraido-Lanza, A. 1999"/&gt; This hypothesis purports that many Hispanic people return home after temporary employment, retirement, or severe illness, meaning that their deaths occur in their native land and are not taken into account by mortality reports in the United States. This hypothesis considers those people as “statistically immortal” because they artificially lower the Hispanic mortality rate. Certain studies hint that it could be reasonable. These studies report that though return migration, both temporary and permanent, depend upon specific economic and social situations in communities, up to 75% of household in immigrant neighborhoods do some kind of return migration from the U.S. However, Abraido-Lanza, ''et al.'' found in 1999 that the “Salmon Hypothesis” cannot account for the  lower mortality of Hispanics in the US because, according to their findings, the Hispanic paradox is still present when non-returning migrants are observed (e.g. Cubans).&lt;ref name="Abraido-Lanza, A. 1999"/&gt;

===Slow biological aging===
Horvath et al. (2013) have proposed that the lower mortality of Hispanics could reflect a slower biological aging rate of Hispanics.&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"&gt;{{Cite journal| title = An epigenetic clock analysis of race/ethnicity, sex, and coronary heart disease.| journal = [[Genome Biol]]| volume =17  | issue = 1| year = 2016| pmid = 27511193  |pmc= 4980791|vauthors= Horvath S, Gurven M, Levine ME, Trumble BC, Kaplan H, Allayee H, Ritz BR, Chen B, Lu AT, Rickabaugh TM, Jamieson BD, Sun D, Li S, Chen W, Quintana-Murci L, Fagny M, Kobor MS, Tsao PS, Reiner AP, Edlefsen KL, Absher D, Assimes TL | doi=10.1186/s13059-016-1030-0| pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is based on the finding that blood and saliva from Hispanics ages more slowly than that of non-Hispanic whites, African Americans, and other populations according to a biomarker of tissue age known as [[epigenetic clock]].&lt;ref name="Horvath2016Race"/&gt;

==Comparison with other ethnicities==
One of the most important aspects of this phenomenon is the comparison of Hispanics' health to non-Hispanic African Americans' health. Both the current and historical poverty rates for Hispanic and non-Hispanic African American populations in the United States are consistently starkly higher than that of non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Asian Americans.&lt;ref name=Yinger2009/&gt; Dr. Hector Flores explains that “You can predict in the African–American population, for example, a high infant-mortality rate, so we would think a [similar] poor minority would have the same health outcomes.” However, he said, the health poor outcomes are not present in the Hispanic population.&lt;ref name="Chung, Juliet 2006"/&gt; For example, the age-adjusted mortality rate for Hispanics living in Los Angeles County was 52 percent less than the blacks living in the same county.&lt;ref name="Chung, Juliet 2006"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Some public health researchers have argued that the Hispanic paradox is not actually a national phenomenon in the United States. In 2006, Smith and Bradshaw argued that no Hispanic paradox exists. They maintain that [[life expectancies]] were nearly equal for non-Hispanic White and Hispanic females, but less close for non-Hispanic White and Hispanic Males.&lt;ref name=pmid16380579/&gt; Turra and Goldman argue that the paradox is concentrated among the foreign born from specific national origins, and is only present in those of middle to older ages. At younger ages, they explain, deaths are highly related to environmental factors such as homicides and accidents. Deaths at older ages, they maintain, are more related to detrimental health-related behaviors  and health status at younger ages. Therefore, immigration-related processes only offer survival protection to those at middle and older ages; the negative impact of assimilation into poor neighborhoods is higher on the mortality of immigrants at a younger age.&lt;ref name="Turra &amp; Goldman 2007"/&gt; In contrast, Palloni and Arias hypothesize that this phenomenon is most likely caused by across-the-board bias in underestimating mortality rates, caused by ethnic misidentification or an overstatement of ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/dem.2004.0024 |jstor=1515185 |title=Paradox Lost: Explaining the Hispanic Adult Mortality Advantage |year=2004 |last1=Palloni |first1=Alberto |last2=Arias |first2=Elizabeth |journal=Demography |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=385–415 |pmid=15461007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These errors could also be related to mistakes in matching death records to the National Health Interview Survey, missing security numbers, or complex surnames.&lt;ref name="Turra &amp; Goldman 2007"/&gt;

'''Informatics for Consumer Health''' (ICH) is a government initiative coordinated by the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) within the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH).  ICH focuses on a coordination of health information, technology, and health care delivery that empowers providers to manage care and increases the ability of consumers to gain mastery over their own health.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, B. W. (2010, June 7).   [http://informaticsforconsumerhealth.org/index.php?q=blog/what%E2%80%99s-name "‘What’s in a Name?” Informatics for Consumer Health"]&lt;/ref&gt; The ICH online initiative involved stakeholders from various sectors—commercial IT, government, health care, education, research,  and advocacy—exchanging ideas and resources to bridge information technology and health care with the goal of improving behavioral support for all consumers. The Informatics for Consumer Health field is related to [[health informatics]], medical informatics, [[consumer health informatics]], [[eHealth]], and [[health information technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Website was at http://informaticsforconsumerhealth.org, but it is no longer active.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background==

Changing health behaviors is key to improving health outcomes. Research indicates that changes in basic preventive behavior - smoking cessation, better diet and exercise, and routine screenings—can lead to potential reductions in disability and death due to cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;The National Academic Press (2003). [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10263 "Fulfilling the Potential for Cancer Prevention and Early Detection"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesse BW, Hanna C, Massett HA, Hesse NK.  (2010).  Outside the box: will information technology be a viable intervention to improve the quality of cancer care? Journal of the National Cancer Institute Monographs. (40):81–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (2006).  Chapter 1.  [http://www.health.gov/communication/ehealth/ehealthTools/chapter1.htm "Expanding the Reach and Impact of Consumer e-Health Tools"].&lt;/ref&gt; Effective consumer health information technology (health IT) applications hold great promise for encouraging and supporting behavior change.&lt;ref&gt;Buntin M. B., Burke M. F., Hoaglin M. C., Blumenthal D. (2011). The benefits of health information technology: a review of the recent literature shows predominantly positive results. Health Affairs (Millwood) 30(3):464-71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, D. K., Woods, S. S., Lightowler, M. C., Finley, S. W., Houston, T. K. (2011). Promise of and potential for patient-facing technologies to enable meaningful use. American Journal of Preventative Medicine 40(5 Suppl 2):S162-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, M. C., Wilson, et al. (2011). Consumer health informatics: results of a systematic evidence review and evidence based recommendations. Translational Behavioral Medicine, 1(1), 175-181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stead, W.W. and S.H. Lin (Eds).(2009). Computational Technology for Effective Health Care: Immediate Steps and Strategic Directions. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaikh, A. R., Prabhu Das, I., Vinson, C. A., Spring, B. (In Press). Cyberinfrastructure for consumer health. American Journal of Preventative Medicine 2011;40(5S2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology. (2010).  Realizing the Full Potential of Health Information Technology to Improve Healthcare for Americans: The Path Forward. Washington, D.C.: Executive Office of the President.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Medicine. (2007). The Learning Health Care System . Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the behavioral and population health evidence-base as a backdrop, the “Informatics for Consumer Health” came out of to two events that occurred in 2009.   The first event occurred in early 2009, when the U.S.-based National Research Council released a report titled “Computational Technology for Effective Healthcare: Immediate Steps and Future Directions”.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council. (2003).  Innovation in information technology. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This report concluded that many of the current deployments of health information technology had become disconnected from their primary objectives: to ensure the health of real consumers in real world settings. The research portfolio in health systems should be rebalanced, authors of the report argued, to emphasize cognitive support for providers, patients, and their families over technology development for its own sake.

The second event occurred in March 2009, when the U.S. Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. Title XIII of the Act, also referred to as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, gave authority to the Department of Health and Human Services to offer incentives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_11113_911643_0_0_18/NHIN_Architecture_Overview_Draft_20100421.pdf "Nationwide Health Information Exchange Architecture Overview 2010"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, B. W., Ahern, D. K., &amp; Woods, S. S. (2011). Nudging best practice: the HITECH act and behavioral medicine. Translational Behavioral Medicine, 1(1), 175-181.&lt;/ref&gt; “Meaningful use”, rather than “use” measured in technological terms, was to be gauged in terms of outcomes for patients and their families.

In this context, a number of Federal agencies came together to convene the “Informatics for Consumer Health: Summit on Communication, Collaboration, and Quality,” &lt;ref&gt;[http://informaticsforconsumerhealth.org/index.php?q_2009_summit/summit_overview "Informatics for Consumer Health Summit Overview"].&lt;/ref&gt; in November 2009.  The summit brought together nearly 200 leaders from commercial IT, government, health care, education, research, and advocacy organizations to open a dialogue and begin creating a blueprint for improving health care quality through enhanced behavioral support for consumers across the healthcare spectrum. Key Summit objectives to foster collaborations and spur innovation led to the publication of a special supplement on cyberinfrastructure for consumer health in the ''American Journal of Preventative Medicine''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ajpmonline.org/issue/S0749-3797(11)X0005-3|title=American Journal of Preventive Medicine, May 2011, Volume 40, Issue 5 - Cyberinfrastructure for Consumer Health, Pages A1-A4, S91-S250|website=www.ajpmonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the development of the online Informatics for Consumer Health (ICH) platform in 2010.

For three years the platform, informaticsforconsumehealth.org, served as a rallying place for summit stakeholders representing a wide range of sectors to exchange resources that bridge information technology and health care, and improve behavioral support for all consumers. By sharing news, resources, and funding opportunities the ICH community helped disseminate information for facilitating collaboration among the public, private, and research communities to improve consumer health.

Goals of the ICH platform included:

# Serving as a clearinghouse of knowledge for use in the development of high-quality evidence based consumer and clinical health IT products.
# Creating an interactive portal where stakeholders could communicate and stay up to date on health IT research innovations and opportunities for collaboration and partnership.
# Learning from key stakeholders about available resources, projects, opportunities, and partnerships in consumer and clinical health IT to disseminate on the ICH platform.
# Providing a platform for conversation and collaboration around informatics for consumer health.

In 2013, the ICH platform was retired and all original content is now archived on the National Cancer Institute’s Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB) website.  As the science and practice of behavioral and public health informatics evolve, the activities and initiatives frequently aggregated and posted on the ICH platform continue to be a priority for the public and private sector.

'''Jesse's Journey''' ({{lang-fr|'''le Reve de Jesse'''}}) is a Canadian charity focused on funding research into [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]]. Founded in 1994 and named for Jesse Davidson, Jesse's Journey is based out of [[London, Ontario]] with a satellite office in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]]. Jesse's Journey is the only Canadian charity that solely exists to fund research into Duchenne.

== History ==
Jesse Davidson was six years old when he was diagnosed with [[Duchenne muscular dystrophy]]. 
In 1994, The Davidsons created The Foundation for Gene and Cell Therapy (known as Jesse's Journey). On May 20, 1995, Jesse's Journey began its first steps at the [[Manitoba]]/[[Ontario]] border. Jesse's father, John Davidson, walked 3,300 kilometres to [[Ottawa]], pushing Jesse in his wheelchair. This first journey raised $1.5M for research. Davidson is the holder of the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the fastest crossing of Canada on foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = John Davidson - The Right Road - Awards and Honours|url = http://therightroad.ca/awards.htm|website = therightroad.ca|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 1998 – Jesse's 18th birthday – Jesse's Journey: A Father's Tribute began. John Davidson's goal was to cross [[Canada]] on foot, raising funds and awareness across the country. Davidson succeeded in walking the 8,300 kilometres across Canada and raised $2M for research. This allowed The Foundation for Gene and Cell Therapy to create the Jesse Davidson Endowment – a fund that in 2015 stands at $11M and is a vehicle through which Jesse’s Journey can fund research in perpetuity, until a cure is found.

In 1998 Davidson and his mother Sherene along with Journey volunteer Mario Chioini flew to Paris, France to assist the French Association le Dystrophe Musculaire with their 30-hour telethon. The telethon generated $116,000,000.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

On November 6, 2009, at the age of 29, Davidson lost his battle&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jesse's journey ends|url = http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2009/11/07/11666431-sun.html|website = The London Free Press|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

On Christmas Eve 2009, one month after his son Jesse died, Davidson carried the Olympic Torch as London's final torch-bearer in the [[2010 Winter Olympics torch relay route|2010 Olympic Torch Relay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Olympic Torch departs London|url = http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2009/12/24/12264106.html|website = The London Free Press|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in honour of his son who had been named London's official torch-bearer earlier in the year.

== Research ==
Jesse's Journey is the only Canadian charity that solely exists to fund research into treatments and a cure for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Through a rigorous annual granting process, Jesse's Journey seeks to fund the most promising research from around the world. Proposals are peer-reviewed by external reviewers.

In 2015, the 20th anniversary of John and Jesse's journey across Ontario, Jesse's Journey reached a milestone by for the first time granting more than $1M in a single year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 20th Anniversary of Jesse’s Journey {{!}} (CFPL AM) AM 980|url = http://www.am980.ca/2015/05/24/20th-anniversary-of-jesses-journey/|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1413">A '''localized disease''' is an [[infection|infectious]] or [[neoplastic]] process that originates in and is confined to one [[organ system]] or general area in the body,&lt;ref&gt;Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary,28th edition. W.B.Saunders, Harcourt Brace &amp; Company&lt;/ref&gt; such as a [[sprain]]ed ankle, a [[boil]] on the hand, an [[abscess]] of finger.

A localized cancer that has not extended beyond the margins of the organ involved can also be described as localized disease, while cancers that extend into other tissues are described as invasive. Tumors that are non-hematologic in origin but extend into the bloodstream or lymphatic system are known as metastatic.

Localized diseases are contrasted with [[disseminated disease]]s and [[systemic disease]]s.  

Some diseases are capable of changing from local to disseminated diseases.  [[Pneumonia]], for example, is generally confined to one or both [[lungs]] but can become disseminated through [[sepsis]], in which the [[microbe]] responsible for the pneumonia "seeds" the [[bloodstream]] or [[lymphatic system]] and is transported to distant sites in the body. When that occurs, the process is no longer described as a localized disease, but rather as a disseminated disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15766">'''Low birth weight''' ('''LBW''') is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as a [[birth weight]] of a
infant of 2,499&amp;nbsp;g or less, regardless of gestational age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2010/en#/P07 P07 - Disorders related to short gestation and low birth weight] in [[ICD-10]]&lt;/ref&gt; Subcategories include '''very low birth weight''' (VLBW), which is less than 1500&amp;nbsp;g (3 pounds 5 ounces), and '''extremely low birth weight''' (ELBW), which is less than 1000&amp;nbsp;g (2 pounds 3 ounces).&lt;ref name="titleeMedicine - Extremely Low Birth Weight Infant : Article by KN Siva Subramanian, MD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicine.com/ped/topic2784.htm |title=eMedicine - Extremely Low Birth Weight Infant : Article by KN Siva Subramanian, MD |accessdate=2007-11-28 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal weight at term delivery is 2500–4200&amp;nbsp;g (5 pounds 8 ounces – 9 pounds 4 ounces).

==Causes==
LBW is either caused by [[preterm birth]] (that is, a low [[gestational age]] at birth, commonly defined as younger than 37 weeks of gestation) or the infant being [[small for gestational age]] (that is, a slow [[prenatal growth rate]]), or a combination of both.

In general, risk factors in the mother that may contribute to low birth weight include young ages, multiple pregnancies, previous LBW infants, poor nutrition, heart disease or [[hypertension]], untreated [[coeliac disease]], drug addiction, alcohol abuse, and insufficient [[prenatal care]]. Environmental risk factors include smoking, lead exposure, and other types of air pollutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umm.edu/pregnancy/000142.htm |title=Labor and delivery - Low Birth Weight |publisher=Umm.edu |date=2008-10-22 |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TersigniCastellani2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tersigni|first1=C.|last2=Castellani|first2=R.|last3=de Waure|first3=C.|last4=Fattorossi|first4=A.|last5=De Spirito|first5=M.|last6=Gasbarrini|first6=A.|last7=Scambia|first7=G.|last8=Di Simone|first8=N.|title=Celiac disease and reproductive disorders: meta-analysis of epidemiologic associations and potential pathogenic mechanisms|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=20|issue=4|year=2014|pages=582–593|issn=1355-4786|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu007|pmid=24619876}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SacconeBerghella2015&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Saccone G, Berghella V, Sarno L, Maruotti GM, Cetin I, Greco L, Khashan AS, McCarthy F, Martinelli D, Fortunato F, Martinelli P|title=Celiac disease and obstetric complications: a systematic review and metaanalysis |journal=Am J Obstet Gynecol |volume=214 |issue=2 |pages= 225–34|date= Oct 9, 2015 |pmid=26432464|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2015.09.080}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preterm birth===
{{Further|Preterm birth}}
Four different pathways have been identified that can result in preterm birth and have considerable evidence: precocious fetal endocrine activation, uterine overdistension, decidual bleeding, and intrauterine inflammation/infection.&lt;ref name=Simham2007&gt;
{{cite journal
 |vauthors=Simhan HN, Caritis SN |year=2007
 |title=Prevention of Preterm Delivery
 |journal=[[New England Journal of Medicine]]
 |volume=357
 |issue=5 |pages=477–487
 |pmid=17671256
 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra050435
}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a practical point a number of factors have been identified that are associated with preterm birth, however, an association does not establish causality.

===Being small for gestational age===
{{Further|Small for gestational age}}
Being [[small for gestational age]] can be constitutional, that is, without an underlying pathological cause, or it can be secondary to [[intrauterine growth restriction]], which, in turn, can be secondary to many possible factors. For example, babies with [[congenital anomalies]] or [[chromosomal abnormalities]] are often associated with LBW. Problems with the [[placenta]] can prevent it from providing adequate oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Infections during pregnancy that affect the fetus, such as [[rubella]], [[cytomegalovirus]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and [[syphilis]], may also affect the baby's weight.

===Environmental factors===
While active [[Smoking and pregnancy|maternal tobacco smoking]] has well established adverse [[perinatal]] outcomes such as LBW, that mothers who smoke during pregnancy are twice as likely to give birth to low-birth weight infants. Review on the effects of passive maternal smoking, also called environmental tobacco exposure (ETS), demonstrated that increased risks of infants with LBW were more likely to be expected in ETS-exposed mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Knopik VS. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and child outcomes: real or spurious effect? Dev Neuropsychol. 2009;34(1):1-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmasi G, Grady R, Jones J, et al. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure and perinatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analyses. Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2010;89(4):423-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding [[environmental toxins in pregnancy]], elevated blood lead levels in pregnant women, even those well below 10&amp;nbsp;ug/dL can cause [[miscarriage]], [[premature birth]], and LBW in the offspring. With 10&amp;nbsp;ug/dL as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's “level of concern”, this cut-off value really needs to arise more attentions and implementations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland LM, Minter ML, Cobb KA, et al. Lead hazards for pregnant women and children: part 1: immigrants and the poor shoulder most of the burden of lead exposure in this country. Part 1 of a two-part article details how exposure happens, whom it affects, and the harm it can do. Am J Nurs. 2008 Oct;108(10):40-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The combustion products of solid fuel in developing countries can cause many adverse health issues in people. Because a majority of pregnant women in developing countries, where rate of LBW is high, are heavily exposed to indoor air pollution, increased relative risk translates into substantial population attributable risk of 21% of LBW.&lt;ref&gt;Pope DP, Mishra V, Thompson L, et al. Risk of low birth weight and stillbirth associated with indoor air pollution from solid fuel use in developing countries. Epidemiol Rev. 2010 Apr;32(1):70-81&lt;/ref&gt;

One environmental exposure which has been found to increase the risk of low birth weight is [[Particulates|particulate matter]], a component of ambient [[air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants|title=Criteria Air Pollutants|last=EPA, OAR|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because particulate matter is composed of extremely small particles, even nonvisible levels can be inhaled and present harm to the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/air/particulate_matter.html|title=CDC - Air Quality - Particle Pollution|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particulate matter exposure can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, and impaired oxygen transport access to the placenta,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erickson|first=Anders C.|last2=Arbour|first2=Laura|date=2014-11-26|title=The Shared Pathoetiological Effects of Particulate Air Pollution and the Social Environment on Fetal-Placental Development|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/901017|journal=Journal of Environmental and Public Health|language=en|volume=2014|pages=1–20|doi=10.1155/2014/901017|issn=1687-9805|pmc=4276595|pmid=25574176}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are mechanisms for heightening the risk of low birth weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Pei-Chen|last2=Talbott|first2=Evelyn O.|last3=Roberts|first3=James M.|last4=Catov|first4=Janet M.|last5=Bilonick|first5=Richard A.|last6=Stone|first6=Roslyn A.|last7=Sharma|first7=Ravi K.|last8=Ritz|first8=Beate|date=2012-08-01|title=Ambient air pollution exposure and blood pressure changes during pregnancy|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935112001818|journal=Environmental Research|volume=117|pages=46–53|doi=10.1016/j.envres.2012.05.011|pmc=3656658|pmid=22835955|bibcode=2012ER....117...46L}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce exposure to particulate matter, pregnant women can monitor the EPA’s [[Air quality index|Air Quality Index]] and take personal precautionary measures such as reducing outdoor activity on low quality days, avoiding high-traffic roads/intersections, and/or wearing personal protective equipment (i.e., facial mask of industrial design). Indoor exposure to particulate matter can also be reduced through adequate ventilation, as well as use of clean heating and cooking methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oar/particlepollution/|title=Particulate matter|last=|first=|date=May 19, 2009|website=EPA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/risk/recordisplay.cfm?deid=216546|title=2009 Final Report: Integrated Science Assessment for Particulate Matter|last=Group|first=US EPA National Center for Environmental Assessment, Research Triangle Park Nc, Environmental Media Assessment|last2=Sacks|first2=Jason|website=cfpub.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A correlation between maternal exposure to CO and low birth weight has been reported that the effect on birth weight of increased ambient CO was as large as the effect of the mother smoking a pack of cigarettes per day during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Lewtas J. Air pollution combustion emissions: characterization of causative agents and mechanisms associated with cancer, reproductive, and cardiovascular effects. Mutat Res. 2007 Nov-Dec;636(1-3):95-133.&lt;/ref&gt;  
It has been revealed that adverse reproductive effects (e.g., risk for LBW) were correlated with maternal exposure to air pollution combustion emissions in Eastern Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Townsend CL, Maynard RL |date=Oct 2002  | title = Effects on health of prolonged exposure to low concentrations of carbon monoxide | url = | journal = Occup Environ Med | volume = 59 | issue = 10| pages = 708–11 | doi=10.1136/oem.59.10.708 | pmid=12356933 | pmc=1740215}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mercury is a known toxic heavy metal that can harm fetal growth and health, and there has been evidence showing that exposure to mercury (via consumption of large [[oily fish]]) during pregnancy may be related to higher risks of LBW in the offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gochfeld M, Burger J |date=Aug 2005  | title = Good fish/bad fish: a composite benefit-risk by dose curve | url = | journal = Neurotoxicology | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 511–20 | doi=10.1016/j.neuro.2004.12.010|pmid=15979722  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed that, exposure of pregnant women to airplane noise was found to be associated with low birth weight. Aircraft noise exposure caused adverse effects on fetal growth leading to low birth weight and preterm infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kawada T |date=Feb 2004  | title = The effect of noise on the health of children | url = | journal = J Nippon Med Sch. | volume = 71 | issue = 1| pages = 5–10 | doi=10.1272/jnms.71.5|pmid=15129589  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Matsui T, Matsuno T, Ashimine K, etal |date=Sep 2003  | title = Association between the rates of low birth-weight and/or preterm infants and aircraft noise exposure | url = | journal = Nippon Eiseigaku Zasshi | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 385–94 | doi=10.1265/jjh.58.385|pmid=14533568  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Periodontal health==
Low birthweight, pre-term birth and pre-eclampsia have been associated with maternal periodontitis exposure. But the strength of the observed associations is inconsistent and vary according to the population studied, the means of periodontal assessment and the periodontal disease classification employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanz|first1=M|title=Periodontitis and adverse pregnancy outcomes: consensus report of the Joint EFP/AAP Workshop on Periodontitis and Systemic Diseases|journal=J Periodontol|date=April 2013|volume=84|issue=4 suppl|page=S164–9|doi=10.1902/jop.2013.1340016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the best is that the risk of low birth weight can be reduced with very simple therapy. Treatment of periodontal disease during gestation period is safe and reduction in inflammatory burden reduces the risk of preterm birth as well as low birth weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shah|first1=Monali|title=Effect of nonsurgical periodontal therapy during gestation period on adverse pregnancy outcome: a systematic review|journal=J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med|date=November 2013|volume=26|issue=17|pages=1691–5|doi=10.3109/14767058.2013.799662|pmid=23617740}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
LBW is closely associated with fetal and [[Perinatal mortality]] and [[Morbidity]], inhibited growth and cognitive development, and chronic diseases later in life. At the population level, the proportion of babies with a LBW is an indicator of a multifaceted public-health problem that includes long-term maternal malnutrition, ill health, hard work and poor health care in pregnancy. On an individual basis, LBW is an important predictor of newborn health and survival and is associated with higher risk of infant and childhood mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stevens-Simon C, Orleans M |date=Sep 1999  | title = Low-birthweight prevention programs: the enigma of failure | url = | journal = Birth | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 184–91 | doi=10.1046/j.1523-536x.1999.00184.x|pmid=10655819  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low birth weight constitutes as sixty to eighty percent of the [[infant mortality]] rate in developing countries. Infant mortality due to low birth weight is usually directly causal, stemming from other medical complications such as preterm birth, poor maternal nutritional status, lack of [[prenatal care]], maternal sickness during pregnancy, and an unhygienic home environment.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Andrews|first=K.M.|author2=Brouillette, D.B |author3=Brouillette, R.T. |encyclopedia=

==Epidemiology==
A study by the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] (AHRQ) found that of the 3.8 million births that occurred in the United States in 2011, approximately 6.1% (231,900) were diagnosed with low birth weight (&lt;2,500 g).  Approximately 49,300 newborns (1.3%) weighed less than 1,500 grams (VLBW).&lt;ref&gt;Kowlessar N.M., Jiang H.J., and Steiner C. Hospital Stays for Newborns, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #163.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7453">'''Medical Officer of Health''', '''Medical Health Officer''' or '''District Medical Officer''', is a title and commonly used for the senior government official of a [[health department]] or agency, usually at a [[municipal government|municipal]], county/district, state/province, or regional level. The post is held by a [[physician]] who serves to advise and lead a team of public health professionals such as [[environmental health officer]]s and [[public health nurse]]s on matters of [[public health]] importance.

The equivalent senior health official at the national level is often referred to as the [[Chief Medical Officer]], although the title varies across countries, for example known as the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] in the United States and the [[Chief Public Health Officer of Canada|Chief Public Health Officer]] in Canada.

In Canada, all communities are under the jurisdiction of an MOH. The roles of the MOH vary across jurisdictions, but always include responsibilities related to public health and safety, and may include the following functions:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/finance/_agree-accord/initiative_transfer/index-eng.php ''Role of the Medical Officer of Health.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101030321/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fniah-spnia/pubs/finance/_agree-accord/initiative_transfer/index-eng.php |date=2012-01-01 }} Health Canada, accessed 16 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Health officers in India are expected to have prescribed qualifications, such as a Bachelor of Sanitary Science (B.S.Sc.), a degree of an institution recognized by the [[Medical Council of India]] or a diploma in Public Health after a 2-year study at the [[University of Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notification No:22/2014 Health Officer in the Tamil Nadu Public Health Service, 2013-2014|url=http://www.tnpsc.gov.in/notifications/22_2014_not_eng_Health_Officer.pdf|publisher=TAMIL NADU PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION|accessdate=8 November 2015|pages=14|format=pdf|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the municipal position was an elected head of the [[local board of health]], however the term MOH has also been used to refer to the [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Officer]]. Under the [[Metropolis Local Management Act 1855]], London municipalities were each required to appoint a medical officer. In 1856, 48 officers took up appointments in the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Epidemic Streets: Infectious Disease and the Rise of Preventive Medicine | page = 4 | author = Anne Hardy | year = 1993 | isbn = 0-19-820377-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these specialists formed [[Metropolitan Association of Medical Officers of Health]].

The '''medical–industrial complex''' is the network of [[corporations]] which supply [[health care]] services and products for a profit. The term is analogous to "[[military–industrial complex]]" and builds from the social precedent of discussion on that concept.

The medical–industrial complex is often discussed in the context of [[conflict of interest in the health care industry]].

==Term==
The concept of a "medical–industrial complex" was first advanced  by Barbara and John Ehrenreich in the November 1969 issue of the Bulletin of the Health Policy Advisory Center in an article entitled "The Medical Industrial Complex" and in a subsequent book (with Health-PAC), The American Health Empire: Power, Profits, and Politics (Random House, 1970). The concept was widely discussed throughout the 1970s, including reviews in the New England Journal of Medicine (November 4, 1971, 285:1095). It was further popularized in 1980, [[Arnold S. Relman]] while he served as editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]''.&lt;ref name="Relman1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Relman |first1=Arnold S. |title=The New Medical-Industrial Complex |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=303|issue=17 |year=1980 |pages=963–970|issn=0028-4793 |doi=10.1056/NEJM198010233031703}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a paper titled "The New Medical-Industrial Complex." Relman commented, "The past decade has seen the rise of another kind of private "industrial complex" with an equally great potential for influence on public policy — this time in health care..." Oddly, Relman added, " In searching for information on this subject, I have found no standard literature and have had to draw on a variety of unconventional sources..."&lt;ref name="Relman1980"/&gt; Subsequently, this paper and the concept have been discussed continually.&lt;ref name="MalinaRosenbaum2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malina|first1=Debra|last2=Rosenbaum|first2=Lisa|title=Understanding Bias — The Case for Careful Study|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=372|issue=20|year=2015|pages=1959–1963|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMms1502497|pmid=25970055}}&lt;/ref&gt; An updated history and analysis can be found in John Ehrenreich, "Third Wave Capitalism: How Money, Power, and the Pursuit of Self-Interest have Imperiled the American Dream" (Cornell University Press, May 2016).

==Characteristics==
Manufacturers of [[medical device]]s fund medical education programs and physicians and hospitals directly to adopt the use of their devices.&lt;ref name="BaggishNezhat1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baggish|first1=Michaels.|last2=Nezhat|first2=Camran|title=The Medical–Industrial Complex|journal=Journal of Gynecologic Surgery|volume=8|issue=3|year=1992|pages=v–vi|issn=1042-4067|doi=10.1089/gyn.1992.8.v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The management of [[health care organization]]s by business staff rather than local medical practice is one of the trends of the increasing influence of the medical-industrial complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maloney |first1=FP |title=The emerging medical/industrial complex. The industrialization of medicine. |journal=Physician Executive|date= 1998 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=34–8 |pmid=10180498}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend is that increased pressure to generate profit for providing services can decrease the influence of creativity or innovation in medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=CW|last2=Glatstein|first2=E|title=Beware the Medical-Industrial Complex.|journal=The Oncologist|date=1996|volume=1|issue=4|pages=IV-V|pmid=10388005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s profit-seeking companies became significant stakeholders in the [[Health care in the United States|United States healthcare]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buchanan|first1=Robert J.|title=The Financial Status of the New Medical-Industrial Complex|journal=[[Inquiry (health journal)|Inquiry]]|date=Winter 1982|volume=19|issue=4|pages=308–316|jstor=29771516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of economic policy on the practice of medicine has a long history.&lt;ref name="JupiterBurke2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jupiter|first1=Jesse|last2=Burke|first2=Dennis|title=Scott’s parabola and the rise of the medical–industrial complex|journal=HAND|volume=8|issue=3|year=2013|pages=249–252|issn=1558-9447|doi=10.1007/s11552-013-9526-5|pmc=3745238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] regulates international marketplaces, in countries where the industrial-medical complex is more strong there can be legal limitations to consumer options for accessing diverse healthcare services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Santos|first1=MA|last2=Passos|first2=SR|title=[International trade in health services and the medical industrial complex: implications for national health systems].|journal=Cadernos de Saúde Pública|date=August 2010|volume=26|issue=8|pages=1483–93|pmid=21229208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the industrial-medical complex funds [[continuing medical education]], this education has a bias to promote the interests of its funders.&lt;ref name="Schofferman2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schofferman|first1=Jerome|title=The Medical-Industrial Complex, Professional Medical Associations, and Continuing Medical Education|journal=Pain Medicine|volume=12|issue=12|year=2011|pages=1713–1719|issn=1526-2375|doi=10.1111/j.1526-4637.2011.01282.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nutrient''' is a [[Chemical substance|substance]] used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce. The requirement for dietary nutrient intake applies to [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], and [[protist]]s. Nutrients can be incorporated into cells for [[metabolism|metabolic purposes]] or [[excretion|excreted]] by cells to create non-cellular structures, such as [[hair]], [[scale (anatomy)|scales]], [[feather]]s, or [[exoskeleton]]s. Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, such as for [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and [[fermentation]] products ([[ethanol]] or [[vinegar]]), leading to end-products of water and [[carbon dioxide]]. All organisms require water. Essential nutrients for animals are the energy sources, some of the [[amino acid]]s that are combined to create [[protein]]s, a subset of [[fatty acid]]s, [[vitamin]]s and certain [[mineral (nutrient)|minerals]]. Plants require more diverse minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed through leaves. [[fungus|Fungi]] live on dead or living organic matter and meet nutrient needs from their host.

Different types of organism have different essential nutrients. Ascorbic acid ([[vitamin C]]) is essential, meaning it must be consumed in sufficient amounts, to humans and some other animal species, but not to all animals and not to plants, which are able to synthesize it. Nutrients may be [[organic compound|organic]] or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as [[iron]], [[selenium]], and [[zinc]], while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.

A classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] and [[micronutrient]]s. Consumed in relatively large amounts ([[gram]]s or [[ounce]]s), macronutrients ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts ([[milligram]]s or [[microgram]]s); they have subtle [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[physiology|physiological]] roles in cellular processes, like [[vascular smooth muscle|vascular functions]] or [[action potential|nerve conduction]]. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction. Consumer advisories for dietary nutrient intakes, such as the United States [[Dietary Reference Intake]], are based on deficiency outcomes{{clarify|date=January 2018}} and provide macronutrient and micronutrient guides for both lower and [[Tolerable upper intake levels|upper limits]] of intake. In many countries, macronutrients and micronutrients in significant content{{clarify|date=January 2018}} are required by regulations to be displayed on food product labels. Nutrients in larger quantities than the body needs may have harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Audrey H. Ensminger|title=Foods &amp; nutrition encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XMA9gYIj-C4C&amp;pg=PA527|accessdate=12 October 2010|year=1994|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-8980-1|pages=527–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edible plants also contain thousands of compounds generally called [[phytochemical]]s which have unknown effects on disease or health, including a diverse class with non-nutrient status called [[polyphenol]]s, which remain poorly understood as of 2017.

Plant nutrients consist of more than a dozen minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed or released through leaves. All organisms obtain all their nutrients from the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=WhitneyRolfes2005&gt;Whitney, Elanor and Sharon Rolfes. 2005. ''Understanding Nutrition, 10th edition'', p. 6.

==Plant nutrition==
{{main|Plant nutrition|Fertilizer}}
Plants absorb carbon, hydrogen and oxygen from air. These three, in the form of water and [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="Jones1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Benton Jones|title=Plant nutrition manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rNP2exwYMJIC&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=14 October 2010|year=1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-884015-31-1|pages=34–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nutrients are absorbed from soil (exceptions include some parasitic or carnivorous plants). Counting these, there are 17 important nutrients for plants:&lt;ref name="BarkerPilbeam2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Allen V. Barker|author2=D. J. Pilbeam|title=Handbook of plant nutrition|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?id=ZWjLBQAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions|accessdate=17 August 2010|year=2007|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8247-5904-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the macronutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), magnesium (Mg), carbon (C), oxygen(O) and hydrogen (H), and the micronutrients iron (Fe), boron (B), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo) and nickel (Ni). In addition to carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulfur]] are also needed in relatively large quantities. Together, the "Big Six" are the elemental '''macronutrients''' for all [[biological life|organisms]].&lt;ref name=wsj20101203&gt;
[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703377504575650840897300342?mod=ITP_pageone_1#printMode New Link in Chain of Life], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 2010-12-03, accessed 2010-12-05. "Until now, however, they were all thought to share the same biochemistry, based on the Big Six, to build proteins, fats and DNA."&lt;/ref&gt;
They are sourced from inorganic matter (for example, [[carbon dioxide]], [[water]], [[nitrate]]s, [[phosphate]]s, [[sulfate]]s, and [[diatomic molecule]]s of nitrogen and, especially, oxygen) and organic matter ([[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s).

==Types of nutrients==
{{main|Nutrition}}

===Macronutrients===
Macronutrients are defined in several ways.&lt;ref name="Kern2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Kern|title=CRC desk reference on sports  nutrition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOYqeeXWomwC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=12 October 2010|date=12 May 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-2273-0|pages=117–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[chemical element]]s humans consume in the largest quantities are [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[phosphorus]], and [[sulphur]], summarized as [[CHNOPS]].
* The chemical compounds that humans consume in the largest quantities and provide bulk energy are classified as [[carbohydrate]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[fat]]s. Water must be also consumed in large quantities.
* [[Calcium]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[chloride]] ions, along with phosphorus and sulfur, are listed with [[list of macronutrients|macronutrients]] because they are required in large quantities compared to [[micronutrient]]s, i.e., vitamins and other minerals, the latter often described as trace or ultratrace minerals.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Macronutrients provide energy:

* [[Carbohydrate]]s are compounds made up of types of [[sugar]]. Carbohydrates are classified according to their number of sugar units: [[monosaccharide]]s (such as [[glucose]] and [[fructose]]), [[disaccharide]]s (such as [[sucrose]] and [[lactose]]), [[oligosaccharide]]s, and [[polysaccharide]]s (such as [[starch]], [[glycogen]], and [[cellulose]]).
* [[Protein]]s are [[organic compound]]s that consist of [[amino acid]]s joined by [[peptide bond]]s. Since the body cannot manufacture some of the [[amino acid]]s (termed [[essential amino acid]]s), the diet must supply them. Through digestion, [[protein]]s are [[protein catabolism|broken down]] by [[protease]]s back into free amino acids.
* [[Fat]]s consist of a [[glycerin]] molecule with three [[fatty acid]]s attached. Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched [[hydrocarbon]] chains connected by single bonds alone ([[Saturated fat|saturated fatty acids]]) or by both double and single bonds ([[Unsaturated fat|unsaturated fatty acids]]). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of [[cell membrane]]s, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed [[essential fatty acid]]s), they must be obtained through one's diet.

Fat has an [[energy]] content of 9{{nbsp}}[[kcal]]/g (~37.7 kJ/g) and proteins and carbohydrates 4{{nbsp}}kcal/g (~16.7 kJ/g).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Micronutrients===
Micronutrients support metabolism.

* [[Dietary mineral]]s are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron. Some of these minerals are essential to human metabolism.
* [[Vitamin]]s are organic compounds essential to the body. They usually act as [[coenzyme]]s or [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for various proteins in the body.

An '''essential nutrient''' is a nutrient required for normal physiological function that cannot be synthesized in the body&amp;nbsp;– either at all or in sufficient quantities&amp;nbsp;– and thus must be obtained from a [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://library.med.utah.edu/NetBiochem/nutrition/lect1/2_1.html | title = What is an essential nutrient? | publisher = NetBiochem Nutrition, [[University of Utah]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VaughanGeissler2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Griffith Vaughan|author2=Catherine Geissler|author3=Barbara Nicholson |author4=Elisabeth Dowle |author5=Elizabeth Rice|title=The new Oxford book of food plants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdKxFcen8zgC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=13 October 2010|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-954946-7|pages=212–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from [[water]], which is universally required for the maintenance of [[homeostasis]] in mammals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jéquier|first1=E|last2=Constant|first2=F|title=Water as an essential nutrient: the physiological basis of hydration|journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=2 September 2009|volume=64|issue=2|pages=115–123|doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.111|url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v64/n2/pdf/ejcn2009111a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; essential nutrients are indispensable for various cellular [[metabolic process]]es and maintaining tissue and organ function.&lt;ref name="AJCN"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chipponi|first1=JX|last2=Bleier|first2=JC|last3=Santi|first3=MT|last4=Rudman|first4=D|title=Deficiencies of essential and conditionally essential nutrients.|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=May 1982|volume=35|issue=5 Suppl|pages=1112–1116|pmid=6805293|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/35/5/1112.long}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of humans, there are nine [[amino acid]]s, two [[fatty acid]]s, thirteen [[vitamin]]s and fifteen [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] that are considered essential nutrients.&lt;ref name="AJCN" /&gt; In addition, there are several molecules that are considered conditionally essential nutrients since they are indispensable in certain developmental and pathological states.&lt;ref name="AJCN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Carver"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carver|first1=Jane|title=Neonatal Nutrition and Metabolism|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=299–311|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511544712.020|chapter=Conditionally essential nutrients: choline, inositol, taurine, arginine, glutamine and nucleotides}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kendler|first1=BS|title=Supplemental conditionally essential nutrients in cardiovascular disease therapy|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing|date=2006|volume=21|issue=1|pages=9–16|pmid=16407731|doi=10.1097/00005082-200601000-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amino acids====
{{Main|Essential amino acid}}
An essential amino acid is an [[amino acid]] that is required by an organism but cannot be synthesized ''[[de novo synthesis|de novo]]'' by it, and therefore must be supplied in its diet. Out of the twenty standard protein-producing amino acids, nine cannot be [[endogenous]]ly synthesized by humans: [[phenylalanine]], [[valine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], [[methionine]], [[leucine]], [[isoleucine]], [[lysine]], and [[histidine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Young VR |title=Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=124 |issue=8 Suppl |pages=1517S–1523S |year=1994 |pmid=8064412 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/124/8_Suppl/1517S.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DRI"&gt;Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements, published by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board, currently available online at {{cite web |url=http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705140516/http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |archivedate=2014-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fatty acids====
{{Main|Essential fatty acid}}
Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are [[fatty acid]]s that humans and other animals must ingest because the body requires them for good health but cannot [[Biosynthesis|synthesize]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | edition = 6th | year = 1980 |author1=Robert S. Goodhart |author2=Maurice E. Shils | publisher = Lea and Febinger | location = Philadelphia | isbn = 0-8121-0645-8 | pages = 134–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only two fatty acids are known to be essential for humans: [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (an [[omega-3 fatty acid]]) and [[linoleic acid]] (an [[omega-6 fatty acid]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Whitney Ellie |author2=Rolfes SR | title = Understanding Nutrition | edition = 11th | location = California | publisher = Thomson Wadsworth | year = 2008 | pages = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vitamins====
{{Main|Vitamin}}
Vitamins are organic molecules essential for an organism that are not classified as [[amino acid]]s or [[fatty acid]]s. They commonly function as [[enzymatic cofactor]]s, metabolic regulators or [[antioxidant]]s. Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, most of which are actually groups of related molecules (e.g. [[vitamin E]] includes [[tocopherol]]s and [[tocotrienol]]s):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brigelius-Flohé R, Traber MG | title = Vitamin E: function and metabolism | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 13 | issue = 10 | pages = 1145–1155 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10385606 | last2 = Traber | doi=10.1096/fasebj.13.10.1145}}&lt;/ref&gt; vitamins A, C, D, E, K, [[thiamine]] (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), [[riboflavin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[niacin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[pantothenic acid]] (B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] (e.g., [[pyridoxine]]), [[biotin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;), [[folate]] (B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[cobalamin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). The requirement for vitamin D is conditional, as people who get sufficient exposure to ultraviolet light, either from the sun or an artificial source, synthesize vitamin D in the skin.

====Minerals====
{{Main|Mineral (nutrient)}}
Minerals are the [[exogenous]] [[chemical element]]s indispensable for life. Although the four elements: [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]], are essential for life, they are so plentiful in food and drink that these are not considered nutrients and there are no recommended intakes for these as minerals. The need for nitrogen is addressed by requirements set for protein, which is composed of nitrogen-containing amino acids. [[Sulfur]] is essential, but again does not have a recommended intake. Instead, recommended intakes are identified for the sulfur-containing amino acids methionine and cysteine.

The essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (expressed as a mass), are [[potassium]], [[chlorine]], [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[phosphorus]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[copper]], [[iodine]], [[chromium]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[cobalt]] (the last as a component of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). There are other minerals which are essential for some plants and animals, but may or may not be essential for humans, such as [[boron]] and [[silicon]].

===Conditionally essential nutrients===
Conditionally essential nutrients are certain organic molecules that can normally be synthesized by an organism, but under certain conditions in insufficient quantities. In humans, such conditions include [[Preterm birth|premature birth]], limited nutrient intake, rapid growth, and certain disease states.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt; [[Choline]], [[inositol]], [[taurine]], [[arginine]], [[glutamine]] and [[nucleotides]] are classified as conditionally essential and are particularly important in neonatal diet and metabolism.&lt;ref name="Carver" /&gt;

=== Non-essential nutrients ===
Non-essential nutrients are substances within foods that can have a significant impact on health; these substances can be beneficial or toxic.{{mcn|date=January 2018}} For example, [[dietary fiber]] is not absorbed in the human digestive tract, but is important in maintaining the bulk of a [[bowel movement]] to avoid [[constipation]].{{mcn|date=January 2018}} A subset of dietary fiber, [[soluble fiber]], can be metabolized by bacteria residing in the large intestine.&lt;ref name="Butyrate synthesis pathways" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lupton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prebiotic digestion" /&gt; Soluble fiber is marketed as serving a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] function{{snd}}promoting "healthy" intestinal bacteria.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Bacterial metabolism of soluble fiber also produces [[short-chain fatty acid]]s like [[butyric acid]], which may be absorbed into intestinal cells as a source of calories.&lt;ref name="Butyrate synthesis pathways"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vital M, Howe AC, Tiedje JM | title = Revealing the bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways by analyzing (meta)genomic data | journal = mBio | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e00889 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24757212 | pmc = 3994512 | doi = 10.1128/mBio.00889-14 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lupton"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lupton JR | title = Microbial degradation products influence colon cancer risk: the butyrate controversy | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 134 | issue = 2 | pages = 479–482 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14747692 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/134/2/479 | doi=10.1093/jn/134.2.479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prebiotic digestion"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cummings JH, Macfarlane GT, Englyst HN | title = Prebiotic digestion and fermentation | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 73 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 415S-420S | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11157351 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-nutrients===
[[Ethanol]] (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OH) supplies calories. For spirits (vodka, gin, rum, etc.) a standard serving in the United States is {{convert|1.5|USfloz|ml}}, which at 40%{{nbsp}}ethanol (80{{nbsp}}proof) would be 14 grams and 98 calories. At 50%{{nbsp}}alcohol, 17.5{{nbsp}}grams and 122.5{{nbsp}}calories. Wine and beer contain a similar amount of ethanol in servings of {{convert|5|USfloz|ml}} and {{convert|12|USfloz|ml}}, respectively, but these beverages also contain non-ethanol calories. A 5-ounce serving of wine contains 100 to 130 calories. A 12-ounce serving of beer contains 95 to 200 calories.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, based on [[NHANES]] 2013–2014 surveys, women ages 20 and up consume on average 6.8{{nbsp}}grams of alcohol per day and men consume on average 15.5 grams per day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf "What We Eat in America, NHANES 2013-2014"]&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring the non-alcohol contribution of those beverages, the average ethanol calorie contributions are 48 and 108 cal/day, respectively.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Alcoholic beverages are considered [[empty calorie]] foods because, other than calories, they contribute no essential nutrients.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

By definition, [[phytochemical]]s include all nutritional and non-nutritional components of edible plants.&lt;ref name="lpi1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phytochemicals|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included as nutritional constituents are [[provitamin]] A [[carotenoid]]s,&lt;ref name="lpi2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carotenoids|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas those without nutrient status are diverse [[polyphenol]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, [[resveratrol]], and [[lignan]]s &amp;ndash; often claimed to have [[antioxidant]] effects &amp;ndash; that are present in numerous plant foods.&lt;ref name="lpi3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Flavonoids|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/flavonoids|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of phytochemical compounds are under preliminary research for their potential effects on human diseases and health.&lt;ref name="lpi1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lpi2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=lpi3/&gt; However, the qualification for nutrient status of compounds with poorly defined properties ''[[in vivo]]'' is that they must first be defined with a [[Dietary Reference Intake]] level to enable accurate food labeling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrient content claims--general principles; 21CFR101.13|url=https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.13|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=31 December 2017|date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condition not established for most phytochemicals that are claimed to be antioxidant nutrients.&lt;ref name="nutra"&gt;{{cite web |title= New Roles for Polyphenols.

==Deficiencies and toxicity==
''See [[Vitamin]], [[Mineral (nutrient)]], [[Protein (nutrient)]]''

An inadequate amount of a nutrient is a deficiency. Deficiencies can be due to a number of causes including an inadequacy in nutrient intake, called a dietary deficiency, or any of several conditions that interfere with the utilization of a nutrient within an organism.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"/&gt; Some of the conditions that can interfere with nutrient utilization include problems with nutrient absorption, substances that cause a greater than normal need for a nutrient, conditions that cause nutrient destruction, and conditions that cause greater nutrient excretion.&lt;ref name="Ensminger1994"/&gt; Nutrient toxicity occurs when excess consumption of a nutrient does harm to an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Nutrient Toxicity|journal=Nutrition Reviews|volume=39|issue=6|pages=249–256|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.1981.tb07453.x|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Canada, recommended dietary intake levels of essential nutrients are based on the minimum level that "will maintain a defined level of nutriture in an individual", a definition somewhat different from that used by the [[World Health Organization]] and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of a "basal requirement to indicate the level of intake needed to prevent pathologically relevant and clinically detectable signs of a dietary inadequacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to Dietary Reference Intakes.

In setting human nutrient guidelines, government organizations do not necessarily agree on amounts needed to avoid deficiency or maximum amounts to avoid the risk of toxicity.&lt;ref name=DRITable&gt;[http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Nutrition/DRI-Tables/5Summary%20TableTables%2014.pdf?la=en Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)] Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JapanDRI&gt;[http://www.nibiohn.go.jp/eiken/info/pdf/dris2010en.pdf Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese (2010)] National Institute of Health and Nutrition, Japan&lt;/ref&gt; For example, for [[vitamin C]], recommended intakes range from 40&amp;nbsp;mg/day in India&lt;ref name="NIN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://icmr.nic.in/final/rda-2010.pdf |title=Nutrient Requirements and Recommended Dietary Allowances for Indians: A Report of the Expert Group of the Indian Council of Medical Research. pp.283-295 (2009) |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615094048/http://icmr.nic.in/final/RDA-2010.pdf |archivedate=June 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 155&amp;nbsp;mg/day for the European Union.&lt;ref name=EFSA-Recommended&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies |year=2017 |url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828082247/https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf |archivedate=August 28, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below shows U.S. Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for vitamins and minerals, PRIs for the European Union (same concept as RDAs), followed by what three government organizations deem to be the safe upper intake. RDAs are set higher than EARs to cover people with higher than average needs. Adequate Intakes (AIs) are set when there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs. Governments are slow to revise information of this nature. For the U.S. values, with the exception of calcium and vitamin D, all of the data date to 1997-2004.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

*For niacin and magnesium there appears to be a contradiction inherent in the information in the table, as the amounts recommended for daily consumption can be more than the amounts identified as the safe upper limits. For both nutrients, the ULs identify the amounts which will not increase risk of adverse effects when the nutrients are consumed as a serving of a dietary supplement. Magnesium above the UL may cause diarrhea. Niacin above the UL may cause flushing of the face and a sensation of body warmth. Each country or regional regulatory agency decides on a safety margin below when symptoms may occur, so the ULs can differ.&lt;ref name=DRITable /&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA /&gt;

'''EAR''' U.S. Estimated Average Requirements.

'''RDA''' U.S. Recommended Dietary Allowances; higher for adults than for children, and may be even higher for women who are pregnant or lactating.

'''AI'''  U.S. Adequate Intake; AIs established when there is not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs.

'''PRI''' Population Reference Intake is European Union equivalent of RDA; higher for adults than for children, and may be even higher for women who are pregnant or lactating. For Thiamin and Niacin the PRIs are expressed as amounts per MJ of calories consumed. MJ = megajoule = 239 food calories.

'''Upper Limit'''  Tolerable upper intake levels.

'''ND'''  ULs have not been determined.

'''NE'''  EARs, PRIs or AIs have not yet been established or will not be (EU does not consider chromium an essential nutrient).

'''Nutrition and pregnancy''' refers to the nutrient intake, and dietary planning that is undertaken before, during and after pregnancy. Nutrition of the fetus begins at conception. For this reason, the nutrition of the mother is important from before conception (probably several months before) as well as throughout pregnancy and breast feeding. An ever-increasing number of studies have shown that the nutrition of the mother will have an effect on the child, up to and including the risk for cancer, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes throughout life.

An inadequate or excessive amount of some nutrients may cause malformations or medical problems in the fetus, and neurological disorders and handicaps are a risk that is run by mothers who are malnourished.&lt;ref name="mary_e_barasi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barasi EM |year=2003 |title=Human Nutrition - A Health Perspective |location=London |publisher=Arnold |isbn=0-340-81025-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 24% of babies worldwide are born with lower than optimal weights at birth due to lack of proper nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/nutrition/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; 10 facts on nutrition |publisher=World Health Organization |date=2011-03-15 |accessdate=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal habits such as consumption of alcohol or large amounts of caffeine can negatively and irreversibly affect the development of the baby, which happens in the early stages of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Riley&gt;{{cite book|title=Pregnancy: The Ultimate Week-by-Week Pregnancy Guide|publisher=Meredith Books|isbn=0-696-22221-3|pages=21–22| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7BKtTKqAQcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pregnancy+books&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_B58Tv6iCYO3rAeuvbT0Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pregnancy%20books&amp;f=false|author=Riley L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caffeine]] consumption during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of pregnancy loss.&lt;ref name=Chen2016/&gt; The available research favors the notion that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweigh the risks; however, the type of fish is important.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Folic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin folate, is critical both in pre-and peri-conception.&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt; 

==Nutrition before pregnancy==

As with most diets, there are chances of over-supplementing, however, as general advice, both state and medical recommendations are that mothers follow instructions listed on particular vitamin packaging as to the correct or recommended daily allowance (RDA). Daily prenatal use of iron substantially improves birth weight, potentially reducing the risk of [[Low birth weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Haider, BA, Olofin, I, Wang, M|title= Anaemia, prenatal iron use, and risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal=British Medical Journal | volume=21| year=2013|doi=10.1136/bmj.f3443|display-authors=etal| pages=f3443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Folic acid]] supplementation is recommended prior to conception, to prevent development of [[spina bifida]] and other [[neural tube defect]]s. It should be taken as at least 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg/day throughout the first [[Trimesters|trimester]] of pregnancy, 0.6&amp;nbsp;mg/day through the pregnancy, and 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/day while breastfeeding in  addition to eating foods rich in folic acid such as green leafy vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drugs During Pregnancy and Lactation: Handbook of Prescription Drugs and Comparative Risk Assessment|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CE569saGK70C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=folic+acid+pregnancy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0jFTVe7zGMW6ggSTqoDACA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=folic%20acid%20pregnancy&amp;f=false|publisher = Gulf Professional Publishing|date = 2001|access-date = 2015-05-13|isbn = 9780444507631|first = Christof|last = Schaefer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iodine]] levels are frequently too low in pregnant women, and iodine is necessary for normal thyroid function and mental development of the fetus, even [[cretinism]]. Pregnant women should take prenatal vitamins containing iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=S5oCjZZZ1ggC&amp;pg=PA303&amp;dq=iodine+levels+pregnancy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vTBTVa39KImegwTB9oG4CQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=iodine%20levels%20pregnancy&amp;f=false|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2006|access-date = 2015-05-13|isbn = 9780781741330|first = Maurice Edward|last = Shils|first2 = Moshe|last2 = Shike}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vitamin D]] levels vary with exposure to sunlight. While it was assumed that supplementation was necessary only in areas of high latitudes, recent studies of Vitamin D levels throughout the United States and many other countries have shown a large number of women with low levels. For this reason, there is a growing movement to recommend supplementation with 1000&amp;nbsp;IU of Vitamin D daily throughout pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Association between maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level and pregnancy and neonatal outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|journal = BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date = 2013|issn = 1756-1833|pmid = 23533188|pages = f1169|volume = 346|first = Fariba|last = Aghajafari|first2 = Tharsiya|last2 = Nagulesapillai|first3 = Paul E.|last3 = Ronksley|first4 = Suzanne C.|last4 = Tough|first5 = Maeve|last5 = O'Beirne|first6 = Doreen M.|last6 = Rabi|doi=10.1136/bmj.f1169}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A large number of pregnant women have been found to have low levels of  [[vitamin B12]], but supplementation has not yet been shown to improve pregnancy outcome or the health of the newborn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation: A Reference Guide to Fetal and Neonatal Risk|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OIgTE4aynrMC&amp;pg=PA1573&amp;dq=vitamin+b12+pregnancy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PDFTVcPCM9HxggSRz4H4Cw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vitamin%20b12%20pregnancy&amp;f=false|publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|date = 2011|access-date = 2015-05-13|isbn = 9781608317080|first = Gerald G.|last = Briggs|first2 = Roger K.|last2 = Freeman|first3 = Sumner J.|last3 = Yaffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, specifically [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA) and [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), are beneficial for fetal development. Several studies have shown lower risk of preterm delivery and low birth weight in mothers with higher intakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effect of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid intake during pregnancy on maternal, infant, and child health outcomes: a systematic review|journal = Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology|date = Jul 2012|issn = 1365-3016|pmid = 22742604|pages = 91–107|volume = 26 Suppl 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3016.2012.01292.x|first = Beth|last = Imhoff-Kunsch|first2 = Virginia|last2 = Briggs|first3 = Tamar|last3 = Goldenberg|first4 = Usha|last4 = Ramakrishnan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Effects of n-3 fatty acids during pregnancy and lactation|journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date = Jun 2006|issn = 0002-9165|pmid = 16841854|pages = 1452S-1457S|volume = 83|issue = 6 Suppl|first = CL|last = Jensen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iron]] is needed for the healthy growth of the fetus and placenta, especially during the second and third trimesters.  It is also essential before pregnancy for the production of hemoglobin.There is no evidence that a hemoglobin level of 7 grams/100 ml or higher is detrimental to pregnancy, but it must be acknowledged that maternal hemorrhage is a major source of maternal mortality worldwide, and a reserve capacity to carry oxygen is desirable. According to the Cochrane review conclusions iron supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anaemia and iron deficiency in pregnancy but the positive effect on other maternal and infant outcomes is less clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peña-Rosas|first=Juan Pablo|last2=De-Regil|first2=Luz Maria|last3=Garcia-Casal|first3=Maria N.|last4=Dowswell|first4=Therese|date=2015-07-22|title=Daily oral iron supplementation during pregnancy|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=7|pages=CD004736|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004736.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26198451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition during pregnancy==
The United States and the European Union have established vitamin and mineral recommendations for during pregnancy and lactation. The amounts in the table below are the higher of the two. The citations separately list recommendations for pregnancy and lactation. Recommendations (RDAs = Recommended Dietary Allowances and PRIs = Population Reference Intakes) are set higher than what has been determined to be average requirements so as to address women who have above average needs. For some nutrients there is not enough information to set a recommendation, so the term Adequate Intake (AI) is used based on what appears to be sufficient.&lt;ref name=DRITable /&gt;&lt;ref name=EFSA-Recommended /&gt;

Problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, hearing loss and vision problems.&lt;ref name=CDC2015Fact&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about FASDs|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html|accessdate=10 June 2015|date=April 16, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523194618/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/fasd/facts.html|archivedate=23 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those affected are more likely to have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and have trouble with alcohol and recreational drug use.&lt;ref name=Cor2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coriale|first1=G|last2=Fiorentino|first2=D|last3=Di Lauro|first3=F|last4=Marchitelli|first4=R|last5=Scalese|first5=B|last6=Fiore |first6=M|last7=Maviglia |first7=M|last8=Ceccanti|first8=M|title=Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD): neurobehavioral profile, indications for diagnosis and treatment.|journal=Rivista di psichiatria|date=2013|volume=48|issue=5|pages=359–369|pmid=24326748|doi=10.1708/1356.15062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetal alcohol syndrome usually occurs when a pregnant woman has more than four drinks per day.

The American Academy of Pediatrics established a conservative set of recommendations in 2015: "During pregnancy:no amount of alcohol intake should be considered safe; there is no safe trimester to drink alcohol; all forms of alcohol, such as beer, wine, and liquor, pose similar risk; and binge drinking poses dose-related risk to the developing fetus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Williams JF, Smith VC |title=Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders |journal=Pediatrics |volume=136 |issue=5 |pages=e1395–e1406 |year=2015 |pmid=26482673 |doi=10.1542/peds.2015-3113 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that alcohol should be avoided entirely during pregnancy, given the relatively unknown effects of even small amounts of alcohol during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/e88335.pdf |publisher=World Health Organisation |title=Framework for alcohol policy in the WHO European Region }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish and omega-3 fatty acids===
Fish consumption during pregnancy is encouraged by European,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=EFSA Dietetic Products|first=Nutrition, and Allergies (NDA)|date=2014-07-01|title=Scientific Opinion on health benefits of seafood (fish and shellfish) consumption in relation to health risks associated with exposure to methylmercury |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2014.3761/abstract|journal=EFSA Journal|language=en|volume=12|issue=7|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2014.3761|issn=1831-4732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines-publications/n55|title=Australian Dietary Guidelines (2013) {{!}} National Health and Medical Research Council|last=Council|first=National Health and Medical Research|date=2013-02-07|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and American guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/|title=2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines - health.gov|website=health.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason given is that fat-containing fish such as salmon and tuna contain [[eicosapentaenoic acid|eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid|docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]]. These are termed long chain, [[Omega-3 fatty acid|omega-3]], [[polyunsaturated fatty acids]], and are considered as important for fetal neurodevelopment.&lt;ref name=Starling2015&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Starling|first=Phoebe|last2=Charlton|first2=Karen|last3=McMahon|first3=Anne T.|last4=Lucas|first4=Catherine|date=2015-03-18|title=Fish Intake during Pregnancy and Foetal Neurodevelopment—A Systematic Review of the Evidence|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/7/3/2001|journal=Nutrients|language=en|volume=7|issue=3|pages=2001–2014|doi=10.3390/nu7032001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, fish are good sources of vitamins A, D, and B12, as well as the mineral iodine.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt;

Due to risks of heavy-metal toxicity on fetal neurodevelopment, many mothers are concerned about eating fish during pregnancy. Overall, current research favors the notion that the benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy outweigh the risks; however, the type of fish is important.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Current research suggests that 2-3 servings of low-methylmercury containing fish per week in pregnancy is both safe and beneficial.&lt;ref name=Starling2015/&gt; Mercury accumulates in fish through their own diet ([[bioaccumulation]]). A general rule of thumb is that fish higher up on the food chain, and with longer life spans will contain higher levels of mercury. Fish lower on the food chain and with shorter life spans will have lower metal content. However, it is important to note that the bioaccumulation of metals in fish is also dependent on geographical location, so it is hard to make global recommendations on specific fish species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosch|first=Adina C|last2=O'Neill|first2=Bernadette|last3=Sigge|first3=Gunnar O|last4=Kerwath|first4=Sven E|last5=Hoffman|first5=Louwrens C|date=2016-01-15|title=Heavy metals in marine fish meat and consumer health: a review|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jsfa.7360/abstract|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|language=en|volume=96|issue=1|pages=32–48|doi=10.1002/jsfa.7360|issn=1097-0010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative to consuming fish is to use fish oil dietary supplements containing both EPA and DHA, or algae-derived DHA-only oils. The New York Times reported on a laboratory evaluation of 30 popular fish oil supplements. Some of those had less than the label claimed amounts of DHA. As for safety, "All of the products tested contained only very low levels of mercury, ranging from one to six parts per billion per serving. That range is far below the upper safety limit of 100 parts per billion set by the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s, an industry trade group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/whats-in-your-fish-oil-supplements/ |title=What’s in Your Fish Oil Supplements? |last=Conner |first=Anahad |date=22 January 2014 |website=The New York Times |access-date=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Folic acid ===
Folic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin [[folate]], is critical both in pre-and peri-conception.&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt; Deficiencies in folic acid may cause [[neural tube defects]] (NTDs). Women who had 0.4&amp;nbsp;mg of folic acid in their systems due to supplementing 3 months before childbirth significantly reduced the risk of NTDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Recommendations {{!}} Folic Acid {{!}} NCBDDD {{!}} CDC|url = https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/recommendations.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 80 countries use [[Food fortification|fortification of certain foods]] with folic acid as a measure to decrease the rate of NTDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wald NJ, Morris JK, Blakemore C |title=Public health failure in the prevention of neural tube defects: time to abandon the tolerable upper intake level of folate |journal=Public Health Rev |volume=39 |issue= |pages=2 |date=2018 |pmid=29450103 |pmc=5809909 |doi=10.1186/s40985-018-0079-6 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamins C and E===
The combination of vitamin E and vitamin C supplemented to pregnant women does not appear to be efficacious for reducing risk of [[stillbirth]], [[neonatal death]], [[preterm birth]], [[preeclampsia]] or any other maternal or infant outcomes, either in healthy women or those considered at risk for pregnancy complications.&lt;ref name="Rumbold2015" /&gt; Antioxidant vitamins as dietary supplements had been proposed as having benefits if consumed during pregnancy. For the combination of vitamin E with vitamin C supplemented to pregnant women, a Cochrane review of 21 clinical trials concluded that the data do not support vitamin E supplementation - majority of trials alpha-tocopherol at 400 IU/day plus vitamin C at 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/day - as being efficacious for reducing risk of [[stillbirth]], [[neonatal death]], [[preterm birth]], [[preeclampsia]] or any other maternal or infant outcomes, either in healthy women or those considered at risk for pregnancy complications.&lt;ref name=Rumbold2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rumbold A, Ota E, Hori H, Miyazaki C, Crowther CA |title=Vitamin E supplementation in pregnancy |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=9 |pages=CD004069 |date=September 2015 |pmid=26343254 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004069.pub3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review identified only three small trials in which vitamin E was supplemented without co-supplementation with vitamin C. None of these trials reported any clinically meaningful information.&lt;ref name=Rumbold2015/&gt; A second Cochrane review of 29 trials, published same year, reported on the same combination trials but added analysis of trials with vitamin C alone. The conclusion was that the data do not support routine vitamin C supplementation alone or in combination with other supplements for the prevention of fetal or neonatal death, poor fetal growth, preterm birth or preeclampsia.&lt;ref name=CochraneVitC&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rumbold A, Ota E, Nagata C, Shahrook S, Crowther CA |title=Vitamin C supplementation in pregnancy |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=9 |pages=CD004072 |date=September 2015 |pmid=26415762 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004072.pub3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutrition after pregnancy==
Proper nutrition is important after delivery to help the mother recover, and to provide enough food energy and nutrients for a woman to [[Breastfeeding|breastfeed]] her child. Women having serum [[ferritin]] less than 70&amp;nbsp;µg/L may need [[iron]] supplements to prevent [[iron deficiency anaemia]] during pregnancy and postpartum.&lt;ref name="pmid16733739"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milman N, Byg KE, Bergholt T, Eriksen L, Hvas AM |title=Body iron and individual iron prophylaxis in pregnancy--should the iron dose be adjusted according to serum ferritin? |journal=Ann. Hematol. |volume=85 |issue=9 |pages=567–573 |year=2006 |pmid=16733739 |doi=10.1007/s00277-006-0141-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sethi V, Kapil U |title=Iodine deficiency and development of brain |journal=Indian J Pediatr |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=325–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15107513 |doi=10.1007/BF02724099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During lactation, water intake may need to be increased. Human milk is made of 88% water, and the IOM recommends that breastfeeding women increase their water intake by about 300 mL/day to a total volume of 3000 mL/day (from food and drink);  approximately 2,400 mL/day from fluids.&lt;ref name="IOM"/&gt;

'''Occupational medicine''', until 1960&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=occupational+medicine%2C+industrial+medicine&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2000&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Coccupational%20medicine%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cindustrial%20medicine%3B%2Cc0 Google Ngram Viewer chart]&lt;/ref&gt; called '''industrial medicine''',&lt;ref name=brit&gt;[https://global.britannica.com/topic/industrial-medicine Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It can be confusing that British English also uses ''industrial medicine'' to refer to [[occupational health and safety]] and also uses ''occupational health'' to refer to occupational medicine. See the Collins Dictionary's entries for [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/industrial-medicine ''industrial medicine''] and [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/occupational-medicine ''occupational medicine''] and [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/occupational-health ''occupational health''].&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of [[clinical medicine|medicine]] which is concerned with the maintenance of health in the workplace, including prevention and treatment of diseases and injuries, with secondary objectives of maintaining and increasing productivity and social adjustment in the workplace.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Occupational+safety+and+health McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is, thus, the branch of clinical medicine active in the field of [[occupational health and safety]]. OM specialists work to ensure that the highest standards of occupational health and safety are achieved and maintained in the workplace. While OM may involve a wide number of disciplines, it centers on [[preventive medicine]] and the management of illness, injury, and disability related to the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfms.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=1524&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;SECTION=Article_Archives|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926173940/http://www.sfms.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;CONTENTID=1524&amp;TEMPLATE=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;SECTION=Article_Archives|title=What Is Occupational Medicine and What Do Occupational Medicine Specialists Do?|archivedate=26 September 2006|publisher=San Francisco Medical Society|author=Thomas McClure, MD|accessdate=9 April 2016|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational physicians must have a wide knowledge of clinical medicine and be competent in a number of important areas. They often advise international bodies, governmental and state agencies, organizations and trade unions. There are contextual links to [[physical medicine and rehabilitation]] and to [[insurance medicine]].

==Mission==
Occupational medicine aims to prevent diseases and promote wellness among workers.&lt;ref name = "acoem"&gt;http://www.acoem.org/OccMed.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational health physicians must:
* Have knowledge of potential hazards in the workplace including toxic properties of materials used.
* Be able to evaluate employee fitness for work.
* Be able to diagnose and treat occupational disease and injury.
* Know about rehabilitation methods, health education, and government laws and regulations concerning workplace health.
* Be able to manage health service delivery.&lt;ref name = "acoem"/&gt;

OM can be described as:

''"work that combines clinical medicine, research, and advocacy for people who need the assistance of [[health professionals]] to obtain some measure of justice and health care for illnesses they suffer as a result of companies pursuing the biggest profits they can make, no matter what the effect on workers or the communities they operate in."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/blog/166246/remembering-dr-stephen-levin Interview with Dr. Stephen Levin/Obituary, Katie Halper, The Nation, February 14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first textbook of occupational medicine, ''[[De Morbis Artificum Diatriba]]'' (''Diseases of Workers)'', was written by Italian physician [[Bernardino Ramazzini]] in 1700.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11129">Occupational noise is the amount of acoustic energy received by an employee's auditory system when they are working in the industry. Occupational noise, or industrial noise, is often a term used in [[occupational safety and health]], as sustained exposure can cause permanent hearing damage.

"Twenty-two million workers are exposed to potentially damaging noise at work each year. Last year, U.S. business paid more than $1.5 million in penalties for not protecting workers from noise." - OSHA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/index.html|title=Safety and Health Topics {{!}} Occupational Noise Exposure {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupational noise is considered an [[occupational hazard]] traditionally linked to loud industries such as [[ship-building]], [[mining]], railroad work, [[welding]], and [[construction]], but can be present in any workplace where hazardous noise is present.

== Regulation ==
In the United States, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) work together to provide standards and regulations for noise in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/standards.html|title=Occupational Noise Exposure: Standards|website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA), [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) have all set standards on hazardous occupational noise in their respective industries. Each industry is different, as workers'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''' tasks and equipment differ, but most regulations agree that noise becomes hazardous when it exceeds 85 [[Decibel|decibels]], for an 8-hour time exposure (typical work shift). This relationship between allotted noise level and exposure time is known as an [[Exposure action value]] (EAV) or [[Permissible exposure limit]] (PEL). The EAV or PEL can be seen as equations which manipulate the allotted exposure time according to the intensity of the industrial noise. This equation works as an inverse, exponential, relationship. As the industrial noise intensity increases, the allotted exposure tie, to still remain safe, decreases.

The above calculations of PEL and EAV are based on measurements taken to determine the intensity of that particular industrial noise. [[A-weighting|A-weighted]] measurements are commonly used to determine noise levels that can cause harm to the human ear. There are also special exposure meters available that integrate noise over a period of time to give an [[Sound level meter#LAT or Leq: Equivalent continuous sound level|L&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;]] value (equivalent sound pressure level), defined by standards.

== Risks of Occupational Hearing Loss ==
[[File:Temporary threshold shift (hearing loss) after noise exposure.jpg|thumb|Temporary hearing loss after loud noise exposure. If such exposure is long enough, this temporary threshold shift may become permanent.&lt;ref name="Измеров-2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Izmerov|first1=Nikolai|last2=Suvorov|first2=Herman|last3=Prokopenko|first3=Ludmila|title=The man and the noise (Человек и шум)|year=2001|publisher=ГЕОТАР-МЕД|location=Moscow|language=ru|isbn=5-9231-0057-6|page=103|chapter=Chapter 4. Occupational hearing loss}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Occupational noise, if experienced repeatedly, at high intensity, for an extended period of time, can cause [[noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) which is then classified as [[occupational hearing loss]].

Noise, in the context of industrial noise, is hazardous to a person's hearing because of its loud intensity through repeated long-term exposure. In order for [[noise]] to cause [[hearing impairment]] for the worker, the noise has to be close enough, loud enough, and sustained long enough to damage the [[Hair cell|hair cells]] in the auditory system. Please see [[Occupational hearing loss]] or [[Noise-induced hearing loss]] for more information regarding the physiology of hearing loss. These factors have been taken into account by the governing occupational health and safety organization to determine the unsafe noise exposure levels and durations for their respective industries.

Noise can also affect the safety of the employee and others. Noise can be a causal factor in [[Work accident|work accidents]] as it may mask hazards and warning signals and impede concentration. High intensity noise interferes with vital workplace communication which increases the chance of accidents and decreases productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soundcontroltech.com/effects-of-noise-on-the-individual-in-the-workplace/|title=Effects of Noise on The Individual in the Workplace {{!}} Sound Control|website=soundcontroltech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise may also act synergistically with other hazards to increase the risk of harm to workers. In particular, toxic materials (e.g. some [[Solvent|solvents]], metals, asphyxiants and pesticides) have some [[Ototoxicity|ototoxic properties]] that may affect hearing function.

Modern thinking in [[occupational safety and health]] further identifies noise as hazardous to workers' safety and health. This hazard is experienced in various places of employment and through a variety of sources.

Noise, in the context of industrial noise, is hazardous to a persons hearing because of its loud intensity through repeated long-term exposure. In order for [[Noise]] to cause [[Hearing impairment]] for the worker, the noise has to be close enough, loud enough and the listener has to be exposed for long enough. These factors have been taken into account by the governing occupational health and safety organizations as they determine the unsafe noise exposure levels and durations for their respective industries.

[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA), [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA), [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA)  have all set standards on hazardous occupational noise in their respective industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf|title=Criteria for Recommended Standard: Occupational Noise Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each industry is different, as workers tasks and equipment differ, but most regulations agree that noise becomes hazardous when it exceeds 85 [[Decibel]], for an 8-hour exposure (typical work shift).

There are also special exposure meters available that integrate noise over a period of time to give an [[Sound level meter#LAT or Leq: Equivalent continuous sound level|L&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;]] value (equivalent sound pressure level), defined by standards.

[[File:Hierarchy of Controls (By NIOSH).jpg|thumb|Hierarchy of Controls guideline]]
There are several ways to limit your exposure to hazardous occupational noise. The [[Hierarchy of hazard controls|hierarchy of controls]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/|title=CDC - Hierarchy of Controls - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a guideline for reducing hazardous noise. First, the company can eliminate the noise source. If the noise source cannot be eliminated, the company must try to reduce the noise with alternative methods. This process is called acoustic quieting.  

[[Acoustic quieting]] is the process of making machinery quieter by damping vibrations to prevent them from reaching the observer. The company can isolate the certain piece of machinery by placing materials on the machine or in between the machine and the worker to decreases the signal intensity that reaches the worker's ear.

To decrease an employee's exposure to hazardous noise, the company can also take [[Administrative controls|administrative control]] by limiting the employee's exposure time. This can be done by changing work shifts and switching employees out from the noise exposure area. Lastly, to decrease occupational noise exposure, [[hearing protection]] should be used. There are several types of [[Earplug|earplugs]] and earmuffs that can be used to attenuate the noise to a safe level.

'''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''

For a more detailed description of the hierarchy of controls, please see [[Occupational hearing loss]]. 

== Initiatives ==
Since the hazards of occupational noise exposure were realized, programs and initiatives such as the US [[Buy Quiet]] program have been set up to regulate or discourage noise exposure. The Buy Quiet initiative promotes the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourages manufacturers to design quieter machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|title=Buy Quiet|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] was created to recognize successes in hearing loss prevention programs or initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Safe-in-Sound:Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|website=Safe-in-Sound|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peto's paradox''' is the observation, named after [[Richard Peto]], that at the species level, the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of [[cancer]] does not appear to correlate with the number of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in an organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peto |first1=R. |last2=Roe |first2=F.

If the probability of [[carcinogenesis]] were constant across cells, one would expect whales to have a higher incidence of cancer than humans.

==Original formulation==
Peto, a statistical epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, first formulated the paradox in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

{{Quote| A man has 1000 times as many cells as a mouse... and we usually live at least 30 times as long as mice. Exposure of two similar organisms to risk of carcinoma, one for 30 times as long as the other, would give perhaps 30&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; or 30&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., a million or a billion) times the risk of carcinoma induction per epithelial cell. However, it seems that, in the wild, the probabilities of carcinoma induction in mice and in men are not vastly different. Are our stem cells really, then, a billion or a trillion times more "cancerproof" than murine stem cells? This is biologically pretty implausible; if human DNA is no more resistant to mutagenesis in vitro than mouse DNA, why don't we all die of multiple carcinomas at an early age? |source="Epidemiology and Multistage Models", 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

Peto went on to suggest that evolutionary considerations were likely responsible for varying per-cell carcinogenesis rates across species.

Across species, however, the relationship breaks down. A 2015 study, using data from necropsies performed by the [[San Diego Zoo]], surveyed results from 36 different mammalian species, ranging in size from the 51-gram [[striped grass mouse]] to the 4,800-kilogram [[elephant]], nearly 100,000 times larger. The study found no relationship between body size and cancer incidence, offering empirical support for Peto's initial observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results suggest an evolutionary relationship between animal size and tumor suppression, as Peto had theorized.

==Metabolic and cell size considerations==
A 2014 paper in ''Evolutionary Applications'' by Maciak and Michalak emphasized what they termed "a largely underappreciated relation of cell size to both metabolism and cell-division rates across species" as key factors underlying the paradox, and concluded that "larger organisms have bigger and slowly dividing cells with lower energy turnover, all significantly reducing the risk of cancer initiation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/eva.12228| title = Cell size and cancer: A new solution to Peto's paradox?| journal = Evolutionary Applications| volume = 8| pages = 2–8| year = 2015| last1 = MacIak | first1 = S. | last2 = Michalak | first2 = P. }}&lt;!-- http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eva.12228/abstract --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Maciak and Michalak argue that cell size is not uniform across mammalian species, making body size an imperfect proxy for the number of cells in an organism. (For example, the [[volume]] of an individual [[red blood cell]] of an elephant is roughly four times that of one from a [[common shrew]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, larger [[cell division|cells divide]] more slowly than smaller ones, a difference which compounds exponentially over the life-span of the organism. Fewer cell divisions means fewer opportunities for cancer mutations, and mathematical models of cancer incidence are highly sensitive to cell-division rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pmc=2829925
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, larger animals generally have lower [[basal metabolic rate]]s, following a well-defined [[Allometry#Metabolic rate and body mass|inverse logarithmic relationship]]. Consequently, their cells will incur less damage over time per unit of body mass. Combined, these factors may explain much of the apparent paradox.

==Medical research==
The apparent ability of bigger animals to suppress cancer across very large numbers of cells has spurred an active field of medical research.&lt;ref name ="Nature"/&gt; In one experiment, laboratory mice were genetically altered to express active [[TP53]] tumor antigens, similar to the ones found in elephants. The mutated mice exhibited increased tumor suppression ability, but also showed signs of premature aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

PhenX (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures) is a community-driven effort to provide standard measures for use in biomedical research. The goals are to help investigators identify opportunities for collaborative biomedical research and improve the consistency of data collection.  The '''PhenX Toolkit''' is a web-based catalog of high-priority measures related to complex diseases, phenotypic traits and environmental exposures. These measures were selected by working groups of experts using a consensus process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last1=Maiese |first1=Deborah R. |last2=Hendershot |first2=Tabitha P. |last3=Strader |first3=Lisa C. |last4=Wagener |first4=Diane K. |last5=Hammond |first5=Jane A. |last6=Huggins |first6=Wayne |last7=Kwok |first7=Richard K. |last8=Hancock |first8=Dana B. |last9=Whitehead |first9=Nedra S. |last10=Nettles |first10=Destiney S. |last11=Pratt |first11=Joseph G. |last12=Scott |first12=Marcia S. |last13=Conway |first13=Kevin P. |last14=Junkins |first14=Heather A. |last15=Ramos |first15=Erin M. |last16=Hamilton |first16=Carol M. |display-authors=3 |name-list-format=vanc |date=2013 |title=PhenX—Establishing a consensus process to select common measures for collaborative research |number=MR-0027-1310 |institution=RTI Press |location=Research Triangle Park, NC |doi=10.3768/rtipress.2013.mr.0027.1310 |doi-access=free |url=http://www.rti.org/publication/phenx%E2%80%94establishing-consensus-process-select-common-measures-collaborative-research }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of PhenX measures facilitates combining data from a variety of studies, and makes it easy for investigators to expand a study design beyond the primary research focus.&lt;ref name="HaStPr2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Carol M. |last2=Strader |first2=Lisa C. |last3=Pratt |first3=Joseph G. |last4=Maiese |first4=Deborah |last5=Hendershot |first5=Tabitha |last6=Kwok |first6=Richard K. |last7=Hammond |first7=Jane A. |last8=Huggins |first8=Wayne |last9=Jackman |first9=Dean |last10=Pan |first10=Huaqin |last11=Nettles |first11=Destiney S. |last12=Beaty |first12=Terri H. |last13=Farrer |first13=Lindsay A. |last14=Kraft |first14=Peter |last15=Marazita |first15=Mary L. |last16=Ordovas |first16=Jose M. |last17=Pato |first17=Carlos N. |last18=Spitz |first18=Margaret R. |last19=Wagener |first19=Diane |last20=Williams |first20=Michelle |last21=Junkins |first21=Heather A. |last22=Harlan |first22=William R. |last23=Ramos |first23=Erin M. |last24=Haines |first24=Jonathan |display-authors=3 |name-list-format=vanc |title=The PhenX Toolkit: Get the Most From Your Measures |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=174 |issue=3 |pages=253–260 |date=1 August 2011 |pmc=3141081 |pmid=21749974 |doi=10.1093/aje/kwr193 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HePaHa2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hendershot |first1=Tabitha |last2=Pan |first2=Huaqin |last3=Haines |first3=Jonathan |last4=Harlan |first4=William R. |last5=Junkins |first5=Heather A. |last6=Ramos |first6=Erin M. |last7=Hamilton |first7=Carol M. |display-authors=3 |name-list-format=vanc |title=Using the PhenX Toolkit to Add Standard Measures to Your Study |journal=Current Protocols in Human Genetics |volume=1 |issue=21 |date=October 2011 |pmid=21975939 |doi=10.1002/0471142905.hg0121s71 |at=Unit 1.21 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Toolkit==
The PhenX Toolkit is a catalog of measures recommended by domain experts, with browse and search capabilities and bioinformatics support.&lt;ref name="HaStPr2011" /&gt; PhenX measures and protocols are included in the Cancer Data Standards Repository (caDSR) [[Health informatics#Common Data Element in clinical research|Common Data Elements (CDE)]] Dictionary and the [[National Center for Biomedical Ontology]] (NCBO) BioPortal. PhenX protocols are available as [[Redcap (Research Electronic Data Capture)|REDCap]] Instrument Zip files, and work is underway to map PhenX variables to all studies in dbGaP.  PhenX provides easy access to standard measures with the potential to increase the overall impact of individual studies via cross-study analyses. For each measure, the PhenX Toolkit provides a brief description, the protocol for measurement with supporting images and tables, the reasons for selecting the protocol, details about training and equipment, translations available and selected  references.&lt;ref name="phenx1" /&gt; Users can browse research domains, measures, or collections, search using a “Smart Search” or a full text search, collect measures of interest in “My Toolkit”, and request custom data dictionaries and custom data collection worksheets.

The Toolkit can be particularly helpful when an investigator wants to expand a study to include measures that are outside his or her primary area of expertise.  Whereas study specific measures are needed to address the primary research goal, common measures are needed to increase the overall impact of the study; both types of measures are important to overall study design.

The "Link Your Study" feature allows registered users to share their study with other registered users or find other studies using the same protocols and identify opportunities for cross-study analysis.

==Protocols==
In addition to measures, PhenX also defines protocols. There may be multiple protocols defined for a measure. For example, for smoking cessation, there is an adult protocol (id: 030901) and adolescent protocol (id:030902).&lt;ref name="phenx1"&gt;{{cite web|title=PhenX Example Measure|url=https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php?pageLink=browse.protocols&amp;id=30900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variables==
PhenX also provides a datatype (e.g., integer, string, date, enumerated, or encoded values) for each PhenX variable. For example, variable 'PX070501_Pregnancy_Outcome_1' for 'Outcome of Pregnancy?' is of type enumerated with value set of four possible values (Live birth,Still born,Miscarriage,Induced abortion).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3322">'''Practice-Based Commissioning''' (PBC) was a [[United Kingdom Department of Health]] initiative introduced in 2005 to improve [[primary care]] services by enabling healthcare professionals to decide how services are funded to meet the needs of the local population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhsconfed.org/Networks/PrimaryCareTrust/OurWorkProgramme/strengthening/Pages/Practice-Based-Commissioning.aspx |title=NHS Confederation Primary Care Trust Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; PBC was designed to give healthcare staff, usually general medical practitioners (GPs), the resources and support to become directly involved in decisions on commissioning health services.

Policymakers wanted PBC to lead to high quality services for patients in local and convenient settings. The incentive for GP involvement was that their practices could retain a proportion of any savings they made to invest in their own practices. In this respect, it was seen as a new Labour policy successor to the early 1990s Conservative policy of GP [[fundholding]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/333/7579/1168 |title=BMJ: Does practice based commissioning avoid the problems of fundholding?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norman Warner, Baron Warner|Lord Warner]], former Labour Minister of State for Health, described the benefits of PBC as: "If there is an alternative that is better for the patient and better for the NHS, then practice-based commissioning provides the basis on which they can change the way that services are delivered." 

The government intended GP practices to be supported by the PCTs ([[NHS Primary Care Trust|Primary Care Trusts]]) to buy in ("commission") services for their patients based on cost and quality of care. This process was expected to generate financial savings of which 7/10ths may be retained by the practice for further investment while the remainder is passed back to the PCT.

Two years after the initiative was introduced, both doctors and Primary Care Trusts were struggling to understand how to implement the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/pbc-two-years |title=King's Fund: PBC 2 years on}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, GP practices were forming coalitions known as consortia, in order to commission services at the necessary scale and efficiency. While this process was initially voluntary, eventually practices were ordered to become part of commissioning groups as part of the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10552720 |title=BBC News: Q&amp;A: The NHS shake-up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47807">'''Psychological trauma''' is a type of damage to the [[mind]] that occurs as a result of a distressing event. Trauma is often the result of an overwhelming amount of [[stress (psychological)|stress]] that exceeds one's ability to cope, or integrate the [[emotion]]s involved with that experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|title=Trauma Definition|work=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140805161505/http://www.samhsa.gov/traumajustice/traumadefinition/definition.aspx|archivedate=August 5, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may result from a single distressing experience or recurring events of being overwhelmed that can be precipitated in weeks, years, or even decades as the person struggles to cope with the immediate circumstances, eventually leading to serious, long-term negative consequences.

Because trauma differs between individuals, according to their subjective experiences, people will react to similar traumatic events differently.

==Definition==
The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR)]] defines trauma as direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury; threat to one's physical integrity, witnessing an event that involves the above experience, learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death, or injury experienced by a family member or close associate. Memories associated with trauma are implicit, pre-verbal and cannot be recalled, but can be triggered by stimuli from the [[in vivo]] environment. The person's response to aversive details of traumatic event involve intense fear, helplessness or horror. In children it is manifested as disorganized or agitative behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dsm.psychiatryonline.org/doi/book/10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|title=DSM-IV-TR – DSM Library|publisher=|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890420249.dsm-iv-tr|doi-broken-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma can be caused by a wide variety of events, but there are a few common aspects. There is frequently a violation of the person's core assumptions about the world and their [[human rights]], putting the person in a state of extreme [[Mental confusion|confusion]] and insecurity. This is seen when institutions depended upon for survival violate, humiliate, [[Betrayal Trauma|betray]], or cause major losses or separations instead of evoking aspects like positive self worth, safe boundaries and personal freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=DePrince, A.P.|author2=Freyd, J.J.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2002|chapter=The Harm of Trauma: Pathological fear, shattered assumptions, or betrayal?|editor=J.

Psychologically traumatic experiences often involve [[physical trauma]] that threatens one's survival and sense of security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emotional and Psychological Trauma|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/emotional_psychological_trauma.htm|work=Helpguide.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913234027/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/emotional_psychological_trauma.htm|archivedate=September 13, 2014|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical causes and dangers of psychological trauma include [[harassment]], [[embarrassment]], abandonment, abusive relationships, rejection, co-dependence, physical assault, [[sexual abuse]], partner battery, [[employment discrimination]], [[police brutality]], [[corruption#Judicial corruption|judicial corruption]] and [[Judicial misconduct|misconduct]], [[bullying]], [[paternalism]], [[domestic violence]], [[indoctrination]], being the victim of an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] parent, the threat or the witnessing of violence (particularly in [[childhood]]), life-threatening [[medical condition]]s, and medication-induced trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Charles|title=Psychiatric drugs as agents of Trauma|journal=The International Journal of Risk and Safety in Medicine|year=2010|volume=22|issue=4|pages=195–207|url=http://iospress.metapress.com/content/17668000738187w6/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128181725/http://iospress.metapress.com/content/17668000738187w6/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 January 2013|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catastrophic [[natural disaster]]s such as [[earthquake]]s and [[volcanic eruption]]s, large scale transportation accidents, [[Structure fire|house or domestic fire]], [[motor vehicle accident]], mass interpersonal violence like [[war]], [[terrorist attack]]s or other mass victimization like [[sex trafficking]], being taken as a hostage or being [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] can also cause psychological trauma. Long-term exposure to situations such as extreme [[poverty]] or other forms of [[abuse]], such as [[verbal abuse]], exist independently of physical trauma but still generate psychological trauma.

Parts of the brain in a growing child are developing in a sequential and hierarchical order, from least complex to most complex. The brain's neurons are designed to change in response to the constant external signals and stimulation, receiving and storing new information. This allows the brain to continually respond to its surroundings and promote survival. Our five main sensory signals contribute to the developing brain structure and its function.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Perry (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Infants and children begin to create internal representations of their external environment, and in particular, key attachment relationships, shortly after birth. Violent and victimizing attachment figures impact infants' and young children's internal representations.&lt;ref name=Schechter&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schechter DS, Zygmunt A, Coates SW, Davies M, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Kolodji A, Robinson JL|author1link=Daniel Schechter|author3link=Susan Coates|year=2007|title=Caregiver traumatization adversely impacts young children's mental representations of self and others|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|volume=9|issue=3|pages=187–205|doi=10.1080/14616730701453762|pmid=18007959|pmc=2078523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The more frequent a specific pattern of brain neurons is activated, the more permanent the internal representation associated with the pattern becomes.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Krenawi; Graham; Kanat-Maymon, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This causes sensitization in the brain towards the specific neural network. Because of this sensitization, the neural pattern can be activated by decreasingly less external stimuli. 
Childhood abuse tends to have the most complications with long-term effects out of all forms of trauma because it occurs during the most sensitive and critical stages of psychological development.&lt;ref name="Wingo, Aliza P. 2014"/&gt; It could also lead to violent behavior, possibly as extreme as serial murder. For example, Hickey's Trauma-Control Model suggests that "[[Childhood trauma|childhood trauma]] for serial murderers may serve as a triggering mechanism resulting in an individual's inability to cope with the stress of certain events."&lt;ref&gt;Hickey, E. W. (2010). ''Serial Murderers and Their Victims.'' Blemont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often psychodynamic aspects of trauma are overlooked even by health professionals: "If clinicians fail to look through a trauma lens and to conceptualize client problems as related possibly to current or past trauma, they may fail to see that trauma victims, young and old, organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of reliving and warding off traumatic memories, reminders, and affects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Effects of Psychological Trauma on Children and Adolescents|url=http://mentalhealth.vermont.gov/sites/dmh/files/report/cafu/DMH-CAFU_Psychological_Trauma_Moroz.pdf|format=PDF|date=June 30, 2005|author=Moroz, Kathleen J.|publisher=Vermont Agency of Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
People who go through these types of extremely traumatic experiences often have certain symptoms and problems afterward. The severity of these symptoms depends on the person, the type of trauma involved, and the emotional support they receive from others.  The range of reactions to and symptoms of trauma can be wide and varied, and differ in severity from person to person. A traumatized individual may experience one or several of them.&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt;

After a traumatic experience, a person may '''re-experience''' the trauma mentally and physically, hence trauma reminders, also called [[Trauma trigger|triggers]], can be uncomfortable and even painful. Re-experiencing can damage people’s sense of safety, self, self-efficacy, as well as their ability to regulate emotions and navigate relationships. They may turn to [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]] including [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] to try to escape or dampen the feelings. These triggers cause flashbacks, which are dissociative experiences where the person feels as though the events are recurring. Flashbacks can range from distraction to complete dissociation or loss of awareness of the current context. Re-experiencing of symptoms is a sign that the body and mind are actively struggling to cope with the traumatic experience.

Triggers and cues act as reminders of the trauma and can cause [[anxiety]] and other associated emotions. Often the person can be completely unaware of what these triggers are. In many cases this may lead a person suffering from traumatic disorders to engage in disruptive behaviors or self-destructive coping mechanisms, often without being fully aware of the nature or causes of their own actions. [[Panic attack]]s are an example of a psychosomatic response to such emotional triggers.

Consequently, intense feelings of anger may frequently surface, sometimes in inappropriate or unexpected situations, as danger may always seem to be present due to re-experiencing past events. Upsetting memories such as images, thoughts, or [[flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashback]]s may haunt the person, and [[nightmare]]s may be frequent.&lt;ref name="Loyola"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|title=Loyola College in Maryland: Trauma and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028034430/http://www.loyola.edu/campuslife/healthservices/counselingcenter/trauma.html|archivedate=2005-10-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Insomnia]] may occur as lurking fears and insecurity keep the person vigilant and on the lookout for danger, both day and night. Trauma doesn't only cause changes in one's daily functions, but could also lead to morphological changes. Such epigenetic changes can be passed on to the next generation, thus making genetics one of the components of psychological trauma. However, some people are born with or later develop protective factors such as genetics and sex that help lower their risk of psychological trauma.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frommberger|first=Ulrich|title=Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder – a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The person may not remember what actually happened, while emotions experienced during the trauma may be re-experienced without the person understanding why (see [[Repressed memory|Repressed Memory]]). This can lead to the traumatic events being constantly experienced as if they were happening in the present, preventing the subject from gaining perspective on the experience. This can produce a pattern of prolonged periods of acute arousal punctuated by periods of physical and mental exhaustion. This can lead to mental health disorders like [[acute stress disorder|acute stress]] and anxiety disorder, [[traumatic grief]], [[undifferentiated somatoform disorder]], [[conversion disorder]]s, [[brief psychotic disorder]], [[borderline personality disorder]], adjustment disorder, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rothschild B|title=The body remembers: the psychophysiology of trauma and trauma treatment |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=2000 |pages= |isbn=978-0-393-70327-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, emotional exhaustion may set in, leading to distraction, and clear thinking may be difficult or impossible. [[Emotional detachment]], as well as [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]] or "numbing out" can frequently occur. Dissociating from the painful emotion includes numbing all emotion, and the person may seem emotionally flat, preoccupied, distant, or cold. Dissociation includes depersonalisation disorder, dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity disorder, etc. Exposure to and re-experiencing trauma can cause neurophysiological changes like slowed myelination, abnormalities in synaptic pruning, shrinking of the hippocampus, cognitive and affective impairment. This is significant in brain scan studies done regarding higher order function assessment with children and youth who were in vulnerable environments.

Some traumatized people may feel permanently damaged when trauma symptoms do not go away and they do not believe their situation will improve. This can lead to feelings of despair, transient paranoid ideation,  loss of [[self-esteem]], profound emptiness, suicidality, and frequently [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. If important aspects of the person's self and world understanding have been violated, the person may call their own identity into question.&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncptsd.va.gov/facts/general/fs_effects.html |title=Effects of Traumatic Experiences: A National Center for PTSD Fact Sheet |accessdate=2005-12-09 |last=Carlson |first=Eve B. |author2=Josef Ruzek  |publisher=National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder |doi= |archiveurl=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/clients/sub.cfm?source=mhealth/factsheets/effects |archivedate=2004-06-12 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often despite their best efforts, traumatized parents may have difficulty assisting their child with emotion regulation, attribution of meaning, and containment of post-traumatic fear in the wake of the child's traumatization, leading to adverse consequences for the child.&lt;ref name=Schechter/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schechter DS, Coates SW, Kaminer T, Coots T, Zeanah CH, Davies M, Schonfield IS, Marshall RD, Liebowitz MR, Trabka KA, McCaw J, Myers MM|author1link=Daniel Schechter|author2link=Susan Coates|year=2008|title=Distorted maternal mental representations and atypical behavior in a clinical sample of violence-exposed mothers and their toddlers|journal=Journal of Trauma and Dissociation|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–149|doi=10.1080/15299730802045666|pmid=18985165|pmc=2577290}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such instances, seeking counselling in appropriate mental health services is in the best interests of both the child and the parent(s).
==Cause==

===Situational trauma===
Trauma can be caused by man-made, technological disasters and natural disasters,&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"&gt;Neria, Y., Nandi, A., &amp; Galea, S. (2008). Post-traumatic stress disorder following disasters: a systematic review. Psychological medicine, 38(4), 467–480. Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; including war, abuse, violence, mechanized accidents (car, train, or plane crashes, etc.) or medical emergencies.

Responses to psychological trauma:
Response to psychological trauma can be varied based on the type of trauma, as well as socio demographic and background factors.&lt;ref name="Neria, Y. 2008"/&gt;
There are several behavioral responses common towards stressors including the proactive, reactive, and passive responses. Proactive responses include attempts to address and correct a stressor before it has a noticeable effect on lifestyle.  Reactive responses occur after the stress and possible trauma has occurred and are aimed more at correcting or minimizing the damage of a stressful event.  A passive response is often characterized by an emotional numbness or ignorance of a stressor.

Those who are able to be proactive can often overcome stressors and are more likely to be able to cope well with unexpected situations.  On the other hand, those who are more reactive will often experience more noticeable effects from an unexpected stressor. In the case of those who are passive, victims of a stressful event are more likely to suffer from long-term traumatic effects and often enact no intentional coping actions. These observations may suggest that the level of trauma associated with a victim is related to such independent coping abilities.

There is also a distinction between trauma induced by recent situations and long-term trauma which may have been buried in the unconscious from past situations such as [[childhood abuse]]. Trauma is sometimes overcome through healing; in some cases this can be achieved by recreating or revisiting the origin of the trauma under more psychologically safe circumstances, such as with a [[Psychotherapy|therapist]].

===In psychoanalysis===
{{main article|Psychoanalysis}}

French neurologist [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] argued in the 1890s that psychological trauma was the origin of all instances of the mental illness known as [[hysteria]].  Charcot's "traumatic hysteria" often manifested as a paralysis that followed a physical trauma, typically years later after what Charcot described as a period of "incubation".
[[Sigmund Freud]], Charcot's student and the father of [[psychoanalysis]], examined the concept of psychological trauma throughout his career.  [[Jean Laplanche]] has given a general description of Freud's understanding of trauma, which varied significantly over the course of Freud's career: "An event in the subject's life, defined by its intensity, by the subject's incapacity to respond adequately to it and by the upheaval and long-lasting effects that it brings about in the psychical organization".&lt;ref name = Laplanche&gt;{{cite book |author1=Laplanche, J.  |author2=Pontalis, J.B. | year=1967 | title=The Language of Psycho-Analysis | publisher=W. W. Norton and Company | isbn=978-0-393-01105-0  | pages=465–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] claimed that what he called "[[The Real]]" had a traumatic quality external to symbolization. As an object of anxiety, Lacan maintained that The Real is "the essential object which isn't an object any longer, but this something faced with which all words cease and all categories fail, the object of anxiety ''par excellence''".&lt;ref name="seminar_II"&gt;Lacan, J., ''The Seminar of Jacques Lacan: Book II: The Ego in Freud's Theory and in the Technique of Psychoanalysis 1954–1955'' | p.164 (W.

===Stress disorders===
{{main article|Posttraumatic stress disorder|Complex post-traumatic stress disorder}}
All psychological traumas originate from stress, a physiological response to an unpleasant stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-205-23939-9|title=Physiology of Psychology|author=Carlson, Neil|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grossarth-Maticek, R., Eysenck, H.J., &amp; Boyle, G.J. (1994). An empirical study of the diathesis-stress theory of disease. ''International Journal of Stress Management, 1'', 3–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Long term stress increases the risk of poor mental health and mental disorders, which can be attributed to secretion of glucocorticoids for a long period of time. Such prolonged exposure causes many physiological dysfunctions such as the suppression of the immune system and increase in blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seyle, H.|title=The Stress of Life|journal=McGraw Hill|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does it affect the body physiologically, but a morphological change in the hippocampus also takes place. Studies showed that extreme stress early in life can disrupt normal development of hippocampus and impact its functions in adulthood. Studies surely show a correlation between the size of hippocampus and one's susceptibility to stress disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brunson|title=Mechanisms of late-onset cognitive decline after early-life stress|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|year=2005|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In times of war, psychological trauma has been known as shell shock or [[combat stress reaction]]. Psychological trauma may cause an [[acute stress reaction]] which may lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  PTSD emerged as the label for this condition after the [[Vietnam War]] in which many veterans returned to their respective countries demoralized, and sometimes, addicted to psychoactive substances. The symptoms of PTSD must persist for at least a month for diagnosis. The main symptoms of PTSD consist of four main categories: trauma (i.e. intense fear), reliving (i.e. flashbacks), avoidance behavior (i.e. emotional numbing), and hypervigilance (i.e. continuous scanning of the environment for danger).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frommberger, Ulrich|year=2014|title=Post-traumatic stress disorder – a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge|journal=Deutsches Arzteblatt International|volume=111|issue=5|pages=59–65|doi=10.3238/arztebl.2014.0059|pmid=24612528|pmc=3952004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that about 60% of the US population reported as having experienced at least one traumatic symptom in their lives, but only a small proportion actually develops PTSD. There is a correlation between the risk of PTSD and whether or not the act was inflicted deliberately by the offender.&lt;ref name="Frommberger 2014"/&gt; Psychological trauma is treated with therapy and, if indicated, psychotropic medications.

The term ''continuous post traumatic stress disorder'' (CTSD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Straker|first=Gillian|title=The continuous traumatic stress syndrome: The single therapeutic interview|journal=Psychology and Society|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced into the trauma literature by Gill Straker (1987). It was originally used by South African clinicians to describe the effects of exposure to frequent, high levels of violence usually associated with civil conflict and political repression. The term is also applicable to the effects of exposure to contexts in which gang violence and crime are endemic as well as to the effects of ongoing exposure to life threats in high-risk occupations such as police, fire and emergency services.

As one of the processes of treatment, confrontation with their sources of trauma plays a crucial role. While debriefing people immediately after a critical incident has not been shown to reduce incidence of PTSD, coming alongside people experiencing trauma in a supportive way has become standard practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McNally RJ |author2=Bryant RA |author3=Ehlers A | title=Does early psychological intervention promote recovery from posttraumatic stress? | journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume=4 | issue=2 | year=2003 | pages=45–79| doi = 10.1111/1529-1006.01421|pmid=26151755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vicarious===
Vicarious trauma affects workers who witnesses their clients' trauma. It is more likely to occur in situations where trauma related work is the norm rather than the exception. Listening with empathy to the clients generates feeling, and seeing oneself in clients' trauma may compound the risk for developing trauma symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2008/phac-aspc/H72-21-178-2000E.pdf|title=Guidebook on Vicarious Trauma: Recommended Solutions for Anti-Violence Workers|publisher=Health Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma may also result if workers witness situations that happen in the course of their work (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/dr-john-bradford-won-t-work-magnotta-case-because-of-ptsd-1.2571463|title=Russell Williams profiler won't work Magnotta case because of PTSD|publisher=CBC|date= March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of help seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.

==Assessment==

As "trauma" adopted a more widely defined scope, traumatology as a field developed a more interdisciplinary approach. This is in part due to the field's diverse professional representation including: psychologists, medical professionals, and lawyers. As a result, findings in this field are adapted for various applications, from individual psychiatric treatments to sociological large-scale trauma management. However, novel fields require novel methodologies. While the field has adopted a number of diverse methodological approaches, many pose their own limitations in practical application.

The experience and outcomes of psychological trauma can be assessed in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Briere, John |author2=Scott, Catherine |title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc |location=California |year=2006 |pages=37–63 |isbn=978-0-7619-2921-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the context of a clinical interview, the risk of imminent danger to the self or others is important to address but is not the focus of assessment. In most cases, it will not be necessary to involve contacting emergency services (e.g., medical, psychiatric, law enforcement) to ensure the individuals safety; members of the individual's [[social support]] network are much more critical.

Understanding and accepting the psychological state an individual is in is paramount. There are many misconceptions of what it means for a traumatized individual to be in psychological crisis. These are times when an individual is in inordinate amounts of pain and incapable of self-comfort. If treated humanely and respectfully the individual is less likely to resort to self harm. In these situations it is best to provide a supportive, caring environment and to communicate to the individual that no matter the circumstance, the individual will be taken seriously rather than being treated as delusional. It is vital for the assessor to understand that what is going on in the traumatized person's head is valid and real. If deemed appropriate, the assessing clinician may proceed by inquiring about both the traumatic event and the outcomes experienced (e.g., post-traumatic symptoms, dissociation, [[substance abuse]], somatic symptoms, psychotic reactions). Such inquiry occurs within the context of established [[rapport]] and is completed in an empathic, sensitive, and supportive manner. The clinician may also inquire about possible relational disturbance, such as alertness to interpersonal danger, [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]], and the need for self-protection via interpersonal control. Through discussion of interpersonal relationships, the clinician is better able to assess the individual's ability to enter and sustain a clinical relationship.

During assessment, individuals may exhibit activation responses in which reminders of the traumatic event trigger sudden feelings (e.g., [[distress (medicine)|distress]], anxiety, [[anger]]), memories, or thoughts relating to the event. Because individuals may not yet be capable of managing this distress, it is necessary to determine how the event can be discussed in such a way that will not "retraumatize" the individual. It is also important to take note of such responses, as these responses may aid the clinician in determining the intensity and severity of possible post traumatic stress as well as the ease with which responses are triggered. Further, it is important to note the presence of possible avoidance responses. Avoidance responses may involve the absence of expected activation or emotional reactivity as well as the use of avoidance mechanisms (e.g., substance use, effortful avoidance of cues associated with the event, dissociation).

In addition to monitoring activation and avoidance responses, clinicians carefully observe the individual's strengths or difficulties with affect regulation (i.e., affect tolerance and affect modulation). Such difficulties may be evidenced by mood swings, brief yet intense [[depressive episode]]s, or [[self-mutilation]]. The information gathered through observation of affect regulation will guide the clinician's decisions regarding the individual's readiness to partake in various therapeutic activities.

Though assessment of psychological trauma may be conducted in an unstructured manner, assessment may also involve the use of a structured interview. Such interviews might include the [[Clinician Administered PTSD Scale|Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale]] (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI; Bryant, Harvey, Dang, &amp; Sackville, 1998), Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress (SIDES; Pelcovitz et al., 1997), Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Dissociative Disorders- Revised (SCID-D; Steinberg, 1994), and Brief Interview for post-traumatic Disorders (BIPD; Briere, 1998).

Lastly, assessment of psychological trauma might include the use of self-administered psychological tests. Individual scores on such tests are compared to normative data in order to determine how the individual's level of functioning compares to others in a sample representative of the general population. Psychological testing might include the use of generic tests (e.g., [[MMPI-2]], [[MCMI-III]], SCL-90-R) to assess non-trauma-specific symptoms as well as difficulties related to personality. In addition, psychological testing might include the use of trauma-specific tests to assess post-traumatic outcomes. Such tests might include the post-traumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS; Foa, 1995), Davidson Trauma Scale (DTS: Davidson et al., 1997), Detailed Assessment of post-traumatic Stress (DAPS; Briere, 2001), Trauma Symptom Inventory (TSI: Briere, 1995), Trauma Symptom Checklist for Children (TSCC; Briere, 1996), Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ: Kubany et al., 2000), and Trauma-related Guilt Inventory (TRGI: Kubany et al., 1996).

Children are assessed through activities and therapeutic relationship, some of the activities are play genogram, sand worlds, coloring feelings, Self and Kinetic family drawing, symbol work, dramatic-puppet play, story telling, Briere's TSCC, etc.&lt;ref name="GilATC"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliana Gil|title=Helping Abused and Traumatized Children: Integrating Directive and Nondirective Approaches|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qe-E0CYLDqcC&amp;pg=PA28|year=2011|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-60918-474-2|pages=28, 59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
A number of psychotherapy approaches have been designed with the treatment of trauma in mind—[[Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing|EMDR]], [[progressive counting (PC)]], [[somatic experiencing]], [[biofeedback]], [[Internal Family Systems Model|Internal Family Systems Therapy]], and [[sensorimotor psychotherapy]].

Studies funded by pharmaceuticals have also shown that medications such as the new anti-depressants are effective when used in combination with other psychological approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Phase-oriented treatment of structural dissociation in complex traumatization: overcoming trauma-related phobias|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|year=2005|volume=6|issue=3|pages=11–53|vauthors=Steele K, van der Hart O, Nijenhuis ER|pmid=16172081|doi=10.1300/J229v06n03_02|citeseerx=10.1.1.130.8227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma therapy allows processing trauma-related memories and allows growth towards more adaptive psychological functioning. It helps to develop positive coping instead of negative coping and allows the individual to integrate upsetting-distressing material (thoughts, feelings and memories) and to resolve these internally. It also aids in growth of personal skills like resilience, ego regulation, empathy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFMXBAAAQBAJ|title=Principles of Trauma Therapy: A Guide to Symptoms, Evaluation, and Treatment (DSM-5 Update)|first1=John N.|last1=Briere|first2=Catherine|last2=Scott|date=25 March 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|via=Google Books|isbn=9781483351254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processes involved in trauma therapy are:

* Psychoeducation: Information dissemination and educating in vulnerabilities and adoptable coping mechanisms.
* Emotional regulation: Identifying, countering discriminating, grounding thoughts and emotions from internal construction to an external representation.
* Cognitive processing: Transforming negative perceptions and beliefs about self, others and environment to positive ones through cognitive reconsideration or re-framing.
* Trauma processing: Systematic desensitization, response activation and counter-conditioning, titrated extinction of emotional response, deconstructing disparity (emotional vs. reality state), resolution of traumatic material (in theory, to a state in which triggers no longer produce harmful distress and the individual is able to express relief.)
* Emotional processing: Reconstructing perceptions, beliefs and erroneous expectations, habituating new life contexts for auto-activated trauma-related fears, and providing crisis cards with coded emotions and appropriate cognitions. (This stage is only initiated in pre-termination phase from clinical assessment and judgement of the mental health professional.)
* [[Gestalt therapy|Experiential]] processing: Visualization of achieved relief state and relaxation methods.

A number of complementary approaches to trauma treatment have been implicated as well, including yoga and meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pradhan|first=Basant|last2=Kluewer D’Amico|first2=Jessica|last3=Makani|first3=Ramkrishna|last4=Parikh|first4=Tapan|date=2015-07-10|title=Nonconventional interventions for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder: Ketamine, repetitive trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), and alternative approaches|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=35–54|doi=10.1080/15299732.2015.1046101|issn=1529-9732}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trauma-sensitive yoga]] has been specifically developed for the purposes of use with traumatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emerson|first=D.|last2=Sharma|first2=R.|last3=Chaudhry|first3=S.|last4=Turner|first4=J.|date=2009|title=Trauma-sensitive yoga: principles, practice, and research|url=|journal=International Journal of Yoga Therapy|volume=19|pages=123-128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public health informatics''' has been defined as the systematic application of information and [[computer science]] and technology to [[public health]] practice, research, and learning.  It is one of the subdomains of [[health informatics]].

==Definition==
Public health informatics is defined as the use of computers, clinical guidelines, communication and information systems, which apply to vast majority of public health, related professions, such as nursing, clinical/ hospital care/ public health and medical research.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.jhsph.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/certificates/public-health-informatics/what-is-health-informatics.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

In developed countries like  the United States, public health informatics is practiced by individuals in public health agencies at the federal and state levels and in the larger local health jurisdictions.  Additionally, research and training in public health informatics takes place at a variety of academic institutions.

At the federal [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in US states like Atlanta, Georgia, the [https://www.cdc.gov/osels/phsipo Public Health Surveillance and Informatics Program Office (PHSIPO)] focuses on advancing the state of information science and applies digital information technologies to aid in the detection and management of diseases and syndromes in individuals and populations.

The bulk of the work of public health informatics in the United States, as with public health generally, takes place at the state and local level, in the [[State health department|state departments of health]] and the county or parish departments of health.  At a state health department the activities may include: collection and storage of ''vital statistics'' (birth and death records); collection of reports of communicable disease cases from doctors, hospitals, and laboratories, used for infectious disease surveillance; display of infectious disease statistics and trends; collection of child immunization and lead screening information; daily collection and analysis of emergency room data to detect early evidence of biological threats; collection of hospital capacity information to allow for planning of responses in case of emergencies.  Each of these activities presents its own information processing challenge.

===Collection of public health data===

(TODO: describe CDC-provided DOS/desktop-based systems like TIMSS (TB), STDMIS (Sexually transmitted  diseases); Epi-Info for epidemiology investigations; and others )

Since the beginning of the World Wide Web, public health agencies with sufficient information technology resources have been transitioning to web-based collection of public [[health data]], and, more recently, to automated messaging of the same information.  In the years roughly 2000 to 2005 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, under its [https://www.cdc.gov/nedss/ National Electronic Disease Surveillance System] (NEDSS), built and provided free to states a comprehensive web and message-based reporting system called the [https://www.cdc.gov/nedss/ NEDSS Base System] (NBS).  Due to the funding being limited and it not being wise to have fiefdom-based systems, only a few states and larger counties have built their own versions of electronic disease surveillance systems, such as Pennsylvania's [https://www.nedss.state.pa.us/nedss/ PA-NEDSS].  These do not provide timely full intestate notification services causing an increase in disease rates versus the NEDSS federal product.

To promote interoperability, the CDC has encouraged the adoption in public [[health data]] exchange of several standard vocabularies and messaging formats from the health care world. The most prominent of these are: the [[Health Level 7]] (HL7) standards for health care messaging; the [[LOINC]] system for encoding laboratory test and result information; and the [[Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine]] (SNOMED) vocabulary of health care concepts.

Since about 2005, the CDC has promoted the idea of the Public Health Information Network to facilitate the transmission of data from various partners in the health care industry and elsewhere (hospitals, clinical and environmental laboratories, doctors' practices, pharmacies) to local health agencies, then to state health agencies, and then to the CDC.  At each stage the entity must be capable of receiving the data, storing it, aggregating it appropriately, and transmitting it to the next level.  A typical example would be infectious disease data, which hospitals, labs, and doctors are legally required to report to local health agencies; local health agencies must report to their state public health department; and which the states must report in aggregate form to the CDC.  Among other uses, the CDC publishes the [[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]] (MMWR) based on these data acquired systematically from across the United States.

Major issues in the collection of public [[health data]] are: awareness of the need to report data; lack of resources of either the reporter or collector; lack of interoperability of data interchange formats, which can be at the purely syntactic or at the semantic level; variation in reporting requirements across the states, territories, and localities.

Public health informatics can be thought or divided into three categories.

===Study models of different systems===
The first category is to discover and study models of complex systems, such as disease transmission. This can be done through different types of data collections, such as hospital surveys, or electronic surveys submitted to the organization (such as the CDC). Transmission rates or disease incidence rates/surveillance can be obtained through government organizations, such as the CDC, or global organizations, such as WHO. Not only disease transmission/rates can be looked at. Public health informatics can also delve into people with/without health insurance and the rates at which they go to the doctor. Before the advent of the internet, public health data in the United States, like other healthcare and business data, were collected on paper forms and stored centrally at the relevant public health agency.  If the data were to be computerized they required a distinct data entry process, were stored in the various file formats of the day and analyzed by mainframe computers using standard batch processing.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|website=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6103a5.htm?s_cid=su6103a5_x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage of public health data===

The second category is to find ways to improve the efficiency of different public health systems. This is done through various collections methods, storage of data and how the data is used to improve current health problems. In order to keep everything standardized, vocabulary and word usage needs to be consistent throughout all systems. Finding new ways to link together and share new data with current systems is important to keep everything up to date.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Storage of public health data shares the same [[data management]] issues as other industries.  And like other industries, the details of how these issues play out are affected by the nature of the data being managed.

Due to the complexity and variability of public health data, like health care data generally, the issue of [[data modeling]] presents a particular challenge.  While a generation ago flat data sets for statistical analysis were the norm, today's requirements of interoperability and integrated sets of data across the public health enterprise require more sophistication.  The [[relational database]] is increasingly the norm in public health informatics.  Designers and implementers of the many sets of data required for various public health purposes must find a workable balance between very complex and abstract data models such as [[HL7]]'s [[HL7#Reference Information Model (RIM)|Reference Information Model]] (RIM) or CDC's [https://www.cdc.gov/phin/library/documents/pdf/PHIN_LDM_User_Guide_v1.0.pdf Public Health Logical Data Model], and simplistic, ad hoc models that untrained public health practitioners come up with and feel capable of working with.

Due to the variability of the incoming data to public health jurisdictions, [[data quality assurance]] is also a major issue.

===Analysis of public health data===

Finally, the last category can be thought as maintaining and enriching current systems and models to adapt to overflow of data and storing/sorting of this new data. This can be as simple as connecting directly to an electronic data collection source, such as health records from the hospital, or can go public information (CDC) about disease rates/transmission. Finding new algorithms that will sort through large quantities of data quickly and effectively is necessary as well.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The need to extract usable public health information from the mass of data available requires the public health informaticist to become familiar with a range of analysis tools, ranging from [[business intelligence]] tools to produce routine or ad hoc reports, to sophisticated statistical analysis tools such as [[DAP (software)|DAP]]/[[SAS System|SAS]] and [[PSPP]]/[[SPSS]], to [[GIS|Geographical Information Systems]] (GIS) to expose the geographical dimension of public health trends.Such analyses usually require methods that appropriately secure the privacy of the health data. One approach is to separate the individually identifiable variables of the data from the rest&lt;ref name=Mazumdar&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mazumdar S, Konings P, Hewett M |title= Protecting the privacy of individual general practice patient electronic records for geospatial epidemiology research |journal= Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health |year=2014|volume=38|issue=6|pages=548–552| doi=10.1111/1753-6405.12262|pmid=25308525|display-authors=etal}} http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1753-6405.12262/full&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications in health surveillance and epidemiology===

There are a few organizations out there that provide useful information for those professionals that want to be more involved in public health informatics. Such as the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA). AMIA is for professions that are involved in health care, informatics research, biomedical research, including physicians, scientists, researchers, and students. The main goals of AMIA are to move from ‘bench to bedside’, help improve the impact of health innovations and advance the public health informatics field. They hold annual conferences, online classes and webinars, which are free to their members. There is also a career center specific for the biomedical and health informatics community.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Many jobs or fellowships in public health informatics are offered. The CDC (Center for Disease Control) has various fellowship programs, while multiple colleges/companies offer degree programs or training in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=http://www.phii.org/what-we-do}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Refugee health''', also known as '''migrant health''' or '''immigrant health''', is the field of study on the health effects experienced by people who have moved into another country or even to another part of the world, either by choice or as a result of unsafe circumstances such as war or persecution.  [[forced displacement|Displaced]] populations' health is mainly affected by [[infectious disease]], [[mental health]], and [[chronic diseases]] that are uncommon in the country in which they eventually settle. Refugee health status is largely due to factors such as the migrant's geographic origin, conditions of [[refugee camp]]s or [[urban refugee|urban settings]] where they lived, and personal, physical, and psychological conditions of the migrant, either pre-existing or acquired while traveling from their homeland to a camp or eventually to their new home.&lt;ref name="Palinkas_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palinkas LA, Pickwell SM, Brandstein K, Clark TJ, Hill LL, Moser RJ, Osman A | title = The journey to wellness: stages of refugee health promotion and disease prevention | journal = Journal of Immigrant Health | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–28 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 14512755 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021048112073 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major health concerns==
Refugees may be at a higher risk for contracting certain diseases or having other health problems due to factors such as poor nutrition, poor sanitation and lack of adequate medical care. The most common health concerns are listed below.

=== Non-communicable diseases ===
[[Non-communicable disease]] (NCD) is a medical condition that is not transmissible and non-infectious. This means it is not caused by an infectious agent but instead is perpetuated by individual and environmental behaviors. According to the [[World Health Organization|WHO]], NCDs lead to an estimated 40 million deaths per year—worldwide. Accordingly, 70% of deaths worldwide are credited to NCDs. It is found that NCD development and control is directly linked with nutrition and healthy behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs355/en/ | title = Non communicable diseases|website=World Health Organization |access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-communicable diseases have accounted for 19-46% of mortality from the top five refugee-producing countries in 2015. Accordingly, the overall proportion of deaths credited to NCDs has risen over 50%. Reports indicate that more than half of Syrian refugee households (resettled in Jordan) have a member suffering from an non-communicable disease.&lt;ref name="Sethi_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sethi S, Jonsson R, Skaff R, Tyler F | title = Community-Based Noncommunicable Disease Care for Syrian Refugees in Lebanon | journal = Global Health, Science and Practice | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–506 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28928227 | pmc = 5620345 | doi = 10.9745/GHSP-D-17-00043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diabetes====
[[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]] is a group of chronic metabolic diseases that affect the body's use of blood sugar. There are two main forms of diabetes: [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2]]. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by insulin deficiency and requires daily administered doses of [[insulin]]. Causes of Type 1 diabetes are unknown and are currently, not preventable. It is typically onset at an early age. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by the body's inability to properly utilize insulin. Type 2 diabetes is typically onset in adults and is linked with unhealthy behaviors. Another common form of diabetes is [[gestational diabetes]]. This occurs in pregnant women and does not necessarily lead to Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/|title=Diabetes|website=World Health Organization|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Refugees are at an increased risk of developing diabetes because of the tendency towards inadequate nutritional behaviors.&lt;ref name="Berkowitz_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berkowitz SA, Fabreau GE, Raghavan S, Kentoffio K, Chang Y, He W, Atlas SJ, Percac-Lima S | title = Risk of Developing Diabetes Among Refugees and Immigrants: A Longitudinal Analysis | journal = Journal of Community Health | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 1274–1281 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27363825 | doi = 10.1007/s10900-016-0216-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], amongst [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]], there is a 6.1% prevalence of adult-onset diabetes. [[Refugees of Iraq|Iraqi refugees]] saw a 3% prevalence and Congolese refugees faced less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/profiles/congolese/health-information/non-communicable-disease.html|title=Non-Communicable Disease Error processing SSI file|date=2017-04-21|website=www.cdc.gov |access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A literary analysis on diabetes risk amongst refugee populations suggests that increased diabetes risk among adult refugees may be associated with longer migration histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wagner J, Berthold SM, Buckley T, Kong S, Kuoch T, Scully M | title = Diabetes among refugee populations: what newly arriving refugees can learn from resettled Cambodians | journal = Current Diabetes Reports | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 56 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26143533 | doi = 10.1007/s11892-015-0618-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis also links increased diabetes prevalence with the transition from traditional, agricultural lifestyles with potentially protective foods, to urbanized, westernized lifestyles that come with migration.

====Anemia====
[[Anemia]] is a condition in which an individual does not have enough healthy red blood cells. This will consequently lead to reduced oxygen flow to the body's organs. Most commonly, this is caused by not consuming enough iron. Anemia is used as a marker for overall [[micronutrient deficiency]]. Symptoms usually involve overall fatigue and tiredness, as a result of reduced oxygen flow. There are various treatments for anemia, including [[iron supplement]]s and vitamin B supplements. [[Blood transfusion]]s may also be used if blood production is low.

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], “an evaluation of anemia prevalence in the [[Zaatari refugee camp]] and surrounding areas showed that 48.4% of children younger than 5 years of age, and 44.8% of women 15-49 years of age suffered from anemia”. Amongst Congolese refugees, [[Sickle-cell disease|Sickle Cell Anemia]] (SCD) is of a much larger concern. In Central America, refugees coming from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras show the highest incidence of anemia cases. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] reports that the prevalence for children under 5 years old is 30% in El Salvador, 47% in Guatemala, and 40% in Honduras. In Guatemala, 22% of pregnant women are also anemic. These cases are mostly credited to poor nutrition or a chronic parasitic infection.&lt;ref name="CDC_refugee_health"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/profiles/index.html | title = Refugee Health Profiles {{!}} Immigrant and Refugee Health | publisher = United States Centers for Disease Control | date = 2017-04-19 | access-date = 2018-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cardiovascular disease and hypertension ====
[[Cardiovascular disease]] is a general term for various heart conditions such as [[coronary artery disease]], [[cardiac arrest]], [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmias]], and many more. [[Hypertension]] is high blood pressure—this is usually defined as blood pressure over 130/80. Cardiovascular disease and hypertension are associated with poor nutrition/diet, sedentary lifestyles, and genetic risk factors.

Amongst [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees]], 4.1% of adults suffered from cardiovascular disease and 10.7% suffered from hypertension. There is also substantial risk amongst Congolese refugees. According to the CDC, amongst [[Refugees of Iraq|Iraqi refugees]] in [[Jordan]], 33% of those over 15 years of age had hypertension. Another 42% were pre-hypertensive. [[Bhutanese refugees|Bhutanese refugee]] adults had a 3% prevalence of hypertension, and nearly 1% prevalence of [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder]].&lt;ref name="CDC_refugee_health" /&gt;

=== Communicable diseases ===

==== Tuberculosis ====
Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection that mainly affects the lungs. As an airborne disease, TB is spread via inhalation of the bacteria, which subsequently travel to the lungs and other body parts to manifest infection. Once a person is infected, TB can either become latent or active. If latent, the disease is asymptomatic and non-contagious; however, latent TB can become active at any point. Active TB is symptomatic and contagious. Either way, TB should be treated immediately, as untreated infections can be fatal.

An estimated third of the world's population is infected with [[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="health.state.mn.us"&gt;{{cite web | title = Minnesota Refugee Health Provider Guide | url = http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/refugee/guide/index.html | publisher = Minnesota Department of Health }}&lt;/ref&gt; This high incidence necessitates that those conducting the overseas exam (Panel Physicians) screen all refugees for TB and further test anyone suspected of having active TB. Screening for tuberculosis generally involves a [[tuberculin skin test]], followed by a chest X-ray when necessary, and laboratory testing depending on those results. Anyone between the ages of 2 and 14, living in a country with a tuberculosis incidence rate of 20 or more cases per 100,000 people (as identified by the WHO), is required to have a tuberculin skin test. Those aged 15 and older must have a chest x-ray.

In the US, refugee individuals identified as having active tuberculosis must complete treatment before being permitted to enter. Upon arriving in the US, the CDC recommends that all refugees be screened for tuberculosis using a tuberculin skin test. A follow-up chest x-ray is required if the tuberculin skin test is positive, or if the refugee was identified as having TB (either Class A or Class B) in their overseas exam, or if they are infected with HIV.

Over 2 billion people are infected with TB worldwide. Specifically amongst refugee populations, the risk of contracting TB are higher than in the general population, as overcrowding and international travel is higher and more frequent. According to the WHO, as of 2016, the TB incidence rate in Syria is 17 per 100,000 people. Compare this to 3.1 per 100,000 people in the United States.

==== Infectious hepatitis ====
There are multiple types of hepatitis, which most broadly can be described as viral infections of the liver. The most common types are viral Hepatitis A, B, and C. Hepatitis B and C can result in chronic infections, while Hepatitis A is solely infectious. As such, Hepatitis A is also referred to as Infectious Hepatitis, and is caused by the Hepatitis A Virus (HAV). HAV can be spread directly or indirectly via fecal contact, causal contact, sexual contact, and foodborne or waterborne pathways. Because of this, refugee populations are more susceptible to this infection. According to a 2016 study conducted in Greece, the rate of Infectious Hepatitis amongst Syrian refugees in certain Greek facilities is 152 per 1,000 people; rates in refugees from Afghanistan and Iraq were much lower, at 8 per 1,000 and 9 per 1,000 people, respectively. The disproportionately higher rate in Syrian refugees can be attributed to the higher proportion of Syrian refugees in the camps, as compared to refugees from other countries of origin. There is no treatment for HAV infections, so hygienic intervention measures and vaccinations are of the highest priority in preventative measures. However, health care is often not prioritized in refugee populations and resources are limited, thus making it difficult to properly control the rate and spread of infection.

==== Hepatitis B ====
[[Hepatitis B]] infection is endemic in [[Africa]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[Northern Asia]], and most of the [[Pacific Islands]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} According to the CDC, the rate of chronic infection among persons emigrating to the US from these areas is between 5% and 15%. Many states require or recommend that all refugees be screened for hepatitis B, and proceed with immunizations for all who are susceptible to this infection.

==== Sexually transmitted infections ====
Refugees can be at a higher risk for contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] because of a lack of access to protection and/or treatment, as well as the circumstances of war and flight, making them subject to higher incidences of [[rape]] and [[sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name="Holt_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holt BY, Effler P, Brady W, Friday J, Belay E, Parker K, Toole M | title = Planning STI/HIV prevention among refugees and mobile populations: situation assessment of Sudanese refugees | journal = Disasters | volume = 27 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12703149 | doi = 10.1111/1467-7717.00216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Refugees are regularly screened for [[syphilis]], [[gonorrhea]], [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], and [[HIV|HIV infection]] when they relocate.

=== Parasitic infections ===
[[Intestinal parasites]] are a major health problem for many groups, including refugees, and the presence of pathogenic parasites requires medical attention. "Over one&amp;nbsp;billion persons worldwide are estimated to be carriers of [[Ascaris]]. Approximately 480&amp;nbsp;million people are infected with [[Entamoeba histolytica]]. At least 500&amp;nbsp;million carry [[Trichuris]]. At present, 200 to 300&amp;nbsp;million people are infected with one or more of the [[Schistosoma]] species and it is estimated that more than 20&amp;nbsp;million persons throughout the world are infected with [[Hymenolepsis nana]]".&lt;ref name="health.state.mn.us" /&gt; Consequences of parasitic infection can include [[anemia]] due to blood loss and [[Iron deficiency (medicine)|iron deficiency]], [[malnutrition]], [[growth retardation]], invasive disease, and death. Refugees are particularly at risk given the likelihood of poor or [[contaminated water]] and poor hygienic conditions in camps. Since 1999, the CDC has recommended that US-bound refugee populations from Africa and Southeast Asia undergo presumptive treatment for parasitic infections prior to departure. The US Protocol includes a single dose of albendazole.&lt;ref name="Swanson_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swanson SJ, Phares CR, Mamo B, Smith KE, Cetron MS, Stauffer WM | title = Albendazole therapy and enteric parasites in United States-bound refugees | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 366 | issue = 16 | pages = 1498–507 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22512482 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1103360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many states, the domestic health screening exam recommends that all refugees be screened for parasitic infections whether or not they appear symptomatic. Screening often includes two stool specimens obtained more than 24 hours apart and/or a CBC with differential for evaluation of [[eosinophilia]].

==== Malaria ====
[[Malaria]] is considered [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in the Americas from as far north as [[Mexico]] to as far south as [[Argentina]], in [[Africa]] from [[Egypt]] to [[South Africa]], in [[Asia]] from [[Turkey]] to [[Indonesia]], and in the islands of [[Oceania]]. It is estimated that 300 to 500&amp;nbsp;million people are infected each year with malaria, and over one&amp;nbsp;million people die every year from the disease, predominantly in sub-Saharan Africa. Based on the high prevalence of asymptomatic malaria in sub-Saharan Africa, the CDC recommends that US-bound refugee populations from this region undergo presumptive treatment prior to departure to the US. For those refugee arrivals from sub-Saharan Africa with no pre-departure treatment documentation, the CDC recommends either they receive presumptive treatment on arrival (preferred) or have laboratory screening to detect [[Plasmodium]] infection. For refugees from other areas of the world where asymptomatic malaria is not prevalent, the CDC recommends that any refugee with signs or symptoms of malaria should receive diagnostic testing for Plasmodium, and subsequent treatment for confirmed infections, but not presumptive treatment.

==== Giardiasis ====

Giardiasis is an intestinal parasitic infection, where the protozoa is in its flagellate mode of movement. It is most commonly spread through contaminated water and food in developing countries. Symptoms are rather mild, and include abdominal pain, flatulence, and loose stool. Studies have found that Giardiasis is common amongst refugee populations, specifically those coming from Afghanistan. However, the parasite is not particularly adept at sustaining infection within children.

==== Leishmaniasis ====
Leishmaniasis is another parasitic infection with a high burden of disease amongst refugee populations. It is a vector-borne parasite, commonly spread by the bite of an infected sand flies. There are two common types of manifestation: cutaneous (skin lesions) and visceral leishmaniasis (infection of internal organs). In 2012, there was an outbreak of Leishmaniasis amongst Syrians. Leishmaniasis is of major concern in the eastern Mediterranean, which is home to the majority of the globe's prevalence (≈57%). Leishmaniasis is most common in this region, as well as in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Syrian Arab Republic. Thus, refugees coming from these regions, which is the majority of all refugees, are highly susceptible to becoming infected by this parasite. Additionally, refugees from other countries are put at a high risk of contraction, as they often share temporary settlements with refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq. As a preventative measure, refugees are administered, when available, albendazole and ivermectin prior to their asylum seeking journey to other countries like the United States. Upon arrival, refugees are typically screened for these infections in order to prevent spread and fatality.

===Mental health===
As mental illnesses are not necessarily tangible or easily quantifiable, it is easy to disregard the real ramifications that poor mental health can have on a person. These repercussions can materialize in any aspect of a person's life, whether that be physical, social, financial, etc. Further, the manifestations of poor mental health are deeply rooted when trauma is experienced at a young age. Thus, populations vulnerable to traumatic experiences are at a concerningly high risk of mental illnesses and poor mental health.

Prior to [[World War II]], immigrants were mainly driven from their countries by forces such as unemployment, famine and poverty, often combined with various forms of prejudice and oppression whilst war and ethnopolitical conflict were less common causes for emigration. They have known social oppression, including inadequate education, lack of job opportunities, inability to practice their faith or marry whom they wished, and inability to live where they want. Beginning with World War II, however, civilians were increasingly targeted as a strategy of warfare, and since then most newcomers (especially refugees) have been victims of war and/or political repression. Many of them have also experienced or witnessed government-sponsored torture and/or terror. That said, refugees are often survivors who possess amazing resiliency, strength and resourcefulness.&lt;ref name="health.state.mn.us" /&gt; An assessment of mental health may be included in a refugee's domestic health screening.

Refugee [[mental health]] and integration into a new society are exquisitely interwoven. Traumatic experiences that occurred in the home country or during the resulting flight from that country are common. These experiences, in addition to the stresses of resettling in the host country, increase the chances of a less successful adjustment to the society of the host country. Mental health problems are one of the key barriers to the labor market integration of refugees in host societies.&lt;ref name="ruiz2018"&gt;{{cite journal|authors= Ruiz, I., and C. Vargas-Silva.|year=2018 |title=Differences in labour market outcomes between natives, refugees and other migrants in the UK | journal = Journal of Economic Geography | volume=18 | pages=855–885|url=https://academic.oup.com/joeg/article/18/4/855/5023833}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of these traumatic and stressful events may be temporary and manageable with straightforward solutions or may be disabling and enduring.

High rates of mental health concerns have been documented in various refugee populations. Most studies reveal high rates of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), [[anxiety]], [[depression (mood)|depression]], and [[somatization]] among newly arrived refugees. Variations reported in the prevalence of PTSD and depression may be ascribed to a number of factors, including prior life in their homeland, the experience of flight from that homeland, life in refugee camps, and stressors during and after resettlement in a third country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = James M. | last1 = Jaranson | first2 = Solvig | last2 = Ekblad | first3 = Georgi V. | last3 = Kroupin | first4 = David P. | last4 = Eisenman | editor-first1 = Patricia Frye | editor-last1 = Walker | editor-first2 = Elizabeth Day | editor-last2 = Barnett | editor-first3 = William | editor-last3 = Stauffer | editor-first4 = James M | editor-last4 = Jaranson | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Chapter 47: Mental Health and Illness in Immigrants: Epidemiology and Risk Factors | chapter-url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ggajBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA627 | title = Immigrant Medicine | date = 25 October 2007 | publisher = Elsevier Health Sciences | isbn = 978-0-323-07057-7 | pages = 627–628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, socioeconomic status, educational background, and gender all affect levels of mental illness.&lt;ref name="pmid16077055"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Porter M, Haslam N | title = Predisplacement and postdisplacement factors associated with mental health of refugees and internally displaced persons: a meta-analysis | journal = JAMA | volume = 294 | issue = 5 | pages = 602–12 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16077055 | doi = 10.1001/jama.294.5.602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a study focused on the impacts of traumatic events on displaced persons from Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan. It revealed that 54% of the population studied suffered from a severe emotional disorder. Of the children who participated in the study, 44% revealed depressive symptoms, and 45% showed signs of PTSD. Compared to other children around the globe, these statistics show a 10-fold increase in mental health disorders. Similarly to topics surrounding menstrual health, mental health is considered to be another taboo topic amongst certain cultures. This prevents people from seeking psychiatric help. Currently, there is only one functioning mental health hospital in Syria that tends to psychiatric needs. In 2016, a Syrian-American doctor named M.K. Hamza coined a new term to more accurately describe the effects felt by nearly all refugees affected by the ongoing crisis—human devastation syndrome. There is a severe lack of, and a dire need for, mental health attention and care. These traumatic events typically worsen and amplify progressively in the years following.

It is critical that mental health issues be addressed in the screening process. Leaving behind all that is familiar and starting a new life in a new country with a different language and culture in addition to previous trauma and dislocation produces an immediate challenge that can have long-term effects. This is true whether an individual is coming from Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, or elsewhere in the world. Many refugees will not share a Western perspective or vocabulary, so questions will need to be explained through specific examples or re-framed in culturally congruent terms with the assistance of an interpreter or bicultural worker.&lt;ref name="health.state.mn.us" /&gt; One option is to administer an efficient and valid screener for emotional distress, such as the Refugee Health Screener - 15, in the context of the overall health screening.&lt;ref name="Hollifield_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hollifield M, Verbillis-Kolp S, Farmer B, Toolson EC, Woldehaimanot T, Yamazaki J, Holland A, St Clair J, SooHoo J | title = The Refugee Health Screener-15 (RHS-15): development and validation of an instrument for anxiety, depression, and PTSD in refugees | journal = General Hospital Psychiatry | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 202–9 | date = 2013 | pmid = 23347455 | doi = 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2012.12.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods of treatment for refugees with mental health issues must also be culturally congruent. Western psychiatric methods may not applicable to individuals who do not conceive of the body and mind in the same way as people in the United States.&lt;ref name="Mercer_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mercer SW, Ager A, Ruwanpura E | title = Psychosocial distress of Tibetans in exile: integrating western interventions with traditional beliefs and practice | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 60 | issue = 1 | pages = 179–89 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15482877 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.04.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, studies of Tibetan refugees have shown how important the Tibetan religion of Buddhism is in helping the refugees cope with their situation. The religion provides them with an explanation for their situation and hope for a better future.&lt;ref name="survivorsoftorture.org"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sachs E, Rosenfeld B, Lhewa D, Rasmussen A, Keller A | title = Entering exile: trauma, mental health, and coping among Tibetan refugees arriving in Dharamsala, India | journal = Journal of Traumatic Stress | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–208 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18404641 | doi = 10.1002/jts.20324 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, indigenous methods of coping and psychological therapy can be integrated with Western methods of therapy to provide a wide spectrum of mental help to refugees.&lt;ref name="Mercer_2005" /&gt;

Additionally, refugee children face unique barriers to adequate psychological health support due to significant trauma during their vulnerable developmental years.

=== Women's health ===
Every woman from every country experiences her own menstrual process. However, some countries are more adept than others at providing proper resources and accessibility for women to easily maintain good hygiene. Menstrual health requires constant and proper upkeep in order to avoid subsequent infections. Menstruation requires attentive care and proper hygienic supplies. Thus, it is no wonder that while in the high income countries, menstrual health is not a major public health concern, but in developing countries or in times of crises, menstruation can pose a distinct problem for women in vulnerable populations.

Proper menstrual care includes washing oneself with soap on a daily basis, and changing menstrual supplies (such as pads or tampons) multiple times per day. Improper care can cause progressive infections, such as bacterial vaginosis (BV) or reproductive tract infection (RTI). With limited access to clean, running water and hygienic supplies (soap, pads, tampons) within refugee camps, monthly periods create health problems for women and girls.

As such, studies have been conducted in various refugee camps to assess the degree of burden that menstruation has on women. Refugees staying in temporary settlements in Myanmar reported poor latrine conditions, describing them as unsafe and dirty, with locks on the doors being a rare occurrence. Additionally, many young girls reported dark, unlit paths at nighttime causing unwarranted assaults by intruders in the camps. Thus, girls reportedly would not use the bathroom once it was dark outside, even if in need of a shower or a fresh pad.

Another obstacle that refugee women face in maintaining their menstrual health is limited to no access to an adequate amount of sanitary supplies. Many refugees do not have the luxury of changing their pads every few hours per day, so a buildup of bacteria is common. Other studies have revealed that when desperate, women will resort to using leaves or old pads to absorb the discharged blood, according to a report by Sommer's team in the journal Conflict and Health.

In addition to limited supplies and sanitary facilities, cultural attitudes towards menstruation create a difficult, taboo environment surrounding the topic. Thus, women and girls may feel too uncomfortable to seek help or advice on tending to their personal needs.

=== Occupational health ===
Demand for labor is an important reason for migration. Despite the difficulty in researching immigrant populations, there is evidence that [[Occupational safety and health|occupational health]] is an area in which immigrants face disparities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Flynn | first1 = Michael | last2 = Eggerth | first2 = Donald | editor-first1 = Marc B. | editor-last1 = Schenker | editor-first2 = Xóchitl | editor-last2 = Castañeda | editor-first3 = Alfonso | editor-last3 = Rodriguez-Lainz | name-list-format = vanc | chapter = Chapter 20: Occupational Health Research with Immigrant Workers | title = Migration and Health: A Research Methods Handbook | date = 2014 | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 978-0-520-27795-3 | pages = 377–395 | chapter-url =  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277224659_Occupational_Health_Research_with_Immigrant_Workers?_sg=4bOtq8P7CuEeeVZzW7h-KQXLH4ohUiSrnbOCDPz3AeQNQezlcLJzV8OGFSSaGAzjiBefjTKWgIX6JE5PkcB8H6-Py_g8EkNttl5BEz6i.oLabspekWVxjHLUYPYlSf2xP5pS4RClFkyclD7v5a7AF8mCUvHSskKpmasTWicA7vPNazvFjp9DRp0GM0IX6TQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An emerging occupational health issue for immigrants relates to the health risks faced by people who are trafficked into situations of forced labor and [[debt bondage]].

== Interventions ==

=== Health Literacy ===
[[Health literacy]] is a crucial component to preventative healthcare and improved public health. A cross-sectional study conducted amongst refugees in Sweden, found that 60% of those assessed had inadequate functioning health literacy and 27% of them had inadequate comprehensive health literacy. The study concluded that health literacy should be taken into consideration when assessing refugee health and that more research is needed to assess the current dynamics and develop strategies to overcome the gaps in health literacy amongst refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wångdahl J, Lytsy P, Mårtensson L, Westerling R | title = Health literacy among refugees in Sweden - a cross-sectional study | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 14 | pages = 1030 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25278109 | pmc = 4195944 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-14-1030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the provision of targeted, adequate health literacy tool kits, populations are more likely to adhere to treatment plans and prevention efforts—particularly in the realm of [[Infectious disease (medical specialty)|infectious disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Osborne RH, Beauchamp A, Batterham R | title = Health literacy: a concept with potential to greatly impact the infectious diseases field | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 43 | pages = 101–102 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26724772 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijid.2015.12.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These health literacy tools must be relevant to the communities, administered in familiar language and vocabulary, and must truly take into account the competencies and limitations of the target audience.Within health literacy initiatives, collaborative learning and [[social support]] could contribute to people's understanding and ability to judge, sift and use health information. Consequently,  adding these practices to the definition of critical health literacy could prove to be hugely beneficial to patient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Wit L, Fenenga C, Giammarchi C, di Furia L, Hutter I, de Winter A, Meijering L | title = Community-based initiatives improving critical health literacy: a systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative evidence | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 40 | date = July 2017 | pmid = 28728547 | pmc = 5520348 | doi = 10.1186/s12889-017-4570-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-Communicable Diseases ===
When addressing the needs of [[Non-communicable disease|NCD]] patients within [[Humanitarian crisis|humanitarian crises]], there needs to be a more epidemiological approach to assessing prevalence of NCDs to ensure a better understanding of the local needs and risks. After such assessment is made, those new understandings must be targeted to create novel, innovative approaches to mitigate risks and promote healthy behaviors—in an infectious manner. Finally, in order to adequately provide such resources, there must be strong guidance and [[Health education|education]] continuously available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jobanputra K, Boulle P, Roberts B, Perel P | title = Three Steps to Improve Management of Noncommunicable Diseases in Humanitarian Crises | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 11 | pages = e1002180 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27824879 | pmc = 5100924 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002180 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immunizations===
Refugees arrive in their new countries with a variety of [[immunization]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bigot A, Blok L, Boelaert M, Chartier Y, Corijn P, Davis A, Deguerry M, Dusauchoit T, Fermon F, Griekspoor A | title = Refugee health: an approach to emergency situations | date = 1997 | publisher = Macmillan Education | location = London | isbn = 978-0-333-72210-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While refugees may have had vaccinations in their country of origin, often they lack documentation because they were forced to depart their home country in haste. Some may have received immunizations as part of their overseas exam, and some may have received no immunizations. Recommendations by the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) Expanded Program on Immunizations (EPI) are generally followed by countries worldwide with minor variations in vaccine schedules, spacing of vaccine doses, and documentation. The majority of vaccines used worldwide are from reliable local or international manufacturers, and no potency problems have been detected, with the occasional exception of [[tetanus]] toxoid and the oral [[polio vaccine]] (OPV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/tools/DTP_vaccine_rates_information_sheet.pdf|title=Information Sheet - Observed Rate of Vaccine Reactions - Diphtheria, Pertussis, Tetanus Vaccines |date=May 2014|website=World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Refugee health in the United States|United States]], entering refugees are not required to have vaccinations. However, it is mandated that at the time of applying for adjustment of status from legal temporary resident to legal permanent resident, a refugee must be fully vaccinated in accordance with recommendations of the [[Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices]] (ACIP). A list of required vaccines in the US can be found on the [[vaccine schedule]] page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/index.html | title = Immunization Schedules for Healthcare Professionals | publisher = United States Centers for Disease Control | access-date = 2017-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social support===

Social support can be very helpful in preventing mental health issues and for coping with living in a new land,&lt;ref name="survivorsoftorture.org" /&gt; so refugees from the same areas should be able to live close to each other. However, even in this case, it may be necessary for social support to be offered by statutory or voluntary agencies from outside the refugees' and asylum seekers' communities in line with local informal and formal structures and networks. One model for such support was proposed by British authors in 2014, the WAMBA process, in which five essential components of support for refugees and asylum seekers were identified:

* '''W'''elcome: a person-centred and benign enquiry as to the asylum seeker's history in a friendly setting and with the use of interpreters if necessary.
* '''A'''ccompaniment: the availability of social support in an asylum-seeking client's life (amongst other presences such as an exilic community and intimate attachments) may foster assurance that moments of crisis can be negotiated by asylum seeker and support worker together.
* '''M'''ediation: offering a type of humanitarian solidarity and care which will offset some of the negative consequences of the asylum-seeking process and the [[hegemonic]] order which it represents and mediating between the individual asylum seeker and the systemic constraints of the asylum process.
* '''B'''efriending: Befriending is another side to the relationship of accompaniment and which seeks to mitigate the political reality within which asylum seekers find themselves and which is distinctly unfriendly: tightly controlled, suspicious, rebarbative and highly hostile.
* '''A'''dvocacy: The professional helping relationship between worker and client can potentially diminish the isolation brought about by the circumstances within which some asylum seekers may live by giving time to hear the voice of the individual and providing support that attends to the individual's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fell|first1=Benedict|last2=Fell|first2=Peter | name-list-format = vanc |date=July 2014|title=Welfare across borders: a social work process with adult asylum seekers |journal=[[The British Journal of Social Work]] | publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] |volume=44|issue=5|pages=1322&amp;ndash;1339|doi=10.1093/bjsw/bct003|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[religions|religious traditions]] have taken a stance on [[abortion]], and these stances span a broad spectrum, as highlighted below.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/abortion/religion/religion.shtml BBC "Religion and Ethics"] Be aware that these BBC pages do not cover all Protestant, Muslim, Hindu or Buddhist beliefs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Topics/All-Topics/Topic-Page-Abortion.html Patheos Public Square Topic] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005014915/http://www.patheos.com/Topics/All-Topics/Topic-Page-Abortion.html |date=2011-10-05 }} Including Buddhist, Muslim, Mormon, and Pagan perspectives in addition to Catholic, Evangelical, Protestant, and Jewish perspectives.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'í Faith==
Abortion, for the purpose of eliminating an unwanted child, and permanent sterilization are generally forbidden to [[Bahá'ís]] unless there is some medical reason for it. At present, Bahá'ís are encouraged to decide based on their own conscience in light of general guidance found in Bahá'í writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Bahá'u'lláh | author2 =Abdu'l-Bahá |author3=Shoghi Effendi |author4=Universal House of Justice |editor-last =Hornby| editor-first = Helen| title =Lights of Guidance: A Bahá'í Reference File | publisher =New Delhi: Bahá'í Publishing Trust | year =1983 | url =http://bahai-library.com/hornby_lights_guidance_2.html&amp;chapter=2#n1154 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
{{main article|Buddhism and abortion}}
There is no single [[Buddhist]] view concerning abortion.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml Abortion: Buddhism]." ''BBC Religion &amp; Ethics.'' Retrieved January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditional sources, including some Buddhist monastic codes, hold that life begins at conception, and that abortion, which would then involve the deliberate destruction of life, should be rejected.&lt;ref name="Harvey"&gt;Harvey, Peter. Introduction to Buddhist Ethics (2000). Cambridge University Press. pg. 311–20&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating the issue is the Buddhist belief that "life is a continuum with no discernible starting point".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Buddhism-and-Abortion.html Buddhism and Abortion on Patheos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301172029/http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Buddhism-and-Abortion.html |date=2010-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Buddhists, there is no official or preferred viewpoint regarding abortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/abortion.shtml Buddhism and abortion on BBC Religions]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] has said that abortion is "negative", but there are exceptions. He said, "I think abortion should be approved or disapproved according to each circumstance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Claudia Dreifus]] |work=New York Times |date= 28 November 1993 |url=http://www.tibet.ca/en/newsroom/wtn/archive/old?y=1993&amp;m=12&amp;p=5_1 |title= New York Times Interview with the Dalai Lama |accessdate= 31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inducing or otherwise causing an abortion is regarded as a serious matter in the monastic rules followed by both [[Theravada]] and [[Vajrayana]] monks; monks and nuns must be expelled for assisting a woman in procuring an abortion.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; Traditional sources do not recognize a distinction between early- and late-term abortion, but in Sri Lanka and Thailand the "moral stigma" associated with an abortion grows with the development of the foetus.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt; While traditional sources do not seem to be aware of the possibility of abortion as relevant to the health of the mother, modern Buddhist teachers from many traditions&amp;nbsp;– and abortion laws in many Buddhist countries&amp;nbsp;– recognize a threat to the life or physical health of the mother as an acceptable justification for abortion as a practical matter, though it may still be seen as a deed with negative moral or karmic consequences.&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;

== Christianity ==
{{main article|Abortion and Christianity|Catholic Church and abortion}}
There is scholarly disagreement on how early Christians felt about abortion, and no explicit prohibition of abortion in either the "Old Testament" or "New Testament" books of the [[Christian Bible]]. Some scholars have concluded that early Christians took a nuanced stance on what is now called abortion, and that at different times, and in separate places, early Christians have taken different stances.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VBN6r3cC6v0C&amp;pg=PA110 When Children Became People: the birth of childhood in early Christianity] by Odd Magne Bakke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Law111/CatholicHistory.htm "Abortion and Catholic Thought: The Little-Told History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218195040/http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/Law111/CatholicHistory.htm |date=2012-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=universityofcalifornia&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-SZnZTSQV9EC&amp;pg=PA12 Abortion and the Politics of Motherhood] by Kristin Luker, University of California Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have concluded that early Christians considered abortion a sin at all stages; although there is disagreement over their thoughts on what type of sin it was&lt;ref name="prejudices"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VXGkAhyNGAEC&amp;pg=PA166 Ana S.

Additionally, there are sizable minorities in some denominations that disagree with their denomination's stance on abortion.&lt;ref name=where /&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{Main article|Hinduism and abortion}}
Classical Hindu texts strongly condemn abortion. The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] writes, "When considering abortion, the Hindu way is to choose the action that will do least harm to all involved: the mother and father, the foetus and society." The BBC goes on to state, "In practice, however, abortion is practiced in Hindu culture in India, because the religious ban on abortion is sometimes overruled by the cultural preference for sons. This can lead to [[Sex-selective abortion|abortion to prevent the birth of girl babies]], which is called 'female foeticide'."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/hinduethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC] "Hinduism and abortion"&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu scholars and women's rights advocates have supported bans on sex-selective abortions. Some Hindus support abortion in cases where the mother's life is at imminent risk or when the foetus has a life-threatening developmental anomaly.

Some Hindu theologians and [[Brahma Kumaris]] believe personhood begins at three months and develops through to five months of gestation, possibly implying permitting abortion up to the third month and considering any abortion past the third month to be destruction of the soul's current incarnate body.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 1: Dilemmas of Life and Death: Hindu Ethics in a North American Context | Date: 1995 | Author: Crawford, S.

==Islam==
{{Main article|Islam and abortion}}
Although there are different opinions among Islamic scholars about when life begins, and when abortion is permissible, most agree that the termination of a pregnancy after 120 days - the point at which, in Islam, a foetus is thought to become a living soul - is not permissible.&lt;ref name=PewForum&gt;The Pew Forum. September 30, 2008. [http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=351 ''Religious Groups’ Official Positions on Abortion''], Retrieved on April 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Islamic thinkers contend that in cases prior to four months of gestation, abortion should be permissible only in instances in which the mother's life is in danger or in cases of rape.&lt;ref name=PewForum/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml BBC.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools of [[Sharia|Muslim law]] permit abortion in the first sixteen weeks of pregnancy, whereas others only allow it in the first seven weeks of pregnancy. The further along the pregnancy has progressed, the greater the wrong. The Qur'an does not specifically mention abortion, but it skirts the issue by condemning intentional murder. All schools accept abortion as a means to save the mother's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BBC - Religions - Islam: Abortion|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/abortion_1.shtml|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
{{main article|Judaism and abortion}}
Orthodox Jewish teaching allows abortion if necessary to safeguard the life of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/jewishethics/abortion_1.shtml Judaism and Abortion], BBC (2005-02-08).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bank, Richard.

In Judaism, views on abortion draw primarily upon the legal and ethical teachings of the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Talmud]], the case-by-case decisions of [[Responsa#In Judaism|responsa]], and other rabbinic literature. Generally speaking, Orthodox Jews oppose abortion after the 40th day,&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Yevomot 69a states that prior to the 40th day, a foetus is "considered to be mere water"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grodzenski, Achiezer Vol. 3, 65:14&lt;/ref&gt; with health-related exceptions, and reform Jews tend to allow greater latitude for abortion.&lt;ref&gt;Articles published by the [[Schlesinger institute]] on [[Judaism and abortion|abortion in Judaism]]: articles [http://www.medethics.org.il/db/jmeResults.asp?title=abortion&amp;author=&amp;source=&amp;year=&amp;Submit2=%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%A9 in English] and [http://www.medethics.org.il/db/AsiaResults.asp?title=&amp;keywords=20&amp;author=&amp;source=&amp;year=&amp;Submit2=%D7%97%D7%A4%D7%A9 in Hebrew], and the [http://www.medethics.org.il/articles/tora/subject18.asp entry on abortion] from the Encyclopedia of Jewish Medical Ethics (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; There are rulings that often appear conflicting on the matter.

The Hebrew Bible has a few references to abortion; Exodus 21:22-25 addresses [[miscarriage]] by way of another's actions, which it describes as a non-capital offense punishable through a fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Exodus|21:22-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isser, Stanley.

==Sikhism==
Although the [[Sikh]] code of conduct does not deal directly with abortion (or indeed many other bioethical issues), it is generally forbidden in Sikhism because it is said to interfere with the creative work of God.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/sikhethics/abortion.shtml BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this theoretical viewpoint, abortion is not uncommon among the Sikh community in India, and there is growing concern that [[Sex-selective abortion|female foetuses are being aborted]] because of the cultural preference for sons.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Unitarian Universalism==
The [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Church]] strongly supports abortion rights. In 1978, the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution that declared, "...&lt;nowiki&gt;[the]&lt;/nowiki&gt; right to choice on contraception and abortion are important aspects of the right of privacy, respect for human life, and freedom of conscience of women and their families".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/20271.shtml Right to Choose] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904064958/http://www.uua.org/socialjustice/socialjustice/statements/20271.shtml |date=2009-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Association had released earlier statements in 1963 and 1968 favoring the reform of restrictive abortion laws.

==Wicca==
Although views differ, most Wiccans consider abortion to be a spiritual decision that should be free from interference by the state or politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of women and religion in North America: Volume 1 - Page 811, Rosemary Skinner Keller, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Marie Cantlon - 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34296">Scholarly studies have investigated the effects of religion on health. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) discerns four dimensions of health, namely physical, social, mental, and spirirtual health. Having a [[religious belief]] may have both positive and negative impacts on health and morbidity.

==Religion and spirituality==
[[Spirituality]] has been ascribed many different definitions in different contexts, but a general definition is: an individual’s search for meaning and purpose in life. Spirituality is distinct from [[organized religion]] in that spirituality does not necessarily need a religious framework. That is, one does not necessarily need to follow certain rules, guidelines or practices to be spiritual, but an organized religion often has some combination of these in place. Some people who suffer from severe mental disorders may find comfort in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pargament|first=Kenneth|date=February 2013|title=Understanding and addressing religion among people with mental illness|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=12 | issue = 1 |pages=26–32|doi=10.1002/wps.20005|pmid=23471791|pmc=3619169}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who report themselves to be spiritual people may not observe any specific religious practices or traditions.&lt;ref name="Nelson, C.J. 2002 pp. 213"&gt;Nelson, C.J., Rosenfeld, B., Breitbart, W., Galietta, M.

==Dimensions of health==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) discerns four dimensions of health, namely physical, social, mental, and spirirtual health.

===Physical health===

====Positive effects====
According to Ellison &amp; Levin (1998), some studies indicate that religiosity appears to positively correlate with physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

These studies have been carried out among all ages,genders and religions. These are based on the experience of religion is positive in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seybold,K.S &amp; Hill,P.C|date=February 2001|title=The Role Of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=10 | issue = 1 |pages=21–24|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00106|jstor=20182684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One possibility is that religion provides physical health benefits indirectly. Church attendees present with lower rates of alcohol consumption and improvement in mood, which is associated with better physical health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Similar studies have been done investigating religious emotions and health. Although religious emotions, such as humility, forgiveness, and gratitude confer health benefits, it is unclear if religious people cultivate and experience those emotions more frequently than non-religious peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Church attendance====
Church attendance has been found to increase life expectancy (Hummer et al. 1999) with a life expectancy at age 20 of 83 years for frequent attendees and 75 years for non-attendees.  The finding, however, does not prove that religion in itself increases life expectancy.

====Death rates====
Kark et. (1996) included almost 4,000 Israelis, over 16 years (beginning in 1970), death rates were compared between the experimental group (people belonging to 11 religious [[kibbutz]]im) versus the control group (people belonging to secular kibbutzim). Some determining factors for the groups included the date the kibbutz was created, geography of the different groups, and the similarity in age. It was determined that “belonging to a religious collective was associated with a strong protective effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kark JD, Shemi G, Friedlander Y, Martin O, Manor O, Blondheim SH |title=Does religious observance promote health? mortality in secular vs religious kibbutzim in Israel |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=341–6 |date=March 1996  |pmid=8604758 |pmc=1380514 |doi=10.2105/ajph.86.3.341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do religious people tend to exhibit healthier lifestyles, they also have a strong support system that secular people would not normally have. A religious community can provide support especially through a stressful life event such as the death of a loved one or illness. There is the belief that a higher power will provide healing and strength through the rough times which also can explain the lower mortality rate of religious people vs. secular people.

The existence of ‘religious struggle’ in elderly patients was predictive of greater risk of mortality in a study by Pargament et al. (2001). Results indicate that patients, with a previously sound religious life, experienced a 19% to 28% greater mortality due to the belief that God was supposedly punishing them or abandoning them.

====Infections====
A number of religious practices have been reported to cause [[infections]]. These happened during an ultra-orthodox Jewish [[circumcision]]s practice known as [[Brit milah#Metzitzah B.27Peh|metzitzah b'peh]], the ritual 'side roll' in [[Hinduism]],&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The ‘side roll’ is a ritual performed during a Hindu festival in which large numbers of male devotees lie prostrate on the ground and roll sideways around the temple premises in fulfilment of vows taken at the temple. Because the men’s upper bodies are usually bare during this ritual, their skin comes into contact with the parasitic larvae that infest the soil or sand on the ground, resulting in the [[Cutaneous larva migrans]] (CLM) skin disease.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Communion rite|communion]] [[chalice]], during the Islamic [[Hajj]] and after the Muslim ritual [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]].&lt;ref name="Pellerin"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Prayer====
{{Main|Studies on intercessory prayer}}

Some religions claim that praying for somebody who is sick can have positive effects on the health of the person being prayed for. [[meta-study|Meta-studies]] of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernible effect" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=Masters &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masters | first1 = K. | last2 = Spielmans | first2 = G. | last3 = Goodson | first3 = J. | date = Aug 2006 | title = Are there demonstrable effects of distant intercessory prayer?

Randomized controlled trials of intercessory prayer have not yielded significant effects on health. These trials have compared personal, focused, committed and organized intercessory prayer with those interceding holding some belief that they are praying to God or a god versus any other intervention. A Cochrane collaboration review of these trials concluded that 1) results were equivocal, 2) evidence does not support a recommendation either in favor or against the use of intercessory prayer and 3) any resources available for future trials should be used to investigate other questions in health research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roberts L, Ahmed I, Hall S, Davison A |title=Intercessory prayer for the alleviation of ill health |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |volume= |issue=2 |pages=CD000368 |year=2009 |pmid=19370557 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000368.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a case-control study done following 5,286 Californians over a 28-year period in which variables were controlled for (i.e. age, race/ethnicity, gender, education level), participants who went to church on a frequent basis (defined as attending a religious service once a week or more) were 36% less likely to die during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strawbridge WJ, Cohen RD, Shema SJ, Kaplan GA |title=Frequent attendance at religious services and mortality over 28 years |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=87 |issue=6 |pages=957–61 |date=June 1997  |pmid=9224176 |pmc=1380930 |doi=10.2105/ajph.87.6.957}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can be partly be attributed to a better lifestyle since religious people tend to drink and smoke less and eat a healthier diet.

===Mental health===
Evidence suggests that religiosity can be a pathway to both mental health and mental disorder. For example, [[religiosity]] is positively associated with mental disorders that involve an excessive amount of self-control and negatively associated with mental disorders that involve a lack of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Depression====
Studies have shown a negative relationship between spiritual well-being and depressive symptoms. In one study, those who were assessed to have a higher spiritual [[quality of life]] on a spiritual well-being scale had less [[Depression symptoms|depressive symptoms]].&lt;ref&gt;Fehring, R.J., Miller, J.F., Shaw, C. (1997). Spiritual well-being, religiosity, hope, depression, and other mood states in elderly people coping with cancer 24. Oncology Nursing Forum. pp. 663–671.&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer and AIDS patients who were more spiritual had lower depressive symptoms than religious patients. Spirituality shows beneficial effects possibly because it speaks to one’s ability to intrinsically find meaning in life, strength, and inner peace, which is especially important for very ill patients.&lt;ref name="Nelson, C.J. 2002 pp. 213"/&gt;

Exline et al. 1999  showed that the difficulty in forgiving God and alienation from God were associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Among those who currently believed in God, forgiving God for a specific, unfortunate incident predicted lower levels of anxious and depressed mood.

====Schizophrenia and Psychosis====
Studies have reported beneficial effects of spirituality on the lives of patients with schizophrenia, [[major depression]], and other psychotic disorders. Schizophrenic patients were less likely to be re-hospitalized if families encouraged [[religious]] practice, and in depressed patients who underwent religiously based interventions, their symptoms improved faster than those who underwent [[secular]] interventions. Furthermore, a few cross-sectional studies have shown that more religiously involved people had less instance of [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Koenig, H. G. (2008) Research on religion, spirituality, and mental health: A review. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Life satisfaction====
Research shows that religiosity moderates the relationship between “thinking about meaning of life” and life satisfaction. For individuals scoring low and moderately on religiosity, thinking about the meaning of life is negatively correlated with life satisfaction. For people scoring highly on religiosity, however, this relationship is positive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Religiosity has also been found to moderate the relationship between negative affect and life satisfaction, such that life satisfaction is less strongly influenced by the frequency of negative emotions in more religious (vs less religious) individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joshanloo|first=Mohsen|date=2016-04-01|title=Religiosity moderates the relationship between negative affect and life satisfaction: A study in 29 European countries|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656616300010|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=61|pages=11–14|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2016.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who use positive religious coping are likely to seek spiritual support and look for meaning in a traumatic situation. Negative religious coping (or [[spiritual struggle]]s) expresses conflict, question, and doubt regarding issues of God and faith.

The effects of religious coping are measured in many different circumstances, each with different outcomes. Some common experiences where people use religious coping are fear-inflicting events such as 9/11 or the holocaust, death and sickness, and near death experiences. Research also shows that people also use religious coping to deal with everyday stressors in addition to life-changing traumas. The underlying assumption of the ability of religion to influence the coping process lies in the hypothesis that religion is more than a [[defence mechanism]] as it was viewed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Rather than inspiring denial, religion stimulates reinterpretations of negative events through the sacred lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krok|first1=D|title=The mediating role of coping in the relationships between religiousness and mental health (2014)|publisher=Archives of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social health===

===Spiritual health===
'''Spiritual Health''' is one of four dimensions to well-being as defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), which include physical, social, and mental.

The preamble to Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO)  adopted by the International Health Conference held in New York from 19 June to 22 July 1946 and signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the World Health Organization 2002, 80 (12)&lt;/ref&gt; defined health as a state of "physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"&lt;ref&gt;Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization as adopted by the International Health Conference, New York, 19–22 June 1946; signed on 22 July 1946 by the representatives of 61 States (Official Records of the World Health Organization, no. 2, p. 100) and entered into force on 7 April 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and it has not been amended.

However, in 1983 twenty-two WHO member countries from the Eastern Mediterranean Region proposed a draft resolution to this preamble to include reference to spiritual health, such that it would redefine health as a state of "physical, mental, spiritual and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity".&lt;ref&gt;Review of the Constitution of the World Health Organization: Report of the Executive Board Special Group. 101st Session. Agenda Item 7.3. 22 January 1998. Geneva: World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst WHO did not amend the preamble to its constitution, resolution WHA31.13 passed by the Thirty-seventh World Health Assembly, in 1984&lt;ref&gt;Thirty-seventh World Health Assembly, Resolution WHA37.13. Geneva: World Health Organization; 1984. WHO document WHA37/1984/REC/1:6.&lt;/ref&gt; called upon Member States to consider including in their [[Health For All]] strategies a spiritual dimension as defined in that resolution in accordance with their own social and cultural patterns
&lt;ref&gt;The fourth ten years of the World Health Organization: 1978–1987. Geneva: World Health Organization, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; recognizing  that "the  spiritual dimension  plays  a great  role in motivating people's achievements in all aspects of life".&lt;ref&gt;Draft Regional Health-for-all Policy and Strategy for the Twenty-First Century. World Health Organization Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean. Forty-fifth Session, Agenda item 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete description of the spiritual dimension as articulated by the Health Assembly is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The spiritual dimension is understood to imply a phenomenon that is not material in nature, but belongs to the realm of ideas, beliefs, values and ethics that have arisen in  the minds and conscience of human beings, particularly ennobling ideas. Ennobling ideas have given rise to health ideals, which have led to a practical strategy for Health for All that aims at attaining a goal that has both a material and non-material component. If the material component of the strategy can be provided to people, the non-material or spiritual one is something that has to arise within people and communities in keeping with their social and cultural patterns. The spiritual dimension plays a great role in motivating people’s achievement in all aspects of life.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization Publication: Year 1991. Issue 9290211407. Chapter 4: The Spiritual Dimension.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the inclusion of spiritual health within WHO's purview, a number of other significant organizations have also attended to spirituality and incorporated reference to it in key documents, including the [[United Nations]] action plan [[Agenda 21]]&lt;ref&gt;Sitarz, Dan. "Agenda 21: The earth summit strategy to save our planet." (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; which recognizes the right of individuals to "healthy physical, mental, and spiritual development".&lt;ref&gt;Agenda 21. Chapter 6.23. United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Rio de Janeiro, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2823">A '''respectful workplace''' is a safe place of employment where employees are valued, recognised, treated fairly have clear expectations, and work harmoniously.&lt;ref name="apsc4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/current-publications/mental-health/a-respectful-workplace|title=-  4. Creating a respectful workplace|work=Promoting mental health and wellbeing at work|publisher=Australian Public Service Commission|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Benefits== 
Benefits of a respectful workplace include better moral, teamwork, lower absenteeism, lower turnover of staff, reduced [[worker's compensation]] claims,
better ability to handle change and recover from problems, work seems less onerous, and improved productivity.
Positively viewed teams will retain and employ better staff.

Lack of respect and what is sometimes called "incivility"—low level negative behaviours (such as rudeness, discourteousness, not acknowledging other staff)—can create a dysfunctional team environment, relationship breakdown, decline in productivity, and the risk of psychological injury.
== Process == 
Managers that want to encourage a respectful workplace must model the appropriate example.
They should talk about what behaviours are encouraged.
The managers must be willing to talk about problem behaviours.
There should be safe ways to report problems, which could be anonymous, or independent people such as an ombudsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.unb.ca/towardarespectfulworkplace/safe.html|title=TOWARDS A RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measures of the culture could include competitiveness, formality, respect, hospitality and supportiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.unb.ca/towardarespectfulworkplace/climate.html|title=Assess workplace culture|work=TOWARDS A RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect can be included in performance appraisals, with feedback given in a formal process. Disrespectful behaviour must not be ignored but be named and its impact brought to the attention of the responsible person. By ignoring problematic behaviour, others will perceive it as condoned.



The Compassionate organisation will have strategies that deal with problems affecting the well being of employees such as redundancies, disasters, workplace conflict.  There would be strategies that recover from distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.unb.ca/towardarespectfulworkplace/compassion.html|title=TOWARDS A RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE|accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="frost"&gt;{{cite book|last=Frost|first=P.

'''RETMAN''' is a comics’ character, associated to [[Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy]] (REBT). Through it, REBT tries more efficiently address children, adolescents and the general public. This form of therapy approaches the treatment of [[emotional disorders]] and the promotion of mental health by modifying maladaptive/irrational behaviors and cognitions (thoughts).

== History and evolution ==
The first RETMAN concept was thought up at the Albert Ellis Institute, US, in the 80s (Calvin Merrifield and Rebecca Merriefield: Call Me Retman and Have a Ball, 1979) inspired by the name Rational Emotive Therapy (that is how this form of [[cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy]] was referred to then). The prototype for the superhero was [[Albert Ellis]] himself. As “RET-Man”, Ellis is arrested by the police but not before helping a depressed jilted lover give up his thoughts of suicide in favor of more rational thinking.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rebt.org/professionals/prof_articles/nardiwebarticle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, because of the high production costs at the time, the project was abandoned after the publication of a comic.

=== Present ===
The concept was resumed in 2008, with the approval of the Albert Ellis Institute by a team of Romanian psychologists and graphic designers led by Prof. Daniel David, with a modern technology. For the first time they also investigated the efficiency of the concept in promoting psychological health and in the treatment of psychological disorders in children and adolescents (see "Meet RETMAN" &lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychotherapy.ro/content/view/143/122/&lt;/ref&gt;). The team developed the RETMAN concept in an innovative way, creating an entire system that includes: (1) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=12 therapeutic comics]; (2) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=13 therapeutic stories]; (3) [http://retman.ro/?page_id=14 therapeutic cartoons]; and (4) the therapeutic system RoboRETMAN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://retman.ro/?page_id=15 RoboRETMAN ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Retman technology is being used by (selection) The Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinic, UMF, [[Cluj-Napoca]], the “PsyTech” University Psychological Clinic at Babes-Bolyai, Cluj-Napoca, kindergartens and private clinical psychology/counseling/psychotherapy practices in [[Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clinicalpsychology.ro/en/innovations/3/&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also used on the REThink Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rethink.info.ro/ REThink Project]&lt;/ref&gt; a research grant with the goal to design, develop, and evaluate a therapeutic video game accessible over the Internet,  meant to be used primarily as a standalone application to promote emotional resilience in children and adolescents.

== Concept ==
The concept was resumed by a team of designers and psychologists at the International Institute for the Advanced Studies of Psychotherapy and Applied Mental Health (link), led by “Aaron T.Beck” professor [[Daniel David]]. The institute was co-founded by the Albert Ellis Institute and [[Babes-Bolyai University]]. The concept put forward by this team was a completely changed one, using the character [[Superman]] as a model for Retman. A planet was created for Retman (Rationalia), as well as new adventures and a dangerous opponent (the evil sorcerer Irationalius)
The stories of Retman are based on an original story, developed by dr. Daniel David: “...Retman was the ruler of Planet Rationalia from the System of Ataraxia in the Happiness Galaxy. He lived in a town called Equilibrium and was a Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist, who is a person who helps you when you suffer and teaches you how to be happy. The Great Sorcerer Psychotherapist practiced “Retmagic” (a rational-emotional therapeutic magic). This gift had been given to him by the Almighty Creator of the World. All the inhabitants of the planet were happy because they had everything they wanted, but mostly because they wanted only what they knew they deserved. The secret of their happiness was therefore their minds and their way of thinking. But while Retman fostered rational thinking on the planet, his enemy, the Sorcerer Irationalius became envious of his power and stole the minds of the inhabitants of the planet. They became mean and envious and the whole planet was overtaken by evil and despair. Then the Almighty Creator of the World, in anger, destroyed everyone, sparing just Retman, as he was the only person whose mind Irationalius could not steal. He was sent on Earth with the goal of teaching everyone here to be rational and happy, so they wouldn’t end up like the inhabitants of Rationalia...”
The stories of Retman have been published in Romanian and English.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8683">The '''School Health Education Study''' (SHES) was a crucial event in transforming [[health education]] as practiced in [[Public school (government funded)|American public schools]]. It has been called, "the most significant school health education initiative of the 1960s"&lt;ref&gt;Allensworth, et al. 1997 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; and was largely responsible for establishing the value of comprehensive health education rather than separate disease-specific units and in introducing the concept-based approach to education in general. Most health curricula developed since have followed the model set by the SHES in its School Health Curriculum Project.&lt;ref&gt;Allensworth, et al., 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In 1960 millionaire distiller and philanthropist [[Samuel Bronfman]] asked Dr. Granville Larimore, then Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health and a member of the Joint Committee on Health Problems in Education of the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), to suggest several projects in health or education that should receive funding but were being neglected by governmental and private funders. Dr. Larimore suggested three priorities: (I) graduate medical education, (2) effectiveness of the mass media for health education, and (3) school health education. After hearing presentations on each of these three priorities, the [[Samuel Bronfman Foundation]]’s board decided to provide $200,000 for a study of the status of health education in the nation’s schools.

== Initial study ==
The Study was envisioned as an independent, two-year-long investigation, affiliated with the [[American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance|American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation]] (AAHPER) and the National Education Association. Bronfman sought the advice of [[Delbert Oberteuffer]], professor at the [[Ohio State University]] and widely regarded as the leading figure in health education at that time, regarding who could best lead the study. Oberteuffer recommended one of his young OSU colleagues, [[Elena Sliepcevich]]. Dr. Sliepcevich accepted the appointment and moved to Washington, DC where the SHES leased office space on Dupont Circle in the building next door to the NEA.&lt;ref&gt;Johns, 1962; Means, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first year, the Study assessed the state of health education offerings in a total of 135 school systems covering 38 states and involving some 1101 individual [[Primary education|elementary schools]] and 359 secondary schools. This survey remains the broadest of its type ever completed in the United States. In the second year test instruments were administered to students in grades 6, 9, and 12 of the participating schools. Of 17,634 usable answer sheets re¬turned to the researchers, a weighted sample of 2000 scores for each of the three [[grade level]]s representative of the makeup of the school sample was selected for analysis. Analysis of the results required a third year of Bronfman Foundation support and led to the conclusion that the state of health education in the nation’s public schools was "appalling".&lt;ref&gt;Sliepcevich, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

== School Health Curriculum Project ==
The [3M] Corporation funded SHES for a further six years (1963–1969) to develop a model curriculum—the School Health Curriculum Project or SHCP. Ann E. Nolte, of Ohio State University, joined SHES as associate director of the study and a curriculum writing team was assembled, consisting of:  William H. Creswell, Jr., professor of health education at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]]; Gus T. Dalis, of the Los Angeles County Schools; Edward B. Johns, professor of school health education at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]; Marion B. Pollock, assistant professor of health education at [[California State University, Long Beach|California State College, Long Beach]]; Richard K. Means, professor of health education at [[Auburn University]]; and [[Robert D. Russell]], associate professor of health education at [[Southern Illinois University]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Russell proposed as the initial point of view for the SHCP that health was a unified concept of well-being. This was expressed in the curriculum as follows, "Health is a quality of life involving dynamic interaction and interdependence among the individual's physical well-being, his (or her) mental and emotional reactions, and the social complex in which he (or she) exists".&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, et al., 1967, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  From this starting point, the SHCP writers identified ten key concepts. Sub concepts were then developed in the physical, mental, and social dimen¬sions for each of the ten concepts. The 31 sub concepts were each linked to behavioral objectives written at four progressive levels—grades K-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12—in the cognitive, affective, and behavioral domains.

== Concepts ==
The ten concepts developed by the SHES as the basis for the SHCP were:
# Growth and development influences and is influenced by the structure and functioning of the individual.
# Growing and developing follows a predictable sequence, yet is unique for each individual.
# Protection and promotion of health is an individual, community, and international responsibility.
# The potential for hazards and accidents exists, whatever the environment.
# There are reciprocal relationships involving man (humanity), disease, and environment.
# The family serves to perpetuate man (humanity) and to fulfill certain health needs.
# Personal health practices are affected by a complexity of forces, often conflicting.
# Utilization of health information, products, and services is guided by values and perceptions.
# Use of substances that modify mood and behavior arises from a variety of motivations.
# Food selection and eating patterns are determined by physical, social, mental, economic, and cultural factors.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, et al., 1967, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual medicine''' is a medical specialty that deals with sexual health. At times heavily influenced by current local views on morality, with heavy cultural overlay, in broad terms this specialty is concerned with diagnosing, assessing and treating all aspects which relate to [[sexual function|sexuality]]. 

Issues can be divided into two main areas of concern: 

*disorders of the sexual organs
*disorders of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] affecting sexuality

Sexual medicine has four dimensions: 
* The promotional dimension (increases awareness and helps individuals have a healthy and fulfilling sex life)
* The preventive dimension (counseling)
* The curative dimension (clinical treatment of specific sexual disorders)
* The rehabilitative dimension (helps patients regain sexual health)

== Disorders of the sexual organs ==
[[Congenital]] or acquired, these conditions refer to any [[pathology]] which interferes with the perception of satisfactory sexual health. Varied conditions include absent sexual organs, [[hermaphrodite]] and other [[genetics|genetic]] malformations, or [[Physical trauma|trauma]] such as [[amputation]] or lacerations. [[Sexually transmitted disease]] accounts for by far the largest proportion of patients in this category. Of these, [[HIV]] and consequently AIDS represents a significant threat to populations throughout the world, but more especially Africa, and within Africa in the sub-Saharan area.

== Disorders of the psyche affecting sexuality ==
A wide range of disorders can be mentioned in this section. While those unaffected can – and often do – mock the afflicted, such issues can be earth shattering in their consequences for the individual, resulting in depression, murder and suicide. Whole cultures have been adversely affected by adhering to specific attitudes regarding sexuality. Issues such as [[genital mutilation]] (e.g. [[circumcision]]), institutionalised rape, and [[honour killing]]s can be attributed to such problems which, although accepted as "the norm" for a specific culture, would in other circumstances be regarded as deviant behaviour. 

Examples of conditions which may be treated by specialists in this field include, but are not limited to:

*[[Erectile dysfunction]]
*Loss of [[libido]]
*[[Dyspareunia]] – pain on intercourse
*Failure to complete intercourse
*Infection
*Sexuality issues

== Anamnesis ==
The [[anamnesis (medicine)|anamnesis]] or medical history taking of issues related to sexual or [[reproductive medicine]] may be inhibited by a reluctance of the patient to disclose intimate or uncomfortable information. Even if such an issue is on the patient's mind, he or she often doesn't start talking about such an issue without the physician initiating the subject by a specific question about sexual or [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name=Quilliam2011/&gt; Some familiarity with the doctor generally makes it easier for patients to talk about intimate issues such as sexual subjects, but for some patients, a very high degree of familiarity may make the patient reluctant to reveal such intimate issues.&lt;ref name=Quilliam2011/&gt; When visiting a health provider about sexual issues, having both partners of a couple present is often necessary, and is typically a good thing, but may also prevent the disclosure of certain subjects, and, according to one report, increases the stress level.&lt;ref name=Quilliam2011&gt;[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/743689_3 'The Cringe Report'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708173555/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/743689_3 |date=8 July 2011 }}  By Susan Quilliam.

A '''shoulder presentation''' refers to a [[Presentation (obstetrics)|malpresentation]] at [[childbirth]] where the baby is in a transverse lie (its vertebral column is perpendicular to that of the mother), thus the leading part (the part that enters first the birth canal) is an [[arm]], [[shoulder]], or the trunk. While a baby can be delivered vaginally when either the head or the feet/buttocks are the leading part, it usually cannot be expected to be delivered successfully with a shoulder presentation unless a [[cesarean section]] (C/S) is performed.

==Frequency and causes==
Shoulder presentations are uncommon (about 0.5% of births)&lt;!--this reference is out of date per [[WP:MEDRS]]--&gt;&lt;ref name=hellman&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Hellman LM, Pritchard JA |title=Williams Obstetrics, 14th Edition | publisher=Appleton Century Crofts | year=1971 | page=872ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; as usually towards the end of [[gestation]] either the head or the buttocks start to enter the upper part of the pelvis anchoring the fetus in a longitudinal lie. It is not known in all cases of shoulder presentation why the longitudinal lie is not reached, but possible causes include bony abnormalities of the pelvis, uterine abnormalities such as malformations or tumors (fibroids), and other tumors in the pelvis or abdomen can also lead to a shoulder presentation. Other factors are a lax abdominal musculature, uterine overdistension (i.e. [[polyhydramnios]]), [[multiple gestation]], [[placenta previa]], a small fetus, or a fetus with some abnormality. Further, if the amniotic fluid sac ruptures the shoulder or arm may become wedged as a shoulder presentation.

==Diagnosis==
Inspection of the abdomen may already give a clue as it is wide from side to side. Usually performing the [[Leopold's maneuvers]] will demonstrate the transverse lie of the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lydon-Rochelle |first1=Mona |last2=Albers |first2=Leah |last3=Gotwocia |first3=Julie |last4=Craig |first4=Ellen |last5=Qualls |first5=Clifford |title=Accuracy of Leopold Maneuvers in Screening for Malpresentation: A Prospective Study |journal=[[Birth (journal)|Birth]] |date=September 1993 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=132–135 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.1993.tb00437.x |pmid=8240620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultrasound examination delivers the diagnosis and may indicate possible causes such as multiple gestation or a tumor. On vaginal examination, the absence of a head or feet/breech is apparent.

Shoulder presentations are classified into four types, based on the location of the scapula:
*Left scapula-anterior (LSA)
*Right scapula-anterior (RSA)
*Left scapula-posterior (LSP)
*Right scapula-posterior (RSP)

==Management==
While a transverse lie prior to labor can be manually versed to a longitudinal lie, once the uterus [[childbirth|starts contracting]] the uterus normally will not allow any version procedure. A shoulder presentation is an indication for a [[caesarean section]]. Generally, as it is diagnosed early, the baby is not damaged by the time of delivery. With the rupture of the membranes, there is an increased risk of a [[cord prolapse]] as the shoulder may not completely block the birth canal. Thus the [[caesarean section]] is ideally performed before the membranes break.

===Delivery of the second twin===
The delivery of the second twin in a transverse lie with a shoulder presentation represents a special situation that may be amenable to a vaginal delivery. As the first twin has just been delivered and the cervix is fully dilated the obstetrician may perform an internal version, that is inserting one hand into the uterus, find the baby’s feet, and then bring the baby into a breech position and deliver the baby as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rabinovici J, Barkai G, Reichman B, Serr DM, Mashiach S | title=Internal podalic version with unruptured membranes for the second twin in transverse lie. |journal=Obstet. Gynecol. | date=March 1988 |pmid=3347429 |volume=71 |issue=3 Pt 1 |pages=428–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impaction===
During labor the shoulder will be wedged into the pelvis and the head lie in one iliac fossa, the breech in the other. With further uterine contractions the baby suffocates.&lt;ref name=hellman/&gt; The uterus continues to try to expel the impacted fetus and as its retraction ring rises, the musculature in the lower segments thins out leading eventually to a uterine rupture and the death of the mother.&lt;ref name=hellman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Diab AE  |title=Uterine ruptures in Yemen  |journal=Saudi Medical journal |year=2005 | pmid=15770303 | volume=26 | issue=2 | pages=264–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impacted shoulder presentations contribute to [[maternal mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Chamiso B |title=Rupture of pregnant uterus in Shashemene Hospital, south Shoa, Ethiopia (a three year study of 57 cases)| journal=[[Ethiopian Medical Journal|Ethiop. Med. J.]] |date=October 1995|pmid=8674491 |volume= 33 |issue= 4 |pages= 251–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obviously a cesarean section should be performed before the baby has died, but even when the baby has died or impaction has occurred, C/S is the method of choice of delivery, as alternative methods of delivery are potentially too traumatic for the mother. If the baby is [[preterm labour|preterm]] or macerated and very small a spontaneous delivery has been observed.&lt;ref name=hellman/&gt;

==History==
[[File:1690 Handgriff der Justine Siegemundin.jpg|right|thumb|Internal version according to Siegemundin, 1690]]
Prior to the arrival of C/S the fetus usually died during protracted labor and the mother's life was at risk as well due to infection, uterine rupture and bleeding. On occasion, if the baby was macerated and small, it collapsed sufficiently to be delivered. The shoulder presentation was a feared obstetrical complication.

In 1690 [[Justine Siegemundin]], a German [[midwife]], published ''Die Kgl. Preußische und Chur-Brandenburgische Hof-Wehemutter''. This treatise for midwives demonstrated abnormal [[presentation (obstetrics)|presentation]]s at birth and their management. She was the first to describe a two-handed method of performing an internal rotation of the baby to extract it as a breech (a variation of which is performed today on the second twin, see above) using a sling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Speert H| title=Iconographia Gyniatrica |publisher=F. A. Davis|year=1973 |ISBN=0-8036-8070-8| page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure was useful provided the fetus was not impacted. Once the uterus had contracted around the baby tightly, destructive interventions were used to save the life of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mann RM  |title=Case of Arm and Shoulder Presentation in Which Evisceration was Performed. | journal=Association Medical Journal |date=1856-04-14  |pmc=2439677 |page=308 |volume=4 |issue=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Note==
Shoulder presentation is a malpresentation that is not to be confused with [[shoulder dystocia]], a complication during the birth of a baby in a [[vertex presentation]].

== Context ==

In one study, boys were asked the circumstances in which their first [[ejaculation]] occurred.  Most commonly this occurred via a [[nocturnal emission]], with a significant number experiencing semenarche via [[masturbation]].  Less commonly, the first ejaculation occurred during [[sexual intercourse]] with a partner.&lt;ref name="context"&gt;A Study of White Middle-Class Adolescent Boys' Responses to "Semenarche" (The First Ejaculation), James H.

TN combines two concepts: 1) human-interaction with narrative text to identify highly prevalent non-negated expressions, and 2) conversion of all expressions and notes into non-negated alphabetical-only representations to create homogeneous representations. The importance of using non-negated expressions to achieve an increased accuracy of text-based classifiers was emphasized in a letter published in Communications of the ACM in October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/3273019 |title=More accurate text analysis for better patient outcomes |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=61 |issue=10 |pages=6–7 |year=2018 |author1=CACM Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional [[machine learning]] approaches for [[text classification]], a human expert is required to label phrases or entire notes, and then a [[supervised learning]] algorithm attempts to generalize the associations and apply them to new data. In contrast, using non-negated distinct expressions eliminates the need for an additional computational method to achieve generalizability.&lt;ref name=pmid28181568&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep42282 |pmid=28181568 |pmc=5299453 |title=Predictive Modeling of Physician-Patient Dynamics That Influence Sleep Medication Prescriptions and Clinical Decision-Making |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |pages=42282 |year=2017 |last1=Beam |first1=Andrew L |last2=Kartoun |first2=Uri |last3=Pai |first3=Jennifer K |last4=Chatterjee |first4=Arnaub K |last5=Fitzgerald |first5=Timothy P |last6=Shaw |first6=Stanley Y |last7=Kohane |first7=Isaac S |bibcode=2017NatSR...742282B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid29085919&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/hep4.1051 |pmid=29085919 |pmc=5659323 |title=Model for end-stage liver disease Na Score predicts incident major cardiovascular events in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease |journal=Hepatology Communications |volume=1 |issue=5 |pages=429–438 |year=2017 |last1=Simon |first1=Tracey G |last2=Kartoun |first2=Uri |last3=Zheng |first3=Hui |last4=Chan |first4=Andrew T |last5=Chung |first5=Raymond T |last6=Shaw |first6=Stanley |last7=Corey |first7=Kathleen E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid26925881&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ajg.2016.44 |pmid=26925881 |pmc=4864030 |title=Using an Electronic Medical Records Database to Identify Non-Traditional Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease |journal=The American Journal of Gastroenterology |volume=111 |issue=5 |pages=671–6 |year=2016 |last1=Corey |first1=Kathleen E |last2=Kartoun |first2=Uri |last3=Zheng |first3=Hui |last4=Chung |first4=Raymond T |last5=Shaw |first5=Stanley Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==TN as progressive cyber-human intelligence==
In July 2018 researchers from [[Virginia Tech]] and [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] referred TN as an example for progressive cyber-human intelligence (PCHI).&lt;ref&gt;https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3231559&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of machine learning in health care==
Chen &amp; Asch 2017 wrote "With machine learning situated at the peak of inflated expectations, we can soften a subsequent crash into a “trough of disillusionment” by fostering a stronger appreciation of the technology’s capabilities and limitations."&lt;ref name=pmid28657867&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMp1702071 |pmid=28657867 |title=Machine Learning and Prediction in Medicine — Beyond the Peak of Inflated Expectations |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=376 |issue=26 |pages=2507–9 |year=2017 |last1=Chen |first1=Jonathan H |last2=Asch |first2=Steven M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter published in [[Communications of the ACM]], "Beyond brute force", emphasized that a brute force approach may perform better than traditional machine learning algorithms when applied to text. The letter stated "... machine learning algorithms, when applied to text, rely on the assumption that any language includes an infinite number of possible expressions. In contrast, across a variety of medical conditions, we observed that clinicians tend to use the same expressions to describe patients' conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1145/3135241 |title=Beyond brute force |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=60 |issue=10 |pages=8–9 |year=2017 |author1=CACM Staff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his viewpoint published in June 2018 concerning slow adoption of data-driven findings in medicine, Uri Kartoun, co-creator of Text Nailing states that " ...Text Nailing raised skepticism in reviewers of medical informatics journals who claimed that it relies on simple tricks to simplify the text, and leans heavily on human annotation. TN indeed may seem just like a trick of the light at ﬁrst glance, but it is actually a fairly sophisticated method that ﬁnally caught the attention of more adventurous reviewers and editors who ultimately accepted it for publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Toward an accelerated adoption of data-driven findings in medicine |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy | year=2018 | last1=Kartoun| first1=Uri| url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11019-018-9845-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human in-the-loop process is a way to generate features using domain experts. Using domain experts to come up with features is not a novel concept. However, the specific interfaces and method which helps the domain experts create the features are most likely novel.

In this case the features the experts create are equivalent to regular expressions. Removing non-alphabetical characters and matching on "smokesppd" is equal to the regular expression /smokes[^a-zA-Z]*ppd/. Using regular expressions as features for text classification is not novel.

Given these features the classifier is a manually set threshold by the authors, decided by the performance on a set of documents. This is a classifier, it's just that the parameters of the classifier, in this case a threshold, is set manually. Given the same features and documents almost any machine learning algorithm should be able to find the same threshold or (more likely) a better one.

The authors note that using support vector machines (SVM) and hundreds of documents give inferior performance, but does not specify which features or documents the SVM was trained/tested on. A fair comparison would use the same features and document sets as those used by the manual threshold classifier.

'''Tubo-ovarian abscesses''' ('''TOA''') are one of the late [[Complication (medicine)|complication]]s of [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID) and can be life-threatening if the [[abscess]] ruptures and results in [[sepsis]]. It consists of an encapsulated or confined 'pocket of [[pus]]' with defined boundaries that forms during an infection of a fallopian tube and ovary.  These abscesses are found most commonly in reproductive age women and typically result from upper genital tract infection.&lt;ref name= "Gradison2012"&gt;Pelvic inflammatory disease. American Family Physician, Vol. 85, No. 8. (15 April 2012), pp. 791-796 by Margaret Gradison&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = CDC - Pelvic Inflammatory Disease - 2010 STD Treatment Guidelines | url = https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/pid.htm | accessdate = 2015-05-16  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an inflammatory mass involving the fallopian tube, ovary and, occasionally, other adjacent pelvic organs. A TOA can also develop as a complication of a hysterectomy.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first = Barbara | title = Williams gynecology | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780071716727 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|103}}

Patients typically present with fever, elevated white blood cell count, lower abdominal-pelvic pain, and/or vaginal discharge. Fever and leukocytosis may be absent. TOAs are often polymicrobial with a high percentage of anaerobic bacteria. The cost of treatment in the United States is approximately $2,000 per patient, which equals about $1.5 billion annually.&lt;ref name="Gradison2012"/&gt;  Though rare, TOA can occur without a preceding episode of PID or sexual activity.&lt;ref name="GoodwinFleming2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goodwin|first1=K.|last2=Fleming|first2=N.|last3=Dumont|first3=T.|title=Tubo-ovarian Abscess in Virginal Adolescent Females: A Case Report and Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|volume=26|issue=4|year=2013|pages=e99–e102|issn=1083-3188|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2013.02.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HoAngstetra2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ho|first1=Jeh Wen|last2=Angstetra|first2=D.|last3=Loong|first3=R.|last4=Fleming|first4=T.|title=Tuboovarian Abscess as Primary Presentation for Imperforate Hymen|journal=Case Reports in Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=2014|year=2014|pages=1–3|issn=2090-6684|doi=10.1155/2014/142039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:BacteroidesFragilis Gram.jpg|thumb|left|''Bacteroides fragilis'']]
The signs and symptoms of tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) are the same as with [[pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID) with the exception that the abscess can be found with [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[sonography]] and [[x-ray]].&lt;ref name="Gradison2012"/&gt; It also differs from PID in that it can create symptoms of acute-onset pelvic pain.&lt;ref name="DupuisKim2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupuis|first1=Carolyn S.|last2=Kim|first2=Young H.|title=Ultrasonography of adnexal causes of acute pelvic pain in pre-menopausal non-pregnant women|journal=Ultrasonography|volume=34|issue=4|year=2015|pages=258–267|issn=2288-5919|doi=10.14366/usg.15013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically this disease is found in sexually active women.&lt;ref name="GoodwinFleming2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ChoKoo2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cho|first1=Hyun-Woong|last2=Koo|first2=Yu-Jin|last3=Min|first3=Kyung-Jin|last4=Hong|first4=Jin-Hwa|last5=Lee|first5=Jae-Kwan|title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease in Virgin Women with Tubo-ovarian Abscess: A Single-center Experience and Literature Review|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|year=2015|issn=1083-3188|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2015.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause of the disease==

The development of TOA is thought to begin with the [[pathogen]]s spreading from the [[cervix]] to the [[endometrium]], through the [[salpinx]], into the [[peritoneal cavity]] and forming the tubo-ovarian abscess with (in some cases) pelvic peritonitis.  TOA can develop from the [[lymphatic system]] with infection of the [[parametrium]] from an [[intrauterine device]] (IUD).&lt;ref name="Gradison2012"/&gt; Bacteria recovered from  TOAs are ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Bacteroides fragilis]]'', other ''[[Bacteroides]]'' species, ''[[Peptostreptococcus]]'', ''[[Peptococcus]]'', and [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] ''[[streptococci]]''.&lt;ref name="LandersSweet"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landers|first1=D.

==Diagnosis==

[[Laparoscopy]] and other imaging tools can visualize the abscess. Physicians are able to make the [[diagnosis]] if the abscess ruptures when the woman begins to have lower abdominal pain that then begins to spread.  The symptoms then become the same as the symptoms for [[peritonitis]].  [[Sepsis]] occurs, if left untreated.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;{{rp|103}} Ultrasonography is a sensitive enough imaging tool that it can accurately differentiate between pregnancy, hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, endometriosis, ovarian torsion, and tubo-ovarian abscess. Its availability, the relative advancement in the training of its use, its low cost, and because it does not expose the woman (or fetus) to ionizing radiation, ultrasonography an ideal imaging procedure for women of reproductive age.&lt;ref name="DupuisKim2015"/&gt;

==Prevention==

Risk factors have been identified which indicate what women will be more likely to develop TOA.  These are: increased age, IUD insertion, chlamydia infection, and increased levels of certain proteins (CRP and CA-125) and will alert clinicians to follow up on unresolved symptoms of PID.&lt;ref name="LeeRhim2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Suk Woo|last2=Rhim|first2=Chae Chun|last3=Kim|first3=Jang Heub|last4=Lee|first4=Sung Jong|last5=Yoo|first5=Sie Hyeon|last6=Kim|first6=Shin Young|last7=Hwang|first7=Young Bin|last8=Shin|first8=So Young|last9=Yoon|first9=Joo Hee|title=Predictive Markers of Tubo-Ovarian Abscess in Pelvic Inflammatory Disease|journal=Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation|year=2015|issn=0378-7346|doi=10.1159/000381772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment for TOA differs from PID in that some clinicians recommend patients with tubo-ovarian abscesses have at least 24 hours of inpatient parenteral treatment with antibiotics, and that they may require surgery.&lt;ref name="Gradison2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lentz | first = Gretchen | title = Comprehensive gynecology | publisher = Mosby Elsevier | location = Philadelphia | year = 2013|page=584 | isbn = 9780323069861 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If surgery becomes necessary, pre-operative administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics is started and removal of the abscess, the affected [[ovary]] and [[fallopian tube]] is done.   After discharge from the hospital, oral antibiotics are continued for the length of time prescribed by the physician.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;{{rp|103}}

Treatment is different if the TOA is discovered before it ruptures and can be treated with IV antibiotics.  During this treatment, IV antibiotics are usually replaced with oral antibiotics on an outpatient basis.  Patients are usually seen three days after hospital discharge and then again one to two weeks later to confirm that the infection has cleared.&lt;ref name=Hoffman2012/&gt;{{rp|103}} Ampicillin/sulbactam plus doxycycline is effective against C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and anaerobes in women with tubo-ovarian abscess. Parenteral Regimens described by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention are Ampicillin/Sulbactam 3 g IV every 6 hours and Doxycycline 200&amp;nbsp;mg orally or IV every 24 hours, though other regiemes that are used for pelvic inflammatory disease have been effective.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/pid.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==

{{further|perioperative mortality}}

Complications of TOA are related to the possible removal of one or both ovaries and fallopian tubes.  Without these reproductive structures, fertility can be affected.  Surgical complications can develop and include:

* Allergic [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]] due to [[anesthesia|anesthetic]]s
* A [[paradoxical reaction]] to a drug
* Infection

==Epidemiology==

The epidemiology of TOA is closely related to that of pelvic inflammatory disease  which is estimated to one million people yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = PID Epidemiology |publisher=Center for Disease Control| url = http://www2a.cdc.gov/stdtraining/self-study/pid/pid_epidemiology_self_study_from_cdc.html| accessdate = 2015-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean''' is the regional office of the [[World Health Organization]] that serves 22 countries and territories in the [[Middle East]], the [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[Central Asia]]. It is one of the WHO's six regional offices around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emro.who.int/entity/about-us/ WHO Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
All the regional divisions of WHO were created between 1949 and 1952. They are based on article 44 of WHO's constitution, which allows the WHO to "establish a [single] regional organization to meet the special needs of [each defined] area". Many decisions are made at regional level, including importance discussions over WHO's budget, and in deciding the members of the next assembly, which are designated by the regions.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization by Gian Luca Burci &amp; Claude-Henri Vignes (2004). pp. 53-57 {{ISBN|9041122737}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
