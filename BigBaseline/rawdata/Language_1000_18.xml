==Characteristics==
It has been suggested, through research done by Dr. James C. McCroskey and Dr. Virginia P. Richmond, that United States society finds talkativeness attractive.&lt;ref name="correlates"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCroskey|first1=James C.|last2=Richmond|first2=Virginia P.|title= Correlates of Compulsive Communication: Quantitative and Qualitative Characteristics |journal=Communican Quarterly|volume=43 | issue = 1|year=1995|page=39|doi=10.1080/01463379509369954}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is something which is rewarded and positively correlated with leadership and influence.&lt;ref name=bostrom/&gt; However, those who compulsively talk are not to be confused with those who are simply highly verbal and vary their quantity of talk. Compulsive talkers are those who are highly verbal in a manner that varies greatly from the norm and is not in the person’s best interest.&lt;ref name=scale/&gt; Those who have been characterized as compulsive talkers talk with a greater frequency, dominate conversations, and are less inhibited than others.&lt;ref name=bostrom/&gt;  They have also been found to be more argumentative and have a positive attitude regarding communication.&lt;ref name=bostrom/&gt; Tendencies towards compulsive talking also are more frequently seen in the personality structure of neurotic psychotic extraverts.&lt;ref name="bigthree"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCroskey|first1=James C.|last2=Heisel|first2=Alan D.|last3=Richmond|first3=Virginia P.|title= Eysenck's BIG THREE And Communication Traits: Three Correlational Studies|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=68 | issue = 4|year=2001|page=360|doi=10.1080/03637750128068}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that talkaholics are never behaviorally shy.&lt;ref name="correlates"/&gt;

==Talkaholic scale==
In 1993 James C. McCroskey and Virginia P. Richmond constructed the Talkaholic Scale, a Likert-type model, to help identify those who are compulsive talkers.  A score of 40 or above, which indicates two standard deviations above the norm, would signal someone to be a true talkaholic.&lt;ref name=scale/&gt;

===Cultural similarities===
A study done in 1995 of 811 university students in the United States found 5.2% of that population had results indicating they were talkaholics. A similar study from the same year with students from New Zealand found similar results, with 4.7% scoring above 40.&lt;ref name="newzealand"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackman|first1=Michael Z.|last2=Barthel-Hackman|first2=Tam|last3=Johnson|first3=Craig E.|title= Correlates Of Talkaholism In New Zealand: An Intracultural Analysis Of The Compulsive Communication Construct |journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=12 | issue = 1|year=1995|page=5360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences and management==
Compulsive talking can drive people away, which in turn can leave that person with no social support.&lt;ref name="Chillot"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chillot|first1=Rick |title=Do you talk too much? |journal=Prevention |volume=49.10|year=1997|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interrupting, another act that is associated with talkaholics, can signal to other people a lack of respect.&lt;ref name=Chillot/&gt;

According to [[Elizabeth Wagele]], an author of best-selling books on personality types, there are different ways to handle compulsive talkers.  Such coping techniques include changing the focus of the conversation, taking attention away from the talkaholic, leaving the conversation, and creating a distraction.&lt;ref name="wagele"&gt;{{cite web| last = Wagele | first = Elizabeth| title = The Career Within You.

Some corpus language left a very large corpus, like [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]], and therefore can be totally reconstucted, even though some details of the pronunciation may be unclear. Such languages can be used even today, as is the case with [[Sanskrit]] and Latin. Others have such a limited corpus that some important words, e.g. some pronouns, are not found in the corpus. Examples for this are [[Ugaritic]] and [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. Languages that are only attested by a few words, often names, and a few phrases (called ''Trümmersprachen'' in German linguistics, literally "rubble languages") can only be reconstructed in a very limited way and often their [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] to other languages remains unclear. Examples are the [[Lombardic language]] and [[Dadanitic]], a [[Semitic language]] that is may be close to [[classical Arabic]].

Corpus languages are studied using the methods of [[corpus linguistics]], but corpus linguistics can be used (and is commonly used) for the study of the recorded productions of living languages.

Not all [[extinct language]]s are "corpus languages," since many languages have disappeared leaving no, or very inadequate, recorded production of their speakers.

'''Dunstan Baby Language''' is a theory about infantile vocal reflexes as signals, in humans.   The theory is that across cultures and linguistic groups there are five sounds, each with a meaning, that are used by [[infants]] before the [[language acquisition]] period. The hypothesis was developed by Australian former [[mezzo-soprano]], Priscilla Dunstan, and has been featured on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPXsoZ_F0SA Dunstan on The Oprah Winfrey Show]&lt;/ref&gt; Dunstan's theory has not been scientifically validated.

==Dunstan's theory==
Between 0–3 months, infants make what Dunstan calls ''sound reflexes''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dunstanbaby.co.uk/cms/index.php?page=us-faqs Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dunstan, we all have reflexes, like sneezes, hiccups, and burps, that all have a recognizable pattern when sound is added to the reflex. There are other reflexes that all babies experience, and when sound is added to these, a distinct, preemptive "cry" will occur before the infant breaks into what Dunstan calls the hysterical [[cry]]. Dunstan states that these preemptive cries can indicate what the infant requires (e.g., ''food'', ''comfort'', ''sleep'', etc.), and they escalate to the hysterical cry if they are not answered. As the infant matures past 3 months in [[Communication|vocalization]], the sound reflexes become replaced with more elaborate [[babbling]].

===Words (sound reflexes)===
According to Dunstan, the five universal words (or ''sound reflexes'') used by infants are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/tows/slide/200611/20061113/slide_20061113_350_102.jhtml Five Universal Words of Dunstan Baby Language as Posted on Oprah.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Neh (I'm hungry)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Neh''" to communicate its hunger. The sound is produced when the sucking reflex is triggered, and the tongue is pushed up on the roof of the mouth.
* '''Owh (I'm sleepy)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Owh''" to communicate that they are tired.  The sound is produced much like an audible [[yawn]].
* '''Heh (I'm experiencing discomfort)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Heh''" to communicate [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], discomfort, or perhaps that it needs a fresh diaper. The sound is produced by a response to a skin reflex, such as feeling sweat or itchiness in the bum.
* '''Eairh (I have lower gas)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Eairh''" to communicate they have [[flatulence]] or an upset stomach. The sound is produced when trapped air from a belch is unable to release and travels to the stomach where the muscles of the intestines tighten to force the air bubble out.  Often, this sound will indicate that a bowel movement is in progress, and the infant will bend its knees, bringing the legs toward the torso. This leg movement assists in the ongoing process.
* '''Eh (I need to be burped)''' - An infant uses the sound reflex "''Eh''" to communicate that it needs to be burped. The sound is produced when a large bubble of trapped air is caught in the chest, and the reflex is trying to release this out of the mouth.

Dunstan states that she has a [[photographic memory]] for sounds and that this, combined with her years in the [[opera]] and her experience as a mother, allowed her to recognize certain sounds in the human voice. A [[DVD]] set called ''The Dunstan Baby Language'' was released by Dunstan in November 2006. The two-disc set covered the five universal words of the language, methods of learning how to recognize the vocalizations and sounds, numerous examples of baby cries from around the world to "tune your ear," and live demonstrations of newborn mother groups experimenting with the language.

==Criticism==
Linguistics experts point out that Dunstan's hypothesis has not been subjected to rigorous testing or academic scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/01162007/entertainment/health/hey_baby__look_whos_talking_health_skip_card.htm Hey Baby, Look Who's Talking]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dunstan company had, at one time, developed a [[clinical trial]] plan with [[Brown University]] researchers to test its claims, but abandoned it for [[Opinion poll|consumer surveys]] and small-group observations in order "to hasten the development of a system that could be used by parents," skipping rigorous testing to go straight to market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/182567 "Dare I Trust My Intuition?"], Mary Carmichael, ''[[Newsweek]]'', 31 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6424">'''Egbert Richter''' (also publishing under the [[pen name]] of '''Richter-Ushanas''', after ''{{IAST|[[Ushanas|uśánas]]}}'', a Vedic [[rishi]]) is a German freelance writer and lecturer, author of [[self-published]] (''Egbert Richter Verlag'', registered in [[Bremen]]) treatises on [[Yoga]], [[Vedanta]], [[Esotericism]] and [[mythology]], translations of some [[Upanishads]], the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]] as well as original poetry. Richter has also published various [[pseudo-scholarly]] claims, including decipherment of the [[Rongorongo]], [[Phaistos Disc decipherment claims|Phaistos Disc]] and [[Indus script]]s.

In his 1992 decipherment claim of the Indus script, he argues that the script is "based very largely on intuition, and this quality is also required for reading it", likening the process of "decipherment" to [[meditation]], concluding that the [[Rbhus]], who Richter alleges were priests of the [[Harappan civilization]], invented the Indus script under the influence of [[Sumerian cuneiform]]. [[Karel Werner|Werner]] (1999) confesses himself "at a loss how to evaluate" Richter's work, admitting the author has thorough knowledge of the various sources he uses, but at the same time completely lacks academic method, discipline or experience.

The '''Finnicization of Helsinki''' is the transformation of [[Helsinki]], Finland from a [[Swedish language|Swedish]]-speaking city to one that is bilingual or even multilingual, with [[Finnish language|Finnish]] as both the majority language and [[lingua franca]]. The dominant aspects of this transition were the immigration of Finnish speakers in the process of urbanization, and the shift from Swedish to Finnish among some local [[Finland Swedes|Swedish]]-speaking residents over several generations.

[[Helsinki]] was founded by the [[King of Sweden|Swedish King]], [[Gustav Vasa]] in 1550 as [[Helsingfors]]. At the time, Finland was an integral part of [[Sweden]], the surrounding region, [[Nylandia]] was predominately Swedish speaking and Swedish was the administrative language of the kingdom. 

In the nineteenth century, during the Russian period, Helsinki became the economic and cultural centre of Finland. Beginning from the late 19th century, the Finnish language became more and more dominant in the city, since the people who moved to the city were mostly Finnish-speaking.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the city was already predominantly Finnish-speaking, although with a large Swedish-speaking minority. In the 21st century, native-Swedish speakers are a minority of 6.1%.

'''Graffiti''' (both singular and plural; the singular ''graffito'' is very rare in English except in archeology)&lt;ref&gt; The Italian singular form "graffito" is so rare in English (except in specialist texts on archeology) that it is not even recorded or mentioned in some dictionaries, for example the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English and the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxd/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahd&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=graffiti American Heritage Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; is writing or drawings made on a wall or other surface, usually without permission and within public view.&lt;ref name=oxd/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahd/&gt; Graffiti ranges from simple written words to elaborate wall paintings, and it has existed [[Graffito (archaeology)|since ancient times]], with examples dating back to [[ancient Egypt]], [[ancient Greece]], and the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Graffito"/&gt;

In modern times, paint (particularly [[aerosol paint|spray paint]]) and [[marker pen]]s have become the most commonly used graffiti materials. In most countries, marking or painting property without the property owner's permission is considered defacement and [[vandalism]], which is a punishable crime.

Graffiti may also express underlying social and political messages and a whole genre of artistic expression is based upon spray paint graffiti styles. Within [[hip hop culture]], graffiti have evolved alongside [[hip hop music]], [[Breakdancing|b-boying]], and other elements.&lt;ref name=powder/&gt; Unrelated to hip-hop graffiti, gangs use their own form of graffiti to mark territory or to serve as an indicator of gang-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lapdonline.org/get_informed/content_basic_view/23471|title=Why Gang Graffiti Is Dangerous - Los Angeles Police Department|website=www.lapdonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversies that surround graffiti continue to create disagreement amongst city officials, law enforcement, and writers who wish to display and appreciate work in public locations. There are many different types and styles of graffiti; it is a rapidly developing art form whose value is highly contested and reviled by many authorities while also subject to protection, sometimes within the same jurisdiction.

Both "graffiti" and its occasional singular form "graffito" are from the Italian word ''graffiato'' ("scratched"). "Graffiti" is applied in [[art history]] to works of art produced by scratching a design into a surface. A related term is "[[sgraffito]]",&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; which involves scratching through one layer of pigment to reveal another beneath it. This technique was primarily used by potters who would glaze their wares and then scratch a design into it. In ancient times graffiti were carved on walls with a sharp object, although sometimes [[chalk]] or [[coal]] were used. The word originates from Greek {{lang|el|γράφειν}}—''graphein''—meaning "to write".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/graffiti|title=graffiti {{!}} Origin and meaning of graffiti by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Graffitti, Castellania, Malta.jpeg|thumb|left|Figure graffito, similar to a relief, at the Castellania, in Valletta]] 
The term ''graffiti'' referred to the [[inscription]]s, figure drawings, and such, found on the walls of ancient [[sepulchre]]s or ruins, as in the [[Catacombs of Rome]] or at [[Pompeii]]. Use of the word has evolved to include any graphics applied to surfaces in a manner that constitutes [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Old Is Graffiti?|url=http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/how-old-is-graffiti/|website=Wonderopolis|accessdate=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only known source of the [[Safaitic]] language, a form of proto-Arabic, is from graffiti: inscriptions scratched on to the surface of rocks and boulders in the predominantly basalt desert of southern [[Syria]], eastern [[Jordan]] and northern [[Saudi Arabia]]. Safaitic dates from the first century BC to the fourth century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krc2.orient.ox.ac.uk/aalc/index.php/en/safaitic-database-online|title=Ancient Arabia: Languages and Cultures - Safaitic Database Online|last=dan|website=krc2.orient.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://krc.orient.ox.ac.uk/ociana/index.php/safaitic|title=The Online Corpus of the Inscriptions of Ancient North Arabia - Safaitic|last=dan|website=krc.orient.ox.ac.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern-style graffiti===
The first known example of "modern style"{{clarify|date=June 2018}} graffiti survives in the ancient Greek city of [[Ephesus]] (in modern-day [[Turkey]]). Local guides say it is an advertisement for [[prostitution]]. Located near a [[mosaic]] and stone walkway, the graffiti shows a handprint that vaguely resembles a heart, along with a footprint, a number, and a carved image of a woman's head. This is believed to indicate that a brothel was nearby, with the handprint symbolizing payment.&lt;ref name=joel/&gt;

The [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] carved graffiti on walls and monuments, examples of which also survive in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. Graffiti in the classical world had different connotations than they carry in today's society concerning content. Ancient graffiti displayed phrases of love declarations, political rhetoric, and simple words of thought, compared to today's popular messages of social and political ideals&lt;ref name=ancel/&gt;
The eruption of [[Vesuvius]] preserved graffiti in [[Pompeii]], which includes [[Latin]] curses, magic spells, declarations of love, alphabets, political slogans, and famous literary quotes, providing insight into ancient Roman street life. One inscription gives the address of a woman named Novellia Primigenia of Nuceria, a prostitute, apparently of great beauty, whose services were much in demand. Another shows a [[phallus]] accompanied by the text, ''mansueta tene'' ("handle with care").

Disappointed love also found its way onto walls in antiquity:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
''Quisquis amat. veniat. Veneri volo frangere costas''
''fustibus et lumbos debilitare deae.''
''Si potest illa mihi tenerum pertundere pectus''
''quit ego non possim caput illae frangere fuste?''

Whoever loves, go to hell. I want to break Venus's ribs
with a club and deform her hips.
If she can break my tender heart
why can't I hit her over the head?
&lt;/poem&gt;|''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum|CIL]]'' IV, 1824.&lt;ref&gt;CIL IV, 4200 shows a failed attempt to write this little poem, maybe because the writer forgot the verses: see F. A. Todd, "Three Pompeian Wall-Inscriptions, and Petronius" in ''The Classical Review'', Vol. 53, No. 1 (Feb., 1939), [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/706251?uid=2134&amp;uid=2476609927&amp;uid=3738296&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=2476609917&amp;uid=60&amp;sid=21104320244421 page 6 note 2] and ''Rediscovering Pompeii'', L'Erma di Bretschneider, Roma, 1990, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ciNtH6c9RDQC&amp;pg=PA39 page 39 note 85].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ancient tourists visiting the 5th-century citadel at [[Sigiriya]] in Sri Lanka scribbled over 1800 individual graffiti there between the 6th and 18th centuries. Etched on the surface of the Mirror Wall, they contain pieces of prose, poetry, and commentary. The majority of these visitors appear to have been from the elite of society: royalty, officials, professions, and clergy. There were also soldiers, archers, and even some metalworkers. The topics range from love to satire, curses, wit, and lament. Many demonstrate a very high level of literacy and a deep appreciation of art and poetry.&lt;ref name=ponnam/&gt; Most of the graffiti refer to the frescoes of semi-nude females found there. One reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Wet with cool dew drops
fragrant with perfume from the flowers
came the gentle breeze
jasmine and water lily
dance in the spring sunshine
side-long glances
of the golden-hued ladies
stab into my thoughts
heaven itself cannot take my mind
as it has been captivated by one lass
among the five hundred I have seen here.&lt;ref name=parana/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among the ancient political graffiti examples were [[Arab]] satirist poems. Yazid al-Himyari, an [[Umayyad]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] poet, was most known for writing his political poetry on the walls between [[Sistan|Sajistan]] and [[Basra]], manifesting a strong hatred towards the [[Umayyad]] regime and its ''[[wali]]s'', and people used to read and circulate them very widely.&lt;ref&gt;حسين مروّة، '''تراثنا كيف نعرفه'''، مؤسسة الأبحاث العربية، بيروت، 1986{{clarify|date=October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2014}}

===Literacy or illiteracy often revealed in graffiti===
Historic forms of graffiti have helped gain understanding into the lifestyles and languages of past cultures. Errors in spelling and grammar in these graffiti offer insight into the degree of literacy in Roman times and provide clues on the pronunciation of spoken Latin. Examples are ''CIL'' IV, 7838: ''Vettium Firmum / aed''[ilem] ''quactiliar''[ii] {{sic}} ''rog''[ant]. Here, "qu" is pronounced "co". The 83 pieces of graffiti found at ''CIL'' IV, 4706-85 are evidence of the ability to read and write at levels of society where literacy might not be expected. The graffiti appear on a [[peristyle]] which was being remodeled at the time of the eruption of Vesuvius by the architect [[Crescens]]. The graffiti were left by both the foreman and his workers. The brothel at ''CIL'' VII, 12, 18–20 contains more than 120 pieces of graffiti, some of which were the work of the prostitutes and their clients. The [[gladiator]]ial academy at ''CIL'' IV, 4397 was scrawled with graffiti left by the gladiator Celadus Crescens (''Suspirium puellarum Celadus thraex'': "Celadus the [[Thracians|Thracian]] makes the girls sigh.")

Another piece from Pompeii, written on a tavern wall about the owner of the establishment and his questionable wine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Landlord, may your lies malign
Bring destruction on your head!
You yourself drink unmixed wine,
Water [do you] sell [to] your guests instead.&lt;ref name=olmert/&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was not only the Greeks and Romans who produced graffiti: the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] site of [[Tikal]] in [[Guatemala]] contains examples of [[ancient Maya graffiti]]. [[Viking]] graffiti survive in Rome and at [[Newgrange|Newgrange Mound]] in Ireland, and a [[Varangian]] scratched his name (Halvdan) in [[Runic alphabet|rune]]s on a [[banister]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]] at [[Constantinople]]. These early forms of graffiti have contributed to the understanding of lifestyles and languages of past cultures.

Graffiti, known as Tacherons, were frequently scratched on Romanesque Scandinavian church walls.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;
When [[Renaissance]] artists such as [[Pinturicchio]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], or [[Filippino Lippi]] descended into the ruins of Nero's [[Domus Aurea]], they carved or painted their names and returned to initiate the ''[[grottesche]]'' style of decoration.&lt;ref name="archeology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atlantic"/&gt;

There are also examples of graffiti occurring in American history, such as [[Independence Rock (Wyoming)|Independence Rock]], a national landmark along the [[Oregon Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Independence Rock - California National Historic Trail (National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/cali/planyourvisit/site5.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, French soldiers carved their names on monuments during the Napoleonic [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1798|campaign of Egypt]] in the 1790s.&lt;ref name=JinxArtCrimes/&gt; [[Lord Byron]]'s survives on one of the columns of the Temple of [[Poseidon]] at [[Cape Sounion]] in [[Attica]], Greece.&lt;ref name=shanks/&gt;

== Contemporary graffiti ==
Graffiti writing is often intertwined with [[hip hop culture]]&lt;ref name="genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Paul-edwards-is-graffiti-really-an-element-of-hip-hop-book-excerpt-annotated|title=Is Graffiti Really An Element Of Hip-Hop?

However, there are many other instances of notable graffiti in the twentieth century. Graffiti have long appeared on building walls, in [[latrine]]s, railroad [[boxcar]]s, [[rapid transit|subways]], and bridges. The oldest known example of modern graffiti is found on traincars created by hobos and railworkers started more than eighty years ago, called Bozo Texino, documented by filmmaker [[Bill Daniel (filmmaker)|Bill Daniel]] in his 2005 film, ''Who is Bozo Texino?''.&lt;ref name="bozo-texino-walker"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walkerart.org/calendar/2010/who-is-bozo-texino|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=22 July 2010|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Bill|last=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bozo-texino-film"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billdaniel.net/who-is-bozo-texino/|title=Who Is Bozo Texino?|date=2005|work=Who Is Bozo Texino? The Secret History of Hobo Graffiti|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Bill|last=Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some graffiti have their own poignancy. In [[World War II]], an inscription on a wall at the fortress of [[Verdun]] was seen as an illustration of the US response twice in a generation to the wrongs of the Old World:&lt;ref name=reagan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/14/opinion/words-from-a-war.html|title=Words From a War|date=14 August 1985|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Austin White – Chicago, Ill – 1918
Austin White – Chicago, Ill – 1945
This is the last time I want to write my name here.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During World War II and for decades after, the phrase "[[Kilroy was here]]" with an accompanying illustration was widespread throughout the world, due to its use by American troops and ultimately filtering into American popular culture. Shortly after the death of [[Charlie Parker]] (nicknamed "Yardbird" or "Bird"), graffiti began appearing around New York with the words "Bird Lives".&lt;ref name=russel/&gt; The student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-révolutionnaire'' ("Boredom is counterrevolutionary") expressed in painted graffiti, [[poster]] art, and [[stencil]] art. At the time in the US, other political phrases (such as "Free Huey" about [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] [[Huey Newton]]) became briefly popular as graffiti in limited areas, only to be forgotten. A popular graffito of the early 1970s was "Dick [[Richard Milhous Nixon|Nixon]] Before He Dicks You", reflecting the hostility of the youth culture to that US president.

===Advent of aerosol paint===
Rock and roll graffiti is a significant subgenre. A famous graffito of the twentieth century was the inscription in the London tube reading "Clapton is God" in a link to the guitarist [[Eric Clapton]]. The phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in an [[Islington]] station on the [[London Underground|Underground]] in the autumn of 1967. The graffito was captured in a photograph, in which a dog is [[Urine marking#Canidae|urinating on the wall]].

Graffiti also became associated with the anti-establishment [[punk rock]] movement beginning in the 1970s. Bands such as [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Crass]] (and their followers) widely [[stencil]]ed their names and logos, while many punk night clubs, squats, and hangouts are famous for their graffiti. In the late 1980s the upside down Martini glass that was the tag for punk band [[Missing Foundation]] was the most ubiquitous graffito in lower Manhattan, and was copied by hard core punk fans throughout the US and West Germany.&lt;ref name=myspace/&gt;

Along similar lines was the legend "[[Frodo Lives!|Frodo Lives]]," referring to the protagonist of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Spread of hip hop culture===
In 1979, graffiti artist [[Lee Quinones]] and [[Fab Five Freddy|Fab 5 Freddy]] were given a gallery opening in Rome by art dealer Claudio Bruni. For many outside of New York, it was their first encounter with their art form. Fab 5 Freddy's friendship with [[Debbie Harry]] influenced [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s single "[[Rapture (Blondie song)|Rapture]]" ([[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]], 1981), the video of which featured [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], and offered many their first glimpse of a depiction of elements of graffiti in hip hop culture. JaJaJa toured Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and Holland with a large graffiti canvas as a backdrop.&lt;ref name=chesh/&gt; Charlie Ahearn's independently released fiction film ''[[Wild Style]]'' (Wild Style, 1983), the early [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'' (1983), hit songs such as "[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]" and "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]" and their accompanying [[music video]]s (both 1982) contributed to a growing interest outside New York in all aspects of hip hop.&lt;ref name="genius-paul-edwards-hiphopbook" /&gt;

''Style Wars'' depicted not only famous graffiti artists such as Skeme, [[DONDI|Dondi]], MinOne, and [[Zephyr (artist)|ZEPHYR]], but also reinforced graffiti's role within New York's emerging hip-hop culture by incorporating famous early break-dancing groups such as Rock Steady Crew into the film and featuring rap in the soundtrack. Although many officers of the New York City Police Department found this film to be controversial, Style Wars is still recognized as the most prolific film representation of what was going on within the young hip hop culture of the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=labonte/&gt; Fab 5 Freddy and Futura 2000 took hip hop graffiti to Paris and London as part of the New York City Rap Tour in 1983.&lt;ref name=hershk/&gt; Hollywood also paid attention, consulting writers such as [[PHASE 2]] as it depicted the culture and gave it international exposure in movies such as ''[[Beat Street]]'' ([[Orion Pictures|Orion]], 1984).

===Stencil graffiti emerges===
This period also saw the emergence of the new [[stencil graffiti]] genre. Some of the first examples were created in 1981 by graffiti artist [[Blek le Rat]] in Paris, in 1982 by [[Jef Aerosol]] in Tours (France);{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} by 1985 stencils had appeared in other cities including New York City, Sydney, and [[Melbourne]], where they were documented by American photographer Charles Gatewood and Australian photographer Rennie Ellis.&lt;ref name=ellis/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Graffiti as a memorial===
People often leave their traces in wet cement or concrete. This type of graffito often commemorates the mutual commitment of a couple, or simply records a person's presence at a particular moment. Often this type of graffito is dated and is left untouched for decades, offering a look into local historical minutiae.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Commercialization and entrance into mainstream pop culture===
{{Main|Commercial graffiti}}
With the popularity and legitimization of graffiti has come a level of commercialization. In 2001, computer giant [[IBM]] launched an advertising campaign in Chicago and San Francisco which involved people spray painting on sidewalks a [[peace symbol]], a [[Heart (symbol)|heart]], and a [[penguin]] ([[Linux]] [[mascot]]), to represent "Peace, Love, and Linux." Due to laws forbidding it, some of the "street artists" were arrested and charged with vandalism, and IBM was fined more than US$120,000 for punitive damages and clean-up costs.&lt;ref name=guerilla/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

In 2005, a similar ad campaign was launched by [[Sony]] and executed by [[TATS CRU]] in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Miami, to market its handheld [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] gaming system. In [[PlayStation Portable#Controversial advertising campaigns|this campaign]], taking notice of the legal problems of the IBM campaign, Sony paid building owners for the rights to paint on their buildings "a collection of dizzy-eyed urban kids playing with the PSP as if it were a skateboard, a paddle, or a rocking horse".&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

===Gamer culture===
Along with the commercial growth has come the rise of [[video game]]s also depicting graffiti, usually in a positive aspect – for example, the ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'' series (2000–2003) tells the story of a group of teens fighting the oppression of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] police force that attempts to limit the graffiti artists' [[freedom of speech]]. In plotlines mirroring the negative reaction of non-commercial artists to the commercialization of the art form by companies such as IBM (and, later, Sony itself) the ''[[Graffiti Kingdom|Rakugaki Ōkoku]]'' series (2003–2005) for Sony's [[PlayStation 2]] revolves around an anonymous hero and his magically imbued-with-life graffiti creations as they struggle against an evil king who only allows art to be produced which can benefit him. Following the original roots of modern graffiti as a political force came another game title, ''[[Marc Eckō's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure]]'' (2006), featuring a story line involving fighting against a corrupt city and its oppression of free speech, as in the ''Jet Set Radio'' series.

Other games which feature graffiti include ''[[Klark Kent|Bomb the World]]'' (2004), an online graffiti simulation created by graffiti artist [[Klark Kent]] where users can paint trains virtually at 20 locations worldwide, and ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' (2002), in which the hero, [[Mario]] must clean the city of graffiti left by the villain, [[Bowser Jr.]] in a plotline which evokes the successes of the Anti-Graffiti Task Force of New York's Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani|Rudolph Giuliani]] (a manifestation of the "[[Fixing Broken Windows|broken window theory]]") or those of the "[[Graffiti Blasters]]" of Chicago's Mayor [[Richard M. Daley]].

Numerous other non-graffiti-centric video games allow the player to produce graffiti (such as the [[Half-Life (series)|''Half-Life'' series]], the [[Tony Hawk's (series)|''Tony Hawk's'' series]], ''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'', ''[[Rolling (video game)|Rolling]]'', and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]''). ''[[Counter-Strike (video game)|Counter-Strike]]'', which is a ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' mod, allows users to create their own graffiti tags to use in the game. Many other titles contain in-game depictions of graffiti, including ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]'', ''[[Double Dragon (series)#Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone|Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone]]'', ''[[NetHack]]'', ''[[Samurai Champloo: Sidetracked]]'', ''[[The World Ends with You]]'', ''[[The Warriors (video game)|The Warriors]]'', ''[[Just Cause (video game)|Just Cause]]'', ''[[Portal (video game)|Portal]]'', and various examples of [[Virtual Graffiti#Gaming|Virtual Graffiti]]. There also exist games where the term "graffiti" is used as a synonym for "drawing" (such as ''[[Yahoo! Graffiti]]'', ''[[ImagiNation Network#SierraLand|Graffiti]]'', etc.).

===Advocates===
[[Marc Ecko]], an urban clothing designer, has been an advocate of graffiti as an art form during this period, stating that "Graffiti is without question the most powerful art movement in recent history and has been a driving inspiration throughout my career."&lt;ref name=sohh/&gt;

[[Henry Chalfant]] is one of the foremost advocates of modern graffiti, having produced the documentary film [[Style Wars]] and co-authored the books ''[[Subway Art]]'' and ''Spray Can Art''. His most recent work, ''Henry Chalfant's Graffiti Archive: New York City's Subway Art and Artists'' displays his over 800 photographs of New York City Subway Graffiti Art.&lt;ref name=chalf/&gt;

[[Keith Haring]] was another well-known graffiti artist who brought Pop Art and graffiti to the commercial mainstream. In the 1980s, Haring opened his first Pop Shop: a store that offered everyone access to his works, which until then could only be found spray-painted on city walls. Pop Shop offered commodities such as bags and t-shirts. Haring explained that "The Pop Shop makes my work accessible. It's about participation on a big level, the point was that we didn't want to produce things that would cheapen the art. In other words, this was still art as statement."&lt;ref name="haring-foundation-site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haring.com/!/pop-shop|title=Pop Shop|date=2018|work=The Keith Haring Foundation Website|accessdate=23 August 2018|first=Keith|last=Haring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graffiti have become a common stepping stone for many members of both the [[art and design]] communities in North America and abroad. Within the United States graffiti artists such as Mike Giant, Pursue, Rime, Noah, and countless others have made careers in skateboard, apparel, and shoe design for companies such as DC Shoes, Adidas, Rebel8, Osiris, or Circa&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Meanwhile, there are many others such as DZINE, Daze, Blade, and The Mac who have made the switch to being gallery artists, often not even using their initial medium, spray paint.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

But perhaps the greatest example of graffiti artists infiltrating mainstream pop culture is the French crew [[123Klan]].  Founded as a graffiti crew in 1989 by Scien and Klor, 123Klan has gradually turned their hands to illustration and design while still maintaining their graffiti practice and style. In doing so they have designed and produced logos and illustrations, shoes, and fashion for the likes of Nike, Adidas, Lamborghini, Coca Cola, Stussy, Sony, Nasdaq, and more.&lt;ref name=grafica/&gt;&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Yarnbus.jpg|thumb|This bus has been [[yarn bombing|yarn bombed]] by a team of knitters. {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

===Global developments===

====South America====
There is a significant graffiti tradition in South America, especially in [[Brazil]]. Within Brazil, [[São Paulo]] is a significant centre of inspiration for many graffiti artists worldwide.&lt;ref name=manco/&gt;

Tristan Manco wrote that Brazil "boasts a unique and particularly rich, graffiti scene&amp;nbsp;... [earning] it an international reputation as the place to go for artistic inspiration." Graffiti "flourishes in every conceivable space in Brazil's cities." Artistic parallels "are often drawn between the energy of São Paulo today and 1970s New York." The "sprawling metropolis," of São Paulo has "become the new shrine to graffiti;" Manco alludes to "poverty and unemployment&amp;nbsp;... [and] the epic struggles and conditions of the country's marginalised peoples," and to "Brazil's chronic poverty," as the main engines that "have fuelled a vibrant graffiti culture." In world terms, Brazil has "one of the most uneven distributions of income. Laws and taxes change frequently." Such factors, Manco argues, contribute to a very fluid society, riven with those economic divisions and social tensions that underpin and feed the "folkloric vandalism and an urban sport for the disenfranchised," that is South American graffiti art.&lt;ref name=manco7/&gt;

Prominent Brazilian graffiti artists include [[Os Gêmeos]], Boleta, [[Francisco Rodrigues da Silva|Nunca]], Nina, Speto, Tikka, and T.Freak.&lt;ref name=globo/&gt; Their artistic success and involvement in commercial design ventures&lt;ref name=nicek/&gt; has highlighted divisions within the Brazilian graffiti community between adherents of the cruder transgressive form of ''pichação'' and the more conventionally artistic values of the practitioners of ''grafite''.&lt;ref name=revela/&gt;

====Middle East====

Graffiti in the [[Middle East]] is emerging slowly, with pockets of taggers operating in the various 'Emirates' of the [[United Arab Emirates]], in [[Israel]], and in [[Iran]]. The major Iranian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'' has published two articles on illegal writers in the city with photographic coverage of Iranian artist [[A1one]]'s works on Tehran walls. Tokyo-based design magazine, ''PingMag'', has interviewed A1one and featured photographs of his work.&lt;ref name=pinmag/&gt; The [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] has become a site for graffiti, reminiscent in this sense of the [[Berlin Wall]]. Many graffiti artists in Israel come from other places around the globe, such as JUIF from Los Angeles and DEVIONE from London. The religious reference  "נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן" ("[[Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman]]") is commonly seen in graffiti around Israel.

====Southeast Asia====
There are also a large number of graffiti influences in [[Southeast Asia]]n countries that mostly come from modern [[Western culture]], such as Malaysia, where graffiti have long been a common sight in Malaysia's capital city, [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Since 2010, the country has begun hosting a street festival to encourage all generations and people from all walks of life to enjoy and encourage Malaysian street culture.&lt;ref name=kharbar/&gt;

== Characteristics of common graffiti ==
{{See also|Graffiti terminology|Graffiti in the United States}}

===Methods and production===
The modern-day graffiti artist can be found with an arsenal of various materials that allow for a successful production of a piece.&lt;ref name=nicolas/&gt; This includes such techniques as [[Scribing (graffiti)|scribing]]. However, [[spray paint]] in aerosol cans is the number one medium for graffiti. From this commodity comes different styles, technique, and abilities to form master works of graffiti. Spray paint can be found at hardware and art stores and comes in virtually every color.

[[Stencil graffiti]], originating in the early 1980s ([[Blek le Rat]], [[Jef Aerosol]], [[Speedy Graphito]], [[Miss Tic]] ... ) is created by cutting out shapes and designs in a stiff material (such as [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] or subject [[File folder|folder]]s) to form an overall design or image.&lt;ref name=drupal/&gt; The stencil is then placed on the "canvas" gently and with quick, easy strokes of the aerosol can, the image begins to appear on the intended surface. This method of graffiti is popular amongst artists because of its swift technique that requires very little time. Time is always a factor with graffiti artists due to the constant threat of being caught by law enforcement.

===Modern experimentation===

[[File:Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier.JPG|thumbnail|Spiderweb Yarnbomb Installation by Stephen Duneier both hides and highlights previous graffiti.]]
Modern graffiti art often incorporates additional arts and technologies. For example, [[Graffiti Research Lab]] has encouraged the use of projected images and magnetic light-emitting diodes ([[LED art|throwies]]) as new media for graffiti artists. [[Yarnbombing]] is another recent form of graffiti. Yarnbombers occasionally target previous graffiti for modification, which had been avoided among the majority of graffiti artists.

===Tagging===

Some of the most common styles of graffiti have their own names. A '''tag''' is the most basic writing of an artist's name; it is simply a [[handstyle]]. A graffiti writer's tag is his or her personalized signature. Tagging is often the example given when opponents of graffiti refer to any acts of handstyle graffiti writing (it is by far the most common form of graffiti). Tags can contain subtle and sometimes cryptic messages, and may incorporate the artist's crew initials or other letters.

One form of tagging, known as '''pissing''', involves taking a refillable fire-extinguisher and replacing the contents with paint, allowing for tags as high as approximately {{convert|20|ft|m}}. Aiming and keeping a handstyle steady in this form of tagging is very difficult, usually coming out wavy and sloppy.

Another form is the '''throw-up''', also known as a '''bombing''', which is normally painted very quickly with two or three colors, sacrificing aesthetics for speed. Throw-ups can also be outlined on a surface with one color. A '''piece''' is a more elaborate representation of the artist's name, incorporating more stylized letters, usually incorporating a much larger range of colors. This is more time-consuming and increases the likelihood of the artist getting caught. A '''blockbuster''' or '''roller''' is a large piece, almost always done in a block-shaped style, done simply to cover a large area solidly with two contrasting colors, sometimes with the whole purpose of blocking other writers from painting on the same wall. These are usually accomplished with extended paint rollers and gallons of cheap exterior paint.

A more complex style is '''[[wildstyle]]''', a form of graffiti usually involving interlocking letters and connecting points. These pieces are often harder to read by non-graffiti artists as the letters merge into one another in an often-undecipherable manner.

Some artists also use self-adhesive '''stickers''' as a quick way to do catch ups. While certain critics from within graffiti culture consider this lazy, stickers can be quite detailed in their own right and often, are used in conjunction with other materials. Sticker tags are commonly executed on blank postage stickers, as these can easily be acquired with no cost on the writer's part.

Many graffiti artists believe that doing complex pieces involves too great an investment of time to justify the practice. Doing a piece can take (depending on experience and size) from 30 minutes to months on end, as was the case for [[Saber (artist)|Saber]] MSK while working on the world's largest graffiti piece on the LA river.

Another graffiti artist can go over a piece in a matter of minutes with a simple throw-up. This was exemplified by the writer "CAP" in the documentary ''[[Style Wars]]'', who, other writers complain, ruins pieces with his quick throw ups. This became known as '''capping''' and often is done when there is a "beef", or conflict between writers.

A number of recent examples of graffiti make use of [[hashtags]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.fitzrovia.org.uk/2015/07/23/hashtag-on-the-pavement-connects-with-fitzrovias-past/] "Hashtag on the pavement connects with Fitzrovia's past", Fitzrovia News, 23 July 2015, Retrieved 17 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://massappeal.com/riskrock-graffiti-in-san-francisco/] "#RISKROCK #GRAFFITI IN #SANFRANCISCO", Mass Appeal, Retrieved 17 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Theories on the use of graffiti by [[avant-garde]] artists have a history dating back at least to the [[Scandinavian Institute of Comparative Vandalism]] in 1961.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Many contemporary analysts and even art critics have begun to see artistic value in some graffiti and to recognize it as a form of [[public art]]. According to many art researchers, particularly in the Netherlands and in Los Angeles, that type of public art is, in fact an effective tool of social [[political emancipation|emancipation]] or, in the achievement of a political goal.&lt;ref name=thimar/&gt;

The murals of [[Belfast]] and of Los Angeles offer another example of official recognition.&lt;ref name=rpmural/&gt; In times of conflict, such murals have offered a means of communication and self-expression for members of these socially, ethnically, or racially divided communities, and have proven themselves as effective tools in establishing dialog and thus, of addressing cleavages in the long run. The [[Berlin Wall]] was also extensively covered by graffiti reflecting social pressures relating to the oppressive [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule over the [[East Germany|GDR]].

Many artists involved with graffiti are also concerned with the similar activity of [[stenciling]]. Essentially, this entails stenciling a print of one or more colors using spray-paint. Recognized while [[Art exhibition|exhibiting]] and publishing several of her coloured stencils and paintings portraying the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] and [[Urban area|urban Britain]] in the early 2000s, graffiti artist [[M.I.A. (artist)|Mathangi Arulpragasam, aka M.I.A.]], has also become known for integrating her imagery of political violence into her [[music videos]] for singles "[[Galang (song)|Galang]]" and "[[Bucky Done Gun]]", and her cover art. Stickers of her artwork also often appear around places such as London in [[Brick Lane]], stuck to lamp posts and street signs, she having become a muse for other graffiti artists and painters worldwide in cities including [[Seville]].&lt;ref name=teleci/&gt; Graffiti artist [[John Fekner]], called "caption writer to the urban environment, adman for the opposition" by writer [[Lucy Lippard]],&lt;ref name=lippard/&gt; was involved in direct art interventions within New York City's [[Urban decay|decaying]] urban environment in the mid-1970s through the 1980s. Fekner is known for his word installations targeting social and political issues, stenciled on buildings throughout New York.

=== Personal expression ===
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] celebrating personal expression]]Graffiti artists constantly have the looming threat of facing consequences for displaying their graffiti. Many choose to protect their identities and reputation by remaining anonymous.

With the commercialization of graffiti (and [[hip hop]] in general), in most cases, even with legally painted "graffiti" art, graffiti artists tend to choose anonymity. This may be attributed to various reasons or a combination of reasons. Graffiti still remains the [[hip hop#Cultural pillars|one of four hip hop elements]] that is not considered "performance art" despite the image of the "singing and dancing star" that sells hip hop culture to the mainstream. Being a graphic form of art, it might also be said that many graffiti artists still fall in the category of the [[Extraversion and introversion#Introversion|introverted archetypal artist]].

[[Banksy]] is one of the world's most notorious and popular street artists who continues to remain faceless in today's society.&lt;ref name=banksy/&gt; He is known for his political, anti-war stencil art mainly in [[Bristol, England]], but his work may be seen anywhere from Los Angeles to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. In the UK, Banksy is the most recognizable icon for this cultural artistic movement and keeps his identity a secret to avoid arrest. Much of Banksy's artwork may be seen around the streets of London and surrounding suburbs, although he has painted pictures throughout the world, including the Middle East, where he has painted on Israel's controversial [[West Bank]] barrier with satirical images of life on the other side. One depicted a hole in the wall with an idyllic beach, while another shows a mountain landscape on the other side. A number of [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]] also have taken place since 2000, and recent works of art have fetched vast sums of money. Banksy's art is a prime example of the classic controversy: vandalism vs. art. Art supporters endorse his work distributed in urban areas as pieces of art and some councils, such as Bristol and Islington, have officially protected them, while officials of other areas have deemed his work to be vandalism and have removed it.

[[Pixnit]] is another artist who chooses to keep her identity from the general public.&lt;ref name=shaer/&gt; Her work focuses on beauty and design aspects of graffiti as opposed to Banksy's anti-government shock value. Her paintings are often of flower designs above shops and stores in her local urban area of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Some store owners endorse her work and encourage others to do similar work as well. "One of the pieces was left up above Steve's Kitchen, because it looks pretty awesome"- Erin Scott, the manager of [[New England Comics]] in [[Allston, Massachusetts]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Radical and political ===
[[File:M2109 Iraq War Protest (Black Bloc Element).jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|[[Black bloc]] members spray graffiti on a wall during an [[Protests against the Iraq War#March 21, 2009|Iraq War Protest]] in Washington, D.C.]]
Graffiti often has a reputation as part of a subculture that rebels against authority, although the considerations of the practitioners often diverge and can relate to a wide range of attitudes. It can express a political practice and can form just one tool in an array of resistance techniques. One early example includes the [[anarcho-punk]] band [[Crass]], who conducted a campaign of stenciling [[anti-war]], [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[feminism|feminist]], and [[consumerism|anti-consumerist]] messages throughout the [[London Underground]] system during the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name=souther/&gt; In [[Amsterdam]] graffiti was a major part of the punk scene. The city was covered with names such as "De Zoot", "Vendex", and "Dr Rat".&lt;ref name=stockho/&gt; To document the graffiti a punk magazine was started that was called ''Gallery Anus''. So when hip hop came to Europe in the early 1980s there was already a vibrant graffiti culture.

The student protests and general strike of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] saw Paris bedecked in revolutionary, anarchistic, and situationist slogans such as ''L'ennui est contre-révolutionnaire'' ("Boredom is counterrevolutionary") and ''Lisez moins, vivez plus'' ("Read less, live more"). While not exhaustive, the graffiti gave a sense of the 'millenarian' and rebellious spirit, tempered with a good deal of verbal wit, of the strikers.

{{quote box|align=right|width=220px|quote=I think graffiti writing is a way of defining what our generation is like. Excuse the French, we're not a bunch of p---- artists. Traditionally artists have been considered soft and mellow people, a little bit kooky. Maybe we're a little bit more like pirates that way. We defend our territory, whatever space we steal to paint on, we defend it fiercely.|source=—Sandra "Lady Pink" Fabara&lt;ref name=chang/&gt;}}

The developments of graffiti art which took place in art galleries and colleges as well as "on the street" or "underground", contributed to the resurfacing in the 1990s of a far more overtly politicized art form in the [[subvertising]], [[culture jamming]], or tactical media movements. These movements or styles tend to classify the artists by their relationship to their social and economic contexts, since, in most countries, graffiti art remains illegal in many forms except when using non-permanent paint. Since the 1990s with the rise of [[Street Art]], a growing number of artists are switching to non-permanent paints and non-traditional forms of painting&lt;ref name="ziptopia-switch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zipcar.com/ziptopia/city-living/temporary-street-art-changing-the-graffiti-game|title=Temporary Street Art That's Changing The Graffiti Game|work=Ziptopia|first=STEVEN|last=HARRINGTON |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost-streetart"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-english/street-art-its-not-meant-_b_5610496.html|title=Street Art: It's Not Meant to be Permanent|work=Huffington Post|first=Ron|last=English|date=6 Dec 2017|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a variety of reasons—but primarily because is it difficult for the police to apprehend them and for the courts to sentence or even convict a person for a protest that is as fleeting and less intrusive than marching in the streets. In some communities, such impermanent works survive longer than works created with permanent paints because the community views the work in the same vein as that of the civil protester who marches in the street—such protest are impermanent, but effective nevertheless.

In some areas where a number of artists share the impermanence ideal, an informal competition develops:  the length of time that a work escapes destruction is viewed as a measure of the respect the work garners in the community. A crude work that deserves little respect would be invariably removed immediately, while the most talented artists might have works last for days.

Contemporary practitioners, accordingly, have varied and often conflicting practices. Some individuals, such as [[Alexander Brener]], have used the medium to politicize other art forms, and have used the prison sentences enforced on them as a means of further protest.&lt;ref name="voice" /&gt;
The practices of anonymous groups and individuals also vary widely, and practitioners by no means always agree with each other's practices. For example, the anti-capitalist art group the [[Space Hijackers]] did a piece in 2004 about the contradiction between the capitalistic elements of Banksy and his use of political [[imagery]].&lt;ref name="tanyabaxter-Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tanyabaxtercontemporary.com/banksy#!Banksy_Flying_Copper__screen_print_on_paper__100_x_70_cm|title= Banksy |work=Tanya Baxter Contemporary Gallery|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haynes-banksy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haynesfineart.com/artists/Banksy--|title= Banksy |work=Haynes Fine Art|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of the political aspect of graffiti as a [[Cultural movement|movement]], political groups and individuals may also use graffiti as a tool to spread their [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. This practice, due to its illegality, has generally become favored by groups excluded from the political mainstream (e.g. [[far-left]] or [[far-right]] groups) who justify their activity by pointing out that they do not have the money – or sometimes the desire – to buy [[advertising]] to get their message across, and that a "[[ruling class]]" or "establishment" controls the mainstream press, systematically excluding the radical and alternative point of view. This type of graffiti can seem crude; for example [[Fascism|fascist]] supporters often scrawl [[swastika]]s and other [[Nazism|Nazi]] images.

One innovative form of graffiti that emerged in the UK in the 1970s was devised by the Money Liberation Front (MLF), essentially a loose affiliation of [[underground press]] writers such as the poet and playwright [[Heathcote Williams]] and magazine editor and playwright Jay Jeff Jones. They initiated the use of paper currency as a medium for [[counterculture]] propaganda, overprinting banknotes, usually with a [[John Bull]] printing set. Although short lived, the MLF was representative of London's [[Ladbroke Grove]] centered alternative and literary community of the period. The area was also a scene of considerable [[anti-establishment]] and humorous street graffiti, much of which is also produced by Williams.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; In 2009, following the elections in Iran, protesters (who regarded the electoral result as rigged) began to deface banknotes with slogans such as "Death to the dictator". In Colombia writing and drawing on banknotes has become increasingly popular, either to make political comments, for fun or as an artistic medium. The national government has run advertising campaigns in an attempt to discourage the practice. In the UK there have been signs of an MLF resurgence with a number of banknotes in circulation being over-marked with protest slogans such as "Banks=Robbers", relating to the perceived culpability of banks in the financial crisis.

Both sides of the conflict in [[Northern Ireland]] produce political graffiti. As well as slogans, Northern Irish political graffiti includes large wall paintings, referred to as ''[[Northern Irish murals|murals]]''. Along with the flying of flags and the painting of kerb stones, the murals serve a territorial purpose, often associated with gang use. Artists paint them mostly on house gables or on the ''[[Belfast Peace Lines|Peace Lines]]'', high walls that separate different communities.

The murals often develop over an extended period and tend to stylization, with a strong symbolic or [[iconographic]] content. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist]] murals often refer to historical events dating from the war between [[James II of England|James II]] and [[William III of England|William III]] in the late seventeenth century, whereas [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] murals usually refer to the more recent [[The Troubles|troubles]].

Territorial graffiti marks urban neighborhoods with tags and logos to differentiate certain groups from others. These images are meant to show outsiders a stern look at whose turf is whose. The subject matter of gang-related graffiti consists of cryptic [[symbols]] and [[initials]] strictly fashioned with unique [[calligraphies]]. Gang members use graffiti to designate membership throughout the gang, to differentiate rivals and associates and, most commonly, to mark borders which are both territorial and ideological.&lt;ref name=ley/&gt;

=== As advertising ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
Graffiti has been used as a means of advertising both legally and illegally. [[The Bronx|Bronx]]-based [[TATS CRU]] has made a name for themselves doing legal advertising campaigns for companies such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[McDonald's]], [[Toyota]], and [[MTV]]. In the UK, Covent Garden's [[Boxfresh]] used stencil images of a [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista]] revolutionary in the hopes that cross referencing would promote their store.

Tech Giants Hewlett Packard used graffiti company [[Darren Cullen#Graffiti Kings|Graffiti Kings]] based in London to showcase the creative use for their Sprout computer by producing a video, during the video Hewlett Packard showed many pieces of graffiti art while the Graffiti Kings artist used the Sprout computer to draw digital graffiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11408538/HP-Sprout-is-this-the-future-of-desktop-computing.html|title=HP Sprout: is this the future of desktop computing?|newspaper= Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graffitikings.co.uk/hp-hewlett-packard-sprout-graffiti-kings/|title=
HP – Hewlett Packard Sprout &amp; Graffiti Kings|website= Graffitikings|date=2015-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smirnoff]] hired artists to use [[reverse graffiti]] (the use of high pressure hoses to clean dirty surfaces to leave a clean image in the surrounding dirt) to increase awareness of their product. [[Shepard Fairey]] rose to fame after his "Andre the Giant Has a Posse" sticker campaign, in which his art was plastered in cities throughout America.

Many graffiti artists see legal advertising as no more than "paid for and legalised graffiti", and have risen against mainstream ads. The [[Graffiti Research Lab]] crew have gone on to target several prominent ads in New York as a means of making a statement against this practice.

=== Offensive graffiti ===
[[File:Stop graffitti.jpg|thumb|Gang symbol markings on public property, [[Millwood, Washington]]]]
Graffiti may also be used as an offensive expression. This form of graffiti may be difficult to identify, as it is mostly removed by the local authority (as councils which have adopted strategies of criminalization also strive to remove graffiti quickly).&lt;ref name=halsey/&gt; Therefore, existing racist graffiti is mostly more subtle and at first sight, not easily recognized as "racist". It can then only be understood if one knows the relevant "local code" (social, historical, political, temporal, and spatial), which is seen as [[heteroglossia|heteroglot]] and thus a 'unique set of conditions' in a cultural context.&lt;ref name=holqu/&gt;
:A spatial code for example, could be that there is a certain youth group in an area that is engaging heavily in racist activities. So, for residents (knowing the local code), a graffiti containing only the name or abbreviation of this gang already is a racist expression, reminding the offended people of their gang activities. Also a graffiti is in most cases, the [[herald]] of more serious criminal activity to come.&lt;ref name=kelling/&gt; A person who does not know these gang activities would not be able to recognize the meaning of this graffiti. Also if a tag of this youth group or gang is placed on a building occupied by asylum seekers, for example, its racist character is even stronger.
Hence, the lack of obvious racist graffiti does not necessarily mean that there is none. By making the graffiti less explicit (as adapted to social and legal constraints),&lt;ref name=barker/&gt; these drawings are less likely to be removed, but do not lose their threatening and offensive character.&lt;ref name=lynn/&gt;

Elsewhere, activists in Russia have used painted [[caricature]]s of local officials with their mouths as [[pothole]]s, to show their anger about the poor state of the roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schreck |first=Carl |date=2015-06-19 |title=Russian politicians mocked with guerrilla pothole portraits |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/russia-pothole-portraits-activists-banksy |website= New East Network |access-date=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Manchester, England]] a graffiti artist painted obscene images around potholes, which often resulted in their being repaired within 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=2015-04-29 |title=Meet the man using penises to fill potholes |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/the-filter/11570595/Meet-the-man-using-penises-to-fill-potholes.html |website= The Telegraph |access-date=2015-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 exhibition at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] displayed graffiti as an art form that began in New York's [[outer boroughs]] and reached great heights in the early 1980s with the work of Crash, Lee, Daze, [[Keith Haring]], and [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]. It displayed 22 works by New York graffiti artists, including [[Crash (graffiti artist)|Crash]], Daze, and [[Lady Pink]]. In an article about the exhibition in the magazine ''Time Out'', curator Charlotta Kotik said that she hoped the exhibition would cause viewers to rethink their assumptions about graffiti. [[Terrance Lindall]], an artist and executive director of the Williamsburg Art and Historic Center, said regarding graffiti and the exhibition:&lt;ref name=tonyk/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Graffiti is revolutionary, in my opinion", he says, "and any revolution might be considered a crime. People who are oppressed or suppressed need an outlet, so they write on walls—it's free."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, [[Burhan Dogancay]] photographed urban walls all over the world; these he then archived for use as sources of inspiration for his painterly works. The project today known as "Walls of the World" grew beyond even his own expectations and comprises about 30,000 individual images. It spans a period of 40 years across five continents and 114 countries. In 1982, photographs from this project comprised a one-man exhibition titled "Les murs murmurent, ils crient, ils chantent..." (The walls whisper, shout and sing ... ) at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] in [[Paris]].

In Australia, art historians have judged some local graffiti of sufficient creative merit to rank them firmly within the arts. [[Oxford University Press]]'s art history text ''Australian Painting 1788–2000'' concludes with a long discussion of graffiti's key place within contemporary [[visual culture]], including the work of several Australian practitioners.&lt;ref name=smithea/&gt;

Between March and April 2009, 150 artists exhibited 300 pieces of graffiti at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris — a clear acceptance of the art form into the French [[art world]].&lt;ref name=rfi/&gt;&lt;ref name=rohter/&gt;

Many graffiti artists have used their design talents in other artistic endeavors. In 2009 graffiti artist "[[Scape (graffiti artist)|Scape]]" published ''GRAFF; the Art &amp; Technique of Graffiti'', the world's first book dedicated to displaying the full techniques of creating graffiti art. Other books that focus on graffiti include ''Faith of Graffiti'' by Norman Mailer, ''Trespass'' by Taschen press,&lt;ref name=urbana/&gt; and the comic book by [[Elite Gudz]], ''Concrete Immortalz'', which has a graffiti artist as its main character.

Figurines by [[KAWS (artist)|KAWS]], featuring icons of pop culture, often with crossed-out eyes, run in limited editions and sell for thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name=intmag/&gt; World-renowned street artist Banksy directed a film in 2010, ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]'', which explored street art and commercialism.

==Environmental effects==
[[Spray paint]] has many negative environmental effects. The paint contains toxic chemicals, and the can uses [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s or volatile hydrocarbon gases to spray the paint unto a surface.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} As an alternative, [[moss graffiti]] is starting to catch on,&lt;ref name=envirog/&gt; which uses [[moss]] to create text or images. The moss is glued onto a surface by means of [[beer]], [[buttermilk]], or [[yogurt]] combined with [[sugar]].&lt;ref name=space/&gt;&lt;ref name=hetka/&gt;

== Government responses ==

=== Asia ===
In China, [[Mao Zedong]] in the 1920s used revolutionary slogans and paintings in public places to galvanise the country's communist revolution.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

In Hong Kong, [[Tsang Tsou Choi]] was known as the ''King of Kowloon'' for his [[calligraphy]] graffiti over many years, in which he claimed ownership of the area. Now some of his work is preserved officially.

In [[Taiwan]], the government has made some concessions to graffiti artists. Since 2005 they have been allowed to freely display their work along some sections of riverside retaining walls in designated "Graffiti Zones".&lt;ref name=taitimes/&gt; From 2007, Taipei's department of cultural affairs also began permitting graffiti on fences around major public construction sites. Department head Yong-ping Lee (李永萍) stated, "We will promote graffiti starting with the public sector, and then later in the private sector too. It's our goal to beautify the city with graffiti". The government later helped organize a graffiti contest in [[Ximending]], a popular shopping district. Graffiti artists caught working outside of these designated areas still face fines up to $6,000 TWD under a department of environmental protection regulation.&lt;ref name=taitimes2/&gt; However, Taiwanese authorities can be relatively lenient, one veteran police officer stating anonymously, "Unless someone complains about vandalism, we won't get involved. We don't go after it proactively."&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

In 1993, after several expensive cars in [[Singapore]] were spray-painted, the police arrested a student from the [[Singapore American School]], [[Michael P. Fay]], questioned him, and subsequently charged him with vandalism. Fay pleaded guilty to vandalizing a car in addition to stealing road signs. Under the 1966 [[Vandalism Act (Singapore)|Vandalism Act of Singapore]], originally passed to curb the spread of communist graffiti in Singapore, the court sentenced him to four months in jail, a fine of S$3,500 (US$2,233), and a [[caning]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran several editorials and op-eds that condemned the punishment and called on the American public to flood the Singaporean embassy with protests. Although the Singapore government received many calls for [[pardon|clemency]], Fay's caning took place in Singapore on 5 May 1994. Fay had originally received a sentence of six strokes of the cane, but the presiding [[president of Singapore]], [[Ong Teng Cheong]], agreed to reduce his caning sentence to four lashes.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In [[Republic of Korea|South Korea]], Park Jung-soo was fined 2 million [[South Korean won]] by the [[Seoul]] Central District Court for spray-painting a rat on posters of the [[G-20]] Summit a few days before the event in November 2011. Park alleged that the initial in "G-20" sounds like the Korean word for "rat", but Korean government prosecutors alleged that Mr. Park was making a derogatory statement about the president of ROK, [[Lee Myung-bak]], the host of the summit. This case led to public outcry and debate on the lack of government tolerance and in support of freedom of expression. The court ruled that the painting, "an ominous creature like a rat" amounts to "an organized criminal activity" and upheld the fine while denying the prosecution's request for imprisonment for Park.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

=== Europe ===
[[File:Graffiti removal berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Graffiti removal in Berlin]]
In Europe, community cleaning squads have responded to graffiti, in some cases with reckless abandon, as when in 1992 in France a local Scout group, attempting to remove modern graffiti, damaged [https://www.panoramio.com/photo/26895452 two prehistoric paintings] of [[bison]] in the [[Cave of Mayrière supérieure]] near the French village of [[Bruniquel]] in [[Tarn-et-Garonne]], earning them the 1992 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] in [[archeology]].&lt;ref name=improb/&gt;

In September 2006, the European Parliament directed the European Commission to create urban environment policies to prevent and eliminate dirt, litter, graffiti, animal excrement, and excessive noise from domestic and vehicular music systems in European cities, along with other concerns over urban life.&lt;ref name=europa/&gt;

The [[Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003]] became Britain's latest anti-graffiti legislation. In August 2004, the [[Keep Britain Tidy]] campaign issued a press release calling for [[zero tolerance]] of graffiti and supporting proposals such as issuing "on the spot" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s to graffiti offenders and banning the sale of aerosol paint to anyone under the age of 16.&lt;ref name=encams/&gt; The press release also condemned the use of graffiti images in advertising and in [[music video]]s, arguing that real-world experience of graffiti stood far removed from its often-portrayed 'cool' or 'edgy' image.

To back the campaign, 123 [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s (including then [[Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]]), signed a charter which stated: "Graffiti is not art, it's crime. On behalf of my constituents, I will do all I can to rid our community of this problem."&lt;ref name=wire/&gt; However, since the early 1990s, the British graffiti scene has been struck by self-titled "art terrorist" Banksy, who has revolutionized the style of UK graffiti (bringing to the forefront stencils to aid the speed of painting), as well as the content; making his work largely satirical of the sociological state of cities, or the political climate of war, often using monkeys and rats as motifs.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In the UK, city councils have the power to take action against the owner of any property that has been defaced under the [[Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003]] (as amended by the [http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2005/ukpga_20050016_en_1 Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005]) or, in certain cases, the Highways Act. This is often used against owners of property that are complacent in allowing protective boards to be defaced so long as the property is not damaged.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In July 2008, a [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charge was used to convict graffiti artists for the first time. After a three-month police surveillance operation,&lt;ref name=bbc2/&gt; nine members of the DPM crew were convicted of conspiracy to commit [[criminal damage]] costing at least £1 million. Five of them received prison sentences, ranging from eighteen months to two years. The unprecedented scale of the investigation and the severity of the sentences rekindled public debate over whether graffiti should be considered art or crime.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

Some councils, like those of Stroud and Loerrach, provide approved areas in the town where graffiti artists can showcase their talents, including underpasses, car parks, and walls that might otherwise prove a target for the 'spray and run.'&lt;ref name=bbc3/&gt;

In [[Budapest]], Hungary both a city-backed movement called ''I Love Budapest'' and a special police division tackle the problem, including the provision of approved areas.&lt;ref name=index/&gt;

=== Australia ===
[[File:Graffiti tunnel 2009, University of Sydney.jpg|thumb|Graffiti Tunnel, University of Sydney at [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] (2009)]]
In an effort to reduce vandalism, many cities in Australia have designated walls or areas exclusively for use by graffiti artists. One early example is the "Graffiti Tunnel" located at the [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]] Campus of the [[University of Sydney]], which is available for use by any student at the university to tag, advertise, poster, and create "art". Advocates of this idea suggest that this discourages petty vandalism yet encourages artists to take their time and produce great art, without worry of being caught or arrested for vandalism or [[trespassing]].&lt;ref name=warrin/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Others disagree with this approach, arguing that the presence of legal graffiti walls does not demonstrably reduce illegal graffiti elsewhere.&lt;ref name=towno/&gt; Some local government areas throughout Australia have introduced "anti-graffiti squads", who clean graffiti in the area, and such crews as BCW (Buffers Can't Win) have taken steps to keep one step ahead of local graffiti cleaners.

Many state governments have banned the sale or possession of spray paint to those under the age of 18 (age of majority). However, a number of local governments in Victoria have taken steps to recognize the cultural heritage value of some examples of graffiti, such as prominent political graffiti. Tough new graffiti laws have been introduced in Australia with fines of up to A$26,000 and two years in prison.

[[Melbourne]] is a prominent graffiti city of Australia with many of its lanes being tourist attractions, such as [[Hosier Lane, Melbourne|Hosier Lane]] in particular, a popular destination for photographers, wedding photography, and backdrops for corporate print advertising. The [[Lonely Planet]] travel guide cites Melbourne's street as a major attraction. All forms of graffiti, including [[sticker]] art, [[poster]], [[stencil]] art, and [[wheatpasting]], can be found in many places throughout the city. Prominent street art precincts include; [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Northcote, Victoria|Northcote]], [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St. Kilda]], and the CBD, where stencil and sticker art is prominent. As one moves farther away from the city, mostly along suburban train lines, graffiti tags become more prominent. Many international artists such as Banksy have left their work in Melbourne and in early 2008 a [[perspex]] screen was installed to prevent a Banksy stencil art piece from being destroyed, it has survived since 2003 through the respect of local street artists avoiding posting over it, although it has recently had paint tipped over it.&lt;ref name=wato/&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
[[File:Christchurch Stock Yards.jpg|thumb|Former Christchurch stock yards]]
In February 2008 [[Helen Clark]], the New Zealand prime minister at that time, announced a government crackdown on tagging and other forms of graffiti vandalism, describing it as a destructive crime representing an invasion of public and private property. New legislation subsequently adopted included a ban on the sale of paint spray cans to persons under 18 and increases in maximum fines for the offence from NZ$200 to NZ$2,000 or extended community service. The issue of tagging become a widely debated one following an incident in [[Auckland]] during January 2008 in which a middle-aged property owner stabbed one of two teenage taggers to death and was subsequently convicted of [[manslaughter]].

====Tracker databases====
Graffiti databases have increased in the past decade because they allow vandalism incidents to be fully documented against an offender and help the police and prosecution charge and prosecute offenders for multiple counts of vandalism. They also provide law enforcement the ability to rapidly search for an offender's moniker or tag in a simple, effective, and comprehensive way. These systems can also help track costs of damage to city to help allocate an anti-graffiti budget. The theory is that when an offender is caught putting up graffiti, they are not just charged with one count of vandalism; they can be held accountable for all of the other damage for which they are responsible. This has two main benefits for law enforcement. One, it sends a signal to the offenders that their vandalism is being tracked. Two, a city can seek restitution from offenders for all of the damage that they have committed, not merely a single incident. These systems give law enforcement personnel real-time, street-level intelligence that allows them to not only focus on the worst graffiti offenders and their damage, but also to monitor potential gang violence that is associated with the graffiti.&lt;ref name=crcp/&gt;

====Gang injunctions====
Many restrictions of civil gang injunctions are designed to help address and protect the physical environment and limit graffiti. Provisions of gang injunctions include things such as restricting the possession of marker pens, spray paint cans, or other sharp objects capable of defacing private or public property; spray painting, or marking with marker pens, scratching, applying stickers, or otherwise applying graffiti on any public or private property, including, but not limited to the street, alley, residences, block walls, and fences, vehicles and/or any other real or personal property. Some injunctions contain wording that restricts damaging or vandalizing the property of another, both public and private property, including, but limited to any vehicle, light fixture, door, fence, wall, gate, window, building, street sign, utility box, telephone box, trees, or power pole.&lt;ref name=crcp2 /&gt;

====Hotlines and reward programs====
To help address many of these issues, many local jurisdictions have set up graffiti abatement hotlines, where citizens can call in and report vandalism and have it removed. San Diego's hotline receives more than 5,000 calls per year, in addition to reporting the graffiti, callers can learn more about prevention. One of the complaints about these hotlines is the response time; there is often a lag time between a property owner calling about the graffiti and its removal. The length of delay should be a consideration for any jurisdiction planning on operating a hotline. Local jurisdictions must convince the callers that their complaint of vandalism will be a priority and cleaned off right away. If the jurisdiction does not have the resources to respond to complaints in a timely manner, the value of the hotline diminishes. Crews must be able to respond to individual service calls made to the graffiti hotline as well as focus on cleanup near schools, parks, and major intersections and transit routes to have the biggest impact. Some cities offer a reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of suspects for tagging or graffiti related vandalism. The amount of the reward is based on the information provided, and the action taken.&lt;ref name=lawtec/&gt;

====Search warrants====
When the police use search warrants in connection with a vandalism investigation they are often seeking judicial approval to look for items such as cans of spray paint and nozzles from other kinds of aerosol sprays, etching tools, or other sharp or pointed objects used to etch or scratch glass and other hard surfaces, such as permanent marking pens and markers or paint sticks; evidence of membership or affiliation with any gang or tagging crew, paraphernalia to include any reference to "(tagger's name)," and any drawings, writings, objects, or graffiti depicting taggers' names, initials, logos, monikers, slogans, or mention of tagging crew membership; any newspaper clippings relating details of or referring to any graffiti crime.&lt;ref name=paladin/&gt;

There has been a long-standing '''influence of [[French language|French]] on [[English language|English]],''' in terms of [[syntax]], [[grammar]], [[lexicon]], spelling and pronunciation.

Most French vocabulary that entered English occurred after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 and the establishment of a French-speaking administration. French became the language of the court, the administration and the elites for several centuries, until after the [[Hundred Years War]]. English has been constantly influenced by French from that time till present day.
According to Laura K. Lawless, more than a third of the current [[English vocabulary]] is of French origin.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm |website=french.about.com |title=Terms of Enrichment: How French Has Influenced English |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216063051/http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm# |archive-date=2016-12-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguist [[Henriette Walter]], words of French origin represent more than two thirds of the English vocabulary. It is estimated by linguist Anthony Lacoudre that over 40 000 English words are directly French and may be understood without [[orthographical]] change by French speakers.&lt;ref name="dailymotion"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vbb1z |title=L&amp;#039;incroyable histoire des mots français dans la langue anglaise – Vidéo dailymotion |website=dailymotion.com |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of French in England ==

=== Before 1066 ===
At the beginning of XIth century, the English language did not have a well-defined status. Indeed, the inhabitants of what would become [[Great Britain]] did not have a language that allowed them to communicate with each other. There were many different [[dialect]]al forms. Great Britain, in which various [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] idioms had coexisted since the IVth century, had experienced partial [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] since the 1st century A.D., and this for four centuries.

From 450 onwards, the [[Saxons]], the [[Angles (people)|Angles]] and the [[Jutes]], who came from the continent, settled in the south and east. Germanic dialects would prevail in these regions, supplanting Celtic dialects, which would remain in the west and north of the island ([[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Scotland]]) and [[Ireland]]. In the VIIIth century, [[Vikings]] from [[Scandinavia]] settled on the island. Their languages, also Germanic, in turn influence the languages already present on the island. Thus, at the dawn of XIth century, the country was made up of a series of peoples with significantly different speeches, most of them Germanic, with multiple influences.

=== Norman conquest of England and its consequences ===
It is therefore a linguistically disunited people that the Normans will get massively in contact with, from 1066. [[William II of Normandy]], supported by his King, [[Philip I of France]], and his blood legitimacy to the throne of England, landed at [[Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], on 29 September 1066. His men are deployed around the city waiting for the king [[Harold II]]'s troops. On October 14, exhausted by the long journey to Hastings, Harold II's troops lost the battle after a day. Following the defeat of the English, Duke William II of Normandy became King of England on December 25, 1066, crowned under the name of William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. This date marks the beginning of a long period of ties between the peoples and languages.

In fact, these links already existed before the Battle of Hastings. Indeed, the geographical location of Normandy, facing the English Channel, favoured commercial contacts with England. These ties will be further strengthened at the beginning of the XIth century when the daughter of the Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], Emma, marries King [[Æthelred II of England]]. But it is really from the 1066 conquest that [[proto-English]] becomes massively impregnated with [[Old French]], then modern French. It should be noted, however, that only French will influence English in the centuries following the conquest. The reverse contribution of English to French will only be real from the XVIIIth century.

The arrival of William the Conqueror and his barons significantly changed the linguistic situation in England. [[Norman language|Norman]] is essentially imposed in the upper layers of society. The Anglo-Saxon dialects were supplanted by Norman in the circles of the court and aristocracy, justice and the Church. The influential circles, who came from Normandy and settled in England, kept their Norman mother tongue, while the more modest rural and urban strata continued to speak English.

Norman is a particular variety of the [[Gallo-Roman]] language, spoken in Normandy. It is one of the [[Oil languages]] alongside, among others, the [[Picard language|Picard]] and the [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. The Norman language is modified in contact with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language. It then integrates words and phrases from English and will give birth to a dialect, [[Anglo-Norman (language)|Anglo-Norman]], still spoken on the [[Anglo-Norman isles]]. Anglo-Norman can be described as a [[vernacular language]], on English soil in the XIth century, in the field of literature, culture, court and among the clergy. French was therefore, at first, spoken in England under the form of this Anglo-Norman dialect.

During the XIIth century, continental French has a greater influence on Old English. It acquires great prestige in England, especially within the aristocracy and the clergy. It becomes the language of law and justice nationwide. Rich and noble families, most of them of Norman origin, teach their children French or send them to study in France. The expansion of the French language in England was also encouraged by royal marriages. From [[Henry II Plantagenet]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] at the beginning of the century, to [[Henri VI]] and [[Marguerite of Anjou|Marguerite]] in the XVth century, all kings of England married French princesses. These marriages made French the language of the English court for several centuries and were decisive in strengthening the use of French in England. This period (XIIth-XVth centuries) is characterized by a massive influx of French words into Old English vocabulary.&lt;ref name="le-mot-juste-en-anglais"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html |title=Comment le français a influencé la langue anglaise |website=Le mot juste en anglais |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221242/https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html# |archive-date=2018-11-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1204, [[Philippe Auguste]] Normandy is officially annexed to the kingdom of France, politically isolating England from the continent. Normans who choose to stay in England move further away from France and, therefore, from the French language. Keeping its status as the language of justice and the language of power, England saw the first teaching manuals for teaching French to the English. These manuals were intended for English nobles who wish to perfect their knowledge of French and teach it to their children. Two types of French spoken in the higher spheres of English society can be distinguished during the XIIIth century : the Anglo-Norman dialect, which was the aristocrats' mother tongue, and a more prestigious type of French as a second language. Knowing "parisian" French was a mark of social distinction. As a language of culture, French supplanted Latin from the XIIth century onward as the language of diplomacy and worldly relations throughout Europe. The mass and influence of French literature reinforced its reputation and appeal.

=== The developing use of French ===
The [[XVIth century]], that of the [[Renaissance]], is a decisive century for French since king [[François I of France]], through the [[Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts]] ([[1539]]), makes French the official language of administration in the whole kingdom.
Although troubled by the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Italian Wars]], the language is marked by intellectual, technical and scientific effervescence. It ushered in an era of prosperity that would also spread to England through French.

The XVIIth century announces the apogee of the Kingdom of France. This period was characterized by the political, literary and artistic prestige of France and the French language. Peace restored and unity ensured in the country, economy grew considerably. Personalities such as the King [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]], the [[Cardinal of Richelieu]] or the [[Sun King]] contribute to fixing and enhancing the French language in Europe, the Americas, India and Oceania.

The creation of the [[Académie française]] by Richelieu in 1635, under [[Louis XIII]], was a step that led to the standardization of French in continental Europe and abroad, including England. French is then the second language of all the elites in Europe, from Turkey to Ireland and from Moscow to Lisbon. The greatest scholars and intellectuals, writers and scientists, express themselves and correspond in this new standardised French. French is considered a perfect language, whose beauty and elegance are determined by the development of scientific logic, aided by dictionaries and grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/caief_0571-5865_1992_num_44_1_1775|title=Le Français face à l'anglais : aspects linguistiques|first=Michael D.|last=Picone|date=22 November 1992|publisher=|journal=Cahiers de l'Association internationale des études francaises|volume=44|issue=1|pages=9–23|doi=10.3406/caief.1992.1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the XXIst Century ==
The geographical use of French has continuously and greatly diversified in the last five hundred years, with countries and states like [[New-Brunswick]], [[Quebec]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Tchad]], [[Djibouti]], [[Senegal]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]] adopting it as their official language. This geographical diversity has led to many different contacts with [[vernacular]] dialects, regional and international languages, from which French has often been enriched locally.
In a number of countries and regions where French shares co-officiality with English (Cameroon, [[Canada]], [[Jersey]], [[Mauritius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113430/http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rwanda]], Vanuatu), particular lexical regionalisms are observed where French and English terms are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr/articles.php?pg=850|title=Avenir de la Langue Française (ALF) - Ile Maurice|first=|last=MAR|website=www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contribution of the French lexicon to English ==
Several elements must be observed.

* Sometimes, the English words' form has kept traces of Old French, written or oral, such as certain consonants (''forest'' / forest) or certain vowels or diphthongs (''veil'' / voil; ''leisure'' / leisure), the current French sometimes deviating more from its old form than the English (i.e. Old French ''ante'' gives "tante" in modern French and is written 'aunt' in modern English).
* Many English nouns, verbs and adjectives borrowed from Old French have not always kept the meaning they had in Old French. Sometimes, they have developed a different meaning from French. In both cases, these words are [[false friend]]s (''egre'' giving 'sour' (''aigre'') in French while mutating into 'eager' in English).
* Other English words are composed of both words of French and Germanic origins (''handkerchief'': ''hand'' is from the proto-Germanic ''k'''hand'''uz'' and ''kerchief'' is a mutation on the old French ''core chief'')
* Some forms of Old French did not survive in modern French, while they still exist in English (''soulace'',''conceler'',''estriver'',''gone'').
* It is not uncommon either for an English concept to have two or even three vocabulary words to describe it, one of French origin, a part from proto-Germanic and another of Latin origin (''royal'', ''kingly'', and ''regal'' all mean the same thing, 'royal').
* Most of the English words ending in ''-ous'', ''-ty'' (on the model of ''-té''),''-tion'', ''-ture'', ''-ture'', ''-ent'' are of French origin.
* Uses in social and intellectual life, but also certain domestic and food uses, demonstrate the omnipresence of French in English society in many fields, for example the names of meat: "beef" comes from the French ''buef'' (beef), "mutton" from ''moton'' (sheep), "pork" from ''pork'', "veal" from ''vel'' (calf).
* Some words borrowed in the XIXth and XXth centuries are still considered foreign words, French words (such as ''chic''). They are generally used by educated English people or by the press and other media and are seen as part of a distinguished language.
* Some [[Anglicisms]] are actually words that were borrowed from French a long time ago and have recently been borrowed back from English (such as ''bacon'').

The following French glossary in English is in no way exhaustive. These words come as examples to illustrate the countless French words that are part of the English language.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In this section, examples of French-to-English lexical contributions are classified by field and in chronological order. The periods during which these words were used in the English language are specified as much as possible. It is not always possible to state with certainty the precise period from which a word was borrowed or integrated.

The English word is on the left, with its current French equivalent in brackets, then comes its Old French origin in bold and the century of its introduction on the right.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1437">The '''Inter-University Program for Chinese Language Studies''' at [[Tsinghua University]] ({{zh|c= 清华IUP中文中心}}) is a prestigious [[Mandarin Chinese]] study center in [[Beijing]] associated with [[University of California, Berkeley]]. IUP started in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] in 1963 and was known as [[Stanford University|Stanford]] Center. In 1997 it moved to Beijing, following [[Mainland China]]'s [[Reform and opening]], and the original Stanford Center in Taipei was renamed the [[International Chinese Language Program]].

IUP currently offers a 32-week Academic Year Program, a 16-week Semester Option, and an 8-week Summer Intensive Program. All programs are located on its [[Tsinghua University]] campus in Beijing.

Classes sizes are very small: typically a class will involve 50-minutes of Chinese-only instruction with a professor and 2-3 students seated around a small table. A typical course load is 3-5 such classes a day from Monday to Friday, with about 4–6 hours of homework in the evenings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7382">The '''Interaction hypothesis''' is a [[second-language acquisition theories|theory]] of [[second-language acquisition]] which states that the development of [[language proficiency]] is promoted by [[face-to-face interaction]] and [[communication]].&lt;ref name="Johnson1999"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | editor1-last = Johnson | editor1-first = Keith | editor2-last = Johnson | editor2-first = Helen | title = Interaction Hypothesis | encyclopedia = Encyclopedic Dictionary of Applied Linguistics: A Handbook for Language Teaching | publisher = Blackwell Publishers | location = Oxford | year = 1999 | page = 174 | isbn = 978-0-631-22767-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea existed in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Long | first = Michael | chapter = Input and Second Language Acquisition Theory | pages = 377–393 | editor1-last = Gass | editor1-first = Susan | editor2-last = Madden | editor2-first = Carolyn | title = Input in second language acquisition | publisher = Newbury House | location = Rowley, Mass | year = 1985 | isbn = 978-0-88377-284-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ellis | first = Rod | title = Classroom Second Language Development: A Study of Classroom Interaction and Language Acquisition | publisher = Pergamon | location = Oxford, UK | year = 1984 | page = 95 | isbn = 978-0-08-031516-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but is usually credited to [[Michael Long (academic)|Michael Long]] for his 1996 paper ''The role of the linguistic environment in second language acquisition''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Long | first = Michael | chapter = The role of the linguistic environment in second language acquisition | pages = 413–468 | editor1-last = Ritchie | editor1-first = William | editor2-last = Bhatia | editor2-first = Tej | title = Handbook of second language acquisition | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-12-589042-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GassSelinker2008"&gt;{{cite book | title = Second Language Acquisition: An Introductory Course | last1 = Gass | first = Susan | last2 = Selinker | first2 = Larry | year = 2008 | page = 350 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-8058-5497-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two forms of the Interaction Hypothesis: the "strong" form and the "weak" form. The "strong" form is the position that the interaction itself contributes to language development. The "weak" form is the position that interaction is simply the way that learners find learning opportunities, whether or not they make productive use of them.&lt;ref name="Johnson1999" /&gt;

== Outline ==
Similar to [[Stephen Krashen|Krashen]]'s [[input hypothesis]], the interaction hypothesis claims that [[comprehensible input]] is important for language learning. In addition, it claims that the effectiveness of comprehensible input is greatly increased when learners have to negotiate for [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].&lt;ref name="Ellis1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ellis | first = Rod | title = Second Language Acquisition | publisher = Oxford University Press| series = Oxford Introductions to Language Study | location = Oxford, New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-19-437212-1 | pages = 47–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when there is a breakdown in communication which interlocutors attempt to overcome.&lt;ref name="RichardsSchmidt2002"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Interaction Hypothesis | editor1-last = Richards | editor1-first = Jack | editor2-last = Schmidt | editor2-first = Richard | encyclopedia = Longman dictionary of language teaching and applied linguistics | publisher = Longman | location = London New York | year = 2002 | page = 264 | isbn = 978-0-582-43825-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the participants in a [[conversation]] will say something that the other does not understand; the participants will then use various [[communicative strategies]] to help the interaction progress. The strategies used when negotiating meaning may include slowing down speech, speaking more deliberately, requests for clarification or repair of speech, or [[paraphrase]]s.&lt;ref name="Brown2000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = H Douglas | title = Principles of Language Learning and Teaching | publisher = Longman | location = White Plains, NY | year = 2000 | pages = 287–288 | isbn = 978-0-13-017816-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactions often result in learners receiving [[negative evidence]].&lt;ref name="RichardsSchmidt2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt; That is, if learners say something that their interlocutors do not understand, after negotiation the interlocutors may model the correct language form. In doing this, learners can receive [[feedback]] on their [[Speech production|production]] and on [[grammar]] that they have not yet mastered.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt; The process of interaction may also result in learners receiving more input from their interlocutors than they would otherwise.&lt;ref name="RichardsSchmidt2002" /&gt; Furthermore, if learners stop to clarify things that they do not understand, they may have more time to [[Speech perception|process]] the input they receive. This can lead to better understanding and possibly the acquisition of new language forms.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt; Finally, interactions may serve as a way of focusing learners' [[attention]] on a difference between their knowledge of the [[second language|target language]] and the reality of what they are hearing; it may also focus their attention on a part of the target language of which they are not yet aware.&lt;ref name="GassSelinker2008" /&gt;

== Primacy of interaction ==
Although there are several studies that link interaction with language acquisition,&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see {{cite book | title = Second Language Acquisition: An Introductory Course | last1 = Gass | first = Susan | last2 = Selinker | first2 = Larry | year = 2008 | pages = 353–355 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-8058-5497-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; not all researchers subscribe to the idea that interaction is the primary means by which language proficiency develops.&lt;ref name="Brown2000" /&gt; In a [[Literature review|survey of the literature]] on the subject, [[Diane Larsen-Freeman|Larsen-Freeman]] and Long say that interaction is not necessary for language acquisition; they do say, however, that it helps in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Larsen-Freeman | first1 = Diane | last2 = Long | first2 = Michael | title = An Introduction to Second Language Acquisition Research | publisher = Longman | location = London, New York | year = 1991 | pages = 143–144 | isbn = 978-0-582-55377-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gass and Selinker claim that as well as interaction facilitating learning, it may also function as a priming device, "setting the stage" for learning rather than being the means by which learning takes place.&lt;ref name="GassSelinker2008" /&gt; In addition, [[Rod Ellis|Ellis]] notes that interaction is not always positive. He says that sometimes it can make the input more complicated, or produce amounts of input which overwhelm learners. According to Ellis, this can happen if interlocutors use lengthy paraphrases or give complex [[definition]]s of a word that was not understood, and he comes to the conclusion that the role of interaction in language acquisition is a complex one.&lt;ref name="Ellis1997" /&gt;

[[File:In Flanders Fields (1921) intro 1.png|thumb|First page, introduction to ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'']]
In an [[essay]], [[Article (publishing)|article]], or [[book]], an '''introduction''' (also known as a '''prolegomenon''') is a beginning section which states the purpose and goals of the following writing.  This is generally followed by the body and conclusion.

The introduction typically describes the scope of the document and gives the brief explanation or summary of the document. It may also explain certain elements that are important to the essay if explanations are not part of the main text. The readers can have an idea about the following text before they actually start reading it.

ln [[technical writing]], the introduction typically includes one or more standard subsections: [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] or summary, [[preface]], acknowledgments, and [[foreword]]. Alternatively, the section labeled ''introduction'' itself may be a brief section found side-by-side with abstract, foreword, etc. (rather than containing them). In this case the set of sections that come before the body of the book are known as the '''front matter'''. When the book is divided into numbered chapters, by convention the introduction and any other front-matter sections are unnumbered and precede chapter 1.

Keeping the concept of the introduction the same, different documents have different styles to introduce the written text. For example, the introduction of a Functional Specification consists of information that the whole document is yet to explain. If a Userguide is written, the introduction is about the product. In a report, the introduction gives a summary about the report contents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28418">[[Ku Klux Klan]] nomenclature has evolved over the order's nearly 160 years of existence. The titles and designations were first laid out in the original Klan's prescripts of 1867 and 1868, then revamped with [[William Joseph Simmons|William J. Simmons]]' [[Kloran]] of 1916. Subsequent Klans have made various modifications.

== Reconstruction period ==

The sources of the rituals, titles and even the name of the original KKK may be found in antebellum [[College fraternity|college fraternities]] and [[Collegiate secret societies in North America|secret societies]] such as the [[Kuklos Adelphon]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing Inc. 1991, p.338&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lester (disambiguation)|John Lester]], one of the original members of the group, stated that the Klan rituals were "modeled on and embraced the leading features of the rituals of an order which has long been popular in many colleges and universities under various names" such as the [[Sons of Confucius]] or [[Guiasticutus]] but always styled '''Ancient and Honorable''' and '''Mirth-Provoking'''. [[Walter L. Fleming]] stated in a footnote to Lester's text that the contemporary (early twentieth century) Southern college fraternity that most nearly mirrored the early Klan was [[Alpha Sigma Sigma]] and the institution of [[snipe hunt]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lester|Lester, John C.]], ''Ku Klux Klan: Its Origin, Growth and Disbandment'' [[Walter L. Fleming]] ed. New York; Neale Publishing Company, 1905. Texts of the first and second prescript as Appendices I and II p.60&lt;/ref&gt;
The original prescript of the Ku Klux Klan was adopted by a convention in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] in April 1867. A slightly revised edition appeared the next year.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, Texts of the first and second prescript as Appendices I and II pp.133-176&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher levels ===
In both prescripts there were four levels or "departments" of organization, above the basic level:

*'''Empire''' – constituting the whole area of the Klan's activities. This was led by the '''[[Grand Wizard]]''' and his staff of ten '''Genii''', as well as a '''Grand Exchequer''' (treasurer) and '''Grand Scribe''', whose duty was to keep lists of the subordinate officers. The Genii, Imperial Exchequer and Scribe were appointed by the Imperial Wizard.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136–37, 157–58&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Realms''' – while the role of Realms was laid out in the first prescript they were only identified as [[US states|states]] in the second. Realms were ruled by a '''Grand Dragon''' assisted by eight '''Hydras''', as well as a Grand Exchequer and Grand Scribe, whose duties were identical to the above officers on the imperial level. All officers were appointed by the Grand Dragon.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 138, 155–56, 158–159. The states making up the "empire" were [[Maryland]], [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], [[Texas]], [[Arkansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Dominions''' – identified in the second prescript as "coterminous with such counties as the Grand Dragons of the several Realms shall assign" and "not to exceed three in number for each [[List of United States congressional districts|Congressional district]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.156, 158&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion was headed by a '''Great Titan''' assisted by six '''Furies''', a Great Exchequer and a Great Scribe, appointed by the Great Titan.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 138–39, 158, 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Provinces''' – the second prescript identified the Provinces as equivalent to a [[Counties of the United States|county]]. It was supervised by a '''Grand Giant''', assisted by four '''Goblins''', a Grand Exchequer, and a Grand Scribe, appointed by the Grand Giant.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.160&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first prescript each officer is given the power to appoint Deputies to organize Realms, Dominions, Provinces and Dens until the latter can elect their own officers.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.137–140&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Wizard was to be elected by a majority of Grand Dragons, and each lower level was elected by a majority of the next lower level of officers (Dragons elected by Titans, Titans by Giants etc.), as soon as three units had been formed at each level (three Dominions within a Realm for Grand Dragon, three Provinces within a Dominion for Grand Titan etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143–144&lt;/ref&gt; In the second prescript each officer appoints the lower officer with the approval of his superior.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.136, 141, 158, 159–160&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dens ===

The '''Dens''' were the basic level of organization for the Reconstruction Klan.&lt;ref&gt;Michael and Judy Ann Newton eds. ''The Ku Klux Klan; an encyclopedia'' Garland Reference Library of the Social Science Vol.499 London and New York; Garland Publishing Inc. 1991 p.160&lt;/ref&gt; In the original prescript, its chief officer was the '''Grand Cyclops''', who appointed two '''Nighthawks''', a '''Grand Turk''', a '''Grand Sentinel, Grand Magi''' and a '''Grand Ensign''' in addition to his Grand Scribe.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Cyclops, Grand Exchequer, '''Grand Magi''' (second officer) and '''Grand Monk''' (third officer) were elected by the body politic of the dens, identified as '''Ghouls'''&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.141-3&lt;/ref&gt; In the second prescript the Grand Ensign is dispensed with, while the Grand Exchequer was appointed by the Grand Cyclops, who was now appointed by the Grand Giant. Only the Grand Magi and Grand Monk were elected by the Ghouls.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.160-1, 165-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact function of these officers and the meaning of the titles varied. The two Nighthawks have been identified as couriers.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.428&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Sentinel was in charge of the "'''Grand Guard'''", an organization which is not otherwise elaborated upon in the prescripts, but apparently served as the Den's security detail.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143, 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Turk was the den's "[[executive officer]]" and was charged with informing Klansmen of "all informal or irregular meetings" and helping the Grand Cyclops and the Grand Magi maintain the "control and government" of the Den.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.142, 163&lt;/ref&gt; The Grand Ensigns job was to take care of the Klan's flag.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.143&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Initiation rites ===
The organ for initiation into the Klan was called the '''Investigating Committee''', composed of the Grand Cyclops, Grand Magi and Grand Monk. Upon the nomination of a new member by a current member, the committee would investigate the candidate's "antecedents and his past and present standings and connections" and would then pronounce the candidate "competent and worthy" to become a member. The Grand Turk would escort the candidate to an "outpost" where he would question him and administer a preliminary [[oath]]. After this the Grand Turk would conduct the candidate to the Den, where the Grand Cyclops would administer the final oath.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.140-1, 142, 146-7&lt;/ref&gt; The second prescript elaborates that the candidate must have his left hand on the [[Bible]] and his right hand toward heaven and includes a ten-point "interrogation" that the candidate must answer satisfactorily in order to proceed with the final oath. The questions asked included: are you now or have ever been a member of the [[Radical Republicans|Radical Republican Party]], [[Loyal Leagues]] or [[Grand Army of the Republic]]? Did you fight with the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]? Do you believe in [[racial equality|Negro equality]]? among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.171-2&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tribunals ===
A system of "judiciary" organs was created in each prescript. In the first the judiciary was divided into a '''Grand Council of Yahoos''', to try officers of the Klan, and a '''Grand Council of Centaurs''' to try regular Ghouls. In Art.IV Sec.4, the Grand Giant is charged with conducting the Council of Yahoo, but Art.VI Sec.2 states that the Council will be composed of officers of the equivalent rank as the accused and presided over by an officer of the next higher rank. A trial of the Grand Wizard would be held by a meeting of all the Grand Dragons, the most senior Grand Dragon presiding&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.140, 144&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear if these tribunals were ever functional.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.139&lt;/ref&gt;

The second prescript presented an entirely different judiciary, with officers of the first three levels tried by three judges, appointed by the chief officer of the given jurisdiction, and the officers and attaches of the headquarters (presumably the Genii, Hydras, and Furies). Trials of Den officers would be conducted at the provincial headquarters and include five judges, and ordinary ghouls to be tried at their dens with seven judges. As before a trial of the Grand Wizard would be conducted by the most senior Grand Dragon, this time with a quorum of seven dragons. All defendants had the right of appeal to the next higher court, and the proceeding was to be governed as "ordinary [[Court-martial|court martials]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lester, pp.16-8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miscellaneous ===
In addition to the structure outlined above, there are documented cases of organs of slightly different nomenclature from Reconstruction. For instance, a group of twenty men who were arrested on April 6, 1868, at their "den" at the corners of [[Beale Street]] and Hernando street in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], was called the '''Supreme Cyclopean Council'''. The constitution that the police captured outlined an organization with a Grand Cyclops, Vice-Grand Cyclops, and Secretary and openly advocated assassination of the "murders and robbers" now ruling the South. Members were bound to participate in the activities of the order, even if it meant leaving the "embraces" of their wife.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.348&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Henry Townsend]] ''The Handbook of the year'' London: Wyman &amp; Sons, 1868 p.293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Allen Trelease]] ''White terror: the Ku Klux Klan conspiracy and Southern Reconstruction'' Greenwood Press, 1979 p.37&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The complete constitution, which identifies the group as part of the KKK was printed in [http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85038521/1868-04-09/ed-1/seq-1/ Nashville union and dispatch. Vol XXXIV #105 April 09, 1868]&lt;/ref&gt; A '''Grand Klan''', composed of delegates from [[Spartanburg County, South Carolina|Spartanburg]], [[York County, South Carolina|York]], [[Union County, South Carolina|Union]], and [[Chester County, South Carolina|Chester]] counties in South Carolina and a few from North Carolina met in [[Spartanburg, South Carolina]] and declared that no more raids or whippings would be conducted by members of the Klan except by their order and that the penalty for violating this order would be 100 lashes for the first offense and death for the second.&lt;ref&gt;''Report of the Joint Select Committee Appointed to Inquire Into the Condition of Affairs in the Late Insurrectionary States, So Far as Regards the Execution of Laws, and the Safety of the Lives and Property of the Citizens of the United States and Testimony Taken: Report of the Joint committee, Views of the minority and Journal of the Select committee, April 20, 1871-Feb. 19, 1872'' Washington; GPO 1872 p.48&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt was apparently made to make Ghoul titles for other officers in [[Maury County, Tennessee]] in 1867 and early 1868, but the result was only confusion. Additionally a "'''Grand Tycoon'''" notified Klansmen in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]] to cease night riding and the order was apparently effective in restoring calm to [[Wilson County, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.236-7&lt;/ref&gt; In some early reconstruction Klan units there was also a '''Lictor''', whose role as a guard of the den was later subsumed by the Nighthawks.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.348&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second Era ==
The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. which existed from 1915 to 1944, elaborated on the original prescript in its Kloran and in the constitution and by-laws adopted in 1922. Some titles and jurisdictional designations were carried over from the Reconstruction prescripts intact or slightly modified, and others were original with Imperial Wizard Simmons.

=== Jurisdictions ===
*'''Invisible Empire''' – this designation included both the Klans geographical domain – up to "the whole world" - but also in a "spiritual sense" all the secrets and workings of the order. All things outside this empire were designated the '''Alien World''' and non-members '''Aliens'''.&lt;ref&gt;Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc ''[http://archive.lib.msu.edu/DMC/AmRad/constitutionlawsknights.pdf Constitution and Laws of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc]'' Atlanta, Ga; Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc 1921 [pref. Nov. 1922] pp.12-4&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan was a military organization and its [[commander in chief]] was the '''Imperial Wizard''', whose power was supreme "within the limits of this Constitution" and whose edicts, decisions and rulings were binding on all members of the order.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.9&lt;/ref&gt; He had a staff of '''Fifteen Genii'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.23&lt;/ref&gt; The Empire had an assembly or convention known as a '''Klonvokation'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.12&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Realm''' – was carried over from the Reconstruction prescript, but it was no longer restricted to the [[Southern United States|Southern States]]; any state or territory of the United States could become a Realm, and Realms were also given a number based on the date of organization of the Realm. The convention of the Realm was designated the '''Klorero'''&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The president of the Realm remained the Grand Dragon; the other officers were collectively known as the '''Nine Hydras'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.45&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Province''' – in the new Klan, a Province was construed as "a county or number of counties" designated by the Grand Dragon. There were a maximum of six provinces per realm, but the Grand Dragon could create more with the permission of the Imperial Wizard. The Provincial convention was the '''Klonverse'''. The chief officer of a Province was a '''Great Titan''', and the other officers were known as the '''Seven Furies'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.13, 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klan''' – the basic unit of the Second Era KKK was known simply as a Klan. Its area of jurisdiction was a '''Klanton''' which was defined as "extend[ing] in all directions to a distance midway between the location of the Klan and the nearest Klan thereto" unless otherwise directed by the Grand Dragon or Imperial Wizard. The chief officer of a Klan was an '''Exalted Cyclops''' and the subordinate officers were known as the '''Twelve Terrors'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.13–14, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Officials ===
There was a nearly identical set of subordinate officers at each level:&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.22–23, 59&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klaliff''' – [[vice president]]
*'''Klokard''' – [[lecturer]]
*'''Kludd''' – [[chaplain]]
*'''Kligrapp''' – [[secretary]]
*'''Klabee''' – [[treasurer]]
*'''Kladd''' – "conductor", in charge of initiating new members
*'''Klarogo''' – inner guard, [[serjeant-at-arms]]
*'''Klexter''' – outer guard
*'''Nighthawks''' – couriers

The officers at each level above the local Klan unit were designated by a unique prefix: '''Imperial''' at the Empire level; '''Grand''' at the Realm level; and '''Great''' at the Province level. Thus, for instance, an Imperial Kludd would be the chaplain for the whole organization, a Grand Kludd for the Realm, Great Kludd for a Province and simply Kludd for a local Klan.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.23, 46, 48, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all offices were reproduced at each level. The Kladd, Klarogo, Klexter, and Klokard were not present at the Province level, and the Kladd was not included on the Realm level.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.48, 59&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Klazik''', second vice-president, and '''Klonsul''', attorney, positions only existed at the Imperial level.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.29, 32&lt;/ref&gt; The Klazik's duties included being head of the department of Realms and organizing new Realms and Provinces&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.45–48,&lt;/ref&gt; At the Province level there were three Klaliffs that served as an advisory board. A '''Klokann''' of three members, each one named a '''Klokan''', filled this role at the local levels and a Klokann of four members at the Imperial level, in which they served as a "Supreme Board of Auditors and Special Advisers and was led by a Chief Imperial Klokan.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.23, 33, 59&lt;/ref&gt;

The Imperial Wizards Genii constituted his '''Imperial Kloncilium'''; this was the Imperial Wizards supreme [[advisory board]], as well as the Klans highest administrative organ in between Klonvokations. It met regularly every July, but could also be called when the Imperial Wizard or five Geniis petitioned him to do so. The Kloncilium was also the Supreme Tribunal of Justice of the organization with [[appellate jurisdiction]] and the right to finally determine disputes between Realms, Provinces, Klans and members in unorganized states&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giant''' was adopted as an [[emeritus]] title: Imperial Giant for an ex-Imperial Wizard, Grand Giant for an ex-Grand Dragon, Great Giant for ex-Great Titan and Klan Giant for an ex-Exalted Cyclops.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.35&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[Kleagle]]''' was a recruiter and was responsible for organizing local Klans.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.33-35&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-1944 ==

Since the dissolution of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc. in 1944, there have been many Klan groups. Details of the nomenclature have varied, somewhat, among the different groups, but some terms have had more currency than others. Over time, the term '''klavern''' replaced klan for local groups.&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.322"&gt;Newton and Newton, p.322&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial Wizard and Grand Dragon have still been generally used for the leader of a Klan organization and for state (realm) leaders. Exceptions included cases of one state Klans, such as the [[Association of Georgia Klans]], whose leader [[Dr. Samuel Green]], kept the title Grand Dragon until shortly before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.238&lt;/ref&gt; The [[White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] created some innovations in their organization including a bicameral '''Klongress''' with an [[upper house]] Klonvokation and [[Lower house|lower]] '''Klanburgess'''.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.321-2&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s [[David Duke]]'s [[Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] dropped the Imperial Wizard title, and the leader was called national director.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; That organization, now known as the Knights Party, no longer uses most of the traditional Klan titles, and the only fraternal titles used are '''Page''', '''Squire''' and '''Knight''' for levels of membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kkk.bz/main/?page_id=43 Structure]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vocabulary ==
Aside from titles and geographical designations, a distinctive vocabulary has grown around the Ku Klux Klan organizations. These include names for rituals, code words, and practices of the various Klans.

*'''Klankraft''' or '''Klanishness''' – the overall practice and state of being a Klan member. This could be defined as the employment and patronizing of fellow Klansmen, as well as sale of official Klan memorabilia, such as T-shirts, watches and belt buckles.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.321&lt;/ref&gt; Imperial Wizard [[Robert Shelton (Ku Klux Klan)|Robert Shelton]] gave this definition "...robes, cross lightings and parades, the mysticism, everything that made the Klan the Klan".&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League ''Danger: Extremism; the major voices and vehicles on America far right fringe'' New York; Anti-Defamation League 1996 p.251&lt;/ref&gt; Other definitions included maintaining the sanctity of one's home, maintenance of white supremacy and purity, and loyalty to the Klan itself.&lt;ref&gt;Knights of the Ku Klux Klan ''The Practice of Klanishness'' 1924 p.6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Membership ===
There are terms related to membership and non-membership:&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League pp.392-3&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Alien''' – a non-member
*'''Naturalization''' – the Klan [[Initiation rites|initiation ceremony]]
*'''Citizen''' – a Klan member
*'''Passport''' – [[membership card]]
*'''Banished''' – expelled from the Klan
*'''Yellow dog''' – a [[hazing]] ritual similar to the type used in [[Hazing in Greek letter organizations|college fraternities]]; when practiced by imperial officers, called the '''Royal Order of the Purple Dog'''.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.627&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Groups ===
Groups of Klansmen commissioned for "special activities"
*'''Wrecking Crew''' – an action squad commissioned to take physical action against enemies and wayward members of the Klan. Depending on time and organization, these groups consisted of 5 to 8 members and were authorized either by the klokann, the Exalted Cyclops and/or the Kludd. Sometimes led by the Nighthawk. An action taken by the crew is '''wrecked'''. Some names used by wrecking crews include "Secret Six", "Ass-tear Squad" and "Holy terrors".&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.623&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Defamation League p.393&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Klan Bureau of Investigation''' – Pioneered by the Mississippi White Knights, these groups investigate the Klans enemies and check leaks.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.228&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Anti-Defamation League p.292"&gt;Anti-Defamation League p.292&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Degree teams''' – a group which performs the task of initiation.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.158&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finances ===
*'''Klectoken''' or '''Klecktokon''' – initiation fee. It stabilized around $10 before the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Newton and Newton, p.322"/&gt;
*'''Imperial tax''' – membership dues&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, p.285&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Provincial tax''' – secondary dues, paid per capita for the upkeep of a Realm.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.48-9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Code words and phrases ===
*'''A.Y.A.K.''' or '''Ayak''' – "Are you a Klansman?" to be answered with below.
*'''A.K.I.A.''' or '''Akia''' – "A Klansman I am"; these were code words for Klansmen meeting in strange surroundings. They would be inserted into common conversation, for instance "Does a Mr. Ayak live in this neighborhood?" to be responded by "No, but a Mr. Akia does." The password would then be accompanied by a [[secret handshake]] or other sign of recognition.&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.292"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Newton, pp.30-1&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''K.I.G.Y''' or '''Kigy''' – "Klansman, I greet you"&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.292"/&gt;&lt;ref name="splcenter1"&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/ku-klux-klan Ku Klux Klan]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''S.A.N.B.O.G.''' or '''Sanbog''' – "Strangers are near, be on guard"&lt;ref name="splcenter1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.293"&gt;Anti-Defamation League p.293&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Itsub''' – "In the sacred unfailing bond", a [[Sign-off|correspondence sign-off]]&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.292"/&gt;
*'''Sor''' – "Sign of recognition.&lt;ref name="Anti-Defamation League p.293"/&gt;
*'''K.L.A.S.P.''' – "Klannish loyalty a sacred principle"&lt;ref name="splcenter1" /&gt;
*'''C.A.B.A.R.K.''' – "Constantly Applied By All Real Klansmen"&lt;ref name="splcenter1" /&gt;
*'''O.R.I.O.N''' – Our Race Is Our Nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/hate_symbols/ORION.asp |title=A Visual Database of Extremist Symbols, Logos and Tattoos |publisher=Archive.adl.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''L.O.T.I.E''' or '''LOTIE''' – Lady Of The Invisible Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Axelrod]] ''International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders'' New York; Facts on File, inc 1997 p.144. This was one of a number of names for Klan women's auxiliaries&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dates and times ===

Two KKK codes for dates and times have been developed, the '''Ku Klux Register''' in the original prescripts and the '''Kalender''' developed by William J. Simmons.

==== Ku Klux Register ====

In the original prescripts the register contained twelve designations, thought to correspond to months:&lt;ref name=" Newton and Newton, p.337"&gt;Newton and Newton, p.337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lester, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;

Years were reckoned according to '''reigns''' and '''cycles'''. The '''Reign of Incarnation and Incantation''' was all time up to the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The '''First Reign of our Incarnation and Incantation''' was the period between the Revolution and the establishment of the original Klan, which was reckoned to May 6, 1866 in this scheme. The '''Reign of our Second Incarnation and Incantation''' was reckoned between 1866 and Grand Wizard [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]'s dissolution of the Klan, which is reckoned to 1872. The '''Reign of our Third Incarnation and Incantation''' began in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' pp.88, 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; The Klan year, '''Anno Klanslar''', began in March of each year, and the cycle was reckoned from December of each calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution'' p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

In Singapore, [[language planning]] is associated with government planning. In this top-down approach, the government influences the acquisition of languages and their respective functions within the [[speech community]] through the education system.&lt;ref name= Kaplan&gt;Kaplan B., Robert, and Richard B. Baldauf Jr. ''Language Planning from Practice to Theory.''  Clevedon: Multilingual Matters ltd., 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Language planning aims to facilitate effective communication within the speech community, which can result in a language shift or language assimilation.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias&gt;Cobarrubias, Juan.  "Ethical Issues in Status Planning."  ''Progress in Language Planning: International Perspectives''.  Eds.  Juan Cobarrubias and Joshua Fishman.  New York: Mouton Publishers, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of language planning are very much dependent on the political and social forces present in Singapore during two distinct periods: [[Colonization|Colonisation]] by the British and the Post-Independence period after 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Spolsky, B. (2004). Language policy. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Singapore is a linguistically and ethnically diverse country with a population of about 5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.google.com.sg/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;met_y=sp_pop_totl&amp;idim=country:SGP&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=population+of+singapore, | title=World Development Indicators - Google Public Data Explorer | website=www.google.com.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially, its ethnic composition is approximately 76.8% Chinese, 13.9% Malay, 7.9% Indian, while the remaining 1.4% are mainly Others, a miscellaneous category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;hid=120&amp;sid=7e115396-984a-4c45-9480-7bb44b801cc1%40sessionmgr11, 'Burdens' and 'handicaps' in Singapore Language Policy: on the limits of language management', p. 98] {{Dead link|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this diversity, the [[language policy]] in Singapore aims at cultivating amongst its citizens a bilingual proficiency in the English language and a mother tongue that is officially assigned to the specific ethnic communities.

Although the English language is excluded from the list of official mother tongues (Mandarin, Bahasa Melayu, Tamil), it is still recognised as an [[official language]] for practical reasons such as ensuring socio-economic mobility. This is because the ethnically neutral status of English helps to ensure that the distribution of economic advantages is not seen as unduly privileging or benefiting a specific ethnic group, which would otherwise raise the danger of inter-ethnic tension. Additionally, the English language represents the idea of 'modernity' and its association with progress, science, technology and capitalism.&lt;ref name=Pakir&gt;Pakir, A. (1997), 'Education and Invisible Language Planning: The Case of the English Language in Singapore', in Tan, Gopinathan and Ho, pp. 57–74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations of Language Policies==
After [[political independence]] in 1959, the Singapore Government officially accepted Malay as the [[national Language]] of Singapore. However, its importance gradually declined as a result of the social, political and economic developments that had taken place. When vernacular schools were closed in 1987, the Ministry of Education implemented the National System of Education.&lt;ref name=Mohamed&gt;Mohamed, S. (2005) Planning for Malay Language in Education. Centre for Research in Pedagogy and Practice. Nanyang Institute of Education,Singapore.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bilingual Policy encourages Singaporeans to be proficient in both the English language, and in their respective ethnic [[mother tongues]], which include Chinese [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]], and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. [[Bilingual education]] is provided by the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]] in Singapore.

The Bilingual Policy also aims to promote better understanding amongst the three ethnic groups in line with the effort of [[nation building]]. Additionally, there was also the growing concern that Singapore was facing increasing Western influences, effecting a potential threat of the de-Asianisation or de-culturalisation of the people. Due to the increasing importance of English as an international language, many Singaporeans have started to pay more attention to the learning of the English language and focus less on the learning of their own mother tongue. The Bilingual Policy was then enacted to safeguard Asian identities and values. Alongside English, the [[Singapore Government]] aims to promote Mandarin Chinese, Malay and Tamil so as to prevent the erosion of culture and heritage of the three ethnic groups&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt;

Racial harmony is a stated policy of the [[government of Singapore|Singaporean government]], and a [[racial harmony day]] is even celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sam11.moe.gov.sg/racialharmony/index.htm |title=Welcome to the MOE Racial Harmony Website |last= |first= |date= |year=2010 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |accessdate=2013-06-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126120920/http://www.racialharmony.edu.sg/cos/o.x?c=%2Frhd%2Fpagetree&amp;func=view&amp;rid=4921 |archivedate=26 November 2010 |author=Ministry of Education, Singapore |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usage of four official languages is an element of policy designed to promote racial harmony, as is [[bilingual]]ism in accordance with the belief that the ethnic language is the "carrier of culture" while English is the "language of commerce", a choice motivated by the fact that English had historically been the language of the colonial administration, while being the native language of few Singaporeans at the time of the policy's implementation.&lt;ref name="clammer"&gt;{{cite book | title = Race and State in Independent Singapore 1965-1990 | last = Clammer | first = John | publisher = Ashgate | year = 1998 | isbn = 978-1-84014-029-3 | location=Brookfield | pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; With English as the [[lingua franca]], no one ethnicity is favored, but the cultures are preserved. The idea behind this policy is that treating all languages as standard and thus equally prestigious will result in the speakers of each language being treated equally.&lt;ref name="vasil"&gt;{{cite book | title = Asianing Singapore: The PAP's Management of Ethnicity | last = Vasil | first = Raj | publisher = Heinemann Asia | year =1995 |isbn=| location = Singapore | pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Singaporean government promotes [[Standard Singapore English]] as a ''lingua franca'', it heavily discourages the usage of [[Singlish]], a Chinese- and Malay-influenced, [[English-based creole language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nbu.bg/PUBLIC/IMAGES/File/departamenti/4ujdi%20ezitsi%20i%20literaturi/Doklad_Adrien_2.pdf |title=Chinese-based lexicon in Singapore English, and Singapore-Chinese culture |first=Adrian |last=Tien |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127055450/http://nbu.bg/PUBLIC/IMAGES/File/departamenti/4ujdi%20ezitsi%20i%20literaturi/Doklad_Adrien_2.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/events/lingo/papers/jakob.leimgruber.pdf |title=From Post-Creole Continuum to Diglossia: The Case of Singapore English |first=Jakob  |last=Leimgruber |publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; widely spoken by Singaporeans, but virtually unintelligible to foreign speakers of English. Governments including those of [[Lee Hsien Loong]], [[Lee Kuan Yew]], and [[Goh Chok Tong]] have campaigned against the usage of Singlish,&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (2007) ''Singapore English'', Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt; declaring it an obstacle to communication with the rest of the English-speaking world, and a substandard, "broken English",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90830afp.htm Singapore to launch Speak-good-English campaign] – Agence France Presse in Singapore, 30 August 1999.

Y. Ooi (ed.), ''Evolving Identities: The English Language in Singapore and Malaysia'', Singapore: Times Academic Press, pp. 12-32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, David (1998) 'Approaches to Diglossia in the Classroom: The Middle Way. REACT, 2, 18-23.' [http://videoweb.nie.edu.sg/phonetic/papers/diglossia.html (on-line version)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Media Development Authority]], a statutory board of the government, urges Singaporean mass media to use as little Singlish as possible, declaring it appropriate only for "interviews, where the interviewee speaks only Singlish".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mda.gov.sg/wms.file/mobj/mobj.612.fta_tv_prog_code.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these policies, however, the usage of Singlish outside formal, institutional contexts remains widespread.

The Singaporean government also promotes a single, standardized form of Chinese, discouraging the usage of dialects. While the [[Chinese Singaporean|Chinese community of Singapore]] historically spoke several [[varieties of Chinese]], most of them [[mutually unintelligible]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091016073611/http%3A//www3.telus.net/linguisticsissues/singapore.html 'A Critical Evaluation of Singapore's Language Policy and its Implications for English Teaching by Manfred Wu Man-Fat, Hong Kong.'] Retrieved on 4 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bokhorst-Heng, W.D.

Singapore: Singapore University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Cantonese]], [[Teochew Chinese|Teochew]], and [[Hokkien]], the government has promoted [[Standard Mandarin]], both as a means of unifying Chinese Singaporeans under a common language, and to facilitate communication with Chinese people from outside Singapore. Since 1979, the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] has promoted use of Mandarin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Language Ideology===
There were two prominent [[language ideology|language ideologies]] that the Singapore government adopted:

* '''Internationalization'''
** It entails the adoption of a non-[[indigenous language]] as an [[official language]]. The Singapore government adopted a non-indigenous language, English, to exist alongside the indigenous languages of Singapore.
* '''Linguistic Pluralism'''
** It entails a recognition and support of the co-existence of multiple languages within society.
** Some believe it to be in contrast with the language ideology of [[Language shift|linguistic assimilation]], where every member of the [[speech community]], regardless of his [[first language]], must learn the dominant language of the society where he lives in.&lt;ref name=Cobarrubias /&gt;

After independence, the Singapore government gave English Language, Mandarin Chinese, Malay Language and Tamil Language shared official status.&lt;ref name="Cobarrubias"/&gt;

The Singapore government attempts to shun away from linguistic assimilation, as it believes it must acknowledge the need to embrace the co-existence of the four official languages in the context of a [[multi-racial]] Singapore.

==Status Planning==
'''Status Planning''' suggests that a particular language or variety may be chosen for specific purposes and given official status. This may result in a [[language policy]] which is a product of [[language planning]], and can be comprehended within the discourse of [[language politics]] and society, or the more informal but powerful political and social aspects of language planning. In this view, one can argue that language status planning issues are related to political issues as status planning focuses on legislative decisions that affect the reallocation of language functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bibliotecavirtualut.suagm.edu/Glossa/Journal/jun2007/Language%20Planning,%20Policy%20and%20Implementation%20in%20South%20Africa.pdf,|title='Language Policy, Planning and Implementation in South Africa', p. 5|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language status can also mean the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.&lt;ref name=Edwards&gt;Edwards, John. "Language, Prestige, and Stigma." ''Contact Linguistics''. Ed. Hans Goebel. New York: de Gruyter, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Singapore Government]] recognises the importance of the English language for a multi-racial society and therefore it has been attributed the status of an [[official language]] and a de facto [[national language]]. The government has been active in promoting [[status planning]] in Singapore. One of the most distinct changes in the linguistic landscape of Singapore after independence was promoting the status of the English language. This is done by allocating resources to develop English in various functional domains such as the government, law, business, administration, and in particular, the medium of instruction in schools—even though time is allocated for the learning of Mother tongue languages.

English is the international [[lingua franca]], it was no longer viewed as a colonial language but rather an [[World language|international language]] permitting universal communication. The economic rewards of being proficient in English was emphasised upon perpetuating the mindset that English is the superior language in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Yip, J. S. K., Eng, S. P. and Yap, J. Y. C. (1997), '25 Years of Education Reform', in Tan, Gopinathan and Ho, pp. 3–32&lt;/ref&gt; Besides government administrative domains where English is widely practised, English has gradually been inculcated into social, family and individual habitats as well. Despite the government's attempt to maintain symbolic and cultural capital in the [[Mother tongues]], English has been deeply integrated into the local linguistic landscape of Singapore.&lt;ref name=Silver&gt;Silver, R. E. (2005). The discourse of linguistic capital: Language and economic policy planning in Singapore. Language Policy, 4(1), 47–66&lt;/ref&gt;

It is evident that English has acquired a significant role in the linguistic landscape of Singapore, as Singapore is the only (non-native speaker) country which has adopted English as a working language, short of Singapore, no other country has channelled its language policies into churning out a population that is bi-literate in English and another official language.&lt;ref name=Pakir /&gt;

===Speak Good English Movement (SGEM)===
{{Main|Speak Good English Movement}}

The '''Speak Good English Movement''' is a government-initiated campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90830afp.htm,|title='Singapore to launch speak-good English campaign'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims "to encourage Singaporeans to speak grammatically correct English that is universally understood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodenglish.org.sg/category/movement/about-us |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401182533/http://www.goodenglish.org.sg/category/movement/about-us |archivedate=1 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Speak Good English Movement website&lt;/ref&gt;

The Singapore government sees [[Singlish]] as a variety whose increasing popularity might threaten the ability of [[Singaporeans]] to acquire competence in 'good' English. The latter is prized as a linguistic resource in a world of global economic competition, and the government fears that the presence of Singlish might actually undermine English language proficiency. This led the government, in 2000, to initiate the Speak Good English Movement (SGEM).&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;hid=120&amp;sid=7e115396-984a-4c45-9480-7bb44b801cc1%40sessionmgr11,|title='Burdens' and 'handicaps' in Singapore Language Policy: on the limits of language management', p. 99|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 1999, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported [[Lee Kuan Yew]], Singapore's first Prime Minister, commented on Singlish as a 'handicap':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Those Singaporeans who can speak good English should help to create a good environment for speaking English, rather than advocate, as some do, the use of Singlish… Singlish is a handicap we must not wish on Singaporeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;hid=120&amp;sid=7e115396-984a-4c45-9480-7bb44b801cc1%40sessionmgr11,|title='Burdens' and 'handicaps' in Singapore Language Policy: on the limits of language management', p. 102|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Controversy of the campaign====
While the Speak Good English Movement has seen progress through its engagement via radio shows, on television programmes, and in giving out the 'Inspiring Teacher of English' award,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodenglish.org.sg/|title=Speak Good English Movement|website=www.goodenglish.org.sg}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has controversy as well. Despite the government's label of Singlish as a 'handicap', the latter endorsed the usage of Singlish on more than one occasion.

=====SARS crisis=====
When the [[SARS]] crisis broke out in 2003, the Singapore government commissioned a SARS rap song (sometimes known as the "SAR-vivor Rap") to emphasise the importance of proper hygiene.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; The lyrics of the SARS rap song are heavily [[Singlish]], containing terms such as "lah", "leh", and "kiasu".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smartlyrics.com/Song562033-Phua-Chu-Kang-Sarvivor-Rap-lyrics.aspx] SARS RAP Lyrics&lt;/ref&gt;

To answer its contradictory stance, the Singapore government provided a rationale that "Singlish was considered necessary in order to communicate with less-educated Singaporeans".&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

=====Singapore Day=====
[[Singapore Day]] is a cultural-cum-[[cuisine]]-based event organised by the Prime Minister's Office Overseas Singaporean Unit. It is aimed at engaging Singaporeans residing overseas. It is held in different cities with a significant community of overseas Singaporeans.

According to a report by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 26 April 2009, the event made occasional use of [[Singlish]], such as the lexical item 'chope', which is used to indicate the reservation of a seat.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; The intended audience there is not the 'less-educated', since most of the overseas Singaporeans are working professionals or university students pursuing a degree abroad.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

==Acquisition Planning==
'''Acquisition Planning''' can be defined as the co-ordination of the [[language planning]] goals of the official parties involved in the implementation and integration of a language policy to ensure its timely and cost effective acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/acquisition-planning.html|title=What is acquisition planning? definition and meaning|website=BusinessDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Singapore, the government has sole control over the acquisition planning of language. This form of [[language planning]] is often done in line with [[status planning]]. The government aims to influence aspects of the language, status, distribution and literacy through the education system.&lt;ref&gt;Liddicoat, Anthony J., and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr., "Language Planning in Local Contexts: Agents, Contexts and Interactions.” ''Language Planning in Local Contexts''. Ed. Anthony J. Liddicoat and Richard B. Baldauf, Jr. Clevedon: Multilingual Matters Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Acquisition planning is often incorporated into language planning processes in which the statuses of languages are evaluated,corpuses are revised and these revisions are implemented in society through the education system.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Charles A. “Sociolinguistic Settings of Language Planning.” ''Language Planning Processes''. Ed. Rubin, Joan, Björn H. Jernudd, Jyotirindra Das Gupta, Joshua A. Fishman and Charles A. Ferguson. The Hague: Mouton Publishers, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum Development Institute of Singapore===
The Curriculum Development Institute of Singapore (CDIS) was formed in 1980 as a division under the Ministry of Education. The institute had the sole task of producing teaching packages under the syllabuses prepared by the Curriculum Planning Division.&lt;ref name=Gopinathan /&gt; In 1998, the Ministry of Education recognised a need to incorporate innovative changes to its Education system besides the current Bilingual Policy. The Ministry introduced three important national initiatives: '''1)'''National Education, '''2)'''Information Technology and '''3)'''Thinking Skills, to the school curriculum&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt; The Curriculum Planning Division reduced the content of the existing syllabuses to integrate the three national initiatives into the school curriculum.

===Bilingual Policy===
Under the Bilingual Policy, all students are educated in English as their [[first language]]. The Ministry of Education ensures that the Bilingual Policy is met by students in Primary and Secondary schools- not only are they required to master English as their first language, they also have to learn their Mother Tongue as a [[second language]].&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt; They are offered [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Malay language|Malay]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]] depending on their father's ethnicity.

While English is the core language of instruction in government schools, mother tongue languages are taught on a weekly basis. While "mother tongue" typically correlates to the first language (L1) overseas, in Singapore, the Ministry of Education refers to it as the "ethnic language" or the second language (L2).&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt; Singapore's language planning is known as exogenous planning, whereby a [[foreign language]] takes on the role as the main language of communication against the indigenous languages in the country. The education system aims to create a workforce that is bi-literate in English and Chinese/Malay/Tamil.&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt;

Despite the intentions of the bilingual policy, there has been an inherent and significant shift from a predominant use of Mandarin Chinese to English within the Chinese community.&lt;ref name="Chew, C. H. 2003 pp.133-154"&gt;Xu, D. M., Chew, C. H., &amp; Chen, S. C. (2003). Language use and language attitudes in Singapore's Chinese community. In S. Gopinathan, A. Pakir, W. K. Ho &amp; V. Saravanan. (Eds.) Language, society and education in Singapore: Issues and trends (pp. 133–154), Singapore: Marshall Cavendish International&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 Population Census revealed that the use of Malay Language has dropped from 96.7% to 94.3%. The use of English Language in Malay households has increased from 2.3% to 5.5%.

====Outcome of Bilingual Policy====
Report on the Ministry of Education, 1978: Assessment of Bilingual Policy:

Formed in April 1978 and led by Deputy Prime Minister, Dr [[Goh Keng Swee]], the Goh Report assessed the bilingual education programme in Singapore.The Ministry of Education saw its Bilingualism policy as not being universally effective.&lt;ref name=Goh&gt;Goh, K. S. et al. (1979), Report on the Ministry of Education 1978. Singapore: Ministry of Education&lt;/ref&gt; The Goh Report critiqued the Bilingual policy as ineffective [[bilingualism]] leading to the main cause of language education problems in Singapore.&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt; Although the Bilingual policy resulted in a rise in overall literacy rate,&lt;ref&gt;Pakir, A. (1993), 'Two Tongue Tied: Bilingualism in Singapore', in Jones and Ozóg, pp. 73–90&lt;/ref&gt; statistics reveal that less than 40% of the School-going Students had the minimum competency level in two languages at a time.&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt;

Under the review of Singapore’s education system:

* At least 25% of the Primary school cohort did not meet the minimum criteria for literacy levels.
* Only 11% of the armed force recruits were adequately competent in English.
* 97.5% of the Primary 6 students who sat for the [[Primary School Leaving Examination]] (PSLE) obtained A*-C grades in English.
* 86.9% of the Secondary 4 students who sat for the GCE 'O' Level Examinations obtained A*-C grades in English.
* Despite increasing Language exposure time in the school curriculum, teaching strategies were ineffective in enhancing Students' language proficiency.

====Challenges and solutions of Bilingual Policy====
An increasing number of Singaporeans are speaking and using English at home, leading to declining standards in the command of Mother Tongue. The impact of the bilingualism policy however, differs from one ethnic group to another.&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt;

Report on the Ministry of Education (1978): Assessment of Bilingual policy for three ethnic groups; The Chinese community, the Malay Community, the Indian Community

=====The Chinese community=====
The Chinese community struggled with learning two languages; English and [[Mandarin Chinese]]. When Chinese students were exposed to Mandarin Chinese in school, they felt that the language was foreign and hard to grasp. The home context did not favour the learning of Mandarin Chinese because Chinese dialects; [[Hokkien]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hainanese]], [[Hakka]] were the dominant mode of communication at home depending on dialectal group. The Ministry of Education only allowed Mandarin Chinese in the classroom, Chinese dialects were seen as inferior in status and were an impediment to learning Mandarin Chinese.&lt;ref name=Wu&gt;Wu, M. (2005) A critical evaluation of Singapore's language policy and its implications for English Teaching. Hong Kong&lt;/ref&gt;

In light of the difficulties faced by the Chinese community, the government made several amendments to the educational system to help Chinese students cope with acquiring Mandarin Chinese:&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt;

* With the introduction of EM3 stream, Mandarin Chinese and other Primary school subjects were taught at a lower than mainstream level to help academically less inclined students cope with a less demanding curriculum.
* Introduction of Chinese B Mandarin Chinese is taught at a lower than mainstream level to help students with difficulties in Mandarin Chinese still be able to acquire the language at oral- language proficiency levels.
* Establishment of [[Singapore centre for Chinese language|Singapore Centre for Chinese Language]] (SCCL) in November 2009. In recognition of Chinese students who come from non –Mandarin speaking homes, the centre aims to enhance the effectiveness of teaching Chinese as a second language in a bilingual environment that is conducive to the needs of these students.
* The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] (SMC) was organised in 1979 by then Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] to promote Chinese Language and Culture among Chinese Singaporeans. Essentially this annual event seeks to create heightened awareness of Singaporean Chinese Asian heritage.

=====The Malay Community=====
Malay is valued as the means for transmitting familial and religious values. Malay is widely practised in [[mosques]] and religious schools also known as '’Madrasahs'’. The use of [[Malay language]] has been largely reduced to religious and classroom domains only.&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt; The increase in the number of contexts of which English is being practised has resulted in a large proportion of the Malays assimilating to English.

As a result, the ML 'B' programme was introduced in 2000 to help less linguistically inclined students cope with acquiring the Malay language at oral- language proficiency levels. However, the ML 'B' programme was available only at secondary levels and was not offered at pre-university levels.&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt;

=====The Indian Community=====
Under the Bilingualism Policy, Singaporean Indians only had the option of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] for their Mother Tongue. Non-Tamil Indian Students were thus at a disadvantage. In recognition of this, the Ministry of Education revised the Bilingual Policy in 1989 to allow Indian Students to choose between [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Urdu]] as their Mother Tongue.&lt;ref name=Mohamed /&gt;

=====Revisions made to Bilingual Policy=====
The development and implementation of the Bilingual Policy is an example of acquisition planning.The Bilingual policy places excessive demands on average students. Most students tackle two foreign languages at primary school level because most of them speak Chinese dialects at home and Mandarin Chinese is used in schools for Chinese lessons.&lt;ref name=Gopinathan&gt;Gopinathan, S. (1980), 'Language Policy in Education: A Singapore Perspectiv3e’, in Afendras and Kuo, pp. 175–202&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education felt that resources were not effectively employed to meet the goals of the policy. Therefore, amendments were made to allow for more flexibility and to cater to the diverse linguistic needs of the population:&lt;ref name=Goh /&gt;

* Students who could not cope with the demands of a Bilingual education could choose to focus on one language, i.e., English.
* Students who were linguistically inclined were encouraged to take on a third language, in addition to English and their Mother Tongue.

Under this new curriculum, the diverse needs of the students could be met and they could effectively maximise their linguistic capabilities. However, the issue of the lack of command in English was highlighted again in the "Report for Moral Education" in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Education (1979), Report on Moral Education. Singapore: Ministry of Education&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corpus Planning==
'''Corpus planning''' focuses on changes by deliberate planning to the actual corpus or shape of a language. It deals with [[Codification (linguistics)|codification]], and can play a significant role in implementation and elaboration stages. Elaboration can be considered as a language task resulting in increased sophistication of the chosen code.&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliotecavirtualut.suagm.edu/Glossa/Journal/jun2007/Language%20Planning,%20Policy%20and%20Implementation%20in%20South%20Africa.pdf, 'Language Planning, Policy and Implementation in South Africa, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpus planning is often undertaken by planners with great linguistic expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Haugen, E. (1983). The implementation of corpus planning: Theory and practice. In J. Cobarrubias &amp; J. A. Fishman (Eds.), Progress in language planning (pp. 269–290). Berlin, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Corpus planning is also referred as making language planning decisions to engineer changes in the structure of a language.&lt;ref name=FergusonG&gt;Ferguson, Gibson. (2006). Language Planning and Education. Edinburgh University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The Singapore Government has been active in status planning and acquisition planning however with regards to corpus planning in English, nothing has been done.The government modelled [[Singaporean English]] after [[Standard British English]], without recognising the internal issues of English which must be specific to the local context.&lt;ref&gt;Gopinathan, S. and Saravanan, V. (1985), 'Varieties of English and Educational Linguistics: An Agenda for Research’, Singapore Journal of Education, Vol. 7, No. 1, pp. 64–71&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of a government body that deals with language issues such as codification and purification, there is negligence to local English,&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, A. F. (1988), ‘A Standard for Written Singapore English?’, in Foley, pp. 27–50&lt;/ref&gt; it becomes difficult to ascertain whether there is a Standard Singapore English.&lt;ref&gt;Strevens, P. (1980), Teaching English as an International Language: From Practice to Principle. Oxford: Pergamon&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to Chinese language, the government selected Mandarin Chinese as the variety of Chinese language that takes precedence over other social and regional dialects i.e., Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Hainanese, Hakka.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;Christian, Donna (1988). “Language Planning: the view from linguistics”, in Frederick J. Newmeyer, ''Language: the socio-cultural context'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 193–211&lt;/ref&gt; Standardization generally entails increasing the uniformity of the norm, as well as of the norm.&lt;ref name="FergusonG"/&gt; The government adopted Mandarin Chinese as one of the four official languages in Singapore and it is mandatory that the Chinese population in Singapore learn Mandarin Chinese as their mother tongue in schools. In addition the government launched the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] to promote the prestige of Mandarin Chinese against other Chinese dialects.

===Speak Mandarin Campaign (SMC)===
{{Main|Speak Mandarin Campaign}}

The [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] was launched by then Prime Minister [[Lee Kuan Yew]] in 1979. The campaign seeks to encourage the use of Mandarin and to discourage the use of [[dialects]], characterising the latter as 'burdens,' as summarized in [[Goh Chok Tong]]'s (then First [[Deputy Prime Minister]]) speech marking the 1986 Speak Mandarin Campaign:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Parents know that our bilingual education system is here to stay, when they drop dialects in conversation with their children they are recognising that the continued use of dialects will add to the learning burden of their children.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Outcome===
The success of the campaign was evident 20 years from the launch of the campaign. The campaign has significantly reduced the number of dialect speakers in Singapore. The use of Chinese dialect at home dropped from 81.4% in 1980 to 30.7% in 2000. Meanwhile, households that claimed to use Mandarin as the dominant language at home increased from 10.2% in 1980 to 35% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]] wiki page&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the campaign is successful in reducing the number of dialect speakers in Singapore, it is not always received positively. This is due to two key reasons:

* The Singapore Government does not abandon the usage of [[dialects]] fully.
* Members from other ethnic groups in Singapore felt that they were not treated fairly.

The reason why Mandarin has been chosen among the various Chinese dialects is that it is supposedly able to unite the different dialect groups, and it is also supposedly the variety associated with ancient Chinese culture and its values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=4&amp;hid=120&amp;sid=7e115396-984a-4c45-9480-7bb44b801cc1%40sessionmgr11,|title='Burdens' and 'handicaps' in Singapore Language Policy: on the limits of language management', p. 101|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is not to say that the government considers the dialects to be totally without cultural value. The government does at times acknowledge that the dialects are also capable of conveying traditional Chinese values.

Excerpted from a speech made by then Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] during the 1991 Speak Mandarin Campaign:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although [[Chinese literature]], idioms and proverb can be translated into English, their full meaning may be lost in the process. A Chinese Singaporean who does not know Chinese- either Mandarin or dialect- runs the risk of losing the collective wisdom of the Chinese civilization.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Non-Mandarin Chinese language speakers have complained that their children have to study two [[foreign languages]] — English and Mandarin.&lt;ref name="Chew, C. H. 2003 pp.133-154"/&gt; This is contrasted to a possible alternative policy of English and their [[native language]], and that the emphasis on Mandarin threatens family ties, as older generations are often not conversant in Mandarin (unless it is their native tongue). Some critics include that the Mandarin education system's goal of promoting cultural identity has left many younger generations of Mandarin speakers unable to communicate with their non-Mandarin Chinese language-speaking grandparents.

==Overview==
Singapore's Bilingual Policy has been commended on contributing to the country's economic success.&lt;ref name=Gopinathan /&gt; The social and political stability that Singapore has enjoyed all these years has also been attributed to the Bilingual policy.&lt;ref&gt;Gopinathan, S. (1977), 'Developing a Language Policy for Education in Singapore', in Crewe, pp. 46–67&lt;/ref&gt; There are however, a lot existing issues and potential problems underlying the bilingual policy, while the English language was useful in attaining national cohesion within the [[Multi-racial]] Country, [[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Malay Language]], [[Tamil Language]] have lost their prestige in the society. To rectify these issues, the government, the policy makers and the teaching professions should co-operate with one another. As front-line practitioners, local teachers have direct experience on the needs and difficulties of students. Parents and peers are ''invisible planners'' who have power to determine the success of the government's language policy.&lt;ref name=Pakir /&gt; The collective collaboration of the government, policy makers, local teachers, parents and peers more effective and indigenised language policy can be designed.&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt;

Policy discourse in Singapore has largely overlooked the fact that the linguistic market consists of permeable boundaries and the value of linguistic capital for each language changes as internal and external factors interact together.&lt;ref name=Silver /&gt; The Ministry of Education was critiqued as failing to recognise that perceptions regarding linguistic capital can change, therefore Language Policy implementation (Bilingual Policy) need to consider the feelings and willingness of the recipients as this ultimately determines the final acceptance and success of the policy. Language Policy and implementations need to consider bottom up processes (Individuals and Unofficial Institutions), and not just designed from the top (Government and Official Agencies).&lt;ref&gt;Haarmann, H. (1990). Language planning in the light of a general theory of language: A methodological framework. International Journal of Sociology and Language, 86,103–126&lt;/ref&gt; The population’s perceptions regarding prestige and image of Ethnic Languages are important parameters that need to be established and analysed in accordance with the Government’s Language Policies plans to account for a multicultural country like Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;Ager D. E. (2005). Image and prestige planning.Current Issues in Language Planning, 6(1), 1–43&lt;/ref&gt;

The political advantages that English has to offer cannot be denied. While the bilingual policy aims to educate its population in enhancing communication in the international market, it is also able to protect the cultural identities of the indigenous groups by embracing multiculturalism.However, the processes of [[globalisation]] exert increasing pressure on the population to assimilate towards English at the expense of their [[mother tongues]]. While diversity breeds potential threats to globalisation, long-term [[language planning]] must be sensitive enough to tackle the precarious linguistic situation to protect Mandarin Chinese, Malay and Tamil, perhaps even Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati and Urdu alongside English.&lt;ref&gt;Poon, A. Y. K (2004), Language Policy of Hong Kong: Its Impact on Language Education and Language Use in Post-Handover Hong Kong. Journal of Taiwan Normal University: Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Vol. 49, Issue 1, pp. 53–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 4 and 114 of the [[Constitution of Latvia]] form the foundation for '''language policy in Latvia''', declaring [[Latvian language|Latvian]] to be the official state language and affirming the rights of ethnic minorities to preserve and develop their languages. [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] and the [[Livonian language]], in addition to Latvian, are considered indigenous and all other languages foreign, including [[Russian language|Russian]] (the [[first language]] for more than one third of the population&lt;ref name="2000 census results"&gt;[http://data.csb.gov.lv/DATABASEEN/tautassk/databasetree.asp?lang=1 2000 census results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321200854/http://data.csb.gov.lv/DATABASEEN/tautassk/databasetree.asp?lang=1 |date=21 March 2008 }} — choose "Results of Population Census Year 2000, in short" and "Iedzīvotāju dzimtā valoda un citu valodu prasme"{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Other significant minority foreign languages include [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Romani language|Romani]].

The preamble to the State Language Law includes as its goals "the integration of national minorities into Latvian society while respecting their right to use their mother tongue or any other language; [and] the increase of the influence of the Latvian language in the cultural environment of Latvia by promoting a faster integration of society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minelres.lv/NationalLegislation/Latvia/Latvia_Language_English.htm State Language Law] — Sections 1, 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal framework ==
The [[official language]] (''valsts valoda'', literally ''state language'') in Latvia is Latvian; this status has been explicitly defined since 1988.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=167|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, amendments to the 1989 Law on Languages strengthened the position of Latvian. All other languages, except the [[Extinct language|extinct]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/fu.html|title=Uralic (Finno-Ugrian) languages|website=Helsinki.fi|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Livonian language]], are defined as foreign languages in Section 5 of the State Language Law of 1999.

Since 1998, the official status of the Latvian language has been written into the [[Constitution of Latvia|Constitution]] (Article 4); and since 2002, MPs have been asked to promise to strengthen Latvian as the only official language in order to take their seats (Article 18). In the Constitution's chapter on human rights, rights to get answers from authorities in Latvian are specified since 2002 (Article 104). The current State Language Law was not amended since its adoption in 1999 (as at 2017).

In 1995, Latvia signed, and in 2005 ratified the [[Council of Europe]]'s [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]]. When ratifying it, the Latvian [[Saeima]] (Parliament) made two declarations (worded as reservations) limiting the implementation of Articles 10 and 11. As at 2008, Latvia did not plan to sign the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/third-report-on-latvia/16808b58b3 Third report on Latvia] by the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]], 2008 — see Paragraph 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Language policy is implemented by a number of institutions: the State Language Commission (under the [[President of Latvia|President]]) prepares proposals in this field; the [[Latvian State Language Center|State Language Centre]] (under the Ministry of Justice) executes control, imposes fines for administrative violations and translates documents of international significance, the Latvian Language Agency (under the Ministry of Education and Science) provides consultations and opportunities for learning the Latvian language, analyses the language situation.

== Official use of languages ==

Since the State Language Law came into force in 2000, submitting documents to government (local included) and state public enterprises is allowed in Latvian only, except in cases specially defined in the law (emergency services, foreign residents etc.), according to Section 10. From 1992–2000, authorities had to accept documents in Russian, German and English, too, and were allowed to answer in the language of application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=165 1992 Law on Languages] — Sections 8, 9{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the losses of the Latvian government in the cases ''[[Podkolzina v. Latvia]]'' ([[European Court of Human Rights|ECHR]]) and ''[[Ignatāne v. Latvia]]'' ([[Human Rights Committee|UN HRC]]), a certain level of command in Latvian was asked for eligibility to Parliament and local councils. In practice, this had led to re-examinations of various candidates, at least sometimes unexpected, which prevented Ignatāne and Podkolzina (representatives of the [[Equal Rights (Latvia)|Equal Rights]] party in the 1997 local and 1998 parliamentary elections&lt;ref&gt;''Жданова Д.'' ООН встала на защиту «Равноправия», «Час» 10.08.01.{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from participation.&lt;!-- {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} - This is exactly what the mentioned ''Iganatane'' and ''Podkolzina'' cases are about - see, e.g., Para 7.4. in ''Ignatane'', Para. 36 in ''Podkolzina'' judgment--&gt; As of 2011, candidates do not need to prove language proficiency, but elected members of Saeima&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saeima.lv/en/legislation/rules-of-procedure|title=Rules of Procedure|website=saeima.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and local councilors&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=58052&amp;from=off Law on status of member of republican city or municipality council — See Section 4]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be deprived of mandate for insufficient command of Latvian.

Names and surnames in Latvian-issued documents are formed in Latvianized form, according to Section 19. These provisions were subject in ECHR cases ''Kuhareca v. Latvia''&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=721719&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECHR decision in case No. 71557/01]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Mencena v.

Toponyms are formed in Latvian language only (on the [[Livonian coast]] - in Livonian as well), according to Section 18 of the State Language Law.

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Latvia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Language policy is an important issue in Latvia: here, demonstrators demand official status for the Russian language.]] --&gt;
The government of Latvia in its policy documents refers to Latvia as a (democratic) [[nation state]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integracija.gov.lv/doc_upl/VP_SIL.pdf State programme "Social integration in Latvia"]{{lv icon}} - see p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.km.gov.lv/UI/imagebinary.asp?imageid=3124 Guidelines of cultural policy 2006-2015 "Nation state"]{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructing societal integration on the basis of the Latvian language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.integracija.gov.lv/doc_upl/VP_SIL.pdf State programme "Social integration in Latvia"]{{lv icon}} - see p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; while respecting the diversity of languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valoda.lv/doc_upl/VVA_angl.pdf Guidelines of the State Language Policy for 2005-2014] — p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unity (Latvian political party)|Unity block]], comprising most of the governing coalition as of 2011, also describes Latvia as a nation state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvk.lv/cgi-bin/wdbcgiw/base/komisijas2010.CVKAND10.progr?NR=5|title=Programma|website=Cvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the nation state, where "language = nation", is seen as the core and main engine of the language policy of the Latvian state.&lt;ref&gt;''Dilāns G.''

One critic, James Hughes, Reader in Comparative Politics at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]], has pointed out that Russian-speakers in Latvia constitute one of the largest linguistic minorities in Europe, therefore he considers Latvia's language laws to be denying Russophones their language rights, and thus they are contrary to international practice in the field of minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 |title=Discrimination against the Russophone Minority in Estonia and Latvia |accessdate=2008-03-27 |author=James Hughes |year=2005 |work=Development &amp; Transition |publisher=[[London School of Economics]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504025222/http://www.developmentandtransition.net/index.cfm?module=ActiveWeb&amp;page=WebPage&amp;DocumentID=586 |archivedate= 4 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nataliya Pulina in ''[[Moskovskiye Novosti]]'' asserts that Latvia's Russophones are by percentage actually the largest linguistic minority in the [[European Union|EU]] whose language has no official status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Наталия |last=Пулина |script-title=ru:Татьяна Жданок: "Русские могут влиять на политику Латвии" |url=http://www.mn.ru/issue/2007-45-33 |work=[[Moskovskiye Novosti|Московские новости]] |language=Russian |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2008-03-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080326223109/http://www.mn.ru/issue/2007-45-33 |archivedate = 2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the demographic arguments for Russian language rights in Latvia, the [[BBC]]'s Angus Roxburgh reported in 2005:
{{cquote|There are as many Russians, proportionally, in Latvia as there are French speakers in Belgium. They argue that, being such a large minority, they should have the right to education in their native language if the demand exists—which it certainly does.&lt;br&gt;[They] say that Russian should be an official language with equal rights, just as Swedish is in Finland (for just 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Angus |last=Roxburgh |title=Latvian lessons irk Russians |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4380437.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-03-29 |accessdate=2008-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the political parties, [[ForHRUL]] offers in its programme to grant co-official status to Russian, Latgalian and possibly others languages in municipalities where these are native for more than 20% of population.&lt;ref&gt;ForHRUL programme (2006) — see section 7.5.: [http://rusojuz.lv/ru/party/programma/14661-/ Russian], [http://rusojuz.lv/lv/party/Programmas/24543-/ Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; In a draft of its political programme,&lt;ref&gt;HC programme project – section "Cultural and language diversity": [http://www.saskanascentrs.lv/index.php?text&amp;id=100&amp;level=1 Russian], [http://www.saskanascentrs.lv/index.php?text&amp;id=100&amp;level=1 Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harmony Centre|HC]] offers to grant co-official status to Latgalian and Russian in printed media, public sphere and education (for Russian, in communication with authorities, as well), stressing its support for the sole state language. Both these parties are in permanent opposition on the state level.

On the other hand, TB/LNNK, a member of governing coalition between 2006 and 2010, is demanding that Latvian be made the sole language of instruction, even in minority schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tb.lv/index.php?id=382|title=Jaunumi|website=Tb.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to research conducted by the Baltic Institute of Social Sciences in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bszi.lv/downloads/resources/Etnopol_krize/Atskaite_LV.pdf Ethnopolitical tension in Latvia: looking for solving the conflict — see p. 39] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509041733/http://www.bszi.lv/downloads/resources/Etnopol_krize/Atskaite_LV.pdf |date=9 May 2007 }} {{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority (77%) of ethnic Latvians opposed (56%) or mostly opposed (21%) granting Russian status as a second official language, while the majority (87%) of Russians supported (59%) or mostly supported (28%) such status, while a majority (75%) of other ethnicities also supported (40%) or rather supported (35%) such status.
(Sample size was 1,018 respondents, with 51% supporting or rather supporting official status for Russian and 44% opposing or rather opposing it.)

==Private use of languages==
The Law on Electronic Media&lt;ref name="Law on Electronic Media"/&gt; prescribes that national and regional electronic media need to broadcast at least 65 % in Latvian language (section 32). Besides, films aired in any channel should be dubbed in Latvian or to have original soundtrack and Latvian subtitles; TV broadcasts in languages other than Latvian, except news, live events, language learning broadcasts and retranslated content, must be subtitled in Latvian.(Section 28). The same concerns films shown in cinemas, according to Section 17 of State Language Law. Until a judgement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2003/01/2003-02-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgement in case No. 2003-02-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitutional Court upon request of 24 ForHRUL MPs (delivered in 2003), broadcasting in minority languages was limited for private TV and radio (originally within 30%, since 1998 within 25%).

According to Section 6 of State Language Law, levels of skills in Latvian are defined for various professions, which concern legitimate public interest. Totally, there are six levels and two lists of professions (longer for public sector and shorter for private sector), classified by needed level. For those who didn't get education in Latvian and aren't disabled, an examination is needed to define their skills in Latvian, to work in these professions. Those who fail to show needed level during inspections, can be fined. Labour market shows high demand for skills in Latvian, Russian and English languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valoda.lv/doc_upl/A5_VVA_valodu_prasmes_LV_Q.pdf Valodu prasmes ietekme uz ekonomiski aktīvo iedzīvotāju dzīves kvalitāti], 2006{{lv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Section 11 of State Language Law, organizers of public events have to provide in Latvian information, which concerns legitimate public interest (defined in Section 2 — public safety, health care ''et cetera'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=10124|title=Noteikumi par tulkojumu nodrošināšanu pasākumos|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same affects posters, billboards and signboards, according to Section 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?mode=DOC&amp;id=102667|title=Noteikumi par valodu lietošanu informācijā|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, according to the Law of languages as amended in 1992 (Section 5), organizers of any public event had to provide translation into Latvian in their conferences. An exemption had existed for organizations of ethnic minorities and religious organizations; 1997 Law on Meetings, Processions and Pickets has foreseen free choice of language in meetings, pickets and processions, too (Section 19).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?mode=KDOC&amp;id=42090&amp;version_date=13.02.1997|title=Par sapulcēm, gājieniem un piketiem|website=LIKUMI.LV|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the beginning of the 1990s, some Polish language schools were created besides the existing schools with Latvian and Russian language of instruction. Certain schools (e.g., Riga Dubnov Jewish Secondary school, founded in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revs.lv|title=Š.

As at 2007, there was also increasing number of minority children attending Latvian-language schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/third-report-on-latvia/16808b58b3 Third report on Latvia] by ECRI — see Paragraph 54&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Education law,&lt;ref&gt;Education law: [http://www.ttc.lv/index.php?&amp;id=10&amp;tid=59&amp;l=LV&amp;seid=down&amp;itid=13759 edition being in force between 27.02.2004. and 15.09.2005., English] and [http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=50759&amp;menu_body=KDOC current version, Latvian]&lt;/ref&gt; as adopted in 1998, the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) had to be only Latvian since 2004. This has mostly affected Russian schools, some existing in Latvia without interruption since at least 1789.&lt;ref&gt;''Гурин А. Г.'' [http://www.russkije.lv/ru/journalism/read/pervye-russkie-shkoly/ Первые русские школы]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Russian School Defense Staff|wide protests in 2003 and 2004]], the law was amended allowing to teach up to 40% of curricula in minority languages (Transition Rules) and allowing orphans to continue their education not only in Latvian, but also in the language he or she began it (Section 56).

In 2005, one judgment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/2005-02-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgment in case No. 2005-02-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Constitutional Court (upon request of ForHRUL, NHP and LSP MPs) has declared unconstitutional the ban of public co-funding for private minority schools, another&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/2004-18-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf|title=Constitutional Court of Latvia judgement in case No. 2004-18-0106|website=Satv.tiesa.gov.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has declared the proportion "60+:40" constitutional.

According to the same 1998 Education Law, the tertiary education in public colleges and universities has to be in Latvian only since 1999 (it had to be basically in Latvian since the second year, according to 1992 Law on Languages, Section 11). In fact, there still exist programmes with education in English for foreigners ([[Riga Technical University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rtuasd.lv/resource/show/3|title=Riga Technical University Department of Foreign Students|website=Rtuasd.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or according to special laws ([[Riga Graduate School of Law]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=124716&amp;mode=DOC 2005 Latvian-Swedish Treaty on Riga Graduate School of Law] - See Article 7; there is a version in English under one in Latvian&lt;/ref&gt;). There is a demand for tertiary education in Russian, too: it is used, for example, at the [[Baltic International Academy]].

In 2018, President [[Raimonds Vejonis]] promulgated the bill banning use of Russian as the language of instruction also at private universities in Latvia. The Latvian parliament passed the legislation on June 21.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltic-course.com/eng/education/?doc=141364&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
&lt;!-- {{main|Language legislation in Latvia}}--&gt;

[[File:Обязательство Государственнаго Казначейства Латвии 100 рублей 1919 реверс.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A banknote of the Republic of Latvia, 1919]]

In the medieval [[Livonian Confederation]], [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]] were the dominant languages of education and administration. German kept this position under subsequent periods of rule by [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] and, initially, under the [[Russian Empire]]. German was the language of instruction in the first institution of tertiary education on the territory of Latvia ([[Riga Polytechnicum]], founded in 1862). In [[Latgale]], the Polish language gained some influence, beginning from the 16th century.

From the mid-19th century, Latvian started to rise in influence. At the end of the 19th century, tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] instigated a policy of [[Russification]] in non-Russian areas of the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A History of Russia |last= Raisanovsky |first= Nicholas V. |authorlink= Nicholas V. Riasanovsky |year= 1993 |edition= 5th |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York; Oxford |isbn= 0-19-507462-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, language of administration, that of Riga Polytechnicum and most schools was changed from German to Russian, and some German toponyms in eastern Latvia were Russianized (e.g., Dünaburg became Dvinsk). After the [[Russian Revolution (1905)|1905 revolution]], possibilities for schooling in Latvian increased.

The pro-[[Bolshevik]] revolutionary [[Soviet (council)|soviet]], [[Iskolat]], declared on 4 January 1918 that Latvian should be the primary language of administration on the territory of Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=170|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the short-lived [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic]] in 1919, Latgalian enjoyed co-equal status with both Latvian and Russian as an official language of administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=135&amp;id=169|title=Valsts valoda - Agrāk spēkā bijušie likumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republic of Latvia (founded in 1918) was initially liberal in its language policy: while Latvianizing toponyms (e.g., Dvinsk became [[Daugavpils]]), it also allowed Russian and German languages to be used in Parliament along Latvian,&lt;ref&gt;Saeimas kārtības rullis.

State had acknowledged public use of Latgalian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=26&amp;id=238|title=Valsts valoda - Ministru kabineta noteikumi|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1934 [[Kārlis Ulmanis|Ulmanis]] coup d'état the policy changed, and many minority high schools were closed.&lt;ref&gt;''Фейгмане Т.

Русские в довоенной Латвии — Р.: БРИ, 2000. {{ISBN|9984-606-68-6}} — стр. 281—296 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly hard hit were the Belarusian primary schools, all but 5 of which were closed. Belarusian schoolteachers and other intellectuals in Latvia were suspected of having a pro-Soviet agenda harmful to national security.&lt;ref&gt;''Latvijas izlūkdienesti 1919-1940: 664 likteņi'', ed.

During World War II, Latvia's German community was mostly moved to Germany, and the Jewish community was destroyed (hit first by the Stalinist deportations in 1941, then by the [[Holocaust]]). Due to that, these groups' respective schools disappeared.

In the postwar [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic]], the proportion of Latvian-speaking population decreased due to large losses in World War II and mass deportation, while the Russian-speaking population increased due to the presence of military forces and mass immigration of labour to implement the Soviet Union's industrialization policy (still, due to low birth rate, the population of Latvia had grown by 27.4% between 1959 and 1989 censuses, while that of the whole USSR — by 36.8%).&lt;ref&gt;''demoscope.ru'' database: population of USSR and its republics (by ethnicity) — [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_59.php 1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316172652/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_59.php |date=16 March 2010 }}, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316172713/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng_nac_89.php |date=16 March 2010 }}{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the use of Russian increased and it started to dominate in the areas integrated on a federal level (state security, railway etc.). As concerns tertiary education, in some faculties, the language of instruction was only Latvian, in some, only Russian; in some there were two language "streams".&lt;ref&gt;Latvijas PSR augstākās mācību iestādes.

Latvian was declared the state language of the Latvian SSR by a decree of the republican [[Supreme Soviet]] on 6 October 1988. Nevertheless, citizens could still choose to communicate with state authorities in Russian, and all correspondence with the USSR's federal bodies was to be in Russian.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Demographic background ==
&lt;!--{{main|Languages of Latvia}}--&gt;
In the first post-Soviet [[census]] in 2000, 1,311,093 persons in Latvia reported Latvian as their mother tongue,&lt;ref name="Census"/&gt; representing the vast majority of the estimated 1.5 million Latvian speakers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=lav|title=Latvian|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2000, [[Livonian language|Livonian]] was a [[moribund language]] spoken by some 35 people, of whom only 10 were fluent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nyelvrokonaink |last=Nanovfszky |first=György (ed.) |year=2000 |publisher=Teleki László Alapítvány |location=Budapest |isbn=963-00-3424-7 |language=Hungarian, Russian |oclc=45621804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decade of the 21st century, it was estimated that Livonian was the native tongue of 4 people in Latvia, all of whom were older than 70.&lt;ref&gt;''Ernšreits V.''

Latvia's current territory is a close approximation to the range of Latvian habitation since the Latvian people emerged. As such, Latvian and Livonian are native only to Latvia.&lt;!-- and have been given special status under Latvian law with the intent to counter the policy of Russification under the Soviet Union--&gt;

In the 2000 census, 891,451 respondents listed Russian as their mother tongue,&lt;ref name="Census"/&gt; representing 37.5% of the total population, whereas Latvian was recorded as the mother tongue for 58.2%.&lt;ref name="2000 census results"/&gt; Latvian was spoken as a second language by 20.8% of the population, and 43.7% spoke Russian as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;LR CSP preses izlaidums: [http://dev.eurac.edu:8085/mugs2/do/blob.doc?type=doc&amp;serial=1022597092498 2000.

Of all districts and cities in Latvia, the highest command of Latvian was in [[Talsi District]] (98.8%), while the lowest was in Daugavpils (41.4%). In Daugavpils was also the highest percentage of people speaking Russian (95.7%), and in [[Kuldīga District]] the lowest (57.6%). There was a similar breakdown with regards to mother tongue: 94.6% in Talsi District and for 11.6% in Daugavpils for Latvian, 80.4% in Daugavpils and for 3.0% in Talsi District for Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=129&amp;id=388|title=Valsts valoda - Statistiska|website=Vvk.lv|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the previous 1989 census, conducted while Latvia was still part of the USSR, Latvian was reported as the native language for 52.0% of the population, Russian for 42.1%;&lt;ref&gt;1989. gada tautas skaitīšanas rezultāti Latvijā.

It should be noted that [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]] was not considered a language separate from Latvian in any census, whether during the Soviet period, or since the restoration of independence. Therefore, no specific data on the number of its native speakers were available until the 2011 census.

== International recommendations ==
In 1999, the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] [[High Commissioner on National Minorities]] found Latvia's new language law to be "essentially in conformity with Latvia's international obligations and commitments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osce.org/item/4702.html |title=High Commissioner welcomes State Language Law in Latvia |accessdate=2008-03-29 |author=OSCE Press Statement |year=1999 |publisher=[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, he stated that the government regulations were "essentially in conformity with both the Law and Latvia's international obligations", but that "specific matters will have to be reviewed upon Latvia's anticipated ratification of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://cilvektiesibas.org.lv/media/attachments/30/01/2012/Cilvektiesibas_Latvija_2000_1.pdf Human Rights in Latvia in 2000] [[LCHRES]] — p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The ratification took place in 2005.

International organizations have recommended to Latvia on various occasions to:

{{Language politics}}
[[File:French and Flemish Sign in Brussels.jpg|thumb|The politics of language are evident in French-speaking Brussels, which is located in the Flanders region of Belgium, where people typically speak Flemish.  Divisive preference of either language is avoided by using both French and Flemish on nearly all signs in Brussels.]]
'''Language politics''' is the way language and linguistic differences between peoples are dealt with in the political arena.  This could manifest as government recognition, as well as how language is treated in official capacities.  Some examples:

*Legal status of a language as an [[official language]] in a [[jurisdiction (area)|country, state, or other jurisdiction]]. This generally means that all official documents affecting a country or region are published in the official language(s), but not in those that are not. Evidence in a court of law may also be expected to be presented in an official language.&lt;ref name=Patten2011&gt;{{cite journal |title= Political Theory and Language Policy |author= Alan Patten |journal= Political Theory |volume=29 |number=5 |date=October 2011 |pages=691–715 |publisher=Princeton|url= http://www.princeton.edu/~apatten/languagepolicy_politicaltheory.pdf |accessdate= September 7, 2018 |format=pdf|doi=10.1177/0090591701029005005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In countries where there are more than one main language, there are often political implications in decisions that are seen to promote one group of speakers over another, and this is often referred to as language politics. An example of a country with this type of language politics is [[Belgium]].
*In countries where there is one main language, immigrants seeking full [[citizenship]] may be expected to have a degree of fluency in that language ('language politics' then being a reference to the debate over the appropriateness of this). This has been a feature of [[Australian politics]].
*At various times [[minority language]]s have either been promoted or banned in schools, as politicians have either sought to promote a minority language with a view to strengthening the cultural identity of its speakers, or banning its use (either for teaching, or on occasion an entire ban on its use), with a view to promoting a national identity based on the majority language. An example of recent promotion of a minority language are [[Welsh language|Welsh]] or [[Leonese language|Leonese]] by the Leonese City Council, an example of official discouragement of a minority language is [[Breton language|Breton]].
*Language politics also sometimes relates to [[dialect]], where speakers of a particular dialect are perceived as speaking a more culturally 'advanced' or 'correct' form of the language. Politicians may therefore try to use that dialect rather than their own when in the public eye. Alternatively, at times those speaking the dialect perceived as more 'correct' may try to use another dialect when in the public eye to be seen as a 'man/woman of the people'.
*To promote national identity, what are strictly dialects of the same language may be promoted as separate languages to promote a sense of national identity (examples include [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]&amp;nbsp;– the latter two also use different scripts for what is linguistically the same language&amp;nbsp;– [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] for Serbian and [[Latin alphabet|roman script]] for Croatian). Whether or not something is a language can also involve language politics, for instance, [[Political views on the Macedonian language|Macedonian]].
*The use of 'he' and other words implying the masculine in documents has been a political issue relating to [[women's rights]].
*The use of words which are considered by some to have negative implications to describe a group of people e.g. Gypsies (or even more negatively, 'Gypos') instead of [[Romani people|Romani]], or indeed using the term 'Gypsies' to cover [[Irish Traveller|Traveller]] peoples as well as Romanies.
*'[[Political correctness]]' issues often stem from the use of words. For instance, some may object to the person in charge of an organisation being referred to as 'chairman', on the grounds that it implies a man must be in charge.
*Co-existence of competing spelling systems for the same language, associated with different political camps. E.g.
** [[Debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters]]
** [[Reforms of Russian orthography|Simplification of Russian orthography]]; proposals for such a reform were viewed as subversive in the late years of the Russian Empire and were implemented by the  [[Bolshevik]]s in 1918, after which the "old orthography" became associated with the [[White movement]].
** The two spelling systems for the [[Belarusian language]], one of which is associated with the country's political opposition.
Language is also utilised in political matters to unify, organise and criticise in order to unify a political group.
* The [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet]] preserved in [[Transnistria]].

The '''languages of Palestine''' are the languages spoken or once spoken in the territory of the [[State of Palestine]].

==Overview==
[[Palestinian Arabic]] is the primary language spoken by Palestinians and has a unique dialect. A Levantine Arabic dialect subgroup, it is spoken in Palestine by [[Arab citizens of Israel]] (mostly Palestinians) and in most Palestinian populations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: L-R - Page 1492, James Minahan - 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, Palestinian refugees in other parts of the world may have a different dialect from Palestinian Arabic. In the West Bank, there are many Israeli settlements in which, since the early 20th century, Hebrew has become more common. However, [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Amharic]] has also started to appear resulting from aliyah from Ethiopia. Other Jewish migrants have also brought other European languages.&lt;ref&gt;Struggle and Survival in Palestine/Israel - Page 403, Gershon Shafir - 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In premodern and medieval time periods, many other languages had also been spoken in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] for ceremonial purposes or otherwise, including [[Latin]] and other [[Italic languages]] as well as [[French language|French]], [[Germanic languages]], [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. However, they gradually faded away along with geopolitical shifts and the end of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Naming Patterns in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem'', p. 42, Iris Shagrir - 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lather, rinse, repeat''' (sometimes '''wash, rinse, repeat''') is an [[idiom]] roughly quoting the instructions found on many brands of [[shampoo]]. It is also used as a humorous way of pointing out that such instructions, if taken literally, would result in an [[endless loop]] of repeating the same steps, at least until one runs out of shampoo. It is also a sarcastic [[metaphor]] for following instructions or procedures slavishly without critical thought.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

It is known as the '''shampoo algorithm''', and is a classic example of an [[algorithm]] in introductory [[computer science]] classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Linguistics''' is the [[science|scientific]] study of [[language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Language and Linguistics |first=Michael A.K. |last=Halliday |authorlink=Michael Halliday |author2=Jonathan Webster | publisher= Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2006 |isbn=0-8264-8824-2 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it involves an analysis of language [[Theoretical linguistics|form]], language [[Semantics|meaning]], and language in [[context (language use)|context]].&lt;ref name="Martinet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elements of General Linguistics |last=Martinet |first=André |authorlink=André Martinet |translator=Elisabeth Palmer Rubbert |series=Studies in General Linguistics, vol. i. |location=London |publisher=Faber |year=1960 |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest activities in the [[language documentation|documentation]] and [[descriptive linguistics|description of language]] have been attributed to the 6th century BC [[India]]n grammarian [[Pāṇini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New History of the Humanities: The Search for Principles and Patterns from Antiquity to the Present|author=Rens Bod|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199665214|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KaOcAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter =Chapter VI: Sanskrit Literature|title = The Imperial Gazetteer of India|volume = 2 |date=1908|page = 263|url =https://archive.org/details/imperialgazette02hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote a formal description of the [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit language]] in his ''{{IAST|Aṣṭādhyāyī}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ashtadhyayi of Panini (2 Vols.) |author=S.C.

Linguists traditionally analyse human language by observing an interplay between [[phonetics|sound]] and [[semantics|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Six Lectures on Sound and Meaning |first=Roman |last=Jakobson |publisher=MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1937 |isbn=0262600102 |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/ru/jakobson.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phonetics]] is the study of speech and non-speech sounds, and delves into their acoustic and articulatory properties. The study of language [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], on the other hand, deals with how languages encode relations between entities, properties, and other aspects of the world to convey, process, and assign meaning, as well as manage and resolve [[ambiguity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vakyapadiya: Sphota, Jati, and Dravya |author=Sharada Narayanan |year=2010 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/power-of-the-word/article3779772.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the study of [[semantics]] typically concerns itself with [[truth condition]]s, [[pragmatics]] deals with how situational context influences the production of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Meaning and Grammar: An Introduction to Semantics |year=2000 |author1=Chierchia, Gennaro |author2=Sally McConnell-Ginet |lastauthoramp=yes|publisher= MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= 9780262531641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grammar]] is a system of rules which governs the production and use of [[utterances]] in a given language. These rules apply to sound&lt;ref&gt;All references in this article to the study of sound should be taken to include the manual and non-manual signs used in [[sign language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as meaning, and include componential subsets of rules, such as those pertaining to [[phonology]] (the organisation of phonetic sound systems), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (the formation and composition of words), and [[syntax]] (the formation and composition of phrases and sentences).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistics|year=2010|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn =0-262-51370-6|url= https://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/examrequest.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=12240 |edition= 6th |author1=Adrian Akmajian |author2=Richard A. Demers |author3=Ann K. Farmer |author4=Robert M. Harnish |accessdate= 25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern theories that deal with the principles of grammar are largely based within [[Noam Chomsky]]'s framework of [[generative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'' (Second Edition), 2013. Andrew Carnie. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] distinguished between the notions of [[langue and parole|''langue'' and ''parole'']] in his formulation of [[structural linguistics]]. According to him, [[speech|''parole'']] is the specific utterance of speech, whereas [[language|langue]] refers to an abstract phenomenon that theoretically defines the principles and system of rules that govern a language.&lt;ref&gt;de Saussure, F. (1986). ''Course in general linguistics'' (3rd ed.). (R. Harris, Trans.). Chicago: Open Court Publishing Company. (Original work published 1972). p. 9-10, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction resembles the one made by [[Noam Chomsky]] between [[linguistic competence|competence]] and [[Linguistic performance|performance]] in his theory of [[generative grammar|transformative]] or [[universal grammar|generative grammar]]. According to Chomsky, competence is an individual's innate capacity and potential for language (like in Saussure's ''langue''), while performance is the specific way in which it is used by individuals, groups, and communities (i.e., ''parole'', in Saussurean terms).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. (1965). ''Aspects of the Theory of Syntax''. Cambridge, MA: [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of ''parole'' (which manifests through cultural [[discourse (linguistics)|discourses]] and [[dialects]]) is the domain of [[sociolinguistics]], the sub-discipline that comprises the study of a complex system of linguistic facets within a certain [[speech community]] (governed by its own set of grammatical rules and laws). [[Discourse analysis]] further examines the structure of texts and [[conversations]] emerging out of a speech community's usage of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociolinguistic Discontinuity in Minority Language Communities |pages=40–55 |year=1998 |publisher=Linguistic Society of America |author1=Raymond Mougeon |author2=Terry Nadasdi |lastauthoramp=yes|jstor=417564}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done through the collection of linguistic data, or through the formal discipline of [[corpus linguistics]], which takes naturally occurring [[Text (disambiguation)|texts]] and studies the variation of grammatical and other features based on such corpora (or corpus data).

[[stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] also involves the study of written, signed, or spoken [[discourse]] through varying speech communities, [[genres]], and editorial or [[narrative]] formats in the mass media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uni-giessen.de/anglistik/ling/Staff/mukherjee/pdfs/Stylistics.pdf |title="Stylistics" by Joybrato Mukherjee.

Antonsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal study of language also led to the growth of fields like [[psycholinguistics]], which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; [[neurolinguistics]], which studies language processing in the brain; [[biolinguistics]], which studies the biology and evolution of language; and [[language acquisition]], which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages.

Linguistics also deals with the social, cultural, historical and political factors that influence language, through which linguistic and language-based context is often determined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://benjamins.com/#catalog/journals/jlp/main Journal of Language and Politics]&lt;/ref&gt; Research on language through the sub-branches of [[historical linguistics|historical]] and [[evolutionary linguistics]] also focus on how languages change and grow, particularly over an extended [[diachronic linguistics|period of time]].

[[Language documentation]] combines anthropological inquiry (into the history and culture of language) with linguistic inquiry, in order to describe languages and their grammars. [[Lexicography]] involves the documentation of words that form a vocabulary. Such a documentation of a linguistic vocabulary from a particular language is usually compiled in a [[dictionary]]. [[Computational linguistics]] is concerned with the statistical or rule-based modeling of natural language from a computational perspective. Specific knowledge of language is applied by speakers during the act of [[translation]] and [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], as well as in [[language education]] – the teaching of a second or [[foreign language]]. Policy makers work with governments to implement new plans in education and teaching which are based on linguistic research.

Related areas of study also includes the disciplines of [[semiotics]] (the study of direct and indirect language through signs and symbols), [[literary criticism]] (the historical and ideological analysis of literature, cinema, art, or published material), [[translation]] (the conversion and documentation of meaning in written/spoken text from one language or dialect onto another), and [[speech-language pathology]] (a corrective method to cure phonetic disabilities and dis-functions at the [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]] level).

==Nomenclature==
Before the 20th century, the term ''[[philology]]'', first attested in 1716,&lt;ref name="Etymonline Definition of Philology"&gt;{{OEtymD|philology|accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was commonly used to refer to the study of language, which was then predominantly historical in focus.&lt;ref name="Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture by Stephen G. Nichols (Vol. 65, No. 1 (Jan 1990), pp. 1-10. Published by Medieval Academy of America."&gt;{{cite journal |title=Introduction: Philology in a Manuscript Culture |first=Stephen G. |last=Nichols |journal=Speculum |volume=65 |number=1 |year=1990 |pages=1–10 |jstor=2864468 |doi=10.2307/2864468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMahon |first=A. M. S. |year=1994 |title=Understanding Language Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=19 |isbn=0-521-44665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s insistence on the importance of [[synchronic analysis (linguistics)|synchronic analysis]], however, this focus has shifted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McMahon |first=A. M. S. |year=1994 |title=Understanding Language Change |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=9 |isbn=0-521-44665-1 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term ''philology'' is now generally used for the "study of a language's grammar, history, and literary tradition", especially in the United States&lt;ref&gt;A. Morpurgo Davies Hist. Linguistics (1998) 4 I. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; (where philology has never been very popularly considered as the "science of language").&lt;ref name="Etymonline Definition of Philology"/&gt;

Although the term "linguist" in the sense of "a student of language" dates from 1641,&lt;ref name="etymonline linguist"/&gt; the term "linguistics" is first attested in 1847.&lt;ref name="etymonline linguist"&gt;{{OEtymD|linguist|accessdate=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now the usual term in English for the scientific study of language,{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} though ''linguistic science'' is sometimes used.

Linguistics is a [[Interdisciplinarity|multi-disciplinary]] field of research that combines tools from natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nc6nRRbMSQC&amp;pg=PA13|title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics|last=Spolsky|first=Bernard|last2=Hult|first2=Francis M.|date=February 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781444331042|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUMqGSbeEXAC&amp;pg=PA23|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|last=Berns|first=Margie|date=2010-03-20|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780080965031|location=|pages=23–25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/science-linguistics|title=The Science of Linguistics|last=|first=|date=|website=Linguistic Society of America|language=en|access-date=2018-04-17|quote=Modern linguists approach their work with a scientific perspective, although they use methods that used to be thought of as solely an academic discipline of the humanities. Contrary to previous belief, linguistics is multidisciplinary. It overlaps each of the human sciences including psychology, neurology, anthropology, and sociology. Linguists conduct formal studies of sound structure, grammar and meaning, but they also investigate the history of language families, and research language acquisition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many linguists, such as David Crystal, conceptualize the field as being primarily scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Linguistics|last=Crystal|first=David|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1990|isbn=9780140135312|authorlink=David Crystal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''linguist'' applies to someone who studies [[language]] or is a researcher within the field, or to someone who uses the tools of the discipline to describe and analyse specific languages.&lt;ref name="American Heritage 2000"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Linguist|encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2000|isbn=978-0-395-82517-4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variation and universality ==
While some theories on linguistics focus on the different varieties that language produces, among different sections of society, others focus on the [[universal grammar|universal]] properties that are common to all human languages. The theory of variation therefore would elaborate on the different usages of popular languages like [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] across the globe, as well as its smaller [[dialects]] and regional permutations within their national boundaries. The theory of variation looks at the cultural stages that a particular language undergoes, and these include the following.

===Pidgin===

The pidgin stage in a language is a stage when communication occurs through a grammatically simplified means, developing between two or more groups that do not have a language in common. Typically, it is a mixture of languages at the stage when there occurs a [[mixed language|mixing]] between a primary language with other language elements.

===Creole===

A creole stage in language occurs when there is a stable natural language developed from a mixture of different languages. It is a stage that occurs after a language undergoes its pidgin stage. At the creole stage, a language is a complete language, used in a community and acquired by children as their native language.

===Dialect===
A dialect is a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[language]] that is characteristic of a particular group among the language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&amp;queryword=dialect&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&amp;hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt; The group of people who are the speakers of a dialect are usually bound to each other by social identity. This is what differentiates a dialect from a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] or a [[discourse]], where in the latter case, cultural identity does not always play a role. Dialects are speech varieties that have their own grammatical and phonological rules, linguistic features, and stylistic aspects, but have not been given an official status as a language. Dialects often move on to gain the status of a language due to political and social reasons. Differentiation amongst dialects (and subsequently, languages too) is based upon the use of grammatical rules, syntactic rules, and stylistic features, though not always on lexical use or vocabulary. The popular saying that "[[a language is a dialect with an army and navy]]" is attributed as a definition formulated by [[Max Weinreich]].

[[Universal grammar]] takes into account general formal structures and features that are common to all dialects and languages, and the template of which pre-exists in the mind of an infant child. This idea is based on the theory of generative grammar and the formal school of linguistics, whose proponents include [[Chomsky|Noam Chomsky]] and those who follow his theory and work.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We may as individuals be rather fond of our own dialect. This should not make us think, though, that it is actually any better than any other dialect. Dialects are not good or bad, nice or nasty, right or wrong&amp;nbsp;– they are just different from one another, and it is the mark of a civilised society that it tolerates different dialects just as it tolerates different races, religions and sexes."&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, P. (1994). Dialects. ''Ebooks Online'' Routledge. Florence, KY.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Discourse===
Discourse is language as social practice (Baynham, 1995) and is a multilayered concept.  As a social practice, discourse embodies different ideologies through written and spoken texts. Discourse analysis can examine or expose these ideologies.   Discourse influences genre, which is chosen in response to different situations and finally, at micro level, discourse influences language as text (spoken or written) at the phonological or lexico-grammatical level. Grammar and discourse are linked as parts of a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ariel|first=Mira|year=2009|title=Discourse, grammar, discourse|jstor=24049745|journal=Discourse Studies|volume=11|issue=1|pages=5–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A particular discourse becomes a language variety when it is used in this way for a particular purpose, and is referred to as a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen Leckie-Tarry, ''Language and Context: a Functional Linguistic Theory of Register'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;6. {{ISBN|1-85567-272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be certain [[lexicon|lexical]] additions (new words) that are brought into play because of the expertise of the community of people within a certain domain of specialization. Registers and discourses therefore differentiate themselves through the use of [[vocabulary]], and at times through the use of style too. People in the medical fraternity, for example, may use some medical terminology in their communication that is specialized to the field of medicine. This is often referred to as being part of the "medical discourse", and so on.

===Standard language===

When a dialect is documented sufficiently through the linguistic description of its grammar, which has emerged through the consensual laws from within its community, it gains political and national recognition through a country or region's policies. That is the stage when a language is considered a standard variety, one whose grammatical laws have now stabilised from within the consent of speech community participants, after sufficient evolution, improvisation, correction, and growth. The English language, besides perhaps the French language, may be examples of languages that have arrived at a stage where they are said to have become standard varieties.

The study of a language's universal properties, on the other hand, include some of the following concepts.

===Lexicon===
The [[lexicon]] is a catalogue of words and terms that are stored in a speaker's mind. The lexicon consists of [[words]] and [[bound morphemes]], which are parts of words that can't stand alone, like [[affixes]]. In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included. [[Lexicography]], closely linked with the domain of semantics, is the science of mapping the words into an [[encyclopedia]] or a [[dictionary]]. The creation and addition of new words (into the lexicon) is called coining or neologization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Ghil'ad Zuckermann |last=Zuckermann |first=Ghil'ad |year=2003 |url=http://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9781403917232 |title=Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1403917232 |pages=2ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the new words are called [[neologism]]s.

It is often believed that a speaker's capacity for language lies in the quantity of words stored in the lexicon. However, this is often considered a myth by linguists. The capacity for the use of language is considered by many linguists to lie primarily in the domain of grammar, and to be linked with [[linguistic competence|competence]], rather than with the growth of vocabulary. Even a very small lexicon is theoretically capable of producing an infinite number of sentences.

===Relativity===
As constructed popularly through the [[linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], relativists believe that the structure of a particular language is capable of influencing the cognitive patterns through which a person shapes his or her [[world view]]. Universalists believe that there are commonalities between human perception as there is in the human capacity for language, while relativists believe that this varies from language to language and person to person. While the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is an elaboration of this idea expressed through the writings of American linguists [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], it was Sapir's student [[Harry Hoijer]] who termed it thus. The 20th century German linguist [[Leo Weisgerber]] also wrote extensively about the theory of relativity. Relativists argue for the case of differentiation at the level of cognition and in semantic domains. The emergence of [[cognitive linguistics]] in the 1980s also revived an interest in linguistic relativity. Thinkers like [[George Lakoff]] have argued that language reflects different cultural metaphors, while the French philosopher of language [[Jacques Derrida]]'s writings have been seen to be closely associated with the relativist movement in linguistics, especially through [[deconstructivism|deconstruction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Writing and Difference |author=Jacques Derrida |translator=Alan Bass |year=1978 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226143293}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was even heavily criticized in the media at the time of his death for his theory of relativism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/nov/18/philosophy |title=Relative Thinking |work=The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Lea |date=18 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structures==
Linguistic structures are pairings of meaning and form.  Any particular pairing of meaning and form is a [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] [[linguistic sign|sign]].  For instance, the meaning "cat" is represented worldwide with a wide variety of different sound patterns (in oral languages), movements of the hands and face (in [[sign language]]s), and written symbols (in written languages). Linguistic patterns have proven their importance for the knowledge engineering field especially with the ever-increasing amount of available data.

Linguists focusing on structure attempt to understand the rules regarding language use that native speakers know (not always consciously).  All linguistic structures can be broken down into component parts that are combined according to (sub)conscious rules, over multiple levels of analysis.  For instance, consider the structure of the word "tenth" on two different levels of analysis.  On the level of internal word structure (known as morphology), the word "tenth" is made up of one linguistic form indicating a number and another form indicating ordinality.  The rule governing the combination of these forms ensures that the ordinality marker "th" follows the number "ten."  On the level of sound structure (known as phonology), structural analysis shows that the "n" sound in "tenth" is made differently from the "n" sound in "ten" spoken alone.  Although most speakers of English are consciously aware of the rules governing internal structure of the word pieces of "tenth", they are less often aware of the rule governing its sound structure.  Linguists focused on structure find and analyze rules such as these, which govern how native speakers use language.

Linguistics has many sub-fields concerned with particular aspects of linguistic structure. The theory that elucidates on these, as propounded by Noam Chomsky, is known as [[generative linguistics|generative theory]] or [[universal grammar]]. These sub-fields range from those focused primarily on form to those focused primarily on meaning. They also run the gamut of level of analysis of language, from individual sounds, to words, to phrases, up to cultural discourse.

===Grammar===

Sub-fields that focus on a grammatical study of language include the following.

* '''[[Phonetics]]''', the study of the physical properties of speech sound production and perception
* '''[[Phonology]]''', the study of sounds as abstract elements in the speaker's mind that distinguish meaning ([[phonemes]])
* '''[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]]''', the study of [[morphemes]], or the internal structures of words and how they can be modified
* '''[[Syntax]]''', the study of how words combine to form grammatical phrases and [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]
* '''[[Semantics]]''', the study of the meaning of words ([[lexical semantics]]) and fixed word combinations ([[phraseology]]), and how these combine to form the [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] of sentences
* '''[[Pragmatics]]''', the study of how [[utterance]]s are used in [[speech acts|communicative acts]], and the role played by context and non-linguistic knowledge in the transmission of meaning
* '''[[Discourse analysis]]''', the analysis of language use in [[Text (literary theory)|texts]] (spoken, written, or signed)
* '''[[Stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]]''', the study of linguistic factors (rhetoric, diction, stress) that place a discourse in context
* '''[[Semiotics]]''', the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication

===Style===
[[Stylistics (field of study)|Stylistics]] is the study and interpretation of texts for aspects of their linguistic and tonal style. Stylistic analysis entails the analysis of description of particular [[dialects]] and [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] used by speech communities. Stylistic features include [[rhetoric]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Rhetoric |author=IA Richards |year=1965 |publisher=Oxford University Press (New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; diction, stress, [[satire]], [[irony]], dialogue, and other forms of phonetic variations. Stylistic analysis can also include the study of language in canonical works of literature, popular fiction, news, advertisements, and other forms of communication in popular culture as well. It is usually seen as a variation in communication that changes from speaker to speaker and community to community. In short, Stylistics is the interpretation of text.

==Approaches==

===Theoretical===
One major debate in linguistics concerns the very nature of language and how it should be understood. Some linguists hypothesize that there is a [[language module|module]] in the [[human brain]] that allows people to undertake linguistic behaviour, which is part of the [[formal grammar|formalist]] approach. This "[[universal grammar]]" is considered to guide children when they learn language and to constrain what sentences are considered grammatical in any human language. Proponents of this view, which is predominant in those schools of linguistics that are based on the [[generative linguistics|generative]] theory of [[Noam Chomsky]], do not necessarily consider that language evolved for communication in particular. They consider instead that it has more to do with the process of structuring human thought (see also [[formal grammar]]).

===Functional===
Another group of linguists, by contrast, use the term "language" to refer to a communication system that developed to support [[cooperation|cooperative activity]] and extend cooperative networks. Such [[functional theories of grammar|theories of grammar]], called "functional", view language as a tool that emerged and is adapted to the communicative needs of its users, and the role of [[cultural evolution]]ary processes are often emphasized over that of [[biological evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Daniela | last=Isac |author2=Charles Reiss  | title= I-language: An Introduction to Linguistics as Cognitive Science, 2nd edition |url= http://linguistics.concordia.ca/i-language/ | year=2013 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0199660179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Linguistics is primarily [[descriptive linguistics|descriptive]].&lt;ref name="Martinet" /&gt; Linguists describe and explain features of language without making subjective judgments on whether a particular feature or usage is "good" or "bad". This is analogous to practice in other sciences: a [[zoologist]] studies the animal kingdom without making subjective judgments on whether a particular species is "better" or "worse" than another.

[[Linguistic prescription|Prescription]], on the other hand, is an attempt to promote particular linguistic usages over others, often favouring a particular dialect or "[[acrolect]]". This may have the aim of establishing a [[Standard language|linguistic standard]], which can aid communication over large geographical areas. It may also, however, be an attempt by speakers of one language or dialect to exert influence over speakers of other languages or dialects (see [[Linguistic imperialism]]). An extreme version of prescriptivism can be found among [[censorship|censors]], who attempt to eradicate words and structures that they consider to be destructive to society. Prescription, however, may be practised appropriately in the [[teaching of language]], like in [[English language teaching|ELT]], where certain fundamental grammatical rules and lexical terms need to be introduced to a second-language speaker who is attempting to [[language acquisition|acquire]] the language.

===Anthropology===
The objective of describing languages is often to uncover cultural knowledge about communities. The use of [[anthropology|anthropological]] methods of investigation on linguistic sources leads to the discovery of certain cultural traits among a speech community through its linguistic features. It is also widely used as a tool in [[language documentation]], with an endeavour to curate [[endangered languages]]. However, now, linguistic inquiry uses the anthropological method to understand cognitive, historical, sociolinguistic and historical processes that languages undergo as they change and evolve, as well as general anthropological inquiry uses the linguistic method to excavate into culture. In all aspects, anthropological inquiry usually uncovers the different variations and relativities that underlie the usage of language.

Most contemporary linguists work under the assumption that [[spoken language|spoken data]] and [[Sign language|signed data]] are more fundamental than [[written language|written data]]. This is because
* Speech appears to be universal to all human beings capable of producing and perceiving it, while there have been many [[culture]]s and speech communities that lack written communication;
* Features appear in speech which aren't always recorded in writing, including [[phonological rule]]s, [[sound change]]s, and [[speech error]]s;
* All natural writing systems reflect a spoken language (or potentially a signed one), even with [[pictographic]] scripts like [[Dongba]] writing [[Naxi language|Naxi]] [[homophone]]s with the same pictogram, and text in writing systems used for [[List of languages by writing system|two languages]] changing to fit the spoken language being recorded;
* Speech evolved before human beings invented writing;
* People learnt to speak and process spoken language more easily and earlier than they did with [[writing]].

Nonetheless, linguists agree that the study of written language can be worthwhile and valuable. For research that relies on [[corpus linguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]], written language is often much more convenient for processing large amounts of linguistic data. Large corpora of spoken language are difficult to create and hard to find, and are typically [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] and written. In addition, linguists have turned to text-based discourse occurring in various formats of [[computer-mediated communication]] as a viable site for linguistic inquiry.

The study of [[writing systems]] themselves, [[graphemics]], is, in any case, considered a branch of linguistics.

===Analysis===
Before the 20th century, linguists analysed language on a [[diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] plane, which was historical in focus. This meant that they would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language from the point of view of how it had changed between then and later. However, with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurean]] linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more [[synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.

At another level, the [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]] plane of linguistic analysis entails the comparison between the way words are sequenced, within the syntax of a sentence. For example, the article "the" is followed by a noun, because of the syntagmatic relation between the words. The [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigmatic]] plane on the other hand, focuses on an analysis that is based on the [[paradigms]] or concepts that are embedded in a given text. In this case, words of the same type or class may be replaced in the text with each other to achieve the same conceptual understanding.

==History==
{{main|History of linguistics}}

===Early grammarians===
{{main|Philology|History of English grammars}}

The formal study of language began in [[India]] with [[Pāṇini]], the 6th century BC grammarian who formulated 3,959 rules of [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Pāṇini's systematic classification of the sounds of Sanskrit into [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s, and word classes, such as nouns and verbs, was the first known instance of its kind. In the [[Middle East]], [[Sibawayh]], a non-Arab, made a detailed description of Arabic in AD 760 in his monumental work, ''Al-kitab fi al-nahw'' ({{lang|ar|الكتاب في النحو}}, ''The Book on Grammar''), the first known author to distinguish between [[phonetics|sounds]] and [[phonology|phonemes (sounds as units of a linguistic system)]].  Western interest in the study of languages began somewhat later than in the East,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=307}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but the grammarians of the classical languages did not use the same methods or reach the same conclusions as their contemporaries in the Indic world. Early interest in language in the West was a part of philosophy, not of grammatical description. The first insights into semantic theory were made by [[Plato]] in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialogue]], where he argues that words denote concepts that are eternal and exist in the world of ideas. This work is the first to use the word [[etymology]] to describe the history of a word's meaning. Around 280 BC, one of [[Alexander the Great]]'s successors founded a university (see [[Musaeum]]) in [[Alexandria]], where a school of philologists studied the ancient texts in and taught [[Greek language|Greek]] to speakers of other languages. While this school was the first to use the word "[[grammar]]" in its modern sense, Plato had used the word in its original meaning as "[[Art of Grammar|téchnē grammatikḗ]]" ({{script|Grek|Τέχνη Γραμματική}}), the "art of writing", which is also the title of one of the most important works of the Alexandrine school by [[Dionysius Thrax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Seuren, Pieter A. M.  |year=1998|title=Western linguistics: An historical introduction|publisher=Wiley-blackwell|isbn=0-631-20891-7|pages=2–24|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], the study of language was subsumed under the topic of philology, the study of ancient languages and texts, practised by such educators as [[Roger Ascham]], [[Wolfgang Ratke]], and [[John Amos Comenius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative philology===
In the 18th century, the first use of the [[comparative method]] by [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]] sparked the rise of [[comparative linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomfield attributes "the first great scientific linguistic work of the world" to [[Jacob Grimm]], who wrote ''Deutsche Grammatik''.&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Bloomfield|1983|p=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon followed by other authors writing similar comparative studies on other language groups of Europe. The study of language was broadened from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] to language in general by [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], of whom Bloomfield asserts:&lt;ref name="Bloomfield 1914 311"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This study received its foundation at the hands of the Prussian statesman and scholar Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835), especially in the first volume of his work on Kavi, the literary language of Java, entitled ''Über die Verschiedenheit des menschlichen Sprachbaues und ihren Einfluß auf die geistige Entwickelung des Menschengeschlechts'' (''On the Variety of the Structure of Human Language and its Influence upon the Mental Development of the Human Race'').&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Structuralism===
{{main|Structuralism (linguistics)}}
Early in the 20th century, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them. By introducing a distinction between [[Diachronic linguistics|diachronic]] and [[Synchronic linguistics|synchronic]] analyses of language, he laid the foundation of the modern discipline of linguistics. Saussure also introduced several basic dimensions of linguistic analysis that are still foundational in many contemporary linguistic theories, such as the distinctions between [[syntagmatic analysis|syntagm]] and [[paradigmatic analysis|paradigm]], and the [[Langue and parole|langue- parole distinction]], distinguishing language as an abstract system (''langue'') from language as a concrete manifestation of this system (''parole'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sources of Semiotic: Readings with Commentary from Antiquity to the Present |first=David S. |last=Clarke |year=1990|location=Carbondale|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|pages=143–144 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vZDmu_4_CUC&amp;pg=PA143 |isbn=9780809316144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Substantial additional contributions following Saussure's definition of a structural approach to language came from [[Prague school (linguistics)|The Prague school]], [[Leonard Bloomfield]], [[Charles F. Hockett]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], [[Émile Benveniste]] and [[Roman Jakobson]].&lt;ref name="Holquist81"&gt;{{harvnb|Holquist|1981|pp=xvii–xviii}}.{{citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Course in General Linguistics |first=Ferdinand |last=de Saussure |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-8022-1493-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generativism===
{{main|Generative linguistics}}
During the last half of the 20th century, following the work of [[Noam Chomsky]], linguistics was dominated by the [[Generative grammar|generativist school]]. While formulated by Chomsky in part as a way to explain how human beings [[language acquisition|acquire language]] and the biological constraints on this acquisition, in practice it has largely been concerned with giving formal accounts of specific phenomena in natural languages. Generative theory is [[Language module|modularist]] and formalist in character. Chomsky built on earlier work of [[Zellig Harris]] to formulate the generative theory of language. According to this theory the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules universal for all humans and underlying the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called [[Universal Grammar]], and for Chomsky describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. For this reason the grammars of individual languages are of importance to linguistics only in so far as they allow us to discern the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.

In the classic formalization of generative grammars first proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Chomsky1956"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Chomsky, Noam | title = Three Models for the Description of Language | journal = [[IRE Transactions on Information Theory]] | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 113 123 | year = 1956 | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chomsky1957"&gt;{{Cite book | author = Chomsky, Noam | title = Syntactic Structures | publisher = [[Mouton de Gruyter|Mouton]] | location = The Hague | year = 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grammar ''G'' consists of the following components:

* A finite set ''N'' of ''[[nonterminal symbol]]s'', none of which appear in strings formed from ''G''.
* A finite set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of ''[[terminal symbol]]s'' that is [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] from ''N''.
* A finite set ''P'' of ''production rules'', that map from one string of symbols to another.
A formal description of language attempts to replicate a speaker's knowledge of the rules of their language, and the aim is to produce a set of rules that is minimally sufficient to successfully model valid linguistic forms.

===Functionalism===
{{main|Functional theories of grammar}}
Functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, it is reasonable to assume that its structures are best analysed and understood with reference to the functions they carry out. Functional theories of grammar differ from [[Formal grammar|formal theories of grammar]], in that the latter seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations, whereas the former defines the functions performed by language and then relates these functions to the linguistic elements that carry them out. This means that functional theories of grammar tend to pay attention to the way language is actually used, and not just to the formal relations between linguistic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Functional Theories of Grammar|author=Nichols, Johanna|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=13|year=1984|quote=[Functional grammar] analyzes grammatical structure, as do formal and structural grammar; but it also analyses the entire communicative situation: the purpose of the speech event, its participants, its discourse context. Functionalists maintain that the communicative situation motivates, constrains, explains, or otherwise determines grammatical structure, and that a structural or formal approach is not merely limited to an artificially restricted data base, but is inadequate as a structural account. Functional grammar, then, differs from formulae and structural grammar in that it purports not to model but to explain; and the explanation is grounded in the communicative situation.|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.13.100184.000525|pages=97–117|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional theories describe language in term of the functions existing at all levels of language.
*Phonological function: the function of the [[phoneme]] is to distinguish between different lexical material.
*Semantic function: ([[Agent (linguistics)|Agent]], [[Patient (linguistics)|Patient]], Recipient, etc.), describing the role of participants in states of affairs or actions expressed.
*Syntactic functions: (e.g. [[Subject (grammar)|Subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|Object]]), defining different perspectives in the presentation of a linguistic expression
*Pragmatic functions: ([[Topic–comment|Theme and Rheme]], [[Topic (linguistics)|Topic]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|Focus]], [[Predicate (grammar)|Predicate]]), defining the informational status of constituents, determined by the pragmatic context of the verbal interaction. Functional descriptions of grammar strive to explain how linguistic functions are performed in communication through the use of linguistic forms.

===Cognitive linguistics===
{{main|Cognitive linguistics}}
Cognitive linguistics emerged as a reaction to generativist theory in the 1970s and 1980s. Led by theorists like [[Ronald Langacker]] and [[George Lakoff]], cognitive linguists propose that language is an [[emergentism|emergent]] property of basic, general-purpose cognitive processes. In contrast to the generativist school of linguistics, cognitive linguistics is non-modularist and functionalist in character. Important developments in cognitive linguistics include [[cognitive grammar]], [[Frame semantics (linguistics)|frame semantics]], and [[conceptual metaphor]], all of which are based on the idea that form–function correspondences based on representations derived from [[embodied cognition|embodied experience]] constitute the basic units of language.

Cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of concepts (sometimes universal, sometimes specific to a particular tongue) that underlie its form. It is thus closely associated with [[semantics]] but is distinct from [[psycholinguistics]], which draws upon empirical findings from cognitive psychology in order to explain the mental processes that underlie the acquisition, storage, production and understanding of speech and writing.  Unlike generative theory, [[cognitive linguistics]] denies that there is an ''autonomous linguistic faculty'' in the mind; it understands grammar in terms of ''conceptualization''; and claims that knowledge of language arises out of ''language use''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognitive Linguistics|author1=Croft, William  |author2=D. Alan Cruse |lastauthoramp=yes|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=2004|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its conviction that knowledge of language is learned through use, cognitive linguistics is sometimes considered to be a functional approach, but it differs from other functional approaches in that it is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language, and not with the use of language as a tool of communication.

==Areas of research==

===Historical linguistics===
[[Historical linguistics|Historical linguists]] study the history of specific languages as well as general characteristics of language change. The study of language change is also referred to as "diachronic linguistics" (the study of how one particular language has changed over time), which can be distinguished from  "synchronic linguistics" (the comparative study of more than one language at a given moment in time without regard to previous stages). Historical linguistics was among the first sub-disciplines to emerge in linguistics, and was the most widely practised form of linguistics in the late 19th century. However, there was a shift to the synchronic approach in the early twentieth century with [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]], and became more predominant in western linguistics with the work of [[Noam Chomsky]].

===Ecolinguistics===
[[Ecolinguistics]] explores the role of language in the life-sustaining interactions of humans, other species and the physical environment. The first aim is to develop linguistic theories which see humans not only as part of society, but also as part of the larger ecosystems that life depends on. The second aim is to show how linguistics can be used to address key ecological issues, from climate change and [[biodiversity loss]] to environmental justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecolinguistics-association.org/ |title=Ecolinguistics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociolinguistics===
[[Sociolinguistics]] is the study of how language is shaped by social factors. This sub-discipline focuses on the synchronic approach of linguistics, and looks at how a language in general, or a set of languages, display variation and varieties at a given point in time. The study of language variation and the different varieties of language through dialects, registers, and ideolects can be tackled through a study of style, as well as through analysis of discourse. Sociolinguists research on both style and discourse in language, and also study the theoretical factors that are at play between language and society.

===Developmental linguistics===
[[Developmental linguistics]] is the study of the development of linguistic ability in individuals, particularly [[Language acquisition|the acquisition of language]] in childhood. Some of the questions that developmental linguistics looks into is how children acquire different languages, how adults can acquire a second language, and what the process of language acquisition is.

===Neurolinguistics===
[[Neurolinguistics]] is the study of the structures in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[theoretical linguistics]], and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and psycholinguistics propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using [[aphasiology]], [[brain imaging]], electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mariën|first=Peter|last2=Manto|first2=Mario|date=2017-10-25|title=Cerebellum as a Master-Piece for Linguistic Predictability|journal=Cerebellum (London, England)|volume=17|issue=2|pages=101–103|doi=10.1007/s12311-017-0894-1|issn=1473-4230|pmid=29071518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied linguistics==
{{Main|Applied linguistics}}
Linguists are largely concerned with finding and [[descriptive linguistics|describing]] the generalities and varieties both within particular languages and among all languages. [[Applied linguistics]] takes the results of those findings and "applies" them to other areas. Linguistic research is commonly applied to areas such as [[language education]], [[lexicography]], [[translation]], [[language planning]], which involves governmental policy implementation related to language use, and [[natural language processing]]. "Applied linguistics" has been argued to be something of a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controversies in Applied Linguistics (pp. 288) |author=Barbara Seidlhofer |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0194374440}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied linguists actually focus on making sense of and engineering solutions for real-world linguistic problems, and not literally "applying" existing technical knowledge from linguistics. Moreover, they commonly apply technical knowledge from multiple sources, such as sociology (e.g., conversation analysis) and anthropology. ([[Constructed language]] fits under Applied linguistics.)

Today, computers are widely used in many areas of applied linguistics. [[Speech synthesis]] and [[speech recognition]] use phonetic and phonemic knowledge to provide voice interfaces to computers. Applications of [[computational linguistics]] in [[machine translation]], [[computer-assisted translation]], and [[natural language processing]] are areas of applied linguistics that have come to the forefront. Their influence has had an effect on theories of syntax and semantics, as modelling syntactic and semantic theories on computers constraints.

Linguistic analysis is a sub-discipline of applied linguistics used by many governments to verify the claimed [[nationality]] of people seeking asylum who do not hold the necessary documentation to prove their claim.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Applied Linguistics and Language Analysis in Asylum Seeker Cases | last=Eades | first=Diana | journal=Applied Linguistics | year=2005 | volume=26 | issue=4 | pages=503–526 | doi=10.1093/applin/ami021 | url=http://songchau.googlepages.com/503.pdf | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often takes the form of an [[interview]] by personnel in an immigration department. Depending on the country, this interview is conducted either in the asylum seeker's [[native language]] through an [[language interpretation|interpreter]] or in an international ''[[lingua franca]]'' like English.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt; Australia uses the former method, while Germany employs the latter; the Netherlands uses either method depending on the languages involved.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt; Tape recordings of the interview then undergo language analysis, which can be done either by private contractors or within a department of the government. In this analysis, linguistic features of the asylum seeker are used by analysts to make a determination about the speaker's nationality. The reported findings of the linguistic analysis can play a critical role in the government's decision on the refugee status of the asylum seeker.&lt;ref name="Linguistic Analysis"/&gt;

==Interdisciplinary fields==
Within the broad discipline of linguistics, various emerging sub-disciplines focus on a more detailed description and analysis of language, and are often organized on the basis of the school of thought and theoretical approach that they pre-suppose, or the external factors that influence them.

===Semiotics===
[[Semiotics]] is the study of sign processes (semiosis), or signification and communication, signs, and symbols, both individually and grouped into sign systems, including the study of how meaning is constructed and understood. Semioticians often do not restrict themselves to linguistic communication when studying the use of signs but extend the meaning of "sign" to cover all kinds of cultural symbols. Nonetheless, semiotic disciplines closely related to linguistics are [[literary studies]], [[discourse analysis]], [[text linguistics]], and [[philosophy of language]]. Semiotics, within the linguistics paradigm, is the study of the relationship between language and culture. Historically, [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ferdinand De Saussure]]'s structuralist theories influenced the study of signs extensively until the late part of the 20th century, but later, post-modern and post-structural thought, through language philosophers including [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Michel Foucault]], and others, have also been a considerable influence on the discipline in the late part of the 20th century and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Classical Roots of Post-Structuralism: Lacan, Derrida and Foucault |journal=International Journal of the Classical Tradition  |first= Paul Allen |last=Miller |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |jstor=30222818|ref=harv|volume=5 |issue=2  |pages=204–225 |doi=10.1007/bf02688423}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories emphasize the role of language variation, and the idea of subjective usage, depending on external elements like social and cultural factors, rather than merely on the interplay of formal elements.

===Language documentation===
Since the inception of the discipline of linguistics, linguists have been concerned with describing and analysing previously [[language documentation|undocumented languages]]. Starting with [[Franz Boas]] in the early 1900s, this became the main focus of American linguistics until the rise of formal structural linguistics in the mid-20th century. This focus on language documentation was partly motivated by a concern to document the rapidly [[language death|disappearing]] languages of indigenous peoples. The ethnographic dimension of the Boasian approach to language description played a role in the development of disciplines such as [[sociolinguistics]], [[anthropological linguistics]], and [[linguistic anthropology]], which investigate the relations between language, culture, and society.

The emphasis on linguistic description and documentation has also gained prominence outside North America, with the documentation of rapidly dying indigenous languages becoming a primary focus in many university programmes in linguistics. Language description is a work-intensive endeavour, usually requiring years of field work in the language concerned, so as to equip the linguist to write a sufficiently accurate reference grammar. Further, the task of documentation requires the linguist to collect a substantial corpus in the language in question, consisting of texts and recordings, both sound and video, which can be stored in an accessible format within open repositories, and used for further research.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelman, Nikolaus "Language documentation: What is it and what is it good for?" in P. Gippert, Jost, Nikolaus P Himmelmann &amp; Ulrike Mosel. (2006) ''Essentials of Language documentation''. Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin &amp; New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
The sub-field of [[translation]] includes the translation of written and spoken texts across mediums, from digital to print and spoken. To translate literally means to transmute the meaning from one language into another. Translators are often employed by organizations, such as travel agencies as well as governmental embassies to facilitate communication between two speakers who do not know each other's language. Translators are also employed to work within [[computational linguistics]] setups like [[Google Translate]] for example, which is an automated, programmed facility to translate words and phrases between any two or more given languages. Translation is also conducted by publishing houses, which convert works of writing from one language to another in order to reach varied audiences. Academic Translators, specialize and semi specialize on various other disciplines such as; Technology, Science, Law, Economics etc.

===Biolinguistics===
[[Biolinguistics]] is the study of the biology and evolution of language. It is a highly interdisciplinary field, including linguists, biologists, neuroscientists, psychologists, mathematicians, and others. By shifting the focus of investigation in linguistics to a comprehensive scheme that embraces natural sciences, it seeks to yield a framework by which the fundamentals of the faculty of language are understood.

===Clinical linguistics===
Clinical linguistics is the application of linguistic theory to the fields of [[Speech-Language Pathology]]. Speech language pathologists work on corrective measures to cure [[communication disorders]] and swallowing disorders

Chaika (1990) showed that people with schizophrenia who display speech disorders, like rhyming inappropriately, have attentional dysfunction, as when a patient, shown a colour chip and then asked to identify it, responded "looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a roll in the hay. Heyday, May Day." The color chip was actually clay-colored, so his first response was correct.'

However, most people suppress or ignore words which rhyme with what they've said unless they are deliberately producing a pun, poem or rap. Even then, the speaker shows connection between words chosen for rhyme and an overall meaning in discourse. People with schizophrenia with speech dysfunction show no such relation between rhyme and reason. Some even produce stretches of gibberish combined with recognizable words.&lt;ref&gt;Chaika, Elaine Ostrach. 1990. Understanding Psychotic Speech: Between Freud and Chomsky. Chas. Thomas Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational linguistics===
[[Computational linguistics]] is the study of linguistic issues in a way that is "computationally responsible", i.e., taking careful note of computational consideration of algorithmic specification and computational complexity, so that the linguistic theories devised can be shown to exhibit certain desirable computational properties and their implementations. Computational linguists also work on computer language and software development.

===Evolutionary linguistics===
[[Evolutionary linguistics]] is the interdisciplinary study of the emergence of the language faculty through [[human evolution]], and also the application of [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] to the study of cultural evolution among different languages. It is also a study of the dispersal of various languages across the globe, through movements among ancient communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Croft | first = William |date=October 2008 | title = Evolutionary Linguistics | journal = Annual Review of Anthropology | volume = 37 | pages = 219–234  | publisher = Annual Reviews | doi = 10.1146/annurev.anthro.37.081407.085156 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic linguistics===
[[Forensic linguistics]] is the application of linguistic analysis to [[forensics]]. Forensic analysis investigates on the style, language, lexical use, and other linguistic and grammatical features used in the legal context to provide evidence in courts of law. Forensic linguists have also contributed expertise in criminal cases.

[[File:Wildgansflug.jpg|thumb|A skein of geese]]

This is a list of English [[terms of venery]] (''venery'' being an archaic word for hunting), comprising terms from a tradition that arose in the [[Late Middle Ages]], at least partly from the ''[[Book of Saint Albans]]'' of [[1486]], a historic list of "company terms". The present list also includes more common collective terms (such as "herd" and "flock") for some animals.

{{Compact ToC|seealso=yes|refs=yes|align=center}}

Standard terms for particular groups are listed first in each group and shown in bold.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2504">In [[linguistics]], [[language]]s are often studied in terms of six major subsystems, which relate to major subfields within linguistics. In addition, particular subfields of linguistic inquiry may divide their subject matter into more specific subsystems. This list contains links to commonly studied language subsystems.

== Major subsystems ==

Linguists recognize seven major language subsystems:

* [[Phonetics]], the [[sound]]s of human [[speech]], including their physiological production, acoustic properties, auditory perception, and neurophysiological status;
* [[Phonology]], the systematic use of sound to encode meaning in any spoken [[human language]] ([[natural language]] or [[constructed language]]);
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]], the structure of meaningful units of a language, such as [[word]]s and [[affix]]es;
* [[Syntax]], the principles and rules for constructing [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, and the like in human languages;
* [[Semantics]], the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaningful]] content of words, [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], or other language elements;
* [[Pragmatics]], the ways in which [[Context (language use)|context]] contributes to meaning in natural language use; and
* [[Lexicology]], the study of words.

This division varies among linguists and authors. For example, phonetics and phonology are occasionally merged into one subsystem. Morphology and lexicology can also be merged.

== Sociolinguistics ==

* The term ''[[Variety (linguistics)|variety]]'' in [[sociolinguistics]] is used as a cover term for dialects, registers, and other forms of language, including standard languages.
** [[Dialect]] refers to a variety that is used by a particular group of speakers.
** [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|Accent]] refers to a specific system of pronunciation.
** [[Idiolect]] refers to the variety that is used by an individual speaker.
** [[Register (sociolinguistics)|Register]] or [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]] refer to a variety that is used in a particular setting or for a particular purpose.
** [[Standard language]] is a variety promoted by some social group, either officially or unofficially, as the preferred form.
* [[Abstand and ausbau languages]] are concepts developed by sociolinguists to describe related language varieties, ranging from dialects of a single language to distinct languages.

[[File:Logos.svg|Left|thumb|[[Greek alphabet|Greek spelling]] of ''logos'']]

'''''Logos''''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|ɒ|s|,_|ˈ|l|ɒ|ɡ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|l|oʊ|ɡ|oʊ|s}}; {{lang-grc|[[wikt:λόγος|λόγος]]|lógos}}; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}, {{transl|grc|légō}}, {{Literal translation|'I say'|lk=on}}) is a term in [[Western philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[rhetoric]], and [[religion]] derived from a Greek word variously meaning "ground", "plea", "opinion", "expectation", "word", "speech", "account", "reason", "proportion", and "discourse",&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0058%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: logos, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Entrys[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; but it became a technical term in [[Western philosophy]] beginning with [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa| 535| 475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}), who used the term for a principle of order and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Heraclitus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' is the logic behind an argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html |title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos |last=Butler|first=S|website=members.tripod.com|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Logos'' tries to persuade an audience using [[logical argument]]s and supportive evidence. ''Logos'' is a persuasive technique often used in writing and rhetoric.

Ancient Greek philosophers used the term in different ways. The [[sophist]]s used the term to mean [[discourse]]; [[Aristotle]] applied the term to refer to "reasoned discourse"&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"/&gt; or "the argument" in the field of rhetoric, and considered it one of the three [[modes of persuasion]] alongside ''[[ethos]]'' and ''[[pathos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, Christof, "[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2010/entries/aristotle-rhetoric/ Aristotle's Rhetoric]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers identified the term with the [[divine]] animating principle pervading the Universe. Within [[Hellenistic Judaism]], [[Philo of Alexandria]] ({{Circa| 20&amp;nbsp;BC| 50&amp;nbsp;AD}}) adopted the term into [[Jewish philosophy]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"&gt;''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (2nd ed): Philo Judaeus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of John]] identifies the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], through which all things are made, as divine (''[[God|theos]]''),&lt;ref name = "May Metzger"&gt;May, Herbert G. and Bruce M. Metzger. ''The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha''. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; and further identifies [[Jesus Christ]] as the [[incarnate]] Logos. The term is also used in [[Sufism]], and the analytical psychology of [[Carl Jung]].

Despite the conventional translation as "word", it is not used for a [[word]] in the grammatical sense; instead, the term ''lexis'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέξις|λέξις]]}}, {{transl|grc|léxis}}) was used.&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fcis ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: lexis, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; However, both ''logos'' and ''lexis'' derive from the same verb {{transl|grc|légō}} ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:λέγω|λέγω]]}}), meaning  "(I) count, tell, say, speak".&lt;ref name="LSJlogos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlexis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LSJlego"&gt;Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dle%2Fgw2 ''An Intermediate Greek–English Lexicon'']: legō, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and Professor Jeanne Fahnestock describes logos as a "premise". She states that, to find the reason behind a rhetor's backing of a certain position or stance, one must acknowledge the different "premises" that the [[rhetor]] applies via his or her chosen diction.&lt;ref name="members.tripod.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fahnestock|first1=Jeanne|title=The Appeals: Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://members.tripod.com/butler_s/f2002-1002/appeals.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rhetor's success, she argues, will come down to "certain objects of agreement...between arguer and audience". "Logos is logical appeal, and the term logic is derived from it. It is normally used to describe facts and figures that support the speaker's topic."&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aristotle's Three Modes of Persuasion in Rhetoric|url=http://www.mountainman.com.au/ESSENES/aristotles_modes_of_persuasion_in_rhetoric.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, logos is credited with appealing to the audience's sense of logic, with the definition of "logic" being concerned with the thing as it is known.&lt;ref name="mountainman.com.au"/&gt;
Furthermore, one can appeal to this sense of logic in two ways.  The first is through [[inductive reasoning]], providing the audience with relevant examples and using them to point back to the overall statement.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethos, Pathos, and Logos|url=http://courses.durhamtech.edu/perkins/aris.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second is through [[Deductive reasoning|deductive]] [[enthymeme]], providing the audience with general scenarios and then indicating commonalities among them.&lt;ref name="Ethos, Pathos, and Logos"/&gt;

Philo distinguished between ''logos prophorikos'' ("the uttered word") and the ''logos endiathetos'' ("the word remaining within").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Adam Kamesar|title=The ''Logos Endiathetos'' and the ''Logos Prophorikos'' in Allegorical Interpretation: Philo and the D-Scholia to the ''Iliad'' |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501000000*/https://web.duke.edu/classics/grbs/FTexts/44/Kamesar.pdf |journal=Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies (GRBS)|volume=44|year=2004|pages=163–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] also spoke of the ''[[logos spermatikos]]'' (the generative principle of the Universe) which foreshadows related concepts in [[Neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L. Jeffrey |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zD6xVr1CizIC&amp;pg=PA459&amp;dq=Neoplatonism+logos#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20prophorikos%20the%20uttered%20word%20and%20the%20logos%20endiathetos%20the%20word%20remaining%20within&amp;f=false |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co|year=1992|isbn=0-8028-3634-8|page=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early translators of the Greek [[New Testament]] such as [[Jerome]] (in the 4th century AD) were frustrated by the inadequacy of any single Latin word to convey the meaning of the word ''Logos'' as used to describe Jesus Christ in the [[Gospel of John]]. The [[Vulgate]] Bible usage of {{lang|la|in principio erat verbum}} was thus constrained to use the (perhaps inadequate) noun {{lang|la|verbum}} for "word", but later [[Romance language]] translations had the advantage of nouns such as {{lang|fr|le mot}} in French. Reformation translators took another approach. [[Martin Luther]] rejected {{lang|de|Zeitwort}} (verb) in favor of {{lang|de|Wort}} (word), for instance, although later commentators repeatedly turned to a more dynamic use involving ''the living word'' as felt by Jerome and [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature |author=David L.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==

===Heraclitus===
{{Further|Heraclitus#Logos}}
The writing of [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa|535|475&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}})&lt;!---maintain consistency throughout article re: BC vs. BCE---&gt; was the first place where the word ''logos'' was given special attention in [[ancient Greek philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, ''Greek Philosophical Terms'', New York University Press, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; although Heraclitus seems to use the word with a meaning not significantly different from the way in which it was used in ordinary Greek of his time.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie]], ''A History of Greek Philosophy'', vol. 1, Cambridge University Press, 1962, pp. 419ff.&lt;/ref&gt; For Heraclitus, ''logos'' provided the link between rational discourse and the world's rational structure.&lt;ref&gt;''The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This ''logos'' holds always but humans always prove unable to ever understand it, both before hearing it and when they have first heard it. For though all things come to be in accordance with this ''logos'', humans are like the inexperienced when they experience such words and deeds as I set out, distinguishing each in accordance with its nature and saying how it is. But other people fail to notice what they do when awake, just as they forget what they do while asleep.|[[Diels–Kranz]]|22B1}}

{{quote|For this reason it is necessary to follow what is common. But although the ''logos'' is common, most people live as if they had their own private understanding.|Diels–Kranz|22B2}}

{{quote|Listening not to me but to the ''logos'' it is wise to agree that all things are one.|Diels–Kranz|22B50&lt;ref&gt;Translations from Richard D. McKirahan, ''Philosophy before Socrates'', Hackett, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

What ''logos'' means here is not certain; it may mean "reason" or "explanation" in the sense of an objective cosmic law, or it may signify nothing more than "saying" or "wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;''Handboek geschiedenis van de wijsbegeerte 1'', Article by Jaap Mansveld &amp; Keimpe Algra, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, an independent existence of a universal ''logos'' was clearly suggested by Heraclitus.&lt;ref&gt;W. K. C. Guthrie, ''The Greek Philosophers: From Thales to Aristotle'', Methuen, 1967, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle identifies two specific types of persuasion methods: artistic and inartistic.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Discovering the Arguments: Artistic and Inartistic Proofs|url=http://www.classicalwriting.com/blog/2010/01/12/discovering-the-arguments-artistic-and-inartistic-proofs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines artistic proofs as arguments that the [[rhetor]] generates and creates on their own. Examples of these include  relationships, testimonies, and conjugates. He defines inartistic proofs as arguments that the rhetor quotes using information from a non-self-generated source. Examples of these include laws, contracts, and [[oath]]s.&lt;ref name="classicalwriting.com"/&gt;

===Aristotle's rhetorical logos===
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|Aristotle, 384–322 BC.]]
Following one of the other meanings of the word, [[Aristotle]] gave ''logos'' a different technical definition in the ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', using it as meaning argument from reason, one of the three [[modes of persuasion]]. The other two modes are ''[[pathos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθος|πᾰ́θος]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthos}}), which refers to persuasion by means of emotional appeal, "putting the hearer into a certain frame of mind";&lt;ref name="AR"&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', in Patricia P. Matsen, Philip B. Rollinson, and Marion Sousa, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R3iLyz9zd7cC&amp;pg=PA120 Readings from Classical Rhetoric]'', SIU Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-8093-1592-0}}, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[ethos]]'' ({{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἦθος|ἦθος]]}}, {{transl|grc|êthos}}), persuasion through convincing listeners of one's "moral character".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt; According to Aristotle, ''logos'' relates to "the speech itself, in so far as it proves or seems to prove".&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/rhetoric.1.i.html translation by W. Rhys Roberts], this reads "the proof, or apparent proof, provided by the words of the speech itself".&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Paul Rahe:

{{Quote|For Aristotle, ''logos'' is something more refined than the capacity to make private feelings public: it enables the human being to perform as no other animal can; it makes it possible for him to perceive and make clear to others through reasoned discourse the difference between what is advantageous and what is harmful, between what is just and what is unjust, and between what is good and what is evil.&lt;ref name="PaulRahe"&gt;Paul Anthony Rahe, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Zymp_kM33ZcC&amp;pg=PA21 Republics Ancient and Modern: The Ancien Régime in Classical Greece]'', University of North Carolina Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-8078-4473-X}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'' can all be appropriate at different times.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Garver, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PoXnLHQ5mgwC&amp;pg=PA114 Aristotle's Rhetoric: An art of character]'', University of Chicago Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0-226-28424-7}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments from reason (logical arguments) have some advantages, namely that [[data]] are (ostensibly) difficult to manipulate, so it is harder to argue against such an argument; and such arguments make the speaker look prepared and knowledgeable to the audience, enhancing ''ethos''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} On the other hand, trust in the speaker—built through ''ethos''—enhances the appeal of arguments from reason.&lt;ref&gt;Garver, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Wardy]] suggests that what Aristotle rejects in supporting the use of ''logos'' "is not emotional appeal [[Per se (Latin)|per se]], but rather emotional appeals that have no 'bearing on the issue', in that the ''pathē'' [{{lang|grc|[[wikt:πάθη|πᾰ́θη]]}}, {{transl|grc|páthē}}] they stimulate lack, or at any rate are not shown to possess, any intrinsic connection with the point at issue—as if an advocate were to try to whip an [[antisemitic]] audience into a fury because the accused is Jewish; or as if another in drumming up support for a politician were to exploit his listeners's reverential feelings for the politician's ancestors".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wardy, "Mighty Is the Truth and It Shall Prevail?", in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QkIn37h_TMUC&amp;pg=PA64 Essays on Aristotle's Rhetoric]'', Amélie Rorty (ed), University of California Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-520-20228-7}}, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle comments on the three modes by stating: 
{{Quote|Persuasion is clearly a sort of demonstration, since we are most fully persuaded when we consider a thing to have been demonstrated. Of the modes of persuasion furnished by the spoken word there are three kinds. ... Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. ... Secondly, persuasion may come through the hearers, when the speech stirs their emotions. ... Thirdly, persuasion is effected through the speech itself when we have proved a truth or an apparent truth by means of the persuasive arguments suitable to the case in question.{{whose translation}}|Aristotle|''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]''|350&amp;nbsp;BC}}

===Stoics===
[[Stoic philosophy]] began with [[Zeno of Citium]] {{Circa|300&amp;nbsp;BC|lk=on}}, in which the ''logos'' was the active [[reason]] pervading and animating the [[Universe]]. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with [[God]] or [[Nature]]. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal logos'' ("''[[logos spermatikos]]''"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos''.&lt;ref&gt;Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37–38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics took all activity to imply a ''logos'' or spiritual principle. As the operative principle of the world, the ''logos'' was ''[[anima mundi]]'' to them, a concept which later influenced [[Philo of Alexandria]], although he derived the contents of the term from Plato.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wUF15rypDscC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;dq=Anima+mundi+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Jwl8TP_xI8KSjAfUm-jSDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Anima%20mundi%20logos&amp;f=false ''Studies in European Philosophy''], by James Lindsay, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4067-0173-4}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In his Introduction to the 1964 edition of [[Marcus Aurelius]]' ''[[Meditations]]'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth wrote that "''Logos'' ... had long been one of the leading terms of [[Stoicism]], chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=24 |isbn=0-14044140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isocrates' logos===
Public discourse on ancient Greek rhetoric has historically emphasized Aristotle's appeals to ''logos'', ''pathos'', and ''ethos'', while less attention has been directed to [[Isocrates]]' teachings about philosophy and ''logos'',&lt;ref name="David M 2010"&gt;David M. Timmerman and [[Edward Schiappa]], ''Classical Greek Rhetorical Theory and the Disciplining of Discourse'' (London: Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010): 43–66&lt;/ref&gt; and their partnership in generating an ethical, mindful ''[[polis]]''. Isocrates does not provide a single definition of ''logos'' in his work, but Isocratean ''logos'' characteristically focuses on speech, reason, and civic discourse.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt; He was concerned with establishing the "common good" of [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] citizens, which he believed could be achieved through the pursuit of philosophy and the application of ''logos''.&lt;ref name="David M 2010"/&gt;

==In Hellenistic Judaism==
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
In the [[Septuagint]] the term ''logos'' is used for the word of God in the creation of heaven in Psalm 33:6, and in some related contexts.

===Philo of Alexandria===
[[Philo]] ({{Circa|20&amp;nbsp;BC|50&amp;nbsp;AD|lk=on}}), a [[Hellenized Jew]], used the term Logos to mean an intermediary divine being or [[demiurge]].&lt;ref name="cdpPhilo"/&gt; Philo followed the Platonic distinction between [[Hylic|imperfect matter]] and perfect Form, and therefore intermediary beings were necessary to bridge the enormous gap between God and the material world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"&gt;[[Frederick Copleston]], ''A History of Philosophy'', Volume 1, Continuum, 2003, pp. 458–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Logos'' was the highest of these intermediary beings, and was called by Philo "the first-born of God".&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;
Philo also wrote that "the Logos of the living God is the bond of everything, holding all things together and binding all the parts, and prevents them from being dissolved and separated".&lt;ref&gt;Philo, ''De Profugis'', cited in [https://archive.org/details/hellenismchristi00frieiala Gerald Friedlander, ''Hellenism and Christianity'', P. Vallentine, 1912, pp. 114–15.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato's Theory of Forms]] was located within the Logos, but the Logos also acted on behalf of God in the physical world.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt; In particular, the [[Angel of the Lord]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Old Testament]]) was identified with the Logos by Philo, who also said that the Logos was God's instrument in the creation of the Universe.&lt;ref name="hpPhilo"/&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main article|Logos (Christianity)}}
[[File:Prologus Ioanni Vulgata Clementina.jpg|thumb|''In principio erat verbum'', [[Latin (language)|Latin]] for ''In the beginning was the Word'', from the [[Clementine Vulgate]], [[Gospel of John]], 1:1–18.]]
In [[Christology]], the ''Logos'' ({{lang-el|Λόγος|lit='Word", "Discourse", or "Reason'}})&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos {{lang|grc|λόγος}}] at [[LSJ]] online.&lt;/ref&gt; is a name or title of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]], seen as the pre-existent second [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)#Christian_theology|person]] of the [[Trinity]]. The concept derives from [[John 1:1]], which in the [[Douay–Rheims]], [[King James Version|King James]], [[New International Version|New International]], and other versions of the [[Bible]], reads:
{{quote|In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|DRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|1:1|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the translations, "Word" is used for Λόγος, although the term is often used [[transliterated]] but untranslated in theological discourse.
The Koine Greek reads, "Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος, καὶ ὁ λόγος ἦν '''πρὸς τὸν θεόν''', '''καὶ θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος'''.(En arkhêi ên ho lógos, kaì ho lógos ên ''pròs tòn theón, kaì theòs ên ho lógos''.) The definite article is used with 'theos/god', making it 'God', and the second usage is indefinite (without an article), rendering it 'god'. Thus David Bentley Hart translates it as 'In the origin there was the Logos, and the Logos was present with GOD, and the Logos was god'.&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart. ''The New Testament: A Translation''. Yale, 2017, ISBN 0-978-0-300-18609-3, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many ancient Greek scholars, including Dr. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton (Professor of New Testament Language and Literature) explains that concepts of definite articles in English and Koine Greek are not similar: "In the New World Translation the opening verse of the Gospel according to John is mistranslated as follows: “Originally the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god.” A footnote which is added to the first word, “Originally,” reads, “Literally, In (At) a beginning.” By using here the indefinite article “a” the translators have overlooked the well-known fact that in Greek grammar nouns may be definite for various reasons, whether or not the Greek definite article is present. A prepositional phrase, for example, where the definite article is not expressed, can be quite definite in Greek, [in Hebrew 10:31, "εις χειρας θεου ζωντος" is properly rendered (even by the New World Translation) with the definite article expressed twice, “into the hands of the living God.”] as in fact it is in John 1:1"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Metzger|first=Bruce M.|date=April 1953|title=The Jehovah'S Witnesses and Jesus Christ: A Biblical and Theological Appraisal|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/004057365301000110|journal=Theology Today|volume=10|pages=65-85|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://believersweb.org/view.cfm?ID=729|title=WHAT GREEK SCHOLARS REALLY THINK!|last=|first=|date=2003|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letusreason.org/jw38.htm|title=The dispute on Jn.1:1|last=|first=|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhema==
The word ''logos'' has been used in different senses along with ''[[rhema]]''. Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] used the term ''logos'' along with ''rhema'' to refer to sentences and propositions.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P.

==Neoplatonism==
[[File:Plotinus and disciples.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Plotinus]] with his disciples.]]
[[Neoplatonist]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] ({{Circa|204/5|lk=on}}{{snd}}270&amp;nbsp;AD) used the term "Logos" in ways that drew on Plato and the [[Stoics]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael F. Wagner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1ZJMzbtNFNsC&amp;pg=PA116 Neoplatonism and Nature: Studies in Plotinus' Enneads]'', Volume 8 of ''Studies in Neoplatonism'', SUNY Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-7914-5271-9}}, pp. 116–17.&lt;/ref&gt; but the term Logos was interpreted in different ways throughout Neoplatonism, and similarities to Philo's concept of Logos appear to be accidental.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Rist, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=n49OAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA84 Plotinus: The road to reality]'', Cambridge University Press, 1967, {{ISBN|0-521-06085-0}}, pp. 84–101.&lt;/ref&gt; The Logos was a key element in the [[meditation]]s of Plotinus&lt;ref&gt;''Between Physics and Nous: Logos as Principle of Meditation in Plotinus'', The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, 1999, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; regarded as the first Neoplatonist. Plotinus referred back to [[Heraclitus]] and as far back as [[Thales]]&lt;ref&gt;Handboek Geschiedenis van de Wijsbegeerte I, Article by Carlos Steel&lt;/ref&gt; in interpreting Logos as the principle of meditation, existing as the interrelationship between the [[hypostases]]—the [[soul]], the intellect (''[[nous]]''), and the [[Monad (philosophy)|One]].&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of Neoplatonic Studies, Volumes 7–8, Institute of Global Cultural Studies, Binghamton University, 1999, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus used a trinity concept that consisted of "The One", the "Spirit", and "Soul". The comparison with the Christian [[Trinity]] is inescapable, but for Plotinus these were not equal and "The One" was at the highest level, with the "Soul" at the lowest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Jcg83ynsJEwC&amp;pg=PA311&amp;dq=plotinus+trinity&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Is18TLriMt6U4gakq5CGBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=plotinus%20trinity&amp;f=false] ''Ancient philosophy'' by Anthony Kenny 2007 {{ISBN|0-19-875272-5}} p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; For Plotinus, the relationship between the three elements of his trinity is conducted by the outpouring of Logos from the higher principle, and ''[[Eros (concept)|eros]]'' (loving) upward from the lower principle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Enneads'' by Plotinus, [[Stephen MacKenna]], John M.

==Islam==
{{Main article|Logos (Islam)}}
The concept of the ''logos'' also exists in [[Islam]], where it was definitively articulated primarily in the writings of the classical [[Sunni]] [[Sufism|mystics]] and [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], as well as by certain [[Shi'a]] thinkers, during the [[Islamic Golden Age]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardet, L., "Kalām", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;Boer, Tj. de and Rahman, F., "ʿAḳl", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sunni Islam]], the concept of the ''logos'' has been given many different names by the denomination's [[metaphysician]]s, mystics, and philosophers, including ''ʿaql'' ("Intellect"), ''al-insān al-kāmil'' ("Universal Man"), ''kalimat Allāh'' ("Word of God"), ''haqīqa muḥammadiyya'' ("The Muhammadan Reality"), and ''nūr muḥammadī'' ("The Muhammadan Light").

===''ʿAql''===
One of the names given to a concept very much like the Christian Logos by the classical Muslim metaphysicians is ''ʿaql'', which is the "Arabic equivalent to the Greek {{lang|grc|[[nous|νοῦς]]}} ('intellect')."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; In the writings of the Islamic [[Neoplatonist]] philosophers, such as [[al-Farabi]] ({{Circa|872|950&amp;nbsp;AD}}) and [[Avicenna]] (d. 1037),&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt; the idea of the ''ʿaql'' was presented in a manner that both resembled "the late Greek doctrine" and, likewise, "corresponded in many respects to the Logos Christology."&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;

The concept of Logos in Sufism is used to relate the "Uncreated" (God) to the "Created" (humanity). In Sufism, for the Deist, no contact between man and God can be possible without the Logos. The Logos is everywhere and always the same, but its personification is "unique" within each region. [[Jesus]] and [[Muhammad]] are seen as the personifications of the Logos, and this is what enables them to speak in such absolute terms.&lt;ref&gt;''Sufism: love &amp; wisdom'' by Jean-Louis Michon, Roger Gaetani 2006 {{ISBN|0-941532-75-5}} p. 242 [https://books.google.com/books?id=UVt-EvXnEC4C&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BMNQNOHXKOMC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false ''Sufi essays''] by Seyyed Hossein Nasr 1973{{ ISBN|0-87395-233-2}} p. 148]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the boldest and most radical attempts to reformulate the Neoplatonic concepts into Sufism arose with the philosopher [[Ibn Arabi]], who traveled widely in Spain and North Africa. His concepts were expressed in two major works ''The Ringstones of Wisdom'' (''Fusus al-Hikam'') and ''The Meccan Illuminations'' (''Al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya''). To Ibn Arabi, every prophet corresponds to a reality which he called a Logos ([[Kalimah]]), as an aspect of the unique Divine Being. In his view the Divine Being would have for ever remained hidden, had it not been for the prophets, with Logos providing the link between man and divinity.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N. Hanif 2002 {{ISBN|81-7625-266-2}} p. 39 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bhpr7RTLMAC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Sufism+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PDR6TJKSGIel4Aai99nDBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Sufism%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Arabi seems to have adopted his version of the Logos concept from Neoplatonic and Christian sources,&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Frazee, "Ibn al-'Arabī and Spanish Mysticism of the Sixteenth Century", ''Numen'' '''14''' (3), Nov 1967, pp. 229–40.&lt;/ref&gt; although (writing in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] rather than Greek) he used more than twenty different terms when discussing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Little |first=John T. |last2= |first2= |date=January 1987 |title=AL-INSĀN AL-KĀMIL: THE PERFECT MAN ACCORDING TO IBN AL-'ARAB? |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x/abstract |journal=The Muslim World |publisher=Hartford Seminary |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=43–54 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1987.tb02785.x |access-date=30 May 2016 |quote="Ibn al-'Arabi uses no less than twenty-two different terms to describe the various aspects under which this single Logos may be viewed."}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dobie  |first=Robert J. |date=17 November 2009 |title=Logos and Revelation: Ibn 'Arabi, Meister Eckhart, and Mystical Hermeneutics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWVwT3UpthUC&amp;pg=PA225 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=The Catholic University of America Press  |page=225 |isbn= 081321677X |quote="For Ibn Arabi, the Logos or "Universal Man" was a mediating link between individual human beings and the divine essence."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Sufi writers also show the influence of the Neoplatonic Logos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Henry Whinfield]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=l0vHUo0wnlgC&amp;pg=PR25 Masnavi I Ma'navi: The spiritual couplets of Maulána Jalálu-'d-Dín Muhammad Rúmí]'', Routledge, 2001 (originally published 1898), {{ISBN|0-415-24531-1}}, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century [[Abd al-Karīm al-Jīlī]] introduced the ''Doctrine of Logos and the Perfect Man''. For al-Jīlī, the "perfect man" (associated with the Logos or the Holy Prophet) has the power to assume different forms at different times and to appear in different guises.&lt;ref&gt;''Biographical encyclopaedia of Sufis'' by N.

In [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sufism, Şeyh Gâlib (d. 1799) articulates Sühan (Logos-''Kalima'') in his ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'') in parallel to Ibn Arabi's Kalima. In the romance, ''Sühan'' appears as an embodiment of Kalima as a reference to the Word of God, the Perfect Man, and the Reality of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Betül Avcı, "Character of ''Sühan'' in Şeyh Gâlib’s Romance, ''Hüsn ü Aşk'' (''Beauty and Love'')" ''Archivum Ottomanicum'', 32 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=March 2018}}

==Jung's analytical psychology==
[[File:Carl Jung (1912).png|thumb|150px|A 37-year-old [[Carl Jung]] in 1912.]]
[[Carl Jung]] contrasted the critical and rational faculties of logos with the emotional, non-reason oriented and mythical elements of ''eros''.&lt;ref&gt;''C.G. Jung and the psychology of symbolic forms'' by Petteri Pietikäinen 2001 {{ISBN|951-41-0857-4}} p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In Jung's approach, logos vs eros can be represented as "science vs mysticism", or "reason vs imagination" or "conscious activity vs the unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;''Mythos and logos in the thought of Carl Jung'' by Walter A. Shelburne 1988 {{ISBN|0-88706-693-3}} p. 4 [https://books.google.com/books?id=yV-ZE8pyZjkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Jung, logos represented the masculine principle of rationality, in contrast to its female counterpart, ''[[eros (concept)|eros]]'':

{{Quote|Woman’s psychology is founded on the principle of ''Eros'', the great binder and loosener, whereas from ancient times the ruling principle ascribed to man is ''Logos''. The concept of ''Eros'' could be expressed in modern terms as psychic relatedness, and that of ''Logos'' as objective interest.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Aspects of the Feminine'', Princeton University Press, 1982, p. 65, {{ISBN|0-7100-9522-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jung attempted to equate logos and eros, his intuitive conceptions of masculine and feminine consciousness, with the [[alchemical]] Sol and Luna. Jung commented that in a man the lunar [[Anima and animus|anima]] and in a woman the solar [[Anima and animus|animus]] has the greatest influence on consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ysgOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=jung+eros+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3CR5TLn_IqiM4gbNvYSUBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=jung%20eros%20logos&amp;f=false ''Aspects of the masculine'' by Carl Gustav Jung, John Beebe p. 85]&lt;/ref&gt; Jung often proceeded to analyze situations in terms of "paired opposites", e.g. by using the analogy with the eastern [[yin and yang]]&lt;ref&gt;''Carl Gustav Jung: critical assessments'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 1992 {{ISBN|0-415-04830-3}} p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and was also influenced by the Neoplatonists.&lt;ref&gt;See the Neoplatonic section above.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Mysterium Coniunctionis]]'' Jung made some important final remarks about anima and animus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In so far as the spirit is also a kind of "window on eternity"... it conveys to the soul a certain influx divinus... and the knowledge of a higher system of the world, wherein consists precisely its supposed animation of the soul.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And in this book Jung again emphasized that the animus compensates eros, while the anima compensates logos.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of Jungian psychology: theory, practice and applications'' by Renos K. Papadopoulos 2006 {{ISBN|1-58391-147-2}} p. 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt7FfLRi17kC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=logos+jung&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2CJ5TMS0Od3NjAew14ijBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=logos%20jung&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''meaningless statement''' posits nothing of substance with which one could agree or disagree. In the context of [[logical argument]]s, the inclusion of a meaningless statement in the premises will undermine the validity of the argument since that premise can neither be true nor false.

There are many classes of meaningless statement:

* A statement may be considered meaningless if it asserts that two categories are disjoint without proposing a criterion to distinguish between them. For example, the claim, "I wouldn't know how [[pornography]] differs from [[erotica]]" is a [[distinction without a difference]].
* A statement may be meaningless if its terms are undefined, or if it contains unbound variables. For instance, the sentence "All ''X'' have ''Y''" is meaningless unless the terms ''X'' and ''Y'' are defined (or bound).
* A grammatically correct sentence may be meaningless if it ascribes properties to particulars which admit of no such properties. For example, the famous sentence "[[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously]]" cannot be taken literally.
* An ungrammatical sentence admits of no meaning. For instance, the string of words "deities Olympus Greek reside The. upon" offers no information regarding the Greek deities, or their whereabouts.
* [[Lewis Carrol]]'s poem [[Jabberwocky]] is a famous example of the [[nonsense verse|nonsensical as literature]].

'''Media stylistics''' or '''mediated stylistics''' is a branch of [[Linguistics#Functional approaches|functional]] [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] that studies human communication in [[mass media]]. It can be considered a branch of [[media linguistics]]; that is, how media [[speech]] depends on the [[content (media)|content]], aims of communicators and the medium.

Media stylistics as a research approach is widely known in [[Eastern Europe]] and especially in [[Russia]], through the work of A. Vasileva, M. Kozhina, V. Kostomarov, L. Maydanova, I. Lysakova, K. Rogova, G. Solganik and others.

==Main problems==
Modern media stylistics in Russia develops mainly as stylistics of media text. The main particular problems of media stylistics are:
* the correlation between linguistic and extralinguistic organization of media texts;
* the role of the author's voice (G. Solganik, L. Kayda, L. Maydanova, N. Tsvetova, T. Shmeleva), their social (I. Lysakova) and genre (L. Duskaeva; I. Myasnikov; L. Maydanova, S. Kalganova, V. Konkov) typology;
* regularities of speech discovery of media texts as interaction of semantic positions (L. Duskaeva, T. Chernyshova), phatic (N. Kornilova, E. Chepkina, T. Chernyshova), polemic (L. Duskaeva, M. Kormilitsyna) and even hostile (E. Kakorina, V. Salimovsky, A. Skovorodnikov);
* sphere of concepts represented in media texts (E. Abramova, E. Malysheva, O. Orlova), their architectonics and composition (N. Bolotnova, L. Kayda, V. Konkov, N. Kuzmina);
* several expressive characteristics (T. Krasnova, M. Kormilitsyna) or their system (G. Bobrovskaya, G. Kopnina, A. Skovorodnikov; M. Kormilitsyna);
* idiostyle in a speech media environment (N. Bolotnova, M. Kormilitsyna O. Sirotinina), its textual (T. Matveeva) and functional semantics and stylistics (L. Duskaeva, T. Permyakova), intentional stylistics (L. Duskaeva, N. Tsvetova) and intentional (N. Klushina) categories - all those speech properties of texts which promote its effectiveness.

Along with stylistics of socio-political texts (V. Konkov, V. Salimovsky, G. Solganik, N. Klushina), the stylistics of journalistic leisure-texts develops (L. Duskaeva, N. Klushina, V. Konkov, E. Kara-Murza, T. Redkina, N. Tsvetova). The intentional-stylistic approach to the study of these texts develops extensively (V. Barbashov, L. Duskaeva, N. Kornilova, K.Prokhorova, N. Tsvetova) as well as stylistic approach to lingvo-etic problems (N. Bessarabova, T. Surikova, V. Suzdaltseva). As separate lines of media stylistics can be considered semiotic lingvostylistics of advertising texts (E. Kara-Murza), expert media stylistics (A. Baranov, E. Kara-Murza, M. Gorbanevsky, T. Chernyshova), stylistics of online media texts (E. Kakorina, T. Karpova).&lt;ref&gt;Duskaeva L. Media Stylistics: The New Concept or New Phenomenon // [[Russian Journal of Communication]]. 2011. № 4.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">In art, '''musivisual language''' is a [[Semiotics|semiotic]] system that is the synchronous union of music and image. The term was coined by Spanish composer [[Alejandro Román]], and for over a century, has appeared in film and other media (television, video or [[multimedia]]). 

== Definition ==
According to Román:

{{quote|''Musivisual Language'' is a special language of music placed in film and from film, understood not only from structural point of view, rhythm and sound-material, but also from the relationships and meaning semiotics in relation to the close interaction with the image and plot.'' |Román, 2008: 84}}

When film music and text connect, they produce meanings distinct from the separate elements. In this communication process, musical codes ([[melody]], rhythm, [[harmony]], sound, [[Texture (music)|texture]], [[Musical form|form]]), in synchrony with the film ([[image]], [[speech]], [[noise]]...) interact. 

Román defines two levels for this language: ''semiotic'', i.e. the contribution of meaning of music over the image, and the specific ''aesthetic'' of film music, which means it has its own stylistic elements not belonging to other musical forms. These elements are determined by the cinematic form.

The '''[[official language]]s of the [[United Nations]]''' are the six languages that are used in UN meetings, and in which all official UN documents are written. In alphabetical order, they are:

* [[Arabic]] ([[Modern Standard Arabic]])
* [[Chinese language|Chinese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Union Nation Official Languages | url=http://www.un.org/en/sections/about-un/official-languages|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Written character: [[Simplified Chinese]])

 | accessdate = 2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[French language|French]]
* [[Russian language|Russian]]
* [[Spanish language|Spanish]]

==Description==
These languages are used at meetings of various [[United Nations System|UN organs]], particularly the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] (Article 51 of its Rules of Procedure), the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]], and the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] (Article 41 of its Rules of Procedure). Each representative of a country may speak in any one of these six languages, or may speak in any language and provide interpretation into one of the six official languages. The UN provides [[simultaneous interpretation]] from the official language into the other five official languages, via the [[United Nations Interpretation Service]].

The six official languages are also used for the dissemination of official documents. Generally, the texts in each of the six languages are equally authoritative.

The United Nations has drawn criticism for relying too heavily on English, and not enough on the other five official languages. Spanish-speaking member nations formally brought this to the attention of the Secretary-General in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1399761.stm |title=Plea to UN: 'More Spanish please' |date=2001-06-21 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] then responded that full parity of the six official languages was unachievable within current budgetary restraints, but he nevertheless attached great importance to improving the linguistic balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter dated 18 June 2001 |url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/56/a56176.pdf |date=2001-06-18 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 and 2009, resolutions of the General Assembly have urged the Secretariat to respect the parity of the six official languages, especially in the dissemination of public information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/63/100%20A-B&amp;Lang=E Resolution 63/100]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114235019/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F63%2F100%20A-B&amp;Lang=E |date=14 January 2014 }} Questions relating to information (5 December 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a/res/63/306 Resolution 63/306]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403101347/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a%2Fres%2F63%2F306 |date=3 April 2015 }} Multilingualism (9 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 June 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-61-266.pdf Resolution A/RES/61/266] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715041928/http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-61-266.pdf |date=15 July 2010 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018}} Multilingualism 8 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; resolutions concerning human resources management at the UN, the General Assembly had emphasized "the paramount importance of the equality of the six official languages of the United Nations" and requested that the Secretary-General "ensure that vacancy announcements specified the need for either of the working languages of the Secretariat, unless the functions of the post required a specific working language".

The Secretary-General's most recent report on multilingualism was issued on 4 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |id=UN Doc ID A/65/488 |url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/65/488 |title=Multilingualism |publisher=United Nations Secretary-General |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, on 19 July 2011, the General Assembly adopted Resolution No. A/RES/65/311 on multilingualism, calling on the Secretary-General, once again, to ensure that all six official languages are given equally favourable working conditions and resources. The resolution noted with concern that the multilingual development of the UN website had improved at a much slower rate than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |id=UN Doc ID GA/11116 |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs//2011/ga11116.doc.htm |publisher=UN Department of Public Information |title=Adopting Resolution on Multilingualism, General Assembly Emphasizes Importance of Equality Among Six Official United Nations Languages |date=2011-07-19 |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six official languages spoken at the UN are the [[first language|first]] or [[second language]] of 2.8 billion people on the planet, less than half of the world population. The six languages are official languages in more than half the countries in the world (about one hundred).{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==History==
The [[United Nations Charter|Charter of the United Nations]], its 1945 constituent document, did not expressly provide for official languages of the [[United Nations|UN]]. The Charter was enacted in five languages (Chinese, French, Russian, English, and Spanish) and provided (in [[Chapter XIX of the United Nations Charter|Article 111]]) that the five texts are equally authoritative.

In 1946, the first session of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted rules of procedure concerning languages that purported to apply to "all the organs of the United Nations, other than the [[International Court of Justice]]", setting out five official languages and two [[working languages]] (English and French).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/2(I) General Assembly Resolution 2 (I)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109134851/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F2%28I%29 |date=9 January 2015 }} Rules of Procedure Concerning Languages, 1 February 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the second session of the General Assembly adopted permanent rules of procedure, Resolution 173 (II). The part of those rules relating to language closely followed the 1946 rules, except that the 1947 rules did not purport to apply to other UN organs, just the General Assembly.&lt;ref name="legal.un.org"&gt;{{cite web |page=4 |url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/documentation/english/a_cn4_187.pdf |year=1966 |volume=2 |title=Preparation of Multilingual Treaties: Memorandum by the Secretariat |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, a proposal had been in the works to add Spanish as a third working language in addition to English and French. This was adopted in Resolution 262 (III), passed on 11 December 1948.&lt;ref name="legal.un.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/262(III) Resolution 262 (III)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109195740/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F262%28III%29 |date=9 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Russian was added as a working language of the General Assembly &lt;!-- as well as of the Security Council? --&gt; so that, of the GA's five official languages, four (all but Chinese) were working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19681218&amp;id=NskyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Y-0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3900,651877 |title=Russian to be included as UN working language |date=1968-12-18 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |work=Ottawa Citizen |author=Robert Reford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/2479(XXIII) Resolution 2479 (XXIII)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713160807/http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A%2FRES%2F2479%28XXIII%29 |date=13 July 2015 }} Inclusion of Russian among the working languages of the General Assembly (amendment to rule 51 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly) and question of including Russian and Spanish among the working languages of the Security Council (21 December 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the General Assembly made Chinese a working language and added Arabic as both an official language and working language of the GA. Thus all six official languages were also working languages. Arabic was made an official and working language of "the General Assembly and its Main Committees", whereas the other five languages had status in all GA committees and subcommittees (not just the main committees). The Arab members of the UN had agreed to pay the costs of implementing the resolution, for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a/res/3189(XXVIII) Resolution 3189 (XXVIII)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713160811/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a%2Fres%2F3189%28XXVIII%29 |date=13 July 2015 }} Inclusion of Chinese among the working languages of the General Assembly and the Security Council (18 December 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a/res/3190(XXVIII) Resolution 3190 (XXVIII)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713160841/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a%2Fres%2F3190%28XXVIII%29 |date=13 July 2015 }} Inclusion of Arabic among the official and the working languages of the General Assembly and its Main Committees (18 December 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a/res/3191(XXVIII) Resolution 3191 (XXVIII)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713160842/http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=a%2Fres%2F3191%28XXVIII%29 |date=13 July 2015 }} Inclusion of Chinese among the working languages of the General Assembly, its committees and its subcommittees and inclusion of Arabic among the official and the working languages of the General Assembly and its Main Committees: amendments to rules 51 to 59 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the General Assembly got rid of this final distinction, making Arabic an official and working language of all its committees and subcommittees, as of 1 January 1982. At the same time, the GA requested the Security Council to include Arabic among its official and working languages, and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] to include Arabic among its official languages, by 1 January 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/35/a35r219e.pdf Resolution 35/219] Use of Arabic in the subsidiary organs of the General Assembly, in the Security Council and in the Economic and Social Council: amendments to rules 51, 52, 54 and 56 of the rules of procedure of the Assembly (17 December 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1983, the Security Council (like the General Assembly) recognized six official and working languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Docs/sc/scrules.htm Provisional Rules of Procedure of the Security Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502000000/http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/scrules.htm |date=2 May 2012 }} Rules 41 to 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]], as of 1992, there were six official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish) of which three were working languages (English, French, and Spanish).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/about/pdf/rules.pdf Rules of Procedure of the Economic and Social Council] rules 32 to 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and [[Russian language|Russian]] were added as [[working languages]] in the Economic and Social Council.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/aboutun/languages.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214205555/http://www.un.org/en/aboutun/languages.shtml |date=14 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights]] was presented to [[UNESCO]]&lt;ref&gt;"Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights, 1996". Cultural Rights: Culture and Development. Retrieved 9 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but has yet to be officially ratified.&lt;ref&gt; "International PEN: Linguistic Rights and Translation". UNESCO's List of NGOs. Unesco.org. Retrieved 9 March 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;  Many international linguistics still expect that the UN will eventually add new official languages such as [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Malay language|Malay]] to represent Asian and African populations and put more resources into assisting endangered languages. 

In 2002, it was reportedly proposed to the then current UN Secretary General Kofi Annan that the UN develops a 'Semi-Official' or 'Regional' language status for commonly spoken languages that do not have Official status so that a higher percentage of the worlds population could be familiar with UN actions. As of 2006, the six official languages are the first or second language of 2.8 billion people on the planet, which is less than half of the world population. The list of potential 'Semi-Official' or 'Regional' languages, many of which can be considered lingua francas in their areas, could include: [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]], [[Chichewa language|Chichewa]], [[Fula language|Fula]], [[German language|German]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Bahasa Indonesia|Indonesian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Lingala language|Lingala]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Oromo language|Oromo]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Shanghaiese]], [[Shona language|Shona]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[Tamil language| Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Urdu]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[International Sign Language]], [[International Braille]], and possibly an [[international auxiliary language]] such as [[Esperanto]], [[Ido language|Ido]], or [[Interlingua]]. As of 2017, the UN has taken no public action to approve a "Semi-Official" or "Regional" status mainly due to expected translation costs.

{{cns|date=April 2018|text=As of April 2018, the [[United Nations Secretariat]] uses two working languages: English and French. All [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretaries-General]] have had a working knowledge of both languages.}}

Since the late 1990's and increasingly in the 2000's, there has been much discussion of adding Hindi, Portuguese, Swahili, Malay and to a lesser extent, Turkish, Bengali, or other languages as additional official languages. The most recent example being when the Deputy Secretary General was asked in January 2018 about the process of adding Hindi as an official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2018/db180103.doc.htm|title=Daily Press Briefing by the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General - Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most proposed [[List of languages by the number of countries in which they are recognized as an official language|languages are spoken in more than one nation]] and/or have a [[List of languages by total number of speakers|large number of speakers]]. 

As of June 2018, the media branch of the United Nations, UN News (https://news.un.org/), includes website translations into Portuguese and Swahili in addition to the 6 official languages.&lt;ref name="un.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2009/12/324362-top-un-official-stresses-need-internet-multilingualism-bridge-digital-divide|title=Top UN official stresses need for Internet multilingualism to bridge digital divide|date=14 December 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other UN documents and websites are already translated into [[Bengali language|Bengali]] (referred to as Bangla), [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[French-based creole languages|French Creole]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Swahili language|Swahili]] but not on an official or consistent basis.

==New proposed languages==
{{See also|International Mother Language Day}}

===Bengali===
[[Bengali language|Bengali]] is one of the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most widely spoken languages in the world]], ranking seventh, with over 240 million speakers.&lt;ref name="ethnologue1"&gt;{{cite web
 | url=http://www.ethnologue.org/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=size
 | title=Ethnologue| publisher=SIL International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh]] [[Sheikh Hasina]] argued in front of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] that the Bengali language should be made one of the official languages of the UN. This was backed by a resolution adopted unanimously by the assembly of the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]] in December, and support was also given by the states of [[Assam]] and [[Tripura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bengali 'should be UN language'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8425744.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindi===
[[Hindi]] is one of the official languages of [[India]] and [[Fiji]] and is also spoken in [[Suriname]], [[Mauritius]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Guyana]]. It is mutually intelligible to a high degree with [[Urdu]] which is spoken in Pakistan and together they are often considered the same language, referred to as [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] or Hindi-Urdu. Although very similar verbally, they do have different written scripts; Hindi is written in the [[Devanagari script|Devanagari script]] and Urdu is written in the [[Nastaʿlīq script|Nastaʿlīq script]]. [[Hindi language|Hindi]] has more than 550 million speakers in India alone, of whom 422 million are native, 98.2 million are second language speakers, and 31.2 million are third language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement5.aspx|title=Census of India: Comparative speaker's strength of Scheduled Languages-1971, 1981, 1991 and 2001|first=|last=ORGI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indiaspeak-English-is-our-2nd-language/articleshow/5680962.cms|title=Indiaspeak: English is our 2nd language – Times of India|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindi is the [[lingua franca]] of the majority of Indians in the subcontinent, along with Pakistan (as Urdu), Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal, with its importance as a global language increasing day by day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siasat.com/news/hindi-varanasi-norwegians-whats-sambandh-982592/|title=Hindi.

In 2007, it was reported that the government would "make immediate diplomatic moves to seek the status of an official language for Hindi at the United Nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/holnus/001200707150321.htm |title=Hindi at UN: India to take action to get official status |date=2007-07-15 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |work=The Hindu |location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2009 press release from its Ministry of External Affairs, the Government of India has been "working actively" to have [[Hindi]] recognized as an official language of the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiacurrentaffairs.org/hindi-in-uno/ |date=2009-12-11 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |title=Hindi in UNO}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pibmumbai.gov.in/scripts/detail.asp?releaseId=E2009PR1426 |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2010-01-25 |title=Government working actively for Hindi as official language of UN: S M Krishna}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[Nepal]]'s Vice President [[Parmananda Jha]] stated his firm support for the inclusion of Hindi as an official language of the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/world/hindi-official-language-un-nepal-vice-president-2042199.html|title=Hindi should be an official language in the UN: Nepal Vice President – Firstpost|date=12 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the [[List of languages by number of native speakers in India|linguistic diversity]] in India, the expansion of Hindi has become political and has led to a rise of English in the post-British colonial period. This is why English is included along with Hindi on Indian passports. If the Indian government is able to grant more federal-level protection for other languages such as [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]], as a compromise then the UN may be more likely to grant a vote on adding Hindi as an official language. But as of now, the international community does not seem to see enough benefit to overcome the potential political issues that adding Hindi as official language of the UN could cause. 

===Malay===
[[Malay language|Malay]] is an [[Austronesian]] language spoken throughout the [[Malay Peninsula]] and large swaths of [[Southeast Asia]]. [[Malay language|Malay]] is an official language of [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]] (which is the 4th most populous nation in the world),&lt;ref name="imf2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sp2010.bps.go.id/|publisher=Badan Pusat Statistik|title=Jumlah dan Distribusi Penduduk|date=May 2010|accessdate=13 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Singapore]], [[East Timor]], [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands|Cocos Islands]] and is a recognized minority language in [[Thailand]] where is it spoken in the [[Narathiwat]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], and [[Pattani]] regions, and the [[Philippines]] where it is spoken in the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]], the [[Sulu Archipelago]], and [[Bataraza]] and [[Balabac]] in [[Palawan]].  

Spoken by more than 280 million people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipll.manoa.hawaii.edu/indonesian/2012/03/10/how-many-people-speak-indonesian/|title=How many people speak Indonesian?|website=ipll.manoa.hawaii.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malay language|Malay]] is considered the 7th most commonly spoken language by Ethnologue 2017. Malay has several names depending on the local vernacular designation, for example it is referred to as [[Bahasa Melayu]] in Malaysia, [[Bahasa Indonesia]] in Indonesia and [[Kelantan-Pattani Malay]] in Thailand. The level of [[mutual intelligibility]] between these standards is debated. Having Malay as an official language of the UN would expand its presence into Asia which is growing rapidly. Malay is also prominent on the internet as the Malay language has the sixth most Internet users of all languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese===
Many [[Lusophone]]s have advocated for greater recognition of their language, being the sixth most spoken language in the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spread across four continents: [[Portugal]] in [[Europe]]; [[Brazil]] (the largest [[lusophone]] nation) in [[South America]]; [[Angola]], [[Mozambique]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] in [[Africa]]; and in [[Asia]], [[Timor-Leste]] and [[Macau]].

===Swahili===
[[Swahili language|Swahili]] is a [[lingua franca]] throughout eastern Africa and is especially prevalent in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Swahili, known as Kiswahili by its speakers, is an official language of [[Kenya]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]],&lt;ref&gt;Prins 1961&lt;/ref&gt;  is an official language of the [[African Union]] and is officially recognised as a lingua franca of the [[East African Community]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eac.int/treaty/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=206&amp;Itemid=331&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most commonly spoken languages in Africa, is a compulsory subject in all Kenyan schools and is increasingly being used in eastern [[Burundi]] and northern [[Mozambique]].

With between 50 – 100 million speakers, Swahili is lexiconically similar to other eastern Bantu languages such as [[Comorian language|Comorian]] which have differing levels of mutual intelligibility. Swahili is already used unofficially in many UN organizations as the [[United Nations Office at Nairobi]], one of the four major UN global offices (in addition to offices in [[Headquarters of the United Nations|New York City]], [[United Nations Office at Vienna|Vienna]], and [[United Nations Office at Geneva|Geneva]]), is located in [[Nairobi|Nairobi]], Kenya. The media branch of the UN, UN News (https://news.un.org/), already includes translations into Swahili.&lt;ref name="un.org1"/&gt;

===Turkish===
In September 2011, during a meeting with UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]], [[Prime Minister of Turkey|Turkish Prime Minister]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] expressed a desire to see [[Turkish language|Turkish]] become an official UN language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/component/content/article/127-ana-manset-haberleri-en/94584-erdogan-meets-un-sg-ban-ki-moon |publisher=Anadolu Agency |title=Erdogan meets U.N.

==Coordinator for multilingualism==
In a 1999 resolution, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to "appoint a senior Secretariat official as coordinator of questions relating to multilingualism throughout the Secretariat".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/RES/54/64 Resolution 54/64]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604120552/http://www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A%2FRES%2F54%2F64 |date=4 June 2011 }} adopted 6 December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Riesco's retirement, [[Miles Stoby]] of [[Guyana]] was appointed Coordinator for Multilingualism, effective 6 September 2001.&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt;

In 2003, Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] appointed [[Shashi Tharoor]] of [[India]] as Coordinator for Multilingualism.

==Language Days at the UN==
In 2010, the UN's Department of Public Information announced an initiative of six "language days" to be observed throughout the year, one for each official language, with the goal of celebrating linguistic diversity and learning about the importance of cross-cultural communication.&lt;ref name="languagedays"&gt;{{cite press release |id=UN Doc ID OBV/853 PI/1926 |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2010/obv853.doc.htm |date=2010-02-19 |accessdate=2011-07-26 |title=Department of Public Information to Launch 'Language Days at the United Nations' |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The days and their historical significance are:
* [[UN Arabic Language Day]]: 18 December (the date on which the [[United Nations General Assembly]] designated Arabic as the sixth official language of the United Nations in 1973)&lt;ref name=firstfrench&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=34136&amp;Cr=multilingualism&amp;Cr1=674 |date=2010-03-19 |accessdate=2011-07-26 |title=First-ever French language day celebrated at UN |publisher=UN News Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN observances"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/events/observances/multilingualism.shtml |accessdate=2011-07-26 |title=United Nations Observances – Multilingualism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UN specialized agencies==
UN independent agencies have their own sets of official languages that sometimes are different from that of the principal UN organs. For example, the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] has nine official languages including Hindi, Italian, and Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001874/187429e.pdf |year=2010 |title=Rules of Procedure of the General Conference}}, Rule 54&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Postal Union]] has just one official language, French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upu.int/en/the-upu/languages.html |publisher=Universal Postal Union |title=Universal Postal Union – Languages |accessdate=2010-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IFAD]] has four official languages: Arabic, English, French, and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifad.org/pub/basic/gc/e/!05govco.pdf |accessdate=2010-08-03 |title=Rules of Procedure of the Governing Council}}, Rule 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifad.org/pub/basic/eb/e/!06exboa.pdf |title=Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board |accessdate=2010-08-03}}, Rule 26&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- for a table giving the official languages and working languages of various UN independent agencies, as of 2002, see Annex I(b) of the JIU report "Implementation of Multilingualism in the United Nations System" www.un.org/Docs/journal/asp/ws.asp?m=A/58/93 --&gt;

== Parallels with other multilingual institutions ==
The next largest international grouping after the UN is the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} which is exclusively English speaking. All other international bodies in commerce, transport and sport have tended to the adoption of one or a few languages as the means of communication. This is usually English, closely followed by French (see: [[list of international organisations which have French as an official language]]). Regional groups have adopted what is common to other elements of their ethnic or religious background. [[Modern Standard Arabic|Standard Arabic]] is usually adopted across Muslim nation groups. Most of non-Arab Africa is either Francophone or Anglophone because of their imperial past, but there is also a [[Portuguese-speaking African countries|lusophone grouping of countries]] for the same reason.

'''Oral history''' is the collection and study of historical information about individuals, families, important events, or everyday life using audiotapes, videotapes, or transcriptions of planned [[interview]]s. These interviews are conducted with people who participated in or observed past events and whose memories and perceptions of these are to be preserved as an aural record for future generations. Oral history strives to obtain information from different perspectives and most of these cannot be found in written sources. ''Oral history'' also refers to information gathered in this manner and to a written work (published or unpublished) based on such data, often preserved in [[archives]] and large [[libraries]].&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;oral history. (n.d.) The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia®. (2013). Retrieved March 12, 2018 from https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/oral+history&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc-clio.com/ODLIS/odlis_o.aspx#oralhistory Definition of ''oral history'' from the Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ AHDict | oral history}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Oxford Dictionaries|oral history}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge presented by Oral History (OH) is unique in that it shares the tacit perspective, thoughts, opinions and understanding of the interviewee in its primary form.&lt;ref name="Oral History Sources as Learning Materials"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nkala|first1=Gugulethu Shamaine|last2=David|first2=Rodreck|title=Oral History Sources as Learning Materials: A Case Study of The National University of Science and Technology|journal=Oral History Journal of South Africa|date=2015|volume=3|issue=2|pages=82|doi=10.25159/2309-5792/340|url=https://upjournals.co.za/index.php/OHJSA/article/view/340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes used in a more general sense to refer to any information about past events that people who experienced them tell anybody else,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/oral-history Definition of ''oral history'' from the Macmillan Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/oral-history Definition of ''oral history'' from the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; but professional [[historian]]s usually consider this to be [[oral tradition]]. However, as the Columbia Encyclopedia&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt; explains: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Primitive societies have long relied on oral tradition to preserve a record of the past in the absence of written histories. In Western society, the use of oral material goes back to the early Greek historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], both of whom made extensive use of oral reports from witnesses. The modern concept of oral history was developed in the 1940s by [[Allan Nevins]] and his associates at Columbia University. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Overview==
Oral history has become an international movement in historical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Around the Globe: Rethinking Oral History with Its Protagonists|last=Miroslav|first=Vanek|publisher=Karolinum Press|year=2013|isbn=9788024622262|location=Prague|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oral History Reader|last=Perks|first=Robert|last2=Thomson|first2=Alistair|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0203435966|location=London|pages=357}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly attributed to the development of information technology, which allowed a method rooted in orality to contribute to research, particularly the use of personal testimonies made in a wide variety of public settings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, oral historians have discovered the endless possibilities of posting data and information on the [[Internet]], making them readily available to scholars, teachers, and average individuals.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Doing Oral History|last=Ritchie|first=Donald|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0195154339|location=New York|pages=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforced the viability of oral history since the new modes of transmission allowed history to get off archival shelves and reach the larger community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Oral historians in different countries have approached the collection, analysis, and dissemination of oral history in different modes. However, it should also be noted that there are many ways of creating oral histories and carrying out the study of oral history even within individual national contexts.

According to the ''[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]'':,&lt;ref name="columbia"/&gt; the accessibility of tape recorders in the 1960s and 1970s led to oral documentation of the era's movements and protests. Following this, oral history has increasingly become a respected record type. Some oral historians now also account for the subjective memories of interviewees due to the research of Italian historian [[Alessandro Portelli]] and his associates.

Oral histories are also used in many communities to document the experiences of survivors of tragedies. Following the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], there has emerged a rich tradition of oral history, particularly of Jewish survivors. The [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] has an extensive archive of over 70,000 oral history interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.ushmm.org/search/?f%5Brecord_type_facet%5D%5B%5D=Oral+History|title=Collections Search - United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Search Results|website=collections.ushmm.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several organizations dedicated specifically to collecting and preserving oral histories of survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncra.org/Foundation/content.cfm?ItemNumber=18389|title=Oral Histories Project: Holocaust Survivors - The Foundation - NCRA|website=www.ncra.org|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://holocaustcenter.jfcs.org/oral-histories/|title=Oral Histories - JFCS Holocaust Center of SF|work=JFCS Holocaust Center of SF|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oral history as a discipline has fairly low barriers to entry, so it is an act in which laypeople can readily participate. In his book [https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=tutjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=layperson+oral+history&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ku5WhEz8Cu&amp;sig=wcnfu2KV6rX1_qeNq2e91-7fGLE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjskKS55q7XAhWEkpQKHdJ_B3gQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=layperson%20oral%20history&amp;f=false Doing Oral History], [[Donald A. Ritchie|Donald Ritchie]] wrote that "oral history has room for both the academic and the layperson. With reasonable training... anyone can conduct a useable oral history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Doing Oral History|last=Ritchie|first=Donald|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=United States of America|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially meaningful in cases like the Holocaust, where survivors may be less comfortable telling their story to a journalist than they would be to a historian or family member.

In the United States, there are several organizations dedicated to doing oral history which are not affiliated with universities or specific locations. [[StoryCorps]] is one of the most well-known of these: following the model of the [[Federal Writers' Project|Federal Writers’ Project]] created as part of the [[Works Progress Administration]], StoryCorps’ mission is to record the stories of Americans from all walks of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1475619|title=StoryCorps, An Oral History of America|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On contrast to the scholarly tradition of oral history, StoryCorps subjects are interviewed by people they know. There are a number of StoryCorps initiatives that have targeted specific populations or problems, following in the tradition of using oral history as a method to amplify voices that might otherwise be marginalized.

The development of digital databases with their text-search tools is one of the important aspects to the technology-based oral historiography. These made it easier to collect and disseminate oral history since access to millions of documents on national and international levels can be instantaneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Emergent Methods|last=Hesse-Biber|first=Sharlene|last2=Leavy|first2=Patricia|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=2010|isbn=9781593851477|location=New York|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growth and development ==

===In Europe===

====Great Britain and Ireland====

Since the early 1970s, oral history in Britain has grown from being a method in [[folklore]] studies (see for example the work of the [[School of Scottish Studies]] in the 1950s) to becoming a key component in community histories. Oral history continues to be an important means by which non-academics can actively participate in the compilation and study of history. However, practitioners across a wide range of academic disciplines have also developed the method into a way of recording, understanding, and archiving narrated memories. Influences have included women's history and labour history.

In Britain, the [[Oral History Society]] has played a key role in facilitating and developing the use of oral history.

A more complete account of the history of oral history in Britain and Northern Ireland can be found at "Making Oral History" on the [[Institute of Historical Research]]'s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/makinghistory/resources/articles/oral_history.html|title=Making Oral History|publisher=[[Institute of Historical Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bureau of Military History]] conducted over 1700 interviews with veterans of the First World War and related episodes in Ireland. The documentation was released for research in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Fearghal  McGarry, "'Too many histories'? The Bureau of Military History and Easter 1916." ''History Ireland'' (2011) pp: 26-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1998 and 1999, 40 BBC local radio stations recorded personal oral histories from a broad cross-section of the population for ''The Century Speaks'' series. The result was 640 half-hour radio documentaries, broadcast in the final weeks of the millennium, and one of the largest single oral history collections in Europe, the Millennium Memory Bank (MMB). The interview based recordings are held by the [[British Library Sound Archive]] in the oral history collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sounds.bl.uk/Oral-history |title=Oral history &amp;#124; British Library |publisher=Sounds |date= |accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the largest memory project anywhere, The BBC in 2003-6 invited its audiences to send in recollections of the homefront in the Second World War. It put 47,000 of the recollections online, along with 15,000 photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/|title=BBC - WW2 People's War|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Italy===
[[Alessandro Portelli]] is an Italian oral historian. He is known for his work which compared workers' experiences in Harlan County, Kentucky and Terni, Italy. Other oral historians have drawn on Portelli's analysis of memory, identity, and the construction of history.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2017}}

===In post-Soviet/Eastern bloc states===

====Belarus====
{{as of|2015}}, since the government-run historiography in modern Belarus almost fully excludes repression during the epoch when Belarus was part of the [[Soviet Union]], only private initiatives cover these aspects. Citizens' groups in Belarus use the methods of oral history and record narrative interviews on video: the [[Virtual Museum of Soviet Repression in Belarus]] presents a full [[Virtual museum]] with intense use of oral history. The [[Belarusian Oral History Archive project]] also provides material based on oral history recordings.

==== Czech Republic ====
Czech oral history began to develop beginning in the 1980s with a focus on social movements and political activism.&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt; The practice of oral history and any attempts to document stories prior to this is fairly unknown. [citation needed] The practice of oral history began to take shape in the 1990s. In 2000, The Oral History Center (COH) at the Institute of Contemporary History, Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic (AV ČR) was established with the aim of "systematically support the development of oral history methodology and its application in historical research." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usd.cas.cz/en/research-units/oral-history-center/|title=Oral history center - Ústav pro soudobé dějiny AV ČR, v.v.i|last=http://www.rinovo.cz/|website=Ústav pro soudobé dějiny AV ČR, v.v.i.|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, [[Post Bellum]], a nonprofit organization, was established to "documents the memories of witnesses of the important historical phenomenons of the 20th century" within the Czech Republic and surrounding European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.postbellum.cz/english/|title=About|website=Post Bellum|language=cs-cz|access-date=2018-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post Bellum works in partnership with [[Czech Radio]] and [[Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes]]. Their oral history project ''[[Memory of Nation]]'' was created in 2008 and interviews are archived online for user access. As of January 2015, the project has more than 2100 published witness accounts in several languages, with more than 24,000 pictures.

Other projects, including articles and books have been funded by the Czech Science Foundation (AV ČR) including:
* "Students in the Period of the Fall of Communism — Life Stories" published as the book ''One Hundred Student Revolutions'' (1999) by M. Vaněk and M. Otáhal; 
* "Political Elites and Dissidents during the Period of So-called Normalization — Historical Interviews" which resulted in ''Victors? Vanquished'' (2005), a two-volume collection of 50 interviews; 
* a compilation of original interpretive essays entitled ''The Powerful?! or Helpless?!'' 
* "An Investigation into Czech Society during the 'Normalization' Era: Biographic Narratives of Workers and the Intelligentsia" and
* A book of interpretations called ''Ordinary People...?!'' (2009). 
These publications aim to demonstrate that oral history contributes to the understanding of human lives and history itself, such as the motives behind the dissidents' activities, the formation of opposition groups, communication between dissidents and state representatives and the emergence of ex-communist elites and their decision-making processes.

Oral history centers in the Czech Republic emphasize educational activities (seminars, lectures, conferences), archiving and maintaining interview collections, and providing consultations to those interested in the method.&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;

===In Spain===
Because of repression during the Franco dictatorship (1939–75), the development of oral history in Spain was quite limited until the 1970s. It became well-developed in the early 1980s, and often had a focus on the Civil War years (1936–39), especially regarding the losers whose stories had been suppressed. The field was based at the University of Barcelona.  Professor Mercedes Vilanova was a leading exponent, and combined it with her interest in quantification and social history. The Barcelona group sought to integrate oral sources with traditional written sources to create mainstream, not ghettoized, historical interpretations. They sought to give a public voice to neglected groups, such as women, illiterates, political leftists, and ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Vilanova, "The Struggle for a History without Adjectives: A Note on Using Oral Sources in Spain," ''Oral History Review'' (1997) 24#1 pp. 81-90 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3675398 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the United States===
Oral history began with a focus on national leaders in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie 2010 considers Senators and other top leaders.&lt;/ref&gt; but has expanded to include groups representing the entire population.  In Britain, the influence of 'history from below' and interviewing people who had been 'hidden from history' was more influential. However, in both countries elite oral history has emerged as an important strand. Scientists, for example, have been covered in numerous oral history projects.  Doel (2003) discusses the use of oral interviews by scholars as primary sources, He lists major oral history projects in the history of science begun after 1950. Oral histories, he concludes, can augment the biographies of scientists and help spotlight how their social origins influenced their research. Doel acknowledges the common concerns historians have regarding the validity of oral history accounts. He identifies studies that used oral histories successfully to provide critical and unique insight into otherwise obscure subjects, such as the role scientists played in shaping US policy after World War II. Interviews furthermore can provide road maps for researching archives, and can even serve as a fail-safe resource when written documents have been lost or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Doel, Ronald E. "Oral History of American Science: a Forty-year Review." ''History of Science'' 2003 41(4): 349-378.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Roger D. Launius]] (2003) shows the huge size and complexity of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) oral history program since 1959. NASA systematically documented its operations through oral histories. They can help to explore broader issues regarding the evolution of a major federal agency. The collection consists primarily of oral histories conducted by scholars working on books about the agency. Since 1996, however, the collection has also included oral histories of senior NASA administrators and officials, astronauts, and project managers, part of a broader project to document the lives of key agency individuals. Launius emphasizes efforts to include such less-well-known groups within the agency as the Astrobiology Program, and to collect the oral histories of women in NASA.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger D. Launius]], "'We Can Lick Gravity, but Sometimes the Paperwork Is Overwhelming': NASA, Oral History, and the Contemporary Past." ''Oral History Review'' 2003 30(2): 111-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Folklore roots and ordinary people====
Contemporary oral history involves recording or transcribing eyewitness accounts of historical events. Some [[anthropologists]] started collecting recordings (at first especially of [[Native American mythology|Native American folklore]]) on phonograph cylinders in the late 19th century. In the 1930s, the [[Federal Writers' Project]]—part of the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA)—sent out interviewers to collect accounts from various groups, including surviving witnesses of the Civil War, slavery, and other major historical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/wpaintro/wpahome.html|title=American Life Histories|website=[[Federal Writers' Project|WPA Writers' Project 1936–1940]]|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Library of Congress]] also began recording traditional American music and folklore onto [[acetate discs]]. With the development of audio tape recordings after World War II, the task of oral historians became easier.

In 1946, [[David P. Boder]], a professor of psychology at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]] in Chicago, traveled to Europe to record long interviews with "displaced persons"—most of them Holocaust survivors. Using the first device capable of capturing hours of audio—the [[wire recording|wire recorder]]—Boder came back with the first recorded Holocaust testimonials and in all likelihood the first recorded oral histories of significant length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marziali|first=Carl|date=26 October 2001|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=895|title=Mr. Boder Vanishes|website=[[This American Life]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many state and local historical societies have oral history programs. Sinclair Kopp (2002) report on the [[Oregon Historical Society]]'s program. It began in 1976 with the hiring of Charles Digregorio, who had studied at Columbia with Nevins. Thousands of sound recordings, reel-to-reel tapes, transcriptions, and radio broadcasts have made it one of the largest collections of oral history on the Pacific Coast. In addition to political figures and prominent businessmen, the Oregon Historical Society has done interviews with minorities, women, farmers, and other ordinary citizens, who have contributed extraordinary stories reflecting the state's cultural and social heritage. Hill (2004) encourages oral history projects in high school courses. She demonstrates a lesson plan that encourages the study of local community history through interviews. By studying grassroots activism and the lived experiences of its participants, her high school students came to appreciate how African Americans worked to end Jim Crow laws in the 1950s.

Naison (2005) describes the Bronx African American History Project (BAAHP), an oral community history project developed by the Bronx County Historical Society. Its goal was to document the histories of black working- and middle-class residents of the South Bronx neighborhood of Morrisania in New York City since the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Naison, The Bronx African American History Project." ''OAH Newsletter'' 2005 33(3): 1, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Middle East===
The Middle East often requires oral history methods of research, mainly because of the relative lack in written and archival history and its emphasis on oral records and traditions.  Furthermore, because of its population transfers, refugees and émigrés become suitable objects for oral history research.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Shryock, ''Nationalism and the Genealogical Imagination: Oral History and Textual Authority in Tribal Jordan'' (U of California Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Franz, "The Bedouin in History or Bedouin History?." ''Nomadic Peoples'' (2011): 11-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Syria====
Katharina Lange studied the tribal histories of [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lange|first1=Katharina|title=Producing (tribal) history: gendered representations of genealogy and warfare in northern Syria|journal=Nomadic Peoples|date=2014|volume=18|issue=2|pages=36–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oral histories in this area could not be transposed into tangible, written form due to their positionalities, which Lange describes as “taking sides.” The positionality of oral history could lead to conflict and tension. The tribal histories are typically narrated by men. While histories are also told by women, they are not accepted locally as “real history.” Oral histories often detail the lives and feats of ancestors.

[[Genealogy]] is a prominent subject in the area. According to Lange, the oral historians often tell their own personalized genealogies to demonstrate their credibility, both in their social standing and their expertise in the field.

====Uzbekistan====
From 2003 to 2004, Professors Marianne Kamp and Russell Zanca researched [[agricultural collectivization]] in [[Uzbekistan]]; one part of their project involved using oral history methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madaeva|first1=Shahnoza|title=Spiritual trauma of the Soviet reality in Uzbekistan, 1920s-1930s|journal=Anthropology of the Middle East|date=2008|volume=3|issue=1|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the project was to learn more about life in the 1920s and 1930s to study the impact of the Soviet Union’s conquest. 20 interviews each were conducted in the [[Fergana valley]], [[Tashkent]], [[Bukhara]], [[Khorezm]], and [[Kashkadarya]] regions. These interviews uncovered untold stories of famine and death. The oral histories filled in a gap of information missing from the Central State Archive of Uzbekistan.

===In Asia===

==== China ====
The rise of oral history is a new trend in historical studies in China that began in the late twentieth century. Some oral historians, stress the collection of eyewitness accounts of the words and deeds of important historical figures and what really happened during those important historical events, which is similar to common practice in the west, while the others focus more on important people and event, asking important figures to describe the decision making and details of important historical events. In December 2004, the Chinese Association of Oral History Studies was established. The establishment of this institution is thought to signal that the field of oral history studies in China has finally moved into a new phase of organized development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zuo|first=Yuhe|title=Oral history studies in contemporary China|journal=Journal of Modern Chinese History|volume=9|issue=2|pages=259–274|doi=10.1080/17535654.2015.1103049|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Notable oral historian ====

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong_Tekong?oldformat=true Te-Kong Tong] (1920-2009) was a prominent Chinese American historian and recognized as the "pioneer of oral history in contemporary China (中国近代口述史学的开创者)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://history.huanqiu.com/people/2010-12/1380672.html|title=唐德刚："中国口述历史"第一人（图）_历史_环球网|last=李侠|website=history.huanqiu.com|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His view on oral history of historical characters is that historians should identify the changes of the people, and posit their evolution in parallel with that of history.&lt;!-- Original quote: "他认为给这些历史创造者写口述历史，应找出这类人物在历史演进过程中成长的经过，把他们做整个历史的平行研究。" Translated by editor. --&gt;His work include: 
* The Memoirs of V. K. Wellington Koo (1977)
* The Memoirs of [[Hu Shih]] (1977)
* The Memoirs of [[Li Zongren|Li Tsung-jen]] (1979)

==== Southeast Asia====
While [[oral tradition]] is an integral part of ancient Southeast Asian history, oral history is a relatively recent development. Since the 1960s, oral history has been accorded increasing attention both on institutional as well as individual levels, representing “history from above” and “history from below”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Loh|first1=Kah Seng|last2=Dobbs|first2=Stephen|last3=Koh|first3=Ernest|title=Oral history in Southeast Asia:  Memories &amp; Fragments|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|isbn=978-1-137-31167-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morrison|first1=James|last2=Lim|first2=Patricia|last3=Kwa|first3=Chong Guan|title=Oral history in Southeast Asia: theory and method|date=1998|publisher=National Archives of Singapore|location=Singapore|isbn=978-9813055773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Oral History and Public Memories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Paula|last2=Shopes|first2=Linda|title=Oral history and public memories|date=2008|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1592131419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackburn writes about oral history as a tool that was used “by political elites and state-run institutions to contribute to the goal of national building” in postcolonial Southeast Asian countries. Blackburn draws most of his examples of oral history as a vehicle for “history from above” from Malaysia and Singapore.

In terms of “history from below”, various oral history initiatives are being undertaken in Cambodia in an effort to record lived experiences from the rule of the Khmer Rouge regime while survivors are still living. These initiative take advantage of crowdsourced history to uncover the silences imposed on the oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirk|first1=Mimi|title=Confronting the Cambodian Genocide Through Oral History|url=https://www.citylab.com/life/2016/10/confronting-the-cambodian-genocide-through-oral-history/505646/|website=CityLab}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambodia: Oral Histories and Biographies|url=http://www.mekong.net/cambodia/oral_hst.htm|website=www.mekong.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BYU Cambodia Oral History Project - Cambodian Oral Histories|url=http://cambodianoralhistories.byu.edu/|website=Cambodian Oral Histories}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral history project brings Cambodia's hidden history to life {{!}} EIFL|url=http://www.eifl.net/eifl-in-action/oral-history-project-brings-cambodias-hidden-history-life|website=www.eifl.net|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimonies|url=http://cambodianwomensoralhistory.com/|website=Cambodian Women's Oral History Project: Life Stories of Survival under the Khmer Rouge Regime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== South Asia ====
Two prominent and ongoing oral history projects out of South Asia stem from time periods of ethnic violence that were decades apart: 1947 and 1984.

[[The 1947 Partition Archive]] was founded in 2010 by Guneeta Singe Bhalla, a physicist in Berkeley, California, who began conducting and recording interviews "to collect and preserve the stories of those who lived through this tumultuous time, to make sure this great human tragedy isn't forgotten." [https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2014/08/12/oral-history-project-races-to-record-voices-of-partition-survivors-in-india-and-pakistan/]

The Sikh Diaspora Project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thesikhdiaspora.com/|title=Delayed Justice|website=Delayed Justice|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2014 by Brajesh Samarth, senior lecturer in Hindi-Urdu at Emory University in Atlanta, when he was a lecturer at Stanford University in California. The project focuses on interviews with members of the Sikh diaspora in the U.S. and Canada, including the many who migrated after the [[1984 anti-Sikh riots|1984 massacre of Sikhs]] in India.

==Academia and Institutions==
In 1948, [[Allan Nevins]], a [[Columbia University]] historian, established the Columbia Oral History Research Office, now known as the Columbia Center for Oral History,&lt;ref&gt;http://library.columbia.edu/locations/ccoh.html&lt;/ref&gt; with a mission of recording, transcribing, and preserving oral history interviews. The [[Regional Oral History Office]] was founded in 1954 as a division of the University of California, Berkeley's [[Bancroft Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/about.html|title=About the Regional Oral History Office|publisher=Regional Oral History Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, American oral historians founded the [[Oral History Association]], and British oral historians founded the Oral History Society in 1969. In 1981, [[Mansel G. Blackford]], a business historian at [[Ohio State University]], argued that oral history was a useful tool to write the history of corporate mergers.&lt;ref name="blackfordthemergerprocessaninside2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blackford|first1=Mansel|date=May 5–7, 1981|title=The Merger Process: An Inside Look by Oral History|journal=Business and Economic History|volume=10|pages=57–59|jstor=23702531|registration=yes|via=[[JSTOR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Harvard Business School]] launched the Creating Emerging Markets project, which "explores the evolution of business leadership in Africa, Asia, and Latin America throughout recent decades" through oral history. "At its core are interviews, many on video, by the School’s faculty with leaders or former leaders of firms and NGOs who have had a major impact on their societies and enterprises across three continents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbs.edu/businesshistory/emerging-markets/Pages/default.aspx|title=Creating Emerging Markets|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Harvard Business School|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now numerous national organizations and an [[International Oral History Association]], which hold workshops and conferences and publish newsletters and journals devoted to oral history theory and practices. Specialized collections of oral history sometimes have archives of widespread global interest; an example is the [[Lewis Walpole Library]] in [[Farmington, Connecticut]], a department of the University Library of [[Yale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walpole.library.yale.edu/about/history-library|title=History of the Library {{!}} Lewis Walpole Library|website=walpole.library.yale.edu|language=en|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://walpole.library.yale.edu|title=Welcome {{!}} Lewis Walpole Library|website=walpole.library.yale.edu|language=en|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTCzxWt1RQk How to Record an Oral History Interview], [[University of Leicester]]&lt;ref name="UofL"&gt;{{cite web | title =Interviewing for Research | website = | publisher =[[University of Leicester]] | date = | url =http://www.le.ac.uk/emoha/howtointerview/index.html | accessdate =March 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
[[Historian]]s, [[Folkloristics|folklorists]], [[anthropologist]]s, [[Human geography|human geographers]], [[Sociology|sociologists]], [[journalist]]s, [[Linguistics|linguists]], and many others employ some form of interviewing in their research.  Although multi-disciplinary, oral historians have promoted common ethics and standards of practice, most importantly the attaining of the "[[informed consent]]" of those being interviewed.  Usually this is achieved through a [[deed of gift]], which also establishes [[copyright]] ownership that is critical for publication and archival preservation.

Oral historians generally prefer to ask open-ended questions and avoid leading questions that encourage people to say what they think the interviewer wants them to say.  Some interviews are "life reviews," conducted with people at the end of their careers. Other interviews focus on a specific period or a specific event in people's lives, such as in the case of war veterans or survivors of a hurricane.

Feldstein (2004) considers oral history to be akin to journalism, Both are committed to uncovering truths and compiling narratives about people, places, and events. Felstein says each could benefit from adopting techniques from the other. Journalism could benefit by emulating the exhaustive and nuanced research methodologies used by oral historians. The practice of oral historians could be enhanced by utilizing the more sophisticated interviewing techniques employed by journalists, in particular, the use of adversarial encounters as a tactic for obtaining information from a respondent.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Feldstein, "Kissing Cousins: Journalism and Oral History." ''Oral History Review'' 2004 31(1): 1-22&lt;/ref&gt;

The first oral history archives focused on interviews with prominent politicians, diplomats, military officers, and business leaders. By the 1960s and '70s, influenced by the rise of new social history, interviewing began to be employed more often when historians investigated [[People's history|history from below]].  Whatever the field or focus of a project, oral historians attempt to record the memories of many different people when researching a given event.  Interviewing a single person provides a single perspective. Individuals may misremember events or distort their account for personal reasons.  By interviewing widely, oral historians seek points of agreement among many different sources, and also record the complexity of the issues.  The nature of memory—both individual and community—is as much a part of the practice of oral history as are the stories collected.

==Archaeology==
[[Archaeologists]] sometimes conduct oral history interviews to learn more about unknown [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]]. Oral interviews can provide narratives, social meaning, and contexts for objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Paul|title=The rhetoric of things: historical archaeology and oral history|journal=Historical Archaeology|date=2014|volume=48|issue=1|pages=105–106, 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; When describing the use of oral histories in archaeological work, Paul Mullins emphasizes the importance of using these interviews to replace “it-narratives.” It-narratives are the voices from objects themselves rather than people; according to Mullins, these lead to narratives that are often “sober, pessimistic, or even dystopian.”

Oral history interviews were used to provide context and social meaning in the Overstone excavation project in [[Northumberland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Jane|last2=Tolson|first2=Louise|last3=Carlton|first3=Richard|title=The artifact as interviewer : experimenting with oral history at the Ovenstone miners' cottages site, Northumberland|journal=Historical Archaeology|date=2014|volume=48|issue=1|pages=11, 19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overstone consists of a row of four cottages. The excavation team, consisting of Jane Webster, Louise Tolson, Richard Carlton, and volunteers, found the discovered artifacts difficult to identify. The team first took the artifacts to an archaeology group, but the only person with knowledge about a found fragment recognized the fragment from a type of pot her mother had. This inspired the team to conduct group interviews volunteers who grew up in households using such objects. The team took their reference collection of artifacts to the interviews in order to trigger the memories of volunteers, revealing a “shared cultural identity.”

==Legal interpretations==

In 1997 the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], in the ''[[Delgamuukw v. British Columbia]]'' trial, ruled that oral histories were just as important as written testimony. Of oral histories, it said "that they are tangential to the ultimate purpose of the fact-finding process at trial – the determination of the historical truth."

Writers who use oral history have often discussed its relationship to historical truth. [[Gilda O'Neill]] writes in ''Lost Voices'', an oral history of [[East End of London|East End]] hop-pickers: "I began to worry. Were the women's, and my, memories true or were they just stories? I realised that I had no 'innocent' sources of evidence - facts. I had, instead, the stories and their tellers' reasons for remembering in their own particular ways.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gilda O'Neill|publisher=Arrow|title=Lost Voices|isbn=978-0-09-949836-0|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Duncan Barrett]], one of the co-authors of ''[[The Sugar Girls]]'' describes some of the perils of relying on oral history accounts: "On two occasions, it became clear that a subject was trying to mislead us about what happened – telling a self-deprecating story in one interview, and then presenting a different, and more flattering, version of events when we tried to follow it up. ... often our interviewees were keen to persuade us of a certain interpretation of the past, supporting broad, sweeping comments about historical change with specific stories from their lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.historyworkshop.org.uk/oral-history-creative-non-fiction-telling-the-lives-of-the-sugar-girls/ |title= Oral History &amp; Creative Non-Fiction: Telling the Lives of the Sugar Girls|publisher= History Workshop Online|date= 11 March 2012|accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alessandro Portelli]] argues that oral history is valuable nevertheless: "it tells us less about events as such than about their meaning [...] the unique and precious element which oral sources force upon the historian ... is the speaker's subjectivity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Portelli |first1=Alessandro |title=The Peculiarities of Oral History |journal=History Workshop Journal |volume=No. 12(1) |issue=1981 |pages=96–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the accuracy of oral history, Jean-Loup Gassend concludes in the book ''Autopsy of a Battle'' "I found that each witness account can be broken down into two parts: 1) descriptions of events that the witness participated in directly, and 2) descriptions of events that the witness did not actually participate in, but that he heard about from other sources. The distinction between these two parts of a witness account is of the highest importance. I noted that concerning events that the witnesses participated in, the information provided was surprisingly reliable, as was confirmed by comparison with other sources. The imprecision or mistakes usually concerned numbers, ranks, and dates, the first two tending to become inflated with time. Concerning events that the witness had not participated in personally, the information was only as reliable as whatever the source of information had been (various rumors); that is to say, it was often very unreliable and I usually discarded such information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean-Loup Gassend|publisher=Schiffer|title=Autopsy of a Battle, the Allied Liberation of the French Riviera, August September 1944|isbn=978-0-7643-4580-7|page=12|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noteworthy case is the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mau_Mau_Uprising?oldformat=true Mau Mau uprising in Kenya] against the British colonizers. Central to the case was Historian Caroline Elkins' study on UK's brutal suppression of the uprising. Elkin's work on this matter is largely based on [https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-22797624 oral testimonies] of survivors and witnesses, which causes controversy in academia: "Some praised Elkins for breaking the 'code of silence' that had squelched discussion of British imperial violence. Others branded her a self-aggrandising crusader whose [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/19/deaths-during-mau-mau-emergency overstated findings] had relied on sloppy methods and dubious oral testimonies."&lt;ref name="Parry"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/aug/18/uncovering-truth-british-empire-caroline-elkins-mau-mau|title=Uncovering the brutal truth about the British empire {{!}} Marc Parry|last=Parry|first=Marc|date=2016-08-18|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-07|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British court eventually ruled in the Kenyan claimants' favor, which also serves as a response to Elkin's critics as Justice McCombe's 2011 decision stressed the "substantial documentation supporting accusations of systematic abuses".&lt;ref name="Parry"/&gt; After the ruling, newly discovered files containing relevant records of former colonies from the [https://www.leighday.co.uk/International/Further-insights/Detailed-case-studies/The-Mau-Mau-claims/Hanslope-Park-disclosure Hanslope disclosure] corroborated Elkin's finding.

==Controversies ==
In Guatemalan literature, ''I, Rigoberta Menchú'' (1983), brings oral history into the written form through the [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/testimonio ''testimonio''] genre. ''I, Rigoberta Menchú'' is compiled by Venezuelan anthropologist Burgos-Debray, based on a series of interviews she conducted with Menchú. The Menchú-controversy arose when historian David Stoll took issue with Menchú’s claim that “this is a story of all poor Guatemalans”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burgos-Debray|first1=Elisabeth|last2=Menchú|first2=Rigoberta|last3=Wright|first3=Ann|title=I, Rigoberta Menchu: An Indian Woman in Guatemala|date=2009|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=978-1844674183|edition=Second English-language}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Rigoberta Menchú and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans'' (1999), Stoll argues that the details in Menchú’s ''testimonio'' are inconsistent with his own fieldwork and interviews he conducted with other Mayas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stoll|first1=David|title=Rigoberta Menchú and the story of all poor Guatemalans|date=2008|publisher=Westview|location=Boulder, CO|isbn=978-0813343969|edition=Expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Guatemalan novelist and critic Arturo Arias, this controversy highlights a tension in oral history. On one hand, it presents an opportunity to convert the subaltern subject into a “speaking subject”. On the other hand, it challenges the historical profession in certifying the “factuality of her mediated discourse” as “subaltern subjects are forced to [translate across epistemological and linguistic frameworks and] use the discourse of the colonizer to express their subjectivity”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Arias|first1=Arturo|title=Authoring Ethnicized Subjects: Rigoberta Menchú and the Performative Production of the Subaltern Self|journal=PMLA|date=2001|volume=116|issue=1|pages=75–88|doi=10.2307/463643|jstor=463643|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paremiology''' ({{Etymology|gre|παροιμία (paroimía)|proverb, maxim, saw}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparoimi%2Fa παροιμία], [[Henry George Liddell]], Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  is the collection and study of [[proverb]]s.

==History==
Paremiology can be dated back as far as [[Aristotle]]. [[Paremiography]], on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar [[Wolfgang Mieder]] defines the term ''proverb'' as follows:

{{Quote|A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation.|Mieder 1985:119; also in Mieder 1993:24}}

==Categorization==
As well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:
* proverbial comparison, such as "as busy as a bee."
* proverbial interrogative, such as "Does a chicken have lips?"
* [[wellerism]], named after [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1837), is a triad that consists of a statement (often a proverb), an identification of a speaker (person or animal), and a phrase that places the statement into an unexpected situation. An example: "Every evil is followed by some good," the man said when his wife died the day after he became bankrupt.
*[[anti-proverb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mieder|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Litovkina|first2=Anna|title=Twisted Wisdon: Modern Anti-Proverbs|date=2002|publisher=DeProverbio}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[perverb]]. This is a misuse or adaptation of a familiar proverb to twist or change its meaning. Examples include: "Nerds of a feather flock together," "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and likely to talk about it," and "Absence makes the heart grow wander." Anti-proverbs are common on T-shirts, such as "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatoshop.com/product/If-At-First-You-Dont-Succeed-Skydiving-Isnt-For-You |title=T-shirt with anti-proverb |publisher=Neatoshop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even classic Latin proverbs can be remolded as anti-proverbs, such as "[[Carpe diem|Carpe noctem]]." and "Carpe per diem." Anti-proverbs are not new; [[Aristophanes]] is credited with creating one over 2,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, Alster, Bendt. 1979. "An Akkadian and a Greek proverb: A comparative study". ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[proverbial expression]], such as "to bite the dust." This is not strictly a proverb, which should be a fixed unchangeable sentence; a proverbial expression permits alteration to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[allusion]], which is a reference to a proverb rather than a statement of the proverb. An example: "The new boss will probably fire some of the old staff, you know what they say about a ''new broom''." This allusion refers to the proverb "A new broom sweeps clean."&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

==Styles==
Typical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, ''The Perception of Proverbiality'' (1984)) are:

* [[Alliteration]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Fionnuala Carson. 2011. Alliteration in English-Language Versions of Current Widespread European Idioms and Proverbs. Jonathan Roper,  (ed.) ''Alliteration in Culture'', pp. 34-44. England: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (Forgive and forget)
* [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] (Nothing ventured, nothing gained)
* [[Rhyme]] (When the cat is away, the mice will play)
* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]] (Once bitten, twice shy)

==Poetic techniques==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In some languages, [[assonance]], the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from [[Oromo language|Oromo]], of Ethiopia.
* kan mana baala, aɂlaa gaala ("A leaf at home, but a camel elsewhere"; somebody who has a big reputation among those who do not know him well.)
Similarly, from [[Tajik language|Tajik]]:
* Az yak palak ― chand handalak ("From one vine, many different melons.")
* Man taanna adraka ma tamanna ("No point in running, one should leave on time.") Arabic
Notice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is &lt;a&gt;, the most common vowel in human languages.

Also in [[Amharic]], complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel &lt;ä&gt; is the most frequent vowel in the language.
*yälämmänä mänämmänä - (The one who begs becomes thin.)

Internal features that can be found quite frequently include:
* [[Hyperbole]] (All is fair in love and war)
* [[Paradox]] (For there to be peace there must first be war)
* [[Personification]] (Hunger is the best cook)

==Metaphorical links==
To make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. ‘[https://www.academia.edu/2353903/_The_Heart_of_Irish-Language_Proverbs_An_Linguo-Stylistic_Analysis_of_Explicit_Metaphor The Heart of Irish-Language Proverbs? A Linguo-stylistic Analysis of Explicit Metaphor’]. Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship 30 (2013): 113-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.
[[File:Nimm dich selbst by der Nase.JPG|thumb|''Nimm dich selbst bei der Nase'' ("take yourself by your nose"). It's also called "Vogel Selbsterkenntnis" (Bird of self-knowledge)]]

==Interpretations from other languages==
In the article "Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding", Joseph Raymond comments on what common [[Russian proverbs]] from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the [[Czar]]. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a "paremiological revolt". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent.{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;J. Raymond. 1956. Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding. ''Western Folklore'' 15.3, pg 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: "When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride"; "If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets"; and "The hen of the [[Czarina]] herself does not lay swan's eggs". While none of these proverbs state directly, "I hate the Czar and detest my situation" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.

Proverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).

==Users of proverbs==
Proverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes.  Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger Jr. The Role of Proverbs in a Nigerian Judicial System. ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology''. 15:1 (Spring, 1959) pp. 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively.  In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.

==Uses of paremiology==
The study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study [[folklore]] and [[literature]] are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc.  Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by [[Nazi]]s, see Mieder 1982.)

There are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as [[dominoes]] (Borajo ''et al.'' 1990) and the Oriental board game [[go (board game)|go]] (Mitchell 2001).  However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.

==Folklore==
One of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ojo Arewa and [[Alan Dundes]].  Proverbs and the Ethnography of Speaking Folklore. American Anthropologist. 66: 6, Part 2: The Ethnography of Communication (Dec 1964), pp. 70-85. Richard Bauman and Neil McCabe. Proverbs in an LSD Cult. The Journal of American Folklore. Vol. 83, No. 329 (Jul. - Sep., 1970), pp. 318-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive science==
Another important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.&lt;ref name="Richard P. Honeck 1997"&gt;Richard P. Honeck. A proverb in mind: the cognitive science of proverbial wit and wisdom. Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prior consistent statements''' and '''prior inconsistent statements''', in the law of [[evidence]], occur where a [[witness]], [[testifying]] at [[trial (law)|trial]], makes a statement that is either consistent or inconsistent, respectively, with a previous statement given at an earlier time such as during a [[discovery (law)|discovery]], [[interview]], or [[interrogation]]. The  examiner can [[witness impeachment|impeach]] the witness when an inconsistent statement is found, and may conversely bolster the credibility of an impeached witness with a prior consistent statement.

==Impeachment with a prior inconsistent statement==
Before the witness can be impeached the examiner must have extrinsic evidence of the prior statement. The examiner must also provide the witness with the opportunity to adopt or reject the previous statement. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lectlaw.com/files/crf13.htm Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 613]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the majority of U.S. jurisdictions, prior inconsistent statements may not be introduced to prove the truth of the prior statement itself, as this constitutes [[Hearsay in the United States|hearsay]], but only to impeach the credibility of the witness. 

However, under Federal Rule of Evidence 801 and the minority of U.S. jurisdictions that have adopted this rule, a prior inconsistent statement may be introduced as evidence of the truth of the statement itself if the prior statement was given in live testimony and under oath as part of a formal hearing, proceeding, trial, or deposition.&lt;ref&gt;In some U.S. jurisdictions, a prior inconsistent statement that is signed or adopted by a witness is admissible both for impeachment and substantive purposes. ''See'', ''e.g.'', [[Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Brady|''Commonwealth v. Brady'']], 507 A.2d 66 (Pa. 1986). 

This approach has been rejected in the federal system.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Note''' that under [[California Evidence Code]] ("CEC") §§769, 770, and 1235, prior inconsistent statements may be used for both impeachment and as substantive evidence, even if they were not originally made under oath at a formal proceeding, as long as "the witness was so examined while testifying as to give him an opportunity to explain or to deny the statement."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=47361519371+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve California Evidence Code §770]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolstering with a prior consistent statement==
===Prior consistent statements===

A prior consistent statement is not a hearsay exception, the FRE specifically define it as non hearsay. A prior consistent statement is  admissible:
# to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated a statement, for instance, during her testimony at trial; 
# the witness testifies at the present trial; and 
# the witness is subject to cross-examination about the prior statement &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_801 Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 801 (d)(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no requirement that the prior consistent statement have been made under oath at a prior trial or hearing.

A form of prior consistent statement excepted from this rule is that of prior identification by the witness of another person in a lineup.

A '''regional language''' is a [[language]] spoken in an area of a [[sovereign state]], whether it be a small area, a [[Federalism|federated]] [[State (administrative division)|state]] or [[province]], or some wider area.

Internationally, for the purposes of the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], ''"regional or minority languages" means languages that are: ''
#''traditionally used within a given territory of a State by nationals of that State who form a group numerically smaller than the rest of the State's population; and ''
#''different from the official language(s) of that State''&lt;ref name=COE-Charter&gt;{{cite web|title=European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages|url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/148.htm|website=Council of Europe|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of regional or minority languages must not be confused with recognition as an [[official language]].

==Influence of number of speakers==
There are many cases when a regional language can claim greater numbers of speakers than certain languages which happen to be [[official language]]s of sovereign states. For example, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (a regional language of [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and [[France]], albeit the [[national language]] of [[Andorra]]) has more speakers than [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or [[Danish language|Danish]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=Catalan only has 4M L1 speakers}}  A similar situation exists in China, where [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], spoken in southern [[Jiangsu]], northern, and the general area of [[Shanghai]] [[Zhejiang]] by more than 90 million speakers, is spoken natively by more speakers than [[French language|French]]; [[Yue Chinese]], a [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese regional variety]] spoken in [[Guangdong]], [[Hong Kong]] and nearby areas in [[China]] with more than 60 million local and overseas speakers (North America, parts of [[Malaysia]]), outnumbers [[Italian language|Italian]] in number of speakers. Dialects of the [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialect group have over 70 million speakers, mainly in [[Fujian]] and in nearby [[Taiwan]], but also in the [[Southeast Asian]] countries of [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].

==Relationship with official languages==
In some cases, a regional language may be closely related to the state's main language or [[official language]]. For example:

*The [[Frisian languages]] spoken in the Netherlands and Germany, which belong to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] family.
*The [[Modern Gutnish|Gutnish language]], a regional language spoken in [[Gotland]] and related to the Swedish language.
*[[Westrobothnian]] is another Swedish regional language native to historical [[Westrobothnia]].
*[[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] in [[Kurdistan]], which is an autonomous region in [[Northern Iraq]], Northwestern [[Iran]] and southeastern [[Turkey]].
*[[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] in northern Iraq, northeastern [[Syria]], southeastern Turkey and northwestern Iran.
* Regional varieties in China are considered part of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[macrolanguage]], with the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] being the most commonly spoken and [[Standard Chinese]] based on the [[Beijing dialect]].
**[[Wu Chinese|Wu]], in [[Shanghai]], southern [[Jiangsu]], [[Zhejiang]] and eastern [[Jiangxi]].
**[[Yue Chinese]], in [[Guangdong]], parts of [[Guangxi]], [[Hainan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], [[Cantonese]] is the regional standard variety for Yue-speaking areas
**[[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], in parts of [[Guangdong]], [[Jiangxi]], [[Fujian]], and [[Taiwan]]
**[[Min Chinese|Min]], in [[Fujian]], [[Taiwan]], eastern [[Guangdong]] and [[Hainan]].
**[[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], in [[Hunan]].
**[[Gan Chinese|Gan]], in [[Jiangxi]].
*[[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], a regional language of [[Poland]].
*[[Limburgish]], a regional language in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and Belgium, has around one million speakers and is closely related to [[Luxembourgish]], [[South Guelderish]] and [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]].
*[[Low German]] (also referred to as Low Saxon), an officially recognized regional language in Germany and the Netherlands, the direct descendant of [[Old Saxon]].

A '''script doctor''' is a writer or playwright hired by a [[film]], [[television]] or theatre production to rewrite an existing script or polish specific aspects of it, including structure, characterization, dialogue, pacing, themes and other elements.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Sarah| title=Film|year=2004| publisher=Smart Apple Media|location=North Mankato|isbn=158340256X|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To receive credit, the [[WGA screenwriting credit system|Writers Guild of America screenwriting credit system]] requires a screenwriter to contribute more than 50 percent of an original screenplay or 33 percent of an adaptation to receive credit.&lt;ref name="Abramowitz"/&gt; Uncredited screenwriters are not eligible to win the [[Academy Award]] or the [[Writers Guild of America Award]].

A script doctor should be distinguished from a [[script consultant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=| url = https://www.scriptmag.com/script-doctor-vs-script-consultant-analyst | title=Do I Need a Script Doctor, a Script Consultant or a Story Analyst?|year=2005|work = Script|accessdate=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Many screenwriters have done uncredited work on screenplays:
* [[Paul Attanasio]] (born 1959): ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' (1994), ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'' (1997), ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'' (1998), ''[[Patch Adams (film)|Patch Adams]]'' (1998), ''[[Town &amp; Country (film)|Town &amp; Country]]'' (2001), ''[[The Bourne Ultimatum]]'' (2007). "I really enjoy doing them. I basically analogize it to being the closer in baseball. There's something about the nature of that kind of pressure, where you're coming in at the ninth inning and throwing your fastball to three batters and leaving, that's exhilarating," Attanasio is quoted as saying from an article in the LA Times in 2002. 

* [[Al Boasberg]] (1891–1937): ''[[The General (1926 film)|The General]]'' (1926) and ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' (1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Erickson|first=Hal|title=Al Boasberg - About This Person|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/158592/Al-Boasberg|work=The New York Times|accessdate=November 8, 2013|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Carrie Fisher]] (1956-2016): ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991),&lt;ref name="McNamara"&gt;{{cite web|last=McNamara|first=Jonathan|title=Carrie Fisher on Spy in the House of Me, Tinkerbell and being the movie industry's best script doctor|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2008/04/carrie_fisher_on_spy_in_the_ho.php|work=Phoenix New Times|accessdate=August 19, 2012|date=April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sister Act]]'' (1992),&lt;ref name="Cagle"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cagle|first=Jess|title=The Prayer|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310617,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=May 29, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lethal Weapon 3]]'' (1992),&lt;ref name="McNamara"/&gt; ''[[Last Action Hero]]'' (1993),&lt;ref name="lahempire"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/last-action-hero | magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] | title=The Life And Death Of Last Action Hero | issue=269 | author=Nick De Semlyen}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The River Wild]]'' (1994),&lt;ref name="McNamara"/&gt; and ''[[The Wedding Singer]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="Setoodeh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Setoodeh|first=Ramin|title=Being Carrie Fisher|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2008/12/18/being-carrie-fisher.html|work=Newsweek|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ''Entertainment Weekly'' article from May 1992 described her as "one of the most sought after doctors in town."&lt;ref name="Cagle"/&gt; When asked if she was still working as a script doctor in December 2008, she said: "I haven't done it for a few years. I did it for many years, and then younger people came to do it and I started to do new things. It was a long, very lucrative episode of my life. But it's complicated to do that. Now it's all changed, actually. Now in order to get a rewrite job, you have to submit your notes for your ideas on how to fix the script. So they can get all the notes from all the different writers, keep the notes and not hire you. That's free work and that's what I always call life-wasting events."&lt;ref name="Setoodeh"/&gt;

Hecht was a snob, and hanging out at the [[Algonquin Hotel|Algonquin]] with [[Dorothy Parker]], it suited him to downplay his movie work, so he only received credit for about half of the 100 plus films he worked on."&lt;ref name="Morris"&gt;{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Mark|title=Get me Tom Stoppard|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/nov/30/tvandradio.television2|work=The Guardian|accessdate=August 17, 2012|date=November 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tom Mankiewicz]] (1942–2010): ''[[The Deep (1977 film)|The Deep]]'' (1977), ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977), ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978), ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' (1979), and ''[[Superman II]]'' (1980).

People had liked what they'd seen with the Bond films, especially the dialogue. I think that caught the attention of agents and studio heads, and they said, 'I want Mankiewicz to come in here and work on this project.'

* [[John Sayles]] (born 1950): ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' (1995), ''[[Mimic (film)|Mimic]]'' (1997). Sayles has stated that the script doctor's main role is to help others tell their stories. He decides which jobs to accept based on whether there is a germ of an idea for a movie he would actually like to see. He has also stated that he works harder when writing for others than he does on his own work.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzsfp7ufVyw&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2010 interview, he said: "With the script doctoring, I did it for [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] for a while, because I was just going through a period where I was having a very difficult time coming up with my own ideas and I was climbing the walls. So I did what is called 'the production polish', where you are brought into the last two weeks on something that you are not emotionally invested in, where it is not your job to break the story, to come up with the moving parts and plot points. Basically, they just wanted some snappy dialogue for Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. The first time I did it, actually, was for ''Schindler's List'' where no-one is looking for snappy dialogue, but the writer of that movie had gone on to direct a picture and there was a little more work that [director Steven Spielberg] wanted done before it went to Poland to begin shooting. He asked me to come in and do that, but you are obviously more interested in your own thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Will|title=Facebook movie The Social Network tells a Shakespearean tale of money, power and betrayal|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/film-tv-features/facebook-movie-the-social-network-tells-a-shakespearean-tale-of-money-power-and-betrayal-1.1060841|work=The Herald|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=October 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'The second reason for doing it is that you get to work with people you admire. The first reason, of course, is that it's overpaid.' Once, hearing the phone ring at home while in the shower, he took a call from [director] [[Paul Greengrass|Steven Spielberg]] on the set of ''[[Schindler's List]]'', agonising over a scene in [[Steven Zaillian]]{{'}}s script. Standing naked, Stoppard improvised a solution that was used in the movie. He remains bemused by this American habit of invisible script revision. 'I actually got quite angry with Spielberg, who was and is a good friend, and told him just to film Zaillian's script. But Steven, like a lot of other people in movies, tends to think one more opinion can't hurt.{{' "}}&lt;ref name="Lawson"/&gt; He also said, "I used to worry about it enormously, but it's a different culture. It's a moral issue, almost. A few years ago, I was invited to a film festival, as a freebie, because I'd done so much work on a movie that they said I should be there. And I said: 'I can't do that, because I'm not supposed to be on this film, and it's unfair to the chap whose name is on it.' But it just goes with the territory: these are the conditions one works under out there."&lt;ref name="Lawson"/&gt;

This is a situation I've been in a bunch of times. [...] ''Waterworld'' was a good idea, and the script was the classic, 'They have a good idea, then they write a generic script and don't really care about the idea.' When I was brought in, there was no water in the last 40 pages of the script. It all took place on land, or on a ship, or whatever. I'm like, 'Isn't the cool thing about this guy that he has gills?' And no one was listening. I was there basically taking notes from &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Kevin Costner]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, who was very nice, fine to work with, but he was not a writer. And he had written a bunch of stuff that they wouldn't let their staff touch. So I was supposed to be there for a week, and I was there for seven weeks, and I accomplished nothing. I wrote a few puns, and a few scenes that I can't even sit through because they came out so bad. It was the same situation with ''X-Men''. They said, 'Come in and punch up the big [[Climax (narrative)|climax]], the [[Three-act structure|third act]], and if you can, make it [[Film budgeting|cheaper]].' That was the mandate on both movies, and my response to both movies was, 'The problem with the third act is the first two acts.' But, again, no one was paying attention. [...] And then, in ''X-Men'', not only did they throw out my script and never tell me about it; they actually invited me to the [[read-through]], having thrown out my entire draft without telling me."&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''semantic overload''' occurs when a word or phrase has more than one meaning, and is used in ways that convey meaning based on its divergent constituent concepts. Semantic overload is related to the linguistic concept of [[polysemy]]. Overloading is related to the psychological concept of [[information overload]], and the computer science concept of an [[overloaded expression]]. A term that is semantically overloaded is a kind of "overloaded expression" in language that causes a certain small degree of "information overload" in the receiving audience.

An example of this is the [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''herri'' which can be translated as ''nation; country, land; people, population''; and ''town, village, settlement'',&lt;ref name=Aulestia&gt;Aulestia, G. ''Basque-English Dictionary'' (1989) [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] Press {{ISBN|0-87417-126-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; amongst other things leading to difficulties in translating the indigenous term [[Euskal herria#Etymology|Euskal Herria]]. Another example is the term ''memory'', especially as used in scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David C.|date=2005-02-15|title=The Abuses of Memory: Reflections on the Memory Boom in Anthropology|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/178196|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=78|issue=1|pages=197–211|doi=10.1353/anq.2005.0001|issn=1534-1518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Profanity|Expletive]]s are also notable for this quality, and conversely this quality is also a contributor to why such terms may be regarded as crude or inappropriate.

Meanings associated with a semantically overloaded word have different qualities: those the word itself [[reference|refers directly]] to, and other meanings [[Inference|inferred]] from its use in [[Context (language use)|context]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolinger|first=Dwight|date=1971-01-01|title=Semantic Overloading: A Restudy of the Verb Remind|jstor=412376|journal=Language|volume=47|issue=3|pages=522–547|doi=10.2307/412376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language planning==
Minority languages that spread into new domains frequently suffer from semantic overloading by attempting to adapt existing terms to cover new concepts. One such example from [[Scottish Gaelic]] is the over-use of the word ''comhairle'' (originally "advice, counsel") for concepts such as ''committee'', ''council'', and ''consultation'' as exemplified by Donald MacAulay in ''dh'iarr a' chomhairle comhairle air a’ chomhairle chomhairleachaidh'': "The committee sought advice from the consultative council"—a sentence that is opaque in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, Wilson ''Faclair na Pàrlamaid, a critical evaluation'' (2001) Department of Celtic and Scottish Studies, University of Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacAulay, Donald ''New Gaelic'' (1986) Scottish Language, 5, 120-25&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40821">A '''social employee''' is a worker operating within a [[social business model]]. Following an organization's social computing guidelines, social employees use [[social media]] tools both for internal [[workflow]] and [[collaboration]] purposes and for external engagement with customers, prospects and stakeholders through a combination of [[social media marketing]], [[content marketing]], [[social marketing]], and [[social selling]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = IBM Social Computing Guidelines|url = http://www.ibm.com/blogs/zz/en/guidelines.html|website = IBM|date = 2011-08-03|access-date = 2016-01-16|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social employee programs are considered to be as much about culture and engagement as they are about business processes and best practices. In addition to increased leads and sales, social employee best practices are said to improve business outcomes important to social media marketing, such as increased connections and web traffic, improved brand identification and "chatter", and better customer advocacy.

== Overview ==
The term "social employee" was first introduced to describe those exhibiting the emerging characteristics of workers operating under a social business model. The concept gained broader recognition in late 2013 with the release of ''[http://bluefocusmarketing.com/book-the-social-employee/ The Social Employee]'', co-authored by marketing consultants Cheryl Burgess and Mark Burgess.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the book, the term was used to describe the end result of efforts of organizations such as [[IBM]], [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]], and [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] to restructure their organizations, using a social business model and [[social computing]] principles to address the changing needs of both the workplace and their workers.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The term is often used interchangeably with similar designations like "employee advocate" or "social employee advocate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucial to the perceived value of the social employee is the concept of the [[digital footprint]]. While organizations are able to generate large bases of followers through social media, research shows that [[brand marketing]] and [[brand engagement|engagement]] efforts through these networks are not as effective as those of individual employees.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, social employee programs are designed to train, empower, and support employee engagement efforts in the hopes of authentically engaging larger communities, increasing the frequency of shares, reviews, and other forms of "earned media" and expanding the brand's presence on the web.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web

== The personal or employee brand ==
A foundational concept of the social employee is the idea of the personal or employee brand. This concept first gained popular attention in a 1997 [[Fast Company (magazine)|FastCompany]] article by business leader [[Tom Peters]] titled "The Brand Called You".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/28905/brand-called-you|title = The Brand Called You|date = August 31, 1997|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = FastCompany|publisher = |last = Peters|first = Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Peters argued that the premium placed on branding impacted workers' lives to such an extent that creating and cultivating a distinct personal brand had become a professional necessity. According to Peters, doing so built trust, loyalty, visibility, influence, and employability.

With increased adoption of social media tools by both businesses and consumers in the early 21st century, many business leaders became increasingly concerned with social engagement, both internally among employees and externally with customers and other stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jure-klepic/to-engage-or-not-engage-e_b_3998928.html|title = To Engage or Not Engage Employees in Social Media—That Is the Question|date = October 1, 2013|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = Klepic|first = Jure}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.clomedia.com/blogs/3-social-workforce/post/redefining-the-social-employee|title = Redefining the Social Employee|date = June 18, 2012|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = Chief Learning Officer|publisher = MediaTec Publishing, Inc.|last = Pontefract|first = Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many in the business community acknowledged the potential social tools had for improved collaboration, productivity, and brand messaging, the concern that employees would misrepresent their brand, disclose proprietary information, or otherwise damage their company's reputation or ability to conduct business persisted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2015/02/15/should-you-let-just-any-employee-tweet-about-your-company/eWMcp9r2LsBlS1WjBGKLiI/story.html|title = Should You Let Just Any Employee Tweet About Your Company?|date = February 15, 2015|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = The Boston Globe|publisher = |last = MIT Sloan Management Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, many began to advocate for employee branding as a solution to this problem. This helped give new meaning to the concept of [[brand ambassador]]ship, positioning everyday employees in public, and potentially high-profile, engagement roles.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.icims.com/hire-expectations-institute/article-the-advantages-of-a-social-employee-engagement-strategy|title = The Advantages of a Social Employee Engagement Strategy|date = December 2, 2015|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = iCIMS|publisher = |last = Yee|first = Angela}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this approach argued that successful employee engagement depended on training, strong [[organizational culture]], and individual empowerment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.business2community.com/branding/the-rise-of-the-employee-brand-0140637#Sr7BeGj6P7wVF3U0.97|title = The Rise of the Employee Brand|date = March 1, 2012|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = Business 2 Community|publisher = |last = Burgess|first = Cheryl}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was seen as an example of a [[Win-win game|win-win]]: The corporate brand benefits from increased transparency and authenticity, while the personal brand benefits through increased visibility and employability.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZUIp0ybaec|title = The Rise of the Social Employee|date = June 12, 2014|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = YouTube|publisher = TEDx Talks|last = Burgess|first = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

=== Engaged ===
Because social employee advocacy is dependent on the perceived authenticity of the employee, [[Employee engagement|engagement]] is highly valued in social organizations. Further, data show the measurable impact of employee engagement on organizational productivity and profitability:
* Happy employees were found to be 12 percent more productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.fastcompany.com/3048751/the-future-of-work/happy-employees-are-12-more-productive-at-work|title = Why Happy Employees Are 12% More Productive|date = July 22, 2015|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = FastCompany|publisher = |last = Revesencio|first = Jonha}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In one study, engaged employees were found to be 38 percent more likely to produce at above-average rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.talentculture.com/6-eye-opening-employee-engagement-statistics/|title = 6 Eye-Opening Employee Engagement Statistics|date = July 2, 2014|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = TalentCulture|publisher = |last = Photiades|first = Melissa Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another, organizations with engaged employees had a 19 percent higher than average shareholder return, while organizations with disengaged employees experienced shareholder return that was 44 percent below average.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.domo.com/blog/2013/05/employee-engagement-delivers-positive-returns/|title = Employee Engagement Delivers Positive Returns|date = May 2, 2013|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Domo|publisher = |last = Kehoe|first = Julie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Engaged companies were found to outperform disengaged companies by up to 202 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dalecarnegie.com/employee-engagement/engaged-employees-infographic/|title = Engaged Employees Infographic|date = |access-date = January 15, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = Dale Carnegie Training}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Companies with strong focus on culture were found to have an average 13.9 percent turnover rate, while those with a low focus experience were found to have a 48.4 percent turnover rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/238640|title = It Really Pays to Have a Rich Company Culture [Infographic]|date = October 21, 2014|access-date = January 15, 2016|website = Entrepreneur|publisher = |last = Siu|first = Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flexible job environment and work/life balance ===
The number of professionals working [[Mobile workspace|mobile or remote]] has risen considerably since 2010. While estimates vary, one study found that number of organizations with mobile or remote employees is expected to rise from 24 percent in 2012 to 89 percent by 2020.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.citrix.com/content/dam/citrix/en_us/documents/products-solutions/workplace-of-the-future-a-global-market-research-report.pdf|title = Workplace of the Future: A Global Market Research Report|date = 2012|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = Citrix}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has estimated that by 2020, 105.4 million professionals will work remotely in America, about 72.3 percent of the total workforce.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS25705415|title = IDC Forecasts U.S. Mobile Worker Population to Surpass 105 Million by 2020|date = June 23, 2015|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = IDC|publisher = |last = International Data Corporation (IDC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This change has been linked to a rise in social technologies, including [[biometrics]], [[Wearable computer|wearables]], [[Near field communication|near-field communications]], and [[augmented reality]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Social employees have also put a greater emphasis on [[Work–life balance|work-life balance]], with many believing that advances in technology can directly support efforts in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/05/career-success-means-work-life-balance_n_2812707.html|title = Career Success Means Work-Life Balance, Study Finds|date = March 5, 2013|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = Brooks|first = Chad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2013/04/18/8-ways-to-achieve-better-work-life-balance/#2715e4857a0b5793c01d3a25|title = 8 Ways To Achieve Better Work-Life Balance|date = April 18, 2013|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Forbes|publisher = |last = Smith|first = Jacquelyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purported benefits of this shift include a more flexible workforce, reduced business costs, and greater organizational leverage in attracting and retaining top talent.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Buys into the brand's story ===
In 2009, thought leader [[Simon Sinek]] presented a speech called "How Great Leaders Inspire Action" at a [[TEDx|TEDxPugetSound]] event. Sinek's central argument in this speech was, "People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en|title = How Great Leaders Inspire Action|date = September 2009|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = TED|publisher = |last = Sinek|first = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept—that the story behind a business or product offering is a more compelling sales tool than the product itself—is frequently cited in [[social media marketing]] as a way to build authentic connections with stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/232069|title = There's an Art to Telling Your Brand's Story: 4 Ways to Get It Right|date = April 3, 2014|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Entrepreneur|publisher = |last = Handley|first = Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2013/09/24/how-to-write-brand-stories-that-build-emotional-connections/#1d43e79062e22b4020f862e2|title = How to Write Brand Stories that Build Emotional Connections|date = September 24, 2013|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Forbes|publisher = |last = Gunelius|first = Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have argued that for employees to share a brand's story authentically, they must be engaged in that story themselves, and as a result, many companies have made storytelling part of their culture programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahmckinney/2014/02/24/this-company-is-turning-the-power-of-storytelling-within-for-employees/#2715e4857a0b4db11bb1790b|title = This Company Is Turning The Power Of Storytelling Within (For Employees)|date = February 24, 2014|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Forbes|publisher = |last = McKinney|first = Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.convinceandconvert.com/digital-marketing/storytelling/|title = How Internal Storytelling Impacts Company Culture|date = |access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Convince&amp;Convert|publisher = |last = Klotz-Guest|first = Kathy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.globoforce.com/gfblog/2014/transforming-company-culture-through-storytelling/|title = Transforming Company Culture Through Storytelling|date = March 6, 2014|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = Globoforce|publisher = |last = Jacobsen|first = Darcy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of securing employee buy-in and ownership for a brand's story is commonly referred to as "branding from the inside out".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/4/21/branding_from_the_in.html|title = Branding From the Inside Out|date = April 23, 2013|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = CMO.com|publisher = Adobe|last = Burgess|first = Cheryl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://marketing.about.com/od/marketingyourbrand/a/internalbrand.htm|title = Branding From the Inside Out|date = November 25, 2014|access-date = January 18, 2016|website = About.com|publisher = |last = Lake|first = Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collaborative ===
An implicit tenet in social business is that social technologies aren't a barrier to productivity, but rather a path to increased connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://marketinginsidergroup.com/social-media/social-employees-the-future-of-marketing/|title = Are Social Employees the Future of Marketing?|date = April 2, 2013|access-date = January 20, 2016|website = Marketing Insider Group|publisher = |last = Brenner|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift in [[enterprise software]] systems like [[IBM Connections]] to incorporate social communication models, such as [[Mention (blogging)|mentions]], [[wiki]]s, and [[News aggregator|newsfeeds]], reflects the changing communication dynamics within business. With an increase in diversity and sophistication in [[collaborative software]] platforms, social organizations have sought to find new creative ways to utilize these tools and secure employee buy-in around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://hbr.org/2015/04/why-no-one-uses-the-corporate-social-network|title = Why No One Uses the Corporate Social Network|date = April 7, 2015|access-date = January 20, 2016|website = Harvard Business Review|publisher = |last = Li|first = Charlene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crowdsourcing]] has also become popular in social businesses. Examples include AT&amp;T's program The Innovation Pipeline (TIP), begun in 2009, which has generated over 28,000 ideas that have led to over 75 projects with funding exceeding $44 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://dupress.com/articles/social-business-study-mit-smr/|title = Moving Beyond Marketing: Generating Social Business Value Across the Enterprise|last = Kane|date = July 15, 2014|journal = MIT Sloan Management Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = January 21, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM has also put considerable resources into such processes, producing its social computing guidelines through employee crowdsourcing, as well as its Connections platform through the Technology Adoption Program (TAP), a more formalized crowdsourcing initiative.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Social Employee|last = Burgess|first = Cheryl|publisher = McGraw Hill Education|year = 2013|isbn = 978-0-07-181641-0|location = New York|pages = |last2 = Burgess|first2 = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another popular form of internal collaboration is the hack day, or [[hackathon]]. Organizations such as [[Netflix]], [[Facebook]], and [[IBM]] use hack days to pull employees out of their day-to-day work environments and encourage them to collaborate in nontraditional ways in an attempt to drive [[disruptive innovation]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Netflix Tech Blog: Netflix Hack Day - Autumn 2015|url = http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/11/netflix-hack-day-autumn-2015.html|website = techblog.netflix.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stay focused and keep hacking|url = https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/stay-focused-and-keep-hacking/10150842676418920|website = www.facebook.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social employees are often encouraged to seek external collaboration opportunities with customers and prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Collaboration Tools Can Turn Your Business Into A Social Enterprise|url = http://www.cio.com/article/2937401/social-collaboration/how-collaboration-tools-can-turn-your-business-into-a-social-enterprise.html|website = CIO|access-date = 2016-01-22|first = Paul|last = Trotter}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Procter &amp; Gamble introduced the Live Well Collaborative to connect with external stakeholders and develop products and services for the 50+ demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Procter &amp; Gamble Uses External Ideas For Internal Innovation|url = http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/how-procter-gamble-uses-external-ideas-for-internal-innovation/|website = MIT Sloan Management Review|access-date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2010, [[Dell]] initiated Customer Advisory Panel (CAP) Days conferences to put customers and employees in direct contact with each other. The initial program proved very popular for the organization, with over 128 million CAP-related impressions generated on Twitter.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Social listener ===
A social listener is someone who engages in social listening, or [[social media monitoring]], for professional means. Social employees can use social media monitoring for a variety of reasons, including professional development, industry news and trends, and gauging market sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Best Social Media Monitoring of 2016 {{!}} Top Ten Reviews|url = http://social-media-monitoring-review.toptenreviews.com/|website = TopTenREVIEWS|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social Listening Enables Social Business|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2014/08/26/social-listening-enables-social-business/#71445c45818a|website = Forbes|access-date = 2016-01-25|first = Daniel|last = Newman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that social listening is one of the most important components of social business, as it enables organizations to collect rich market data, make more informed strategic decisions, and respond to customer needs more authentically.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://tompeters.com/blogs/toms_videos/docs/Leadership_Listening.pdf|title = Leadership: Listening|date = |access-date = January 25, 2016|website = Tom Peters|publisher = |last = Peters|first = Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Customer-centric ===
Advocates of customer-centricity in social business argue that social media has changed the dynamic from one-way brand messaging to shared interactions between brand and customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = To Build a Personal Brand With Social Media Takes Experimentation|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-cardon/to-build-a-personal-brand_b_4887210.html|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = Cardon|first = Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand and [[customer engagement]] is seen as a means of creating more lasting connections with customers and prospects and empowering them to become brand promoters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Collaboration Can Turn Customers into Brand Promoters|url = http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6551-customer-collaboration-tips.html|website = Business News Daily|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customer-centric interactions are seen to have distinct value to brands, as research shows that prospects are far more likely to trust brand-related messaging from a friend or family member than they are from a brand.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Nielsen: Global Consumers' Trust in 'Earned' Advertising Grows in Importance {{!}} Nielsen|url = http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/press-room/2012/nielsen-global-consumers-trust-in-earned-advertising-grows.html|website = www.nielsen.com|access-date = 2016-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a means of building social employees, some social advocates have also called for a broader definition of customer to include the employees themselves. In the book ''The Pursuit of Social Business Excellence'', authors Vala Afshar and Brad Martin made the following argument: &lt;blockquote&gt;A social business operates with the guiding principle that each employee’s responsibility is to serve one another, and that those we serve, even internally, are our customers. To earn internal customer trust and loyalty, each employee must be dependable, available, responsive, and committed to the success of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = In Pursuit of Social Business Excellence|author1=Afshar, Vala  |author2=Martin, Brad |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Charles Pinot|year = 2012|isbn = 0985356464|location = Sonoma|pages = Kindle locations 266–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In ''The Social Employee'', authors Cheryl Burgess and Mark Burgess echo this sentiment:&lt;blockquote&gt;The social employee understands that every customer is an employee somewhere, and that every coworker is a customer in many other places as well. No one likes feeling ignored or otherwise disregarded by a brand. The rise of social media means that every employee with a Twitter profile is a de facto brand ambassador. Social employees are not only aware of this, they work to maximize its impact. By prizing authentic engagement and rich exchanges, the social employee is able to leverage virtual platforms toward real-world results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Social Employee|author1=Burgess, Cheryl  |author2=Burgess, Mark |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2013|isbn = 0071816410|location = New York|pages = 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Adaptable ===
The relatively quick proliferation and prioritization of social media in business has driven a need for organizations to be more flexible and responsive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/global/files/us__en_us__socialbusiness__epw14008usen.pdf|title = The Social Business: Advent of a New Age|date = 2011|access-date = January 25, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = IBM}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in turn has led to a reprioritization of employee skill sets in which adaptability, self-directed learning, and organizational sharing are highly valued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Skills Gap and the Seven Skill Sets that Employers Want: Building the Ideal New Hire|url = https://www.ced.org/blog/entry/the-skills-gap-and-the-seven-skill-sets-that-employers-want-building-the-id|website = Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board|access-date = 2016-01-26|last = Herk|first = Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 10 Unique Soft Skills Employers Desire in New Hires|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234864|website = Entrepreneur|access-date = 2016-01-26|first = Heather R.|last = Huhman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social training programs are commonly structured around self-directed learning modules, and employees are encouraged to share knowledge resources with others to improve organizational intelligence (see "Training").&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Creating a culture of social learning {{!}} IBM Smarter Workforce Blog|url = https://www.ibm.com/blogs/smarter-workforce/2015/04/creating-a-culture-of-social-learning/|website = www.ibm.com|access-date = 2016-01-27|last = Burgess|first = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common features of social employee programs ==
According to Weber Shandwick, 47 percent of employees are either already prepared to advocate for their employers or willing to learn. Of those, 21 percent are what the study refers to as "ProActivists," or [[early adopter]]s, employees who actively use social media for professional purposes, with about half of this group already posting about their employer through social channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.webershandwick.com/uploads/news/files/employees-rising-seizing-the-opportunity-in-employee-activism.pdf|title = Employees Rising: Seizing Opportunity in Employee Activism|date = April 2, 2014|access-date = January 26, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = Weber Shandwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pilot program ===
Many organizations begin with a social employee [[Pilot experiment|pilot program]] to determine best practices suitable to their organizational structure.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Plotting Your Course with a Social Employee Pilot Program {{!}} Social Business Spotlight Blog|url = https://www.ibm.com/blogs/social-business/2015/02/10/plotting-your-course-with-a-social-employee-pilot-program/|website = www.ibm.com|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = Burgess|first = Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pilot to Deployed: Employee Advocacy is How You Scale Social|url = http://www.socialmediatoday.com/webinar/2015-03-17/pilot-deployed-employee-advocacy-how-you-scale-social|website = Social Media Today|access-date = 2016-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Program design depends in part on the size of the organization and the desired scope of social adoption. For instance, whereas [[Domo (company)|Domo]] implemented a mandatory pilot program requiring the participation of all its staff, [[Dell]] recruited approximately 200 employee participants through what was called the Social Media and Communities (SMaC) University.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Let the games begin! Welcome to the #domosocial experiment. {{!}} Domo Blog|url = https://www.domo.com/blog/2012/05/let-the-games-begin-welcome-to-the-domosocial-experiment/|website = www.domo.com|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = James|first = Josh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How Dell Trained 9,000 on Social Media - SMaC U|url = http://www.tomsitpro.com/articles/social_media_training-dell_SMaC_U-social_media_and_community_university,2-330.html|website = Tom's IT Pro|date = 2012-06-19|access-date = 2016-02-12|first = David|last = Strom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Discovery ====
A common first step in a social employee pilot program is an initial process of discovery in which organizations attempt to identify and quantify their current resources. This can include a roll call of employee early adopters, an internal audit of informal adoption of social tools and practices, or a skills test to determine current adoption rates.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://issuu.com/oksbf/docs/s_dt_en/1|title = Piloting the Future of Social Business: Branding From the Inside Out|date = June 2014|access-date = February 11, 2016|website = |publisher = Harvard Business Review Italia|last = Burgess|first = Mark|pages = 24–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when Adobe conducted an internal audit, it discovered a high rate of employee social adoption. However, because different groups were using different tools across departments, informal employee tool adoption was found to have a negative effect on productivity, creating redundancies and [[Information silo|silos]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Social computing policy ====
Many organizations will recruit employees to actively participate in designing the pilot program. A fundamental concern of social media use in business has been its potential for abuse—specifically regarding the release of confidential information, negative or off-brand messages, and security risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Should employees be allowed to use social networks at work?|url = https://www.socialmediaexplorer.com/social-media-marketing/employees-on-social-networks/|website = Social Media Explorer|access-date = 2016-02-12|language = en-US|last = Falls|first = Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, one focus in many social employee pilot programs has been to establish a set of social media guidelines. For example, IBM created an internal wiki and invited employees to help build a document laying out acceptable social engagement guidelines.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This document has since been adopted by several other organizations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Training ====
To social organizations, social employee training helps to unify employee programs and tools throughout the organization and establishes a common knowledge base and set of [[best practice]]s to assist employees in sharing and decision-making.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Many organizations us a combination of in-person training, digital learning modules, and [[Social learning theory|social learning]] principles.

Social employee training often applies the [[70/20/10 Model|70/20/10 learning model]] as its basis. In this model, 70 percent of learning is self-directed, 20 percent is informal mentoring or coaching, and 10 percent is formal training. Applying this dynamic, many organizations work to design a "digital learning experience" in which employees can access learning modules and other subject-specific content to help them acquire new skills.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.bersin.com/blog/post/Predictions-for-2015--Redesigning-the-Organization-for-A-Rapidly-Changing-World.aspx
| title = Predictions for 2015:  Redesigning the Organization for A Rapidly Changing World
| website = www.bersin.com
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Training is often divided into mandatory basic skills modules and optional advanced skills modules. To determine what social knowledge an employee needs, a baseline or "social IQ" test is often administered.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://www.domo.com/news/media/qa-assessing-the-social-media-payoff
| title = Media - Q&amp;A: Assessing the Social Media Payoff {{!}} Domo
| website = www.domo.com
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations, such as Adobe with its Center of Excellence (CoE) and Dell with its SMaC University, have expanded their training programs to establish a more permanent resource for employees.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 4 Top Employers for Social Media Professionals|url = http://mashable.com/2010/12/14/top-companies-social-media-professionals/|website = Mashable|access-date = 2016-02-12|first = Amy-Mae|last = Elliott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because social employee best practices affect organizational practice and culture in a broad way, upper management and executives are also encouraged to adopt social engagement best practices. Doing so is said to help drive buy-in among the workforce and reinforce organizational commitment to the program. Training for upper management and executives can often involve a process known as "reverse mentoring," in which a lower-level employee is brought in to help develop a senior-level manager's skills and basic digital literacy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social engagement and content marketing ===
Social engagement and sharing through both internal and external channels are considered key components of social employee design. Employees are encouraged to communicate with coworkers, customers, prospects, and stakeholders through social channels by sharing industry-related news or user-generated content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://marketingland.com/5-research-based-findings-prove-content-marketing-better-native-advertising-129953
| title = 5 Research-Based Findings Show Content Marketing Beats Native Advertising
| website = Marketing Land
| language = en-US
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internally, this process is often centered on keeping employees updated on company and industry news, helping employees collaborate on projects, and building culture. Many [[Enterprise social software|enterprise-level social platforms]] have been developed to facilitate such objectives, including task management platforms, wikis, file-sharing tools, and messaging services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://hbr.org/2013/07/the-real-power-of-enterprise-s.html
| title = The Real Power of Enterprise Social Media Platforms
| website = Harvard Business Review
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Externally, the focus is often on customer engagement, often through content marketing practices. Research has shown that social sharing can have a positive impact on metrics such as brand engagement, web traffic, and sales.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The advent of digital commerce has led customers to research products more thoroughly before make a purchase decision, using social reviews, peer recommendations, and product-specific content to help guide their decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| last = Burgess
| first = Cheryl
| date = February 18, 2016
| website = Blue Focus Marketing
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the value of peer recommendations specifically, a primary of goal of content marketing is to encourage customers and prospects to share the content among their personal networks as a form of "earned" advocacy.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Another popular social engagement strategy with stakeholders is resharing advocate-generated content through branded channels. This is believed to strengthen relationships with stakeholders and help to humanize the brand.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Assessment ===
Measuring the success social employee advocacy programs has presented a challenge to many organizations. While a small percentage of organizations assert that they are able to measure and validate their investment in social marketing, a larger percentage is either only qualitatively aware of the success of their social efforts or unable to measure whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.cmosurvey.org/
| title = The CMO Survey
| website = www.cmosurvey.org
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social business thought leaders argue that assessing the success of social employee programs must take into account more than financial [[return on investment]] (ROI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = http://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/social-media-roi-calculate-metrics/
| title = What’s the ROI of Your Mother?
| last = Vaynerchuck
| first = Gary
| date = December 2015
| website = GaryVaynerchuk.com
| access-date = 2016-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that consider a broader set of metrics than financial return often measure success through a variety of key performance indicators:
* Number of employee profile views and connections&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* Number of leads from social channels&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* Rate at which employee network grows&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* Frequency of shares and interactions&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* Increase in online "chatter" about a brand&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* Ability to attract and retain skilled talent&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;
* Increases in visibility, inbound web traffic, brand recognition, and brand loyalty&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
Many organizations, however, do report financial benefits as well. Social employees are more likely to exceed their sales quota, and social businesses in general are more likely to see increased sales leads and increase in revenues.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Gamification, engagement, and culture-building programs ===
Culture-building programs vary in scope and complexity, but all use social media in some way to underscore employee, departmental, or organizational accomplishments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Program leaders will issue social engagement challenges to help employees meet goals. Challenges can include number of connections (i.e., [[Like button|likes]] or follows, [[Reblogging|retweets]]), number of leads, or frequency of posts (i.e., status updates, [[Tweets (Twitter)|tweets]], [[blog]]s, etc.).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For a more competitive element, some organizations will employ [[gamification]] strategies such as leaderboards, achievement badges, and scavenger hunts.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10849">'''Speech acquisition''' focuses on the development of [[spoken language]] by a child.  Speech consists of an organized set of sounds or phonemes that are used to convey meaning while language is an arbitrary association of symbols used according to prescribed rules to convey meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Bernthal, J.E., Bankson, N.W., &amp; Flipsen, P. (2009) Articulation and Phonological Disorders: Speech Sound Disorders in Children. (6th edition). Boston, MA: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;
While [[grammatical]] and [[syntactic]] learning can be seen as a part of [[language acquisition]], speech acquisition focuses on the development of [[speech perception]] and [[speech production]] over the first years of a child's lifetime.  There are several models to explain the norms of speech sound or phoneme acquisition in children.

== Development of speech perception ==
Sensory learning concerning acoustic speech signals already starts during pregnancy.  Hepper and Shahidullah (1992) described the progression of fetal response to different pure tone frequencies.  They suggested fetuses respond to 500 Hertz (Hz) at 19 weeks gestation, 250&amp;nbsp;Hz and 500&amp;nbsp;Hz at 27 weeks gestation and finally respond to 250, 500, 1000, 3000&amp;nbsp;Hz between 33 and 35 weeks gestation.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper, P. G., &amp; Shahidullah, B. S. (1994). Development of fetal hearing. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition, 71(2), F81–F87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lanky and Williams (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Lasky, R.E. &amp; Trickey, A.W. (2005). The Development of the Auditory System from Conception to Term. NeoReviews 6(3). DOI: 10.1542/neo.6-3-e141.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that fetuses could respond to pure tone stimuli of 500&amp;nbsp;Hz as early as 16 weeks.

The newborn is already capable of discerning many phonetic contrasts. This capability may be innate. 
Speech perception becomes language-specific for vowels at around 6 months, for sound combinations at around 9 months and for language-specific consonants at around 11 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrn1533 |pmid=15496861 |title=Early language acquisition: Cracking the speech code |journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=831–43 |year=2004 |last1=Kuhl |first1=Patricia K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important that a newborn is already capable of detecting typical word stress patterns around the age of 8 months.

As an infant grows into a child their ability to discriminate between speech sounds should increase.  Rvachew (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Rvachew, S. (2007). Phonological Processing and Reading in Children With Speech Sound Disorders. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology. 16. 260-270. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9b7e/1674775fc3775c9c1a1da4b57c1e0ed2e821.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; described three developmental stages in which a child recognizes or discerns adult-like, phonological and articulatory representations of sounds.In the first stage, the child is generally unaware of phonological contrast and can produce sounds that are acoustically and perceptually similar.  In the second stage the child is aware of phonological contrasts and can produce acoustically different variations imperceptible to adult listeners. Finally, in the third stage, children become aware of phonological contrasts and produce different sounds that are perceptually and acoustically accurate to an adult production.

It is suggested that a child's perceptual capabilities continue to develop for many years. Hazan and Barrett (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Hazan, V. &amp; Barrett, S.(2000) Development of phonemic categorization in children aged 6-12. Journal of Phonetics 28(4):377-396 · https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222834995_The_development_of_phonemic_categorization_in_children_aged_6-12&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that this development can cotton into late childhood; 6 to 12 year old children showed increasing mastery of discriminating synthesized differences in place, manner, and voicing of speech sounds with out yet achieving adult-like accuracy in their own production.

== Typologies of infant vocalization==

Infants are born with the ability to vocalize, most notably through crying.  As they grow and develop, infants add more sounds to their inventory. 
There are two primary typologies of infant vocalizations. Typology 1: Stark Assessment of Early Vocal Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02699200500211451 |pmid=16728333 |pmc=3412408 |title=Assessing vocal development in infants and toddlers |journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=351–69 |year=2009 |last1=Nathani |first1=Suneeti |last2=Ertmer |first2=David J. |last3=Stark |first3=Rachel E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of 5 phases. 
#Reflexive (0 to 2 months of age) consisting of crying, fussing, and vegetative sounds
#Control of phonation (1 to 4 months of age) consonant-like sounds, clicks, and raspberry sound
#Expansion (3 to 8 months of age) isolated vowels, two or more vowels in a row, and squeals
#Basic canonical syllables (5 to 10 months of age) – a consonant vowel (CV) combination, often repeated (e.g. ba ba ba ba).
#Advanced forms (9 to 18 months of age) complex combinations of differing constant-vowel combinations (CVC) and jargon.

Typology 2: Oller's typology of infant phonations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oller |first1=J. W. |last2=Oller |first2=S. D. |last3=Badon |first3=L. C. |year=2006 |title=Milestones: Normal Speech and Language Development Across the Life Span |publisher=Plural Publishing |location=San Diego }}{{page needed|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists primarily of 2 phases with several substages.  The 2 primary phases include Non-speech-like vocalizations and Speech-like vocalizations.  Non-speech-like vocalizations include a. vegetative sounds such as burping and b. fixed vocal signals like crying or laughing.  Speech-like vocalizations consist of a. quasi-vowels, b. primitive articulation, c. expansion stage and d. canonical babbling.

== Speech sound normative data ==

Knowing when a speech sound should be accurately produced helps parents and professionals determine when child may have an articulation disorder. There have been two traditional methods used to compare a child's articulation of speech sounds to chronological age. The first is comparing the number of correct responses on a standardized articulation test with the normative data for a given age on the same test.  This allows evaluators to see how well a child is producing sounds compared to their same aged peers.  The second method consists of comparing an individual sound a child produces with developmental norms for that individual sound. The second method can be difficult when considering the differing normative data and other factors that affect typical speech development. 
Many norms are based on age expectations in which a majority of children of a certain age are accurately producing a sound (75% or 90% depending on the study). Using the results from Sander (1972),&lt;ref&gt;Sander, E. K. (1972). When are speech sounds learned? Journal of Speech and Hearing Disorders, 37(1), 55–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Templin (1957),&lt;ref&gt;Templin, M. (1957). Certain language skills in children: Their development and interrelationships. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Wellman, Case, Mengert, &amp; Bradbury, (1931),&lt;ref&gt;Wellman, B., Case, I., Mengert, I., &amp; Bradbury, D. (1931). Speech sounds of young children. University of Iowa Study, Child Welfare, 5(2), 1–82.&lt;/ref&gt; the American Speech-Language Hearing Association suggests the following: Sounds mastered by age 3 include /p, m, h, n, w, b/; by age 4 /k, g, d, f, y/; by age 6 /t, ŋ, r, l/; by age 7 /tʃ, ʃ, j, θ/. and by age 8 /s, z, v, ð, ʒ/.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asha.org/uploadedFiles/ASHA/Practice_Portal/Clinical_Topics/Late_Language_Emergence/Consonant-Acquisition-Chart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early, Middle, and Late 8s===

Shriberg (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1044/jshr.3601.105 |pmid=8450654 |title=Four New Speech and Prosody-Voice Measures for Genetics Research and Other Studies in Developmental Phonological Disorders |journal=Journal of Speech Language and Hearing Research |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=105–40 |year=1993 |last1=Shriberg |first1=Lawrence D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a model for speech sound acquisition known as the Early, Middle, and Late 8 based on 64 children with speech delays ages 3 to 6 years. Shriberg proposed that there were three stages of phoneme development. Using a profile of "consonant mastery" he developed the following:

* Early 8 – /m, b, j, n, w, d, p, h/
* Middle 8 – /t, ŋ, k, g, f, v, tʃ, dʒ/
* Late 8 – /ʃ, θ, s, z, ð, l, r, ʒ/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41406">[[image:LippenStudium1.JPG|thumb|250px|right|[[Children]] copy with their own [[mouth]]s the words spoken by the mouths of those around them. This enables them to learn the [[pronunciation]] of words not already in their [[vocabulary]].]]
'''Speech repetition''' is the [[speech|saying]] by one individual of the spoken [[Speech production|vocalizations]] made by another individual. This requires the ability in the person making the copy to map the sensory input they [[Hearing (sense)|hear]] from the other person's vocal [[pronunciation]] into a similar motor output with their own [[vocal tract]].

Such speech input output imitation often occurs independently of speech comprehension such as in [[speech shadowing]] when a person automatically says words heard in [[earphone]]s, and the pathological condition of [[echolalia]] in which people [[reflex]]ively repeat overheard words. This links to speech repetition of words being separate in the [[human brain|brain]] to [[speech perception]]. Speech repetition occurs in the  dorsal speech processing stream while speech perception occurs in the ventral speech processing stream. Repetitions are often incorporated unawares by this route into spontaneous novel sentences immediately or after delay following  storage in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]].

In humans, the ability to map heard input vocalizations into motor output is highly developed due to this copying ability playing a critical role in a child's rapid expansion of their  [[Vocabulary#Vocabulary growth|spoken vocabulary]]. In older children and adults it still remains important as it enables the continued learning of novel words and names and [[Second language acquisition|additional languages]]. Such repetition is also necessary for the propagation of language from generation to generation. It has also been suggested that the phonetic units out of which speech is made have been selected upon by the process of vocabulary expansion and vocabulary [[cultural evolution|transmission]]s  due to  children preferentially copying words in terms of more easily imitated elementary units.

==Properties==

===Automatic===

The imitation of [[syllables|speech syllables]] possibly happens even quicker: people begin imitating the second phone in the syllable [ao] earlier than they can identify it (out of the set [ao], [aæ] and [ai]).&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{Cite journal

The ability to repeat and imitate speech sounds occurs separately to that of normal speech. Speech shadowing provides evidence of a 'privileged' input/output speech loop that is distinct to the other components of the speech system.&lt;ref name="McLeod"&gt;McLeod P. Posner MI. (1984).

===Effector independent===
Speech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations in spite of vocal tract anatomy differences in size and shape due to [[gender]], [[Human development (biology)|age]] and individual [[anatomical]] variability. Such variability is extensive making input output mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: [[dentist]]s recognize three basic shapes of [[palate]]: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of [[malocclusion]] between the two [[jaw]]s; nine ways teeth relate to the [[dental arch]] and a wide range of [[maxilla]]ry and [[human mandible|mandible]] deformities.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomer HH. (1971). Speech defects associated with dental malocclusions and related abnormalities. In L. E. (Eds), Handbook of speech pathology and audiology (pp. 715-766), New York, Appleton Century. {{ISBN|978-0-13-381764-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and [[dental caries]]. Other factors that do not impede  the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation  are gross oral deformations such as [[hare-lip]]s, [[cleft palate]]s or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in [[ventriloquism]]). [[Paranasal sinuses]]  vary between individuals 20-fold in volume, and differ in the presence and the degree of their  asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Williams RJ. (1967). You are extra-ordinary. New York, Random House.  pp. 26-27. {{OCLC|156187572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vocal traits also vary moreover when people get upper respiratory tract infections  as the shape and size of sinus cavities is further changed with the swelling of mucous membranes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diverse linguistic vocalizations===
Vocal imitation occurs potentially in regard to a diverse range of phonetic units and types of vocalization. The world's languages use [[consonant|consonantal phone]]s that differ in thirteen imitable vocal tract [[place of articulation]]s (from the [[lip]]s to the [[glottis]]). These phones can potentially be pronounced with eleven types of imitable [[manner of articulation]]s ([[nasal stop]]s to [[lateral click]]s). Speech can be copied in regard to its [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|social accent]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Pitch accent|pitch]] and individuality (as with entertainment [[impersonator]]s). Speech can be articulated in ways which diverge considerably in speed, [[timbre]], pitch, [[loudness]] and [[emotion]]. Speech further exists in different forms such as [[song]], [[Poetry|verse]], [[Vociferation|scream]] and [[whispering|whisper]]. Intelligible speech can be produced with pragmatic intonation and in [[regional dialect]]s and [[Accent (dialect)|foreign accents]].

==Mechanism==

Spoken words are sequences of motor movements organized around vocal tract gesture motor targets.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer LH. (1984). Motor programming in language production. In H. Bouma &amp; D. G. Bouwhuis, (Eds), Attention and performance, X. pp. (17-41). London, Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-86377-005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalization due to this is copied in terms of the motor goals that organize it rather than the exact movements with which it is produced. These vocal motor goals are auditory. According to James Abbs&lt;ref&gt;Abbs JH. (1986). Invariance and variability in speech production, A distinction between linguistic intent and its neuromotor implementation. In J. S. Perkell, &amp; D. H. Klatt, (Eds), Invariance and variability in speech processes (pp. 202-219). Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-89859-545-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'For speech motor actions, the individual articulatory movements would not appear to be controlled with regard to three- dimensional spatial targets, but rather with regard to their contribution to complex vocal tract goals such as resonance properties (e.g., shape, degree of constriction) and or aerodynamically significant variables'. Speech sounds also have duplicable higher-order characteristics such as rates and shape of modulations and rates and shape of frequency shifts.&lt;ref&gt;Porter RJ. (1987). What is the relation between speech production and speech perception? In: Allport A, MacKay D G, Prinz W G, Scheerer E, eds. Language Perception and Production. London: Academic Press,: 85-106. {{ISBN|978-0-12-052750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such complex auditory goals (which often link—though not always—to internal vocal gestures) are detectable from the speech sound which they create.

==Neurology==

===Dorsal speech processing stream function===

Two cortical processing streams exist: a ventral one which maps sound onto meaning, and a dorsal one, that maps  sound onto motor representations. The dorsal stream projects from the posterior [[Sylvian fissure]] at the [[temporoparietal junction]], onto frontal motor areas, and is not normally involved in speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Carl Wernicke]] identified a pathway between the left posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] (a cerebral cortex region sometimes called the [[Wernicke's area]]) as a centre of the sound "images" of speech and its syllables that connected through the [[arcuate fasciculus]] with part of the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (sometimes called the [[Broca's area]]) responsible for their articulation.&lt;ref name="Wernicke"/&gt;  This pathway is now broadly identified as the dorsal speech pathway, one of the two pathways (together with the ventral pathway) that process speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Evolution and language==
Human language is a vocabulary-based form of communication that  unlike that of other animals employs tens of thousands of lexicals and names. This requires that young humans new to language have the ability to quickly learn both the pronunciations and use of many thousands of words. If children could not repeat speech without problems,  human language could not exist.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt;  This makes the evolution of the capacity of speech repetition a critical innovation needed for the [[origin of speech]]&lt;ref name="skoyles"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Sign language==
Words in [[sign languages]], unlike those in spoken ones, are made not of sequential units but of [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] configurations of subword unit arrangements, the spatial analogue of the sonic-chronological [[morpheme]]s of spoken language.&lt;ref name="Poizner"&gt;Poizner H.

Rosenbaum, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touchscreen keyboards==

As of 2015, there were diverse claims regarding the fastest typing in [[smartphone]]s and other [[touchscreen]] devices with [[virtual keyboard|on-screen keyboards]]. The typical [[yardstick]] is writing, with no [[Typographical error|mistakes]], the 160-character text:

:''The razor-toothed [[piranha]]s of the genera [[Serrasalmus]] and [[Pygocentrus]] are the most ferocious [[freshwater fish]] in the world. In reality they seldom attack a [[human]].''

A disputed issue is whether [[Autocorrection|auto-correct]] and [[Predictive text|predictive features]] should be allowed. Common sense indicates that they shouldn't, because when typing the record phrase several times the phone [[Machine learning|learns the text]]. Speed depends, then, on the phrase being repeated, a poor indicator of performance for everyday use. In the extreme, the phone could learn to predict "Serrasalmus" when typing just "Ser", but that would be extremely uncomfortable in normal circumstances ("[[wikt:ser|ser]]" is the Spanish word for "[[Be (verb)|being]]"). In fact, [[Guinness World Records]] establishes that "To qualify for the record, no autocorrect or predictive text features are allowed to remain on".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/corporate/2014/5/fastest-touch-screen-text-message-record-officially-broken-with-fleksy-keyboard-57380-57388 Fastest touch-screen text message record officially broken with Fleksy keyboard]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, [[Samsung]] posted a 35.54-second record with predictive texting, but no actual [[footage]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WAh-FqEizi4 Guinness World Record for Texting Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, [[Swype]], a predictive keyboard for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] where users swipe their fingers across the keyboard to enter one word per stroke, claimed a record of 25.94 seconds, but with prediction features on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phandroid.com/2010/08/24/text-message-speed-record-broken-thanks-to-swype-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s/ Text Message Speed Record Broken Thanks to Swype on the Samsung Galaxy S]&lt;/ref&gt; A [[YouTube]] user later claimed to have set a 21.8-second record on an [[iPhone]], but the posted video clearly showed autocorrect enabled and correcting at least four mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVXyVzLjKag Text messaging world record? I beat that (less than 21.8 seconds)!]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, in the midst of a publicity campaign for [[Windows Phone 8.1]], [[Microsoft Research]] published a new record of 18.44 seconds, also with predictive features on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/wordflow-040414.aspx Microsoft Brings World’s Fastest Texting to Windows Phone 8.1]&lt;/ref&gt; This record, obviously dependent on pre-learning by the keyboard's memory, became the object of mockery on the web.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_lXTtMa2xg&lt;/ref&gt; It was broken the next month when a time of 18.19 seconds was alleged by Brazilian youngster Marcel Fernandes Filho using the [[Flesky]] mobile keyboard on an Android phone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/5/fastest-touch-screen-text-message-record-officially-broken-with-fleksy-keyboard-57380/ Fastest touch-screen text message record officially broken with Fleksy keyboard]&lt;/ref&gt; While the firm claimed it was without autocorrection, video footage clearly contradicted this (e.g., the letter "B" was pressed when writing "genera"); furthermore, only a portion of the complete taping was displayed. This alleged record was admitted by Guinness in spite of violating its own rules of having the autocorrect feature off. Also, a [[dash]] (crucial for the record) appeared in the main keyboard, which was never a part of Fleksy's main screen. Thus, questions arose as to whether Guinness had been object of a [[misinformation]] scheme or even a party in it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exideas.com/ME/GamesAndContests.php How were the Guinness People Duped?]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014, Fleksy claimed Mr Fernandes Filho had broken his own record on a larger phone, but later removed the video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fleksy.com/dropping-price-breaking-world-records/ We’re dropping price, and breaking world records (again)!]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, TipType, a [[WYSIWYG|What-You-Type-Is-What-You-Get]] keyboard with a QWERTY layout but based on sliding movements rather than pressing (similar to Swype), launched a speed contest for phones of traditional size. The company posted a 25-second record with a [[Samsung Galaxy S3 mini]] on YouTube and promised [[USD]] 500 to anyone bettering that record on a touchscreen of size 4.5" or less, subject to Guinness World Records rules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6S_5fquM7E TipType Challenge, march 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speedwriting''' is the [[trademark]] under which three versions of a [[shorthand]] system were marketed during the 20th century. The original version was designed so that it could be written with a pen or typed on a typewriter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Speedwriting, the Natural Shorthand|date=1925|publisher=Brief English Systems, Inc|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the peak of its popularity, Speedwriting was taught in more than 400 vocational schools and its advertisements were ubiquitous in popular American magazines.

==Description of the original version==
The original version of Speedwriting uses letters of the alphabet and a few punctuation marks to represent the sounds of English. There are abbreviations for common prefixes and suffixes; for example, uppercase N represents enter- or inter- so "entertainment" is written as Ntn- and "interrogation" is reduced to Ngj.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Charles E.|title=Speedwriting Dictionary (English Version)|date=1930|publisher=Brief English Systems, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vowels are omitted from many words and arbitrary abbreviations are provided for the most common words.

''Specimen:'' ltus vaqt ll p/, aspz rNb otfm. Let us have a quiet little party and surprise our neighbor on the farm.&lt;ref name="textbook1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dearborn|first1=Emma B.|title=Speedwriting, The Natural Shorthand|date=1936|publisher=School of Speedwriting, Inc.|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By reducing the use of spaces between words a high level of brevity can be achieved: “laugh and the world laughs with you” can be written as “lfatwolfs wu.”&lt;ref name="dict" /&gt;

Original Speedwriting can be typed on a typewriter or computer keyboard. When writing with a pen, one uses regular cursive handwriting with a few small modifications. Lowercase 't' is written as a simple vertical line and 'l' must be written with a distinctive loop; specific shapes for various letters are prescribed in the textbook.

With twelve weeks of training, students could achieve speeds of 80 to 100 words per minute writing with a pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Students' Speedwriting Here Amazes Educators|journal=Brooklyn Daily Eagle|date=April 8, 1928|page=19|url=https://bklyn.newspapers.com/image/59876615/?terms=speedwriting%2Bamazes|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inventor of the system was able to type notes on a typewriter as fast as anyone could speak, therefore she believed Speedwriting could eliminate the need for stenotype machines in most applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dearborn|first1=Emma B.|title=Speedwriting, The Natural Shorthand: Book One (of the original correspondence course)|date=1925|publisher=Brief English Systems, Inc.|location=New York City|page=3|edition=first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the original version==
[[Emma B. Dearborn]] (February 1, 1875 - July 28, 1937&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=Dearborn&amp;GSiman=1&amp;GScid=2312427&amp;GRid=17005244&amp; findagrave.com]&lt;/ref&gt;) worked as a shorthand instructor and trainer of shorthand teachers at [[Simmons College]], [[Columbia University]], and several other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Speedwriting, the Natural Shorthand|date=1925|publisher=Brief English Systems, Inc|page=title_page}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an expert in several pen stenography systems as well as [[stenotype]].

Having seen students struggle to master the complexities of symbol-based shorthand systems and stenotype theory, Dearborn decided to design a system that would be easier to learn.&lt;ref name="sheff1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheff|first1=Alexander|title=Speedwriting Shorthand, Century Edition, Book One|date=1951|publisher=Speedwriting Publishing Co. Inc.|location=New York|page=iii}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early edition of her system was called "The Steno Short-Type System"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Worldcat search result|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/steno-short-type-system/oclc/752547937?referer=br&amp;ht=edition|website=Worldcat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dearborn organized a corporation in 1924 and [[rebranding|rebranded]] her shorthand system under the name of Speedwriting. Starting with just $192 of capital, she used print advertising to turn her textbooks and classes into a thriving international company&lt;ref name="brett" /&gt; with offices in England and Canada. Dearborn's company offered correspondence courses to individuals while [[vocational school]]s around the country paid an annual [[franchising|franchise]] fee for the right to teach Speedwriting classes within a specified territory.

In addition to the extensive use of newspaper and magazine ads, Speedwriting gained publicity from a few unsolicitied endorsements. Commander [[Richard E. Byrd]] commissioned Dearborn to teach her shorthand system to some members of his upcoming polar expedition.&lt;ref name="brett" /&gt; [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]] cited Dearborn as an example of women making great contributions to the business world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modern Woman a Radical in Business...|journal=Greenfield (Indiana) Daily Reporter|date=March 22, 1927|page=2|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/101148049|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 the [[Works Progress Administration]] sponsored free Speedwriting classes as part of its Emergency Education Program.

Dearborn committed suicide in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Eight Killed In Falls From N.Y. Windows|journal=Ottawa Evening Journal|date=July 30, 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Speedwriting organization continued publishing her textbooks and making franchise deals with vocational schools through about 1950.

==Later versions==
The second version of Speedwriting, designed by John Sheff (July 21, 1898 – June 27, 1978) in the early 1950s, introduced some symbols that could not be produced on a typewriter such as arcs representing the letters 'm' and 'w'. This version modified a few of the abbreviating principles also. Changes implemented in the Sheff version include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Speedwriting Shorthand, Self-Teaching Manual|date=1951|publisher=Speedwriting Pub. Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* vowels are included rather than omitted slightly more often; "cheap" is written as ''cep'' instead of ''cp''
* the word "the" is indicated by a dot rather than the letter t
* period at the end of the sentence is written as a large diagonal stroke \ rather than a dot
* past tense of a regular verb is indicated by a short horizontal stroke above the final letter of the root-word
* the -ing suffix is indicated by a short horizontal mark under the last letter of the outline rather than the letter g

A Spanish-language edition of the Sheff version was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheff|title=Speedwriting : taquigrafia a b c|date=1966|publisher=Instituto Speedwriting (Barcelona)|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1974 a variant of Speedwriting called Landmark Shorthand was taught in some American high schools and universities. Students generally enjoyed Landmark classes more than symbol-based shorthand because of the “immediate positive feedback… Within minutes, words, phrases and sentences are written readily.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harwood|first1=Frank|title=Some Alternatives to Traditional Shorthand|journal=Journal of Education for Business|date=1977|volume=52|issue=8|page=370|doi=10.1080/08832323.1977.10118312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s Joe M. Pullis designed the third major version of Speedwriting which further modified the system's symbols and principles. Changes implemented in the Pullis version include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Speedwriting Shorthand, Regency Edition|date=1984|publisher=Bobbs-Merrill Educational Pub.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* the sound of 'k' is written with lowercase c
* the "ch" sound is written with uppercase C
* the "sh" sound is written with a modified lowercase cursive s, as in [[Forkner shorthand]]
* the past tense of regular verbs is indicated with a hyphen on the line of writing
* the period, question mark, and end of paragraph symbols are identical to those of [[Gregg shorthand]]
* the brief forms for ''it/at, the, is/his'' are also the same as in Gregg

==Ownership history==
Ownership of the Speedwriting trademark and the textbook copyrights changed hands several times.

In 1931 the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled that a particular textbook of shorthand could be copyrighted but the system itself is an invention or process rather than a literary work and cannot be copyrighted. “There is no literary merit in a mere system of condensing written words into less than the number of letters usually used to spell them out. Copyrightable material is found, if at all, in the explanation of how to do it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief English Systems v.

'''''Spellbound''''' is a 2002 documentary that was directed by [[Jeffrey Blitz]]. The film follows eight competitors in the [[72nd Scripps National Spelling Bee|1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee]]. The film received positive reviews and won several awards. 

== Spellers ==
The spellers were Neil Kadakia, Emily Stagg, Ashley White, April DeGideo, Harry Altman, Angela Arenivar, Nupur Lala and Ted Brigham. As they appear from left to right on the DVD's cover:

=== Neil Kadakia ===
Neil (as speller # 139) missed "[[wiktionary: hellebore|hellebore]]" in the bee to get ninth place. Other words Neil spelled include: [[wiktionary: encephalon|encephalon]], [[wiktionary: desecration|desecration]], [[wiktionary: mercenary|mercenary]], [[wiktionary: Darjeeling|Darjeeling]], and [[wiktionary: hypsometer|hypsometer]].  He was sponsored by the ''[[Orange County Register]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocde.us/SpellingBee/Pages/default.aspx/|title=Orange County Spelling Bee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neil is a graduate of UC Berkeley. Before he went to college, he went on a jet ski expedition with his father and his sister, Shivani, also a speller.  He is currently the COO of Greens Global, a real estate company based out of San Clemente, CA. On July 3, 2011, he married Archana Sheth, also a UC Berkeley graduate. He is also an avid chess player, and has earned over 15 chess trophies in his life.

;
His grandfather paid 1000 people in India to pray for him.

=== Emily Stagg ===
Emily Stagg (speller # 148) was sponsored by the ''[[New Haven Register]]'' in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and spelled: [[wiktionary: seguidilla|seguidilla]], [[wiktionary: disclaimant|disclaimant]], [[wiktionary: kookaburra|kookaburra]], [[wiktionary: viand|viand]], [[wiktionary: apocope|apocope]], [[wiktionary: brunneous|brunneous]], [[wiktionary: clavecin|clavecin]] (spelled incorrectly as "clavison").  She came in 6th place.  In 2006, as a junior in [[Carleton College]], she wrote an op-ed article for the New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/opinion/31stagg.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp; questioning the usefulness] of the National Spelling Bee.

=== Ashley White ===
Ashley White (speller 149) represented ''The Washington Informer'' in [[Washington, DC]] in the spelling bee. Following Ashley's [[teenage pregnancy]] (she was 18), a marketing consultant who had seen the movie managed to rally support from other viewers of the documentary to help Ashley into Howard University. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13893-2004Jun3.html] The proctor of the Washington Informer regional spelling bee featured in the film is [[Mac McGarry]]

=== April DeGideo ===
April DeGideo, who lives in [[Ambler, Pennsylvania|Ambler]], [[Pennsylvania]], participated in the 1998 and 1999 bees, in the latter of which she placed third, representing the ''Times Herald'' of [[Norristown, Pennsylvania|Norristown]], Pennsylvania. April graduated in 2007 from [[New York University]] with a degree in Journalism. She then went on to get a second degree in creative writing and later went on to publish two books. ''The study guide'', and ''Where to start’’.

=== Harry Altman ===
Many critics who reviewed ''Spellbound'' singled out Altman (speller # 8) as its most interesting "character". Yet in the finals Altman is stumped by the word 'banns'. [[Roger Ebert]] wrote that he "has so many eccentricities that he'd be comic relief in a teenage comedy... He screws his face up into so many shapes while trying to spell a word that it's a wonder the letters can find their way to the surface."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/spellbound-2003|title=Spellbound|author=Roger Ebert|date=16 May 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went to the [[Bergen County Academies|Academy for Engineering and Design Technology]] in [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]], [[New Jersey]]. In autumn 2005, he enrolled in the [[University of Chicago]]. In 2014 Harry completed a PhD in Mathematics from the [[University of Michigan]], focusing on integer complexity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www-personal.umich.edu/~haltman/ University of Michigan Ann Arbor pursuing&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Angela Arenivar ===
Angela Arenivar represented the ''Amarillo Globe-News'' in the 1998 and 1999 bees.   Angela graduated from Texas A&amp;M University in 2007 with a bachelor's degree in Spanish and earned a master's in Spanish from the University of New Mexico in 2009.  She has taught Spanish in Texas public high schools.  Angela now attends Texas A&amp;M University pursuing her Ph.D. in Hispanic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelaarenivar.com/|title=Hello!  Not heleoplankton.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nupur Lala ===
Nupur Lala was the champion of the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee (as speller # 155), spelling "[[wiktionary: logorrhea|logorrhea]]" to win. Nupur won the bee against David Lewandowski, a speller from Indiana who misspelled "[[opsimath]]."  She turned down an MTV reality show that would have followed her college years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/05/nupur-lala-reflects-on-winning-national-spelling-bee-89296.html | title=Nupur Lala reflects on winning National Spelling Bee | date=May 27, 2013 | accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2003, she entered [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]] to study brain and cognitive sciences and pre-medical studies and graduated in 2007 with a degree in Brain, Behavior and Cognitive Science.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/gabrieli-lab/People/technical-assistant.html Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Gabrieli Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory website&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fall of 2014 she entered the College of Medicine at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.

=== Ted Brigham ===
Ted Brigham was speller # 1. He represented the ''Rolla Daily Record'' of [[Rolla, Missouri|Rolla]], [[Missouri]]. One of the more notable stories from his experience is the congratulations posted by students on the marquee in front of his high school in which "champ" was misspelled (presumably as an ironic joke) as "chapm".  Ted attended medical school in Kansas City, Missouri until his mysterious death in December 2007. His family chose not to disclose the circumstances of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/KansasCity/DeathNotices.asp?Page=LifeStory&amp;PersonID=99091039|title=Theodore Earl Brigham Obituary: View Theodore Brigham's Obituary by Kansas City Star|work=Kansas City Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other notable spellers ===
* '''George Thampy''' was speller # 245 in the bee and was mentioned several times within the film. He misspelled "kirtle" as "curtle" for third place, tying with April DeGideo. Thampy eventually won the 2000 national bee.
* '''David Lewandowski''' finished second place in the spelling bee, spelling "opsimath" as "opsomath". After David's mistake, Nupur spelled "logorrhea" to win the competition.
* '''Allyson Lieberman''' was originally slated to be featured as one of the spellers in the documentary, but her clips were ultimately left out of the film; the scene involving her can be found in the special features of the DVD. The youngest contestant in the entire 1998 bee, she misspelled "purblind".
* '''Frances Taschuk''' and '''Ann Foley''' are shown in the final set of scenes prior to the last round of the spelling bee. Frances misspells "acoelous" and Ann "quinquevir".
* '''Vinay Krupadev''' is in a scene involving Harry's mother feeling "sorry for the boy from Texas who got 'yenta'". She was referring to Vinay, who is actually from Marietta, Ohio, and his pronunciation of "yenta," shown in the film. He eventually spelled it "yente".
* '''Jess Altman''' was mentioned in a scene by Harry Altman for being a terrific speller and that he was disappointed she didn't make the Nationals.
* '''Sonia Nagala''' won the North Dakota bee with the word "butyraceous", but was eliminated in the second round of the Nationals.  She is currently{{when|date=May 2017}} completing her MBA at Harvard Business School.

* [[Frank Neuhauser]], winner of the first National Spelling Bee, held in 1925, also appears in the film.&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|title=Frank Neuhauser, winner of first national spelling bee, dies at 97 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/frank-neuhauser-winner-of-first-national-spelling-bee-dies-at-97/2011/03/21/AB9J9BAB_story.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |publisher= |date=2011-03-21 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16436">'''{{IAST|Sphoṭa}}''' ([[Devanagari]] {{lang|sa|स्फोट}}, the [[Sanskrit]] for "bursting, opening", "spurt") is an important concept in the Indian grammatical tradition of [[Vyakarana]], relating to the problem of speech production, how the mind orders linguistic units into coherent discourse and [[meaning (linguistic)|meaning]].

The theory of ''{{IAST|sphoṭa}}'' is associated with {{IAST|'''Bhartṛhari'''}} ({{circa}} 5th century&lt;ref name="date"&gt;
"Bhartrihari was long believed to have lived in the seventh century CE, but according to the testimony of the Chinese pilgrim Yijing [...] he was known to the Buddhist philosopher [[Dignaga]], and this has pushed his date back to the fifth century CE."
{{citation | year=1998 | title = Routledge encyclopedia of philosophy | editor1=Edward Craig | publisher=Taylor &amp;amp; Francis | isbn=978-0-415-16916-5 | page=764 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQ-GhVWTH84C&amp;pg=PA764&amp;dq=long+believed}}&lt;/ref&gt;), an  early figure in Indic linguistic theory, mentioned in the 670s by Chinese traveller [[Yi-Jing]].
{{IAST|Bhartṛhari}} is the author of the '''''{{IAST|Vākyapadīya}}''''' ("[treatise] on [[pada (foot)|words]] and [[vākya|sentences]]"). The work is divided into three books, the ''{{IAST|Brahma-kāṇḍa}}'', (or ''{{IAST|Āgama-samuccaya}}'' "aggregation of traditions"), the ''{{IAST|Vākya-kāṇḍa}}'', and the ''{{IAST|Pada-kāṇḍa}}'' (or ''{{IAST|Prakīrṇaka}}'' "miscellaneous").

He theorized the act of speech as being made up of three stages:
# [[Conceptualization]] by the speaker (''Paśyantī'' "[[idea]]")
# [[Performance]] of speaking (''Madhyamā'' "[[Transmission medium|medium]]")
# [[Understanding|Comprehension]] by the interpreter (''Vaikharī'' "complete utterance").

{{IAST|Bhartṛhari}} is of the ''{{IAST|śabda-advaita}}'' "[[śabda|speech]] [[advaita|monistic]]" school which identifies language and cognition.
According to [[George Cardona]], "Vākyapadīya is considered to be the major Indian work of its time on grammar, semantics and philosophy."

==Origin of the term==
While the  ''{{IAST|sphoṭa}}'' theory proper (''{{IAST|sphoṭavāda}}'') originates with {{IAST|Bhartṛhari}}, the term has a longer history of use in the technical vocabulary of Sanskrit grammarians, and Bhartṛhari may have been building on the ideas of his predecessors, whose works are partly lost.

Sanskrit ''{{IAST|sphoṭa}}'' is etymologically derived from the root ''{{IAST|sphuṭ}}'' 'to burst'.
It is used in its technical linguistic sense by  [[Patañjali]] (2nd century BCE), in reference to the "bursting forth" of meaning or idea on the mind as language is uttered. Patañjali's ''sphoṭa'' is the invariant quality of speech.  The acoustic element (''dhvani'') can be long or short, loud or soft, but the ''sphoṭa'' remains unaffected by individual speaker differences.   Thus, a single [[phoneme]] (''varṇa'') such as /k/, /p/ or /a/ is an abstraction, distinct from variants produced in actual enunciation.&lt;ref name=watw&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
Eternal qualities in language  are already postulated by [[Yāska]], in his ''[[Nirukta]]'' (1.1), where reference is made to another ancient grammarian, ''{{IAST|Audumbarāyaṇa}}'', about whose work nothing is known, but who has been suggested as the original source of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title=Audumbarayana's Theory of Language

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The grammarian Vyāḍi, author of the lost text ''Saṃgraha'', may have developed some ideas in ''sphoṭa'' theory; in particular  some distinctions relevant to ''dhvani'' are referred to by Bhartṛhari.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|author =Dominik Wujastyk
| title = Metarules of Pāṇinian Grammar, the Vyāḍīyaparibhāṣā
| year = 1993
| location = Groningen
| publisher = Forsten
}} 
Wujastyk notes, however, that there is no early evidence linking someone called Vyāḍi with a text called ''Saṃgraha'' that is said to be about language philosophy, and that the connection between the two has grown up through early misreadings of the ''Mahābhāṣya''.  Furthermore, the ''Saṃgraha'' is mainly referred to for having an opinion about the connection between a word and its meaning (''śabdārthasaṃbandha'').
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no use of  ''{{IAST|sphoṭa}}'' as a technical term prior to Patañjali, but  [[Pāṇini]] (6.1.123) refers to a grammarian named ''{{IAST|Sphoṭāyana}}'' as one of his predecessors. This has induced Pāṇini's medieval commentators (such as [[Padamañjari|Haradatta]]) to ascribe the first development of the ''{{IAST|sphoṭavāda}}''  to ''{{IAST|Sphoṭāyana}}''.

=={{IAST|Vākyapadīya}}==
{{further|Bhartṛhari}}
The account  of the Chinese traveller [[Yi-Jing]] places a firm ''terminus ante quem'' of AD 670 on Bhartrhari. Scholarly opinion had formerly tended to place him in the 6th or 7th century; current consensus places him in the 5th century.&lt;ref name="date"/&gt; By some traditional accounts, he is the same as the poet Bhartṛhari who wrote the [[Śatakatraya]].

In the {{IAST|Vākyapadīya}}, the term ''sphoṭa'' takes on a finer nuance, but there is some dissension among scholars as to what Bhartṛhari intended to say. ''Sphoṭa'' retains its invariant attribute, but sometimes its indivisibility is emphasized and at other times it is said to operate at several levels.
In verse I.93, Bhartṛhari states that the ''sphota'' is the universal or linguistic type &amp;mdash; sentence-type or word-type, as opposed to their tokens (sounds).&lt;ref name=watw/&gt;

Bhartṛhari develops this doctrine in a metaphysical setting, where he views ''sphoṭa'' as the language capability of man, revealing his consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | author = Coward, Harold G. |authorlink=Harold Coward
 | title = The Sphota Theory of Language: A Philosophical Analysis
 | publisher = Motilal Banarsidass,
 | year = 1997
 | isbn = 81-208-0181-4
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Indeed, the ultimate reality is also expressible in language, the ''śabda-brahman'', or "Eternal Verbum".
Early Indologists such as [[A. B. Keith]] felt that Bhartṛhari's ''sphoṭa'' was a mystical notion, owing to the metaphysical underpinning of Bhartṛhari's text, ''Vākyapādiya'' where it is discussed. Also, the notion of "flash or insight" or "[[revelation]]" central to the concept also lent itself to this viewpoint. However, the modern view{{according to whom|date=June 2015}} is that it is perhaps a more psychological distinction.

Bhartṛhari expands on the notion of ''sphoṭa'' in Patañjali, and discusses three levels:
# ''varṇa-sphoṭa'', at the syllable level. [[George Cardona]] feels that this remains an abstraction of sound, a further refinement on Patañjali for the concept of phoneme- now it stands for units of sound.
# ''pada-sphoṭa'', at the word level, and
# ''vakya-sphoṭa'', at the sentence level.

He makes a distinction between ''sphoṭa'', which is whole and indivisible, and ''[[nāda]]'', the sound, which is sequenced and therefore divisible. The ''sphoṭa'' is the causal root, the intention, behind an utterance, in which sense is similar to the notion of [[Lemma (psycholinguistics)|lemma]] in most [[psycholinguistic]] theories of speech production. However, ''sphoṭa'' arises also in the listener, which is different from the lemma position. Uttering the ''nāda'' induces the same mental state or ''sphoṭa'' in the listener - it comes as a whole, in a flash of recognition or [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] (''pratibhā'', 'shining forth'). This is particularly true for ''vakya-sphoṭa'', where the entire sentence is thought of (by the speaker), and grasped (by the listener) as a whole.

[[Bimal K. Matilal]] (1990) has tried to unify these views - he feels that for Bhartṛhari the very process of thinking involves vibrations, so that thought has some sound-like properties. Thought operates by ''śabdana''or 'speaking', - so that the mechanisms of thought are the same as that of language. Indeed, Bhartṛhari seems to be saying that thought is not possible without language. This leads to a somewhat [[whorfian]] position on the relationship between language and thought. The ''sphoṭa'' then is the carrier of this thought, as a primordial vibration.

Sometimes the ''nāda-sphoṭa'' distinction is posited in terms of the [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]]-signified mapping, but this is a misconception. In traditional Sanskrit linguistic discourse (e.g. in Katyāyana), ''vācaka'' refers to the signifier, and 'vācya' the signified. The 'vācaka-vācya' relation is eternal for Katyāyana and the [[Mīmāṃsā|Mīmāṃsakas]], but is conventional among the Nyāya. However, in Bhartṛhari, this duality is given up in favour of a more holistic view - for him, there is no independent meaning or signified; the meaning is inherent in the word or the sphoṭa itself.

==Reception==

===Vyākaraṇa===
''Sphoṭa'' theory remained widely influential in Indian [[philosophy of language]] and was the focus of much debate over several centuries.  It was adopted by most scholars of [[Vyākaraṇa]] (grammar), but both the [[Mīmāṃsā]] and [[Nyāya]] schools rejected it, primarily on the grounds of [[compositionality]].  Adherents of the 'sphota' doctrine were holistic or non-compositional (''a-khanḍa-pakṣa''), suggesting that many larger units of language are understood as a whole, whereas the Mīmāṃsakas in particular proposed compositionality (''khanḍa-pakṣa'').  According to the former, word meanings, if any, are arrived at after analyzing the sentences in which they occur.  This debate had many of the features animating present day debates in language over [[semantic holism]], for example.

The ''Mīmāṃsakas'' felt that the sound-units or the letters alone make up the word.  The sound-units are uttered in sequence, but each leaves behind an impression, and the meaning is grasped only when the last unit is uttered. The position was most ably stated by [[Kumarila Bhatta]] (7th century) who argued that the 'sphoṭas' at the word and sentence level are after all composed of the smaller units, and cannot be different from their combination.&lt;ref&gt;Gaurinath Sastri ''A Study in the Dialectics of Sphota'', [[Motilal Banarsidass]] (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the end it is cognized as a whole, and this leads to the misperception of the ''sphoṭa'' as a single indivisible unit.  Each sound unit in the utterance is an eternal, and the actual sounds differ owing to differences in manifestation.

The ''Nyāya'' view is enunciated among others by Jayanta (9th century), who argues against the ''Mīmāṃsā'' position by saying that the sound units as uttered are different; e.g. for the sound [g], we infer its 'g-hood' based on its similarity to other such sounds, and not because of any underlying eternal. Also, the ''vācaka-vācya'' linkage is viewed as arbitrary and conventional, and not eternal. However, he agrees with Kumarila in terms of the compositionality of an utterance.

Throughout the second millennium, a number of treatises discussed the ''sphoṭa'' doctrine.  Particularly notable is Nageśabhaṭṭa's ''Sphotavāda'' (18th century). Nageśa clearly defines ''sphoṭa'' as a carrier of meaning, and identifies eight levels, some of which are divisible.

===Modern linguistics===
In modern times, scholars of Bhartṛhari have included [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who did his doctoral work on the [[genitive]] in [[Sanskrit]], and lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European languages at the Paris and at the [[University of Geneva]] for nearly three  decades.  It is thought that he might have been influenced by some ideas of Bhartṛhari, particularly the ''sphoṭa'' debate.  In particular, his description of the [[sign (semiotics)|sign]], as composed of the signifier and the signified, where these entities are not separable - the whole mapping from sound to denotation constitutes the sign, seems to have some colourings of ''sphoṭa'' in it.  Many other prominent European scholars around 1900, including linguists such as [[Leonard Bloomfield]] and [[Roman Jakobson]] may have been influenced by Bhartṛhari.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frits Staal]], "The science of language" chapter 16  in [[Gavin D.

'''''The Adventure of English''''' is a British television series ([[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]) on the history of the English language presented by [[Melvyn Bragg]] as well as a companion book, written by Bragg. The series ran in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://folksonomy.co/?keyword=51057 |title=The collected episodes of The Adventure of English|publisher=Folksonomy|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series and the book are cast as an adventure story, or the biography of English as if it were a living being, covering the history of the language from its modest beginnings around 500 AD as a minor [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] dialect to its rise as a truly established global language.

In the television series, Bragg explains the origins and spelling of many words based on the times in which they were introduced into the growing language that would eventually become modern English.

 |ShortSummary=
The modern [[West Frisian language|Frisian language]] is the closest sounding language to the English used approximately 2000 years ago, when the people from what is now the north of the Netherlands travelled to what would become England, and pushed the Celtic language - ancestor of modern Welsh - ([[Celts]]) to the western side of the island. Words like "blue" can be recognised in the Frisian language.

Bragg then discusses how English dialects in certain areas of the United Kingdom were heavily influenced by historical events such as the invasion of the [[Vikings]] in the east, contributing words such as "sky" to the English language.

Short video clips of discussions with language expert Kathryn A. Lowe appear a number of times during the episode; she offers wonderful insight into the evolution of Anglo-Saxon and Old English.

Bragg discusses how class also affected the use of English, especially in the time of [[William the Conqueror]] and for approximately 300 years after his reign; during this period, only the French language and [[Latin]] were used in state affairs and by the aristocracy, while English remained in use with the lower peasant classes.

 |Title=The Battle for the Language of the Bible
 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|11|13|df=y}}
 |EpisodeNumber=3
 |ShortSummary=
In the early to mid 14th century, English fought to be the language of the Christian Bible through the efforts of theologian [[John Wycliffe]], who opposed the church's use of a Latin scripture because it prevented most of the population from reading the Bible for themselves. Though Wycliffe died before English became the official language of the Bible, Bragg discusses how his translation eventually led to the transition of various Latin words into the English language, including "emperor", "justice", "profession", "suddenly", or "angel".

Eventually, [[Henry V of England]] would use his power to create this English language Bible in the early 15th century. However, the difficulty of creating a common language for all the English dialects in the United Kingdom had to be addressed since there was such an array of spellings and pronunciations. Bragg explains, "The '-ing' participle, as in 'running,' was said as '-and' in the North, '-end' in the [[East Midlands]], and '-ind' in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]. So 'running' could also be said as 'runnand,' 'runnind,' and 'runnend.'" The number of spellings was even greater, Bragg offers sixteen different ways in which the word meaning "church" had been spelt at the time, including "kerke", "kirc", "chirche", "cherge", and "schyrche."

The Chancery had the duty of creating an official spelling for each spoken word, much of which is still used in modern English. Still, the spelling was confusing because of the debates that went on during this period, for example many words wound up being spelt as to their roots like the words "debt" and "doubt" which came from the French language. The word "rhyme" was given an "h" simply because the word "rhythm" already had one. Around this time the [[Great Vowel Shift]] also took place, which altered spoken English from the [[Old English]] pronunciation to a more modern sounding form.

The possession of an English Bible had become illegal once more and [[William Tyndale]] left the country to write his translation of the Bible from the original [[Hebrew]] and Greek version, which he published in 1526. Many of his sayings are still used today, including, "scapegoat", "the apple of mine eye", "eat, drink and be merry", and words such as "beautiful" and "zealous".

Eventually, [[Henry VIII of England]] wished for the creation of an English Bible and a new [[Church of England]] so that he could divorce his wife [[Catherine of Aragon]]. In time, [[James I of England|King James I]] would create an official version of the Bible which had become wide spread with various versions. This Bible deliberately used words like "ye" and "thou", which were no longer in common use, to create the sense that the words written would appear to be ancient, to have authority.

 |Title=This Earth, This Realm, This England
 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|11|13|df=y}}
 |EpisodeNumber=4
 |ShortSummary=
In [[Queen Elizabeth I]]'s time, English began to expand to even greater depths. Overseas trade brought new words from France, as well as the now popular swearwords "fokkinge" (fucking), "krappe" (crap), and "bugger" from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], in the 16th century. Sailors also brought all kinds of produce like apricots, bananas, limes, yams, cocoa, potatoes, port wine from Spain and Portugal, chocolate and tomatoes from France as well words from 50 other languages including "coffee", "magazine", and "alcohol" from [[Arabic countries]].

"The decade on either side of the year 1600 saw thousands of Latin words come into the English vocabulary of educated people, words like 'excavate,' 'horrid,' 'radius,' 'cautionary,' 'pathetic,' 'pungent,' 'frugal' [...]," states Bragg in this episode. The Inkhorn Controversy, a debate about the English language and where its new words should come from, soon followed. A few scholars, including [[John Cheke]], wished that the language should not use Latin or Greek words to expand the English vocabulary, but rather Anglo-Saxon ones.

English eventually obtained its own dictionary. Eight years before Italian and 35 years before French. However, this is a huge difference from the Arabic dictionary, which was made 800 years before and the Sanskrit, which was created nearly 1000 years before the English.

Scholar Katherine Duncan-Jones informs on poet, courtier, and soldier [[Philip Sidney]], who also had a large impact on the English language, introducing phrases like "my better half", "far-fetched", and words such as "conversation", which had previously had another meaning.

[[William Shakespeare]]'s contribution to the English vocabulary is one of the most famous. Over 2000 words used in modern English were first recorded in his writing, words such as "leapfrog", "assassination", "courtship", and "indistinguishable". Shakespeare's vocabulary included over 21,000 words, his plays translated into 50 different languages, and Bragg states, "The Oxford English dictionary lists a stunning 33,000 Shakespeare quotations."

 |Title=English in America
 |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|11|df=y}}
 |EpisodeNumber=5
 |ShortSummary=
Upon landing in North America, settlers encountered [[Squanto]], a native man who had been captured and brought to England to learn English and become a guide. After escaping, Squanto returned to his tribe, which happened to live near the place that the English settlers had created their small village. Among shockingly few other words, the settlers adopted "skunk" and "squash" into their vocabulary from the local language, making clear that they meant to impose their own culture, rather than adopt any other.

English began to change, not only in meaning, with "shops" becoming "stores", but also with the variety of accents becoming considerably less in number than in England. In the last 18th and early 19th centuries, [[Noah Webster]] wrote what was known as the American Spelling Book, or the Blue Backed Speller, which would become one of the most influential books in the history of the English language, [[Webster's Dictionary]]. This dictionary created simpler spellings, eliminating the "u" in words like "colour" and "honour", reducing "axe" to "ax" and reducing double letters to single ones, like in the word "traveller", now spelt "traveler" in the United States. Words with "-re" endings became "-er", and other spellings changed include "defence", which became "defense". Some words that England had dropped were kept in by Americans, such as "deft", "scant", "talented", "likely", and "fall" instead of the newer "autumn".

Two-thousand words were created in journals of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] toward the West, including "rapids", which came from the adjective "rapid". New words to the English language, such as "hickory", "moose", "pecan", and "toboggan" are derived from Indigenous languages. "There are hundreds of names made by combining existing English words," states Bragg, such as "black bear", "bullfrog", "blue jay", and "rednecks", who got their name from the sunburned necks they got from working in the fields. Rednecks couldn't afford steamboat fare, they travelled the water on rafts, using paddles called riffs, and they became known as the "riffraff."

Alcohol also added a great deal of words to the English language, "bootlegging" referred to hiding a flat bottle of alcohol in the leg of a boot. "And there were literally hundreds of terms for drunk," says Bragg. "Benjamin Franklin listed 229 of them minted in America, including... 'He's wamble-cropped,' 'He's halfway to concord,' 'He's ate a toad and a half for breakfast,' 'He's groatable,' 'He's globular,' [and] 'He's loose in the hilts.'"

Irish settlers brought words and expressions like "smithereens", "speakeasy", "Yes, indeedy", and "No, sirree".

[[Joseph McCoy]] had the idea to drive his cattle to trains and sell them to the Eastern states, creating a new meaning for the word "cowboy", and he made a lot of money in the process. Because of this, travellers would sometimes introduce themselves with his name, and in turn, he began to introduce himself as "the real McCoy".

The [[Gullah language]] is a mixture of English and other languages that is thought to be the closest to the one that slaves, brought over from various countries in West Africa and the [[Caribbean]], spoke in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Words like "banana", "zebra", "gorilla", "samba", and "banjo" were incorporated into English from the slaves living on plantations. The stripped-down grammar used in variations of English, like Gullah, is common when different languages come together. However, slave-owners took this to mean that they had lesser intelligence, when in reality their slaves were ultimately contributing words to the English language.

 |EpisodeNumber=6
 |ShortSummary=
The [[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]] began, and English scholars of mathematics and science like [[Isaac Newton]] started publishing their books in English instead of Latin. [[Jonathan Swift]] would attempt to save the English language from perpetual change, followed by [[Samuel Johnson]] who would write the ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'', made up of 43,000 words and definitions, written in seven years and published in 1755.

Though the upper and lower classes found no reason to change or improve their grammar, the middle class used it to their advantage in joining polite society. [[William Cobbett]], a son of the lower middle class and writer of [[Rural Rides]], advising those who wish to rise above their station that writing and speaking properly was essential.

As English began to replace Gaelic in Scotland it took on its own character, using "bonnie" from the French "bon" and "kolf" from the Dutch for "club", the probable origin for "golf". Several other words came from Gaelic, including "ceilidh", "glen", "loch", and "whisky". Pronunciation became an issue all over the United Kingdom, as some sounds could be spelt in several different ways, while one spelling could have several articulations. Irish actor [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]] wrote ''[[British Education]]'', a book that attempted to educate all English speakers in the proper pronunciation of words. However, some Scots were offended that their speech might be considered second-class and the Scottish poet [[Robert Burns]], son of a poor farmer, became the hero of the Scottish language. [[William Wordsworth]] also became a champion of the ordinary peoples' English, suggesting that poetry need not be written using haughty vocabulary.

The turn of the 19th century marked a period when women were more educated and their speech and literacy improved. Novels were thought to be a frivolous occupation for females until Jane Austen wrote about the capabilities of such works in her own novels; her works were highly proper, often using words like "agreeable", "appropriate", "discretion", and "propriety".

Then came the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the language that came along with it. The steam engine changed the meaning of words like "train", "locomotive", and "tracks" to be associated with the new technology. Along with this age came a change of social situation; the term "slum" came into use, and [[Cockney]] [[rhyming slang]] became a new form of speech for those in the lower class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1698">In the [[occult]] study of the [[esotericism|esoteric]] meaning of runes, the '''Uthark theory''' originated in the 1930s with the work of philologist [[Sigurd Agrell]] (1881–1937), a professor at [[Lund University]], Sweden.

He theorised that the ''rune row'' is a [[cipher]], and that one can understand its meaning by placing the first rune, "F", last, resulting in an ”Uthark” instead of the traditional [[Runic alphabet|"Futhark"]] order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.swipnet.se/~w-93783/uthark/uthark.html Uthark at Swipnet]. Accessed September 22, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He articulated the bulk of his theory in his book of 1932, ''Die spätantike Alphabet-Mystik und die Runenreihe'' [The Alphabet-mysticism of late antiquity and the sequence of the runes].

The suggestion has not been accepted in mainstream [[runology|runic studies]], due to lack of historical sources, but has found proponents in occult circles and in popular culture.

Kenneth Meadows promoted the Uthark theory in his 1995 book ''Rune Power''. [[Thomas Karlsson]], founder of the magical Order [[Dragon Rouge]] and [[Therion (band)|Therion]] lyricist, then published the first monograph dedicated to the subject after Agrell's work of 1932: ''Uthark: Nightside of the Runes''&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8596">{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], the '''value''' of a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] depends on its position and relations in the system of signification and upon the particular [[code (Semiotics)|codes]] being used.

==Saussure's value==

[[File:Semiotic Value.GIF|thumb|left|the internal, vertical relationship between signifier and signified is distinct from the horizontal relation of values between signs.]]

Value is the sign as it is determined by the other signs in a semiotic system. For linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], for example, the content of a sign in linguistics is ultimately determined and delimited not by its internal content, but by what surrounds it: the synonyms ''redouter'' ("to dread"), ''craindre'' ("to fear"), and ''avoir peur'' ("to be afraid") have their particular values because they exist in opposition to one another. If two of the terms disappeared, then the remaining sign would take on their roles, become vaguer, less articulate, and lose its "extra something" because it would have nothing to distinguish itself from.

For de Saussure, this suggests that thought is a chaotic nebula until linguistic structure dissects it and holds its divisions in equilibriums. This is akin to the philosophy of 
[[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]], who indirectly influenced Saussure&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article2869724.ece The Poet who could Smell Vowels]&lt;/ref&gt; and believed that the mind could only grasp an idea through distinguishing it from something that it is not. He reasoned that the two objects would otherwise collapse together for the mind and become indistinguishable from one another.

Value determines the sign as a whole, not just meaning. Sound is also an indeterminate nebulous. The arbitrary nature of the sign and the flexibility of sound means that an agreed upon contrast is required. For example, "zena" is useful because it stands in contrast to "zenb" within an agreed upon system. Without the distinction, "zena" could be used for absolutely anything, or indeed nothing, making communication an impossibility.

It must also be noted that it is only the sign as a whole that has value. Linguistic structure simultaneously unites sound with thought and decomposes "thought-sound" into linguistic units, or signs, consisting of a signifier and a signified (sound-pattern and concept, respectively). When analysed in isolation, the sound-pattern or concept are pure differences, emerging from series of sound-patterns or concepts that they themselves are dependent upon. But in isolation, they are mere abstractions, because neither can exist without the connection between the two. It is the sign as a whole, then, that is the concrete entity of structural linguistics, which is not a pure difference, a negative term, but a pure value, a positive term that is merely in opposition or resistance to all the other signs in the system.

== Definitions ==
=== Saussure ===
Drawing from the original definition proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857–1913), a sign has two parts:
*as a ''signifier'', i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, and/or hear, and 
*as the ''signified'', i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a ''thing'' rather than the thing itself.

This emphasises that the sign is merely a [[symbol]] for the [[class (philosophy)|class]] of [[object (philosophy)|object]] referred to. Hence, the [[lexical (Semiotics)|lexical]] word or noun "box" evokes a range of possibility from cheap card to gold-encrusted container. The reader or [[audience]] may not be able to see the particular box referred to but will be aware of its likely form from the other signs accompanying the use of the particular word.

However, there is no necessary connection between the signifier and the signified. There is nothing inherently ''boxy'' about the component sounds or letters that comprise the noun "box"—the scope of [[onomatopoeia]] is limited when forming a [[language]]. All that is necessary is that the relevant group of people should decide to use that word to [[denotation (Semiotics)|denote]] the object. Evidence that this is the correct view comes from the fact that each language can encode signifiers with whichever signified they wish to communicate. Hence, for example, the letters comprising "air" signify what humans breathe in English, and what fish breathe in Malay, i.e. water.

This makes a system of signs a very flexible mechanism for communicating [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]], but one which is conditioned by [[history]] and [[culture]], i.e. once a sign acquires a commonly accepted meaning in each language, it cannot arbitrarily be changed by any one person, but it is able to change [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]].

Further, [[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982)  proposes that when a group of signs is used, there is an emotive function that reflects the speaker's attitude to the topic of his or her [[discourse]]. Language and the other coding systems are the means whereby one self-aware individual communicates with another. By selecting particular signs and placing them in a context, the addresser is making a [[cognitive]] use of the sign system to refer to his or her own social, moral, ethical, political or other values.

=== Barthes ===
Because signs may have multiple meanings, a sign can only be interpreted in its context. Saussure believed that any one sign takes its value from its position and relations with other signs within the linguistic system. Modern semiotics draws its inspiration from the work of,  ''inter alios'', [[Roland Barthes]] (1915–1980), who argued that semiotics should expand its scope and concern: "...any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all of these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public entertainment: these constitute, if not languages, at least systems of signification" (1967, 9). 

In the system to be interrogated, the relations will be both weak and strong, positive and negative, qualitative and quantitative, etc. In this, a sign cannot be attributed a value outside its context (although what is signified may have [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meaning(s) that resonate outside the context), and what is ''not'' present can be just as significant as what is present.

In a slightly different context of critique through the ''archaeological'' and ''genealogical'' methods for the study of [[knowledge]], [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984) used the idea of [[discontinuity (Postmodernism)|discontinuity]] as a means to ''revalorise'' elements of knowledge. In this, he considered the silences and lacunae within a text to be as significant as express statements. In both systems, the specific processes of analysis examine these gaps to reveal whose interests are served by the omissions. Such analysis is particularly useful to identify which questions are left unasked.

==Methods==
The [[commutation test (Semiotics)|commutation test]] can be used to identify which signifiers are significant. The test depends on substitution: a particular signifier is chosen, then the effect of substituting alternatives is considered to determine the extent to which the value of the sign is changed. This both illuminates the meaning of the original choice and identifies the [[paradigms]] and [[code (Semiotics)|code]] to which the signifiers used belong.

[[Paradigmatic analysis]] compiles a list of the signifiers present in the text. This set comprises the paradigm. The analyst then compares and contrasts the set with absent signifiers, i.e. with other signifiers that might have been chosen. This reveals the significance of the choices made which might have been required because of technical production constraints or the limitations of the individual’s own technique, or because of the [[Trope (linguistics)|tropes]], generic [[Convention (norm)|conventions]], [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]] and [[rhetoric]]al purpose of the work. The analysis of paradigmatic relations helps to define the ‘value’ of specific items in a system.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1954">In the broadest sense of the word, a '''vocable''' is any meaningful sound uttered by people, such as a word or term, that is fixed by their language and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|vocable}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Saussure''&lt;/ref&gt;  However, use in the broad sense is archaic.  The term is currently used for utterances which are not considered [[word]]s, such as the English vocables of assent and denial, ''uh-huh'' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|h|ʌ}} and ''uh-uh'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|ʔ|ə}}, or the vocable of error, ''uh-oh'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʌ|ʔ|oʊ}}.&lt;ref&gt;Danesi (2004) ''A Basic Course in Anthropological Linguistics''&lt;/ref&gt; 

Such non-lexical vocables are often [[Non-lexical vocables in music|used in music]], for example ''la la la'' or ''dum dee dum'', or in magical incantations, such as ''abra-cadabra''.  Many [[Native American music|Native American songs]] consist entirely of vocables; this may be due to both phonetic substitution to increase the [[Sonorant|resonance]] of the song, and to the trade of songs between nations speaking different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Golla (2011) ''California Indian Languages'', §4.12.4&lt;/ref&gt;

Vocables are common as [[pause filler]]s, such as ''um'' and ''er'' in English, where they have little formal meaning and are rarely purposeful.  

[[Pseudoword]]s that mimic the structure of real words are used in experiments in [[psycholinguistics]] and [[cognitive psychology]], for example the [[nonsense syllable]]s introduced by [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]].

[[File:Rosetta Stone.JPG|thumb|The [[Rosetta Stone]], with writing in three different scripts, was instrumental in deciphering Ancient Egyptian.]]

'''Writing''' is a medium of human [[communication]] that represents [[language]] and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or [[spoken language]]. Writing is not a language, but a [[tool]] used to make languages be read. Within a language system, writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as [[vocabulary]], [[grammar]], and [[semantics]], with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of writing is called ''text'', and the recipient of text is called a ''reader''. Motivations for writing include [[publication]], [[storytelling]], correspondence, [[record keeping]] and [[diary]]. Writing has been instrumental in keeping [[history]], maintaining [[culture]], dissemination of knowledge through the [[Mass media|media]] and the formation of [[legal systems]].

As human societies emerged, the development of writing was driven by pragmatic exigencies such as exchanging information, maintaining financial accounts, codifying laws and recording history. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration in [[Mesopotamia]] outgrew human memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=36}} In both [[ancient Egypt]] and [[Mesoamerica]], writing may have evolved through calendric and a political necessity for recording historical and environmental events.

== Means of recording information ==
[[H.G. Wells]] argued that writing has the ability to "put agreements, laws, commandments on record. It made the growth of states larger than the old city states possible. It made a continuous historical consciousness possible. The command of the priest or king and his seal could go far beyond his sight and voice and could survive his death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =A Short History of the World |first=H. G. |last=Wells |year=1922 |page=41|title-link=A Short History of the World (H. G. Wells) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing systems ===
{{Main article|Writing system}}
[[File:Fountain pen writing (literacy).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Alphabet]]ic writing is a frequent category in [[human communication]]. ]]
The major [[writing system]]s—methods of inscription—broadly fall into five categories: [[logographic]], [[Syllable|syllabic]], [[alphabetic]], [[featural]], and [[ideographic]] (symbols for ideas). A sixth category, [[pictographic]], is insufficient to represent language on its own, but often forms the core of logographies.

====Logographies====
A [[logogram]] is a written character which represents a word or [[morpheme]]. A vast number of logograms are needed to write [[Chinese characters]], [[cuneiform]], and [[Mayan script|Mayan]], where a glyph may stand for a morpheme, a syllable, or both—("logoconsonantal" in the case of hieroglyphs). Many logograms have an ideographic component (Chinese "radicals", hieroglyphic "determiners"). For example, in Mayan, the glyph for "fin", pronounced "ka", was also used to represent the syllable "ka" whenever the pronunciation of a logogram needed to be indicated, or when there was no logogram. In Chinese, about 90% of characters are compounds of a semantic (meaning) element called a ''radical'' with an existing character to indicate the pronunciation, called a ''phonetic''. However, such phonetic elements complement the logographic elements, rather than vice versa.

The main logographic system in use today is [[Chinese characters]], used with some modification for the various languages or dialects of [[languages of China|China]], [[languages of Japan|Japan]], and sometimes in [[Korean language|Korean]] despite the fact that in [[South Korea|South]] and [[North Korea]], the phonetic [[Hangul]] system is mainly used.

====Syllabaries====
A [[syllabary]] is a set of written symbols that represent (or approximate) [[syllable]]s. A glyph in a syllabary typically represents a consonant followed by a vowel, or just a vowel alone, though in some scripts more complex syllables (such as consonant-vowel-consonant, or consonant-consonant-vowel) may have dedicated glyphs. Phonetically related syllables are not so indicated in the script. For instance, the syllable "ka" may look nothing like the syllable "ki", nor will syllables with the same vowels be similar.

Syllabaries are best suited to languages with a relatively simple syllable structure, such as Japanese. Other languages that use syllabic writing include the [[Linear B]] script for [[Mycenaean Greek]]; [[Cherokee]]; [[Ndyuka language|Ndjuka]], an English-based [[creole language]] of [[Surinam]]; and the [[Vai language|Vai]] script of [[Liberia]]. Most logographic systems have a strong syllabic component. [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic]], though technically an [[abugida]], has fused consonants and vowels together to the point where it is learned as if it were a syllabary.

====Alphabets====
{{See also|History of the alphabet}}

An [[alphabet]] is a set of symbols, each of which represents or historically represented a phoneme of the language. In a perfectly [[phonology|phonological]] alphabet, the phonemes and letters would correspond perfectly in two directions: a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker could predict the pronunciation of a word given its spelling.

As languages often evolve independently of their writing systems, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.

=====Abjads=====
In most of the writing systems of the Middle East, it is usually only the consonants of a word that are written, although vowels may be indicated by the addition of various diacritical marks. Writing systems based primarily on marking the consonant phonemes alone date back to the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt. Such systems are called ''[[abjad]]s'', derived from the Arabic word for "alphabet".

=====Abugidas=====
In most of the alphabets of India and Southeast Asia, vowels are indicated through diacritics or modification of the shape of the consonant. These are called ''[[abugida]]s''. Some abugidas, such as [[Ethiopic]] and [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cree]], are learned by children as syllabaries, and so are often called "syllabics". However, unlike true syllabaries, there is not an independent glyph for each syllable.

Sometimes the term "alphabet" is restricted to systems with separate letters for consonants and vowels, such as the [[Latin alphabet]], although abugidas and abjads may also be accepted as alphabets. Because of this use, [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] is often considered to be the first alphabet.

====Featural scripts====
A featural script notates the building blocks of the phonemes that make up a language. For instance, all sounds pronounced with the lips ("labial" sounds) may have some element in common. In the Latin alphabet, this is accidentally the case with the letters "b" and "p"; however, labial "m" is completely dissimilar, and the similar-looking "q" and "d" are not labial. In Korean [[hangul]], however, all four labial consonants are based on the same basic element, but in practice, Korean is learned by children as an ordinary alphabet, and the featural elements tend to pass unnoticed.

Another featural script is [[SignWriting]], the most popular writing system for many [[sign languages]], where the shapes and movements of the hands and face are represented [[secular icon|iconically]]. Featural scripts are also common in fictional or invented systems, such as [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Tengwar]].

====Historical significance of writing systems====
[[Image:Olin-Warner-LoC-tympanum-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|300px|[[Olin Levi Warner]], [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] representing Writing, above exterior of main entrance doors, [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington DC, 1896.]]

Historians draw a sharp distinction between prehistory and history, with history defined by the advent of writing. The cave paintings and petroglyphs of prehistoric peoples can be considered precursors of writing, but they are not considered true writing because they did not represent language directly.

Writing systems develop and change based on the needs of the people who use them. Sometimes the shape, orientation, and meaning of individual signs changes over time. By tracing the development of a script, it is possible to learn about the needs of the people who used the script as well as how the script changed over time.

===Tools and materials===
{{See also|writing implements}}
The many tools and writing materials used throughout history include [[stone tablet]]s, [[clay tablet]]s, bamboo slats, [[papyrus]], [[wax tablet]]s, [[vellum]], [[parchment]], [[paper]], [[intaglio printing|copperplate]], [[stylus]]es, [[quill]]s, [[ink brush]]es, [[pencil]]s, [[pen]]s, and many styles of [[lithography]]. The Incas used knotted cords known as [[quipu]] (or khipu) for keeping records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://khipukamayuq.fas.harvard.edu/index.html|title=The Khipu Database Project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[typewriter]] and various forms of [[word processor]]s have subsequently become widespread writing tools, and various studies have compared the ways in which writers have framed the experience of writing with such tools as compared with the pen or pencil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==History==
{{Main article|Proto-writing|History of writing}}

===Neolithic writing===
[[File:Tărtăria Amulet.png|thumb|250px|Amulet of the [[Tărtăria tablets]], the earliest found example of the [[Old European script]] and of human writing in the world generally, dating to 5500–5300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Haarmann, Harald (2002). ''Geschichte der Schrift'', C.H. Beck, {{ISBN|3-406-47998-7}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; It is a product of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]] that was in [[Romania]] and neighbouring regions.]]

By definition, the modern practice of [[history]] begins with written records. Evidence of human culture without writing is the realm of [[prehistory]]. The [[Dispilio Tablet]] (Greece), [[Jiahu symbols]] (China) and [[Tărtăria tablets]] (Romania), which have been carbon dated to the [[6th millennium BC]], are recent discoveries of the earliest known neolithic writings.

===Mesopotamia===
While neolithic writing is a current research topic, conventional history assumes that the writing process first evolved from economic necessity in the ancient Near East. Writing most likely began as a consequence of political expansion in ancient cultures, which needed reliable means for transmitting information, maintaining financial accounts, keeping historical records, and similar activities. Around the 4th millennium BC, the complexity of trade and administration outgrew the power of memory, and writing became a more dependable method of recording and presenting transactions in a permanent form.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=36}}

[[File:Accountancy clay envelope Louvre Sb1932.jpg|thumb|upright|Globular envelope with a cluster of accountancy tokens, Uruk period, from [[Susa]]. [[Louvre Museum]]]]

Archaeologist [[Denise Schmandt-Besserat]] determined the link between previously uncategorized clay "tokens", the oldest of which have been found in the Zagros region of Iran, and the first known writing, [[Mesopotamian]] [[cuneiform]].&lt;ref name="Rudgley"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age| last=Rudgley| first=Richard| authorlink=Richard Rudgley| year=2000| pages=48–57| publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In approximately 8000 BC, the Mesopotamians began using clay tokens to count their agricultural and manufactured goods. Later they began placing these tokens inside large, hollow clay containers (bulla, or globular envelopes) which were then sealed. The quantity of tokens in each container came to be expressed by impressing, on the container's surface, one picture for each instance of the token inside. They next dispensed with the tokens, relying solely on symbols for the tokens, drawn on clay surfaces. To avoid making a picture for each instance of the same object (for example: 100 pictures of a hat to represent 100 hats), they 'counted' the objects by using various small marks. In this way the Sumerians added "a system for enumerating objects to their incipient system of symbols".

The original [[Mesopotamian]] writing system (believed to be the world's oldest) was derived around 3600 BC from this method of keeping accounts. By the end of the 4th millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;The Origin and Development of the Cuneiform System of Writing, Samuel Noah Kramer, ''Thirty Nine Firsts in Recorded History'' pp. 381–383&lt;/ref&gt; the Mesopotamians were using a triangular-shaped stylus pressed into soft clay to record numbers. This system was gradually augmented with using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted by means of [[pictographs]]. Round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing was gradually replaced by writing using a wedge-shaped stylus (hence the term [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]]), at first only for [[logogram]]s, but by the 29th century BC also for phonetic elements. Around 2700 BC, cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]. About that time, Mesopotamian cuneiform became a general purpose writing system for logograms, syllables, and numbers. This script was adapted to another Mesopotamian language, the [[East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ([[Old Assyrian period|Assyrian]] and [[Babylonia]]n) around 2600 BC, and then to others such as [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hattian language|Hattian]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]. Scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]]. With the adoption of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] as the 'lingua franca' of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–609 BC), Old Aramaic was also adapted to Mesopotamian cuneiform. The last cuneiform scripts in Akkadian discovered thus far date from the 1st century AD.

===Elamite scripts===
Over the centuries, three distinct Elamite scripts developed.
[[Proto-Elamite]] is the oldest known writing system from Iran. In use only for a brief time (c. 3200–2900 BC), clay tablets with Proto-Elamite writing have been found at different sites across Iran. The Proto-Elamite script is thought to have developed from early [[cuneiform]] (proto-cuneiform). The Proto-Elamite script consists of more than 1,000 signs and is thought to be partly [[logogram|logographic]].

[[Linear Elamite]] is a writing system attested in a few monumental inscriptions in Iran. It was used for a very brief period during the last quarter of the 3rd millennium BC. It is often claimed that Linear Elamite is a syllabic writing system derived from Proto-Elamite, although this cannot be proven since Linear-Elamite has not been deciphered. Several scholars have attempted to decipher the script, most notably [[:de:Walther Hinz|Walther Hinz]] and [[:it:Piero Meriggi|Piero Meriggi]].

The [[Elamite cuneiform]] script was used from about 2500 to 331 BC, and was adapted from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]]. The Elamite cuneiform script consisted of about 130 symbols, far fewer than most other cuneiform scripts.

====Cretan and Greek scripts====
{{Further information|Cretan hieroglyphs|Linear A|Linear B}}

[[Cretan hieroglyphs]] are found on artifacts of [[Crete]] (early-to-mid-2nd millennium BC, MM I to MM III, overlapping with Linear A from MM IIA at the earliest). [[Linear B]], the writing system of the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greeks]],&lt;ref name="Olivier 1986, 377f."/&gt; has been deciphered while [[Linear A]] has yet to be deciphered. The sequence and the geographical spread of the three overlapping, but distinct writing systems can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref name="Olivier 1986, 377f."&gt;{{harvnb|Olivier|1986|pp=377f.}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name group="A"&gt;Beginning date refers to first attestations, the assumed origins of all scripts lie further back in the past.&lt;/ref&gt; Cretan hieroglyphs were used in Crete from c. 1625 to 1500 BC; Linear A was used in the [[Aegean Islands]] ([[Kea (island)|Kea]], [[Cythera (island)|Kythera]], [[Milos|Melos]], [[Santorini|Thera]]), and the [[Greek mainland]] ([[Laconia]]) from c. 18th century to 1450 BC; and Linear B was used in Crete ([[Knossos]]), and mainland ([[Pylos]], [[Mycenae]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Tiryns]]) from c. 1375 to 1200 BC.

===China===
{{Further information|Oracle bone script|Bronzeware script}}

The earliest surviving examples of writing in China—inscriptions on so-called "[[oracle bone]]s", tortoise [[plastron]]s and ox [[scapula]]e used for divination—date from around 1200 BC in the late [[Shang dynasty]]. A small number of bronze inscriptions from the same period have also survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2003, archaeologists reported discoveries of [[Jiahu symbols|isolated tortoise-shell carvings]] dating back to the 7th millennium BC, but whether or not these symbols are related to the characters of the later oracle-bone script is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Narmer Palette serpopard side.jpg|196px|thumbnail|right|[[Narmer Palette]], with the two serpopards representing unification of [[Upper Egypt|Upper]] and [[Lower Egypt]], [[3000 B.C.|3000 B. C.]]]]
The earliest known [[Egyptian hieroglyph|hieroglyphic]] inscriptions are the [[Narmer Palette]], dating to c. 3200 BC, and several recent discoveries that may be slightly older, though these glyphs were based on a much older artistic rather than written tradition. The hieroglyphic script was [[logogram|logographic]] with phonetic adjuncts that included an effective [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Script|alphabet]].

Writing was very important in maintaining the Egyptian empire, and literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of [[scribe]]s. Only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes, in the service of temple, pharaonic, and military authorities. The hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn, but in later centuries was purposely made even more so, as this preserved the scribes' status.

The world's [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|oldest known alphabet]] appears to have been developed by Canaanite turquoise miners in the Sinai desert around the mid-19th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Goldwasser, Orly. "How the Alphabet Was Born from Hieroglyphs", Biblical Archaeology Review, Mar/Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Around 30 crude inscriptions have been found at a mountainous Egyptian mining site known as Serabit el-Khadem. This site was also home to a temple of Hathor, the "Mistress of turquoise". A later, two line inscription has also been found at Wadi el-Hol in Central Egypt. Based on [[hieroglyph]]ic prototypes, but also including entirely new symbols, each sign apparently stood for a consonant rather than a word: the basis of an alphabetic system. It was not until the 12th to 9th centuries, however, that the alphabet took hold and became widely used.

===Indus Valley===
{{Main article|Indus script}}

Indus script refers to short strings of symbols associated with the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (which spanned modern-day [[Pakistan]] and [[North India]]) used between 2600 and 1900 BC. In spite of many attempts at decipherments and claims, it is as yet undeciphered. The term 'Indus script' is mainly applied to that used in the mature Harappan phase, which perhaps evolved from a few signs found in early [[Harappa]] after 3500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse, David (1999). "[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/334517.stm 'Earliest writing' found]" BBC&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by the mature Harappan script. The script is written from right to left,&lt;ref&gt;(Lal 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes follows a [[boustrophedonic]] style. Since the number of principal signs is about 400–600,&lt;ref&gt;(Wells 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; midway between typical logographic and syllabic scripts, many scholars accept the script to be logo-syllabic&lt;ref&gt;(Bryant 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; (typically syllabic scripts have about 50–100 signs whereas logographic scripts have a very large number of principal signs). Several scholars maintain that structural analysis indicates that an [[agglutinative]] language underlies the script.

===Central Asia===
In 2001, archaeologists discovered that there was a civilization in [[Central Asia]] that used writing c. 2000 BC. An excavation near [[Ashgabat]], the capital of [[Turkmenistan]], revealed an inscription on a piece of stone that was used as a stamp seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient writing found in Turkmenistan |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1330705.stm |quote=A previously unknown civilisation was using writing in Central Asia 4,000 years ago, hundreds of years before Chinese writing developed, archaeologists have discovered. An excavation near Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan, revealed an inscription on a piece of stone that seems to have been used as a stamp seal. |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=15 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phoenician writing system and descendants===
The [[Proto-Sinaitic]] script, in which [[Proto-Canaanite]] is believed to have been first written, is attested as far back as the 19th century BC. The [[Phoenician script|Phoenician writing system]] was adapted from the Proto-Canaanite script sometime before the 14th century BC, which in turn borrowed principles of representing phonetic information from [[Hieratic]], [[Cuneiform]] and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. This writing system was an odd sort of syllabary in which only consonants are represented. This script was adapted by the [[Greek alphabet|Greeks]], who adapted certain consonantal signs to represent their vowels. The [[Cumae alphabet]], a variant of the early Greek alphabet, gave rise to the [[Etruscan alphabet]] and its own descendants, such as the [[Latin alphabet]] and [[Rune]]s. Other descendants from the [[Greek alphabet]] include [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], used to write [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]], among others. The Phoenician system was also adapted into the [[Aramaic script]], from which the [[Hebrew script|Hebrew]] and the [[Arabic script]]s are descended.

The [[Tifinagh]] script (Berber languages) is descended from the Libyco-Berber script, which is assumed to be of Phoenician origin.

===Mesoamerica===
A stone slab with 3,000-year-old writing, known as the [[Cascajal Block]], was discovered in the Mexican state of [[Veracruz]] and is an example of the oldest script in the Western Hemisphere, preceding the oldest [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] writing by approximately 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John Noble |last=Wilford |authorlink=John Noble Wilford |title=Writing May Be Oldest in Western Hemisphere |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/15/science/15writing.html |quote=A stone slab bearing 3,000-year-old writing previously unknown to scholars has been found in the Mexican state of Veracruz, and archaeologists say it is an example of the oldest script ever discovered in the Western Hemisphere. |work=New York Times |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=15 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Helen |last=Briggs |title='Oldest' New World writing found |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5347080.stm |quote=Ancient civilisations in Mexico developed a writing system as early as 900 BC, new evidence suggests. |publisher=BBC |accessdate=30 March 2008 | date=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Oldest Writing in the New World |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/313/5793/1610 |first=Maria del Carmen |last=Rodríguez Martínez |display-authors=etal |year=2006 |volume=313 |issue=5793 |pages=1610–1614 |doi=10.1126/science.1131492 |pmid=16973873 |quote=A block with a hitherto unknown system of writing has been found in the Olmec heartland of Veracruz, Mexico.

Of several [[pre-Columbian]] scripts in [[Mesoamerica]], the one that appears to have been best developed, and the only one to be deciphered, is the [[Maya script]]. The earliest inscription identified as Maya dates to the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name=Saturno2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saturno|first=William A.|author2=David Stuart |author3=Boris Beltrán |title=Early Maya Writing at San Bartolo, Guatemala|journal=Science|date=3 March 2006|volume=311|issue=5765|pages=1281–1283|doi=10.1126/science.1121745|pmid=16400112|bibcode=2006Sci...311.1281S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maya writing used logograms complemented by a set of syllabic glyphs, somewhat similar in function to modern Japanese writing.

===South America===
The [[Incas]] had no known script. Their [[quipu]] system of recording information—based on knots tied along one or many linked cords—was apparently used for inventory and accountancy purposes and could not encode textual information.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===Dacia===
Three stone slabs were found by Romanian archaeologist [[Nicolae Vlassa]], in the mid-20th century (1961) in [[Tărtăria]] (present-day [[Alba County]], [[Transylvania]]), [[Romania]], ancient land of [[Dacia]], inhabited by Dacians, which were a population who may have been related to the [[Getae]]s and [[Thracians]].
One of the slabs contains 4 groups of pictographs divided by lines. Some of the characters are also found in Ancient [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], as well as in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], [[Old Italic alphabet|Old Italic]] and [[Iberian scripts|Iberian]].
The origin and the timing of the writings are disputed, because there are no precise evidence [[in situ]], the slabs cannot be carbon dated, because of the bad treatment of the [[Cluj]] museum. There are indirect carbon dates found on a skeleton discovered near the slabs, that certifies the 5300–5500 BC period.

==Modern importance==
In the 21st century, writing has become an important part of daily life as [[technology]] has connected individuals from across the globe through systems such as [[e-mail]] and [[social media]]. [[Literacy]] has grown in importance as a factor for success in the modern world. In the United States, the ability to [[reading (process)|read]] and write are necessary for most jobs, and multiple programs are in place to aid both children and adults in improving their literacy skills. For example, the emergence of the [[writing center]] and community-wide literacy councils aim to help students and community members sharpen their writing skills. These resources, and many more, span across different age groups in order to offer each individual a better understanding of their language and how to express themselves via writing in order to perhaps improve their [[socioeconomic status]].

Other parts of the world have seen an increase in writing abilities as a result of programs such as the [[World Literacy Foundation]] and [[International Literacy Foundation]], as well as a general push for increased global communication.

[[File:Zangezi.gif|thumb|[[Velimir Khlebnikov|Khlebnikov's]] book ''Zangezi'' (1922).]]
'''Zaum''' ({{lang-ru|зáумь}}) are the linguistic experiments in [[sound symbolism]] and [[artistic language|language creation]] of [[Russian Futurism|Russian-empire Futurist poets]] such as [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] and [[Aleksei Kruchenykh]].

Coined by Kruchenykh in 1913,{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=2}} the word ''zaum'' is made up of the Russian prefix [[:wikt:за|за]] "beyond, behind" and noun [[:wikt:ум|ум]] "the mind, ''[[nous]]''" and has been translated as '''"transreason"''', '''"transration"''' or '''"beyonsense"''' ([[Paul Schmidt (translator)|Paul Schmidt]]).{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=1}} According to scholar Gerald Janecek, ''zaum'' can be defined as experimental poetic language characterized by indeterminacy in meaning.{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=1}}

Kruchenykh, in “Declaration of the Word as Such (1913),” declares zaum “a language which does not have any definite meaning, a transrational language” that “allows for fuller expression” whereas, he maintains, the common language of everyday speech “binds.”{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=78}} He further maintained, in “Declaration of Transrational Language (1921),” that zaum “can provide a universal poetic language, born organically, and not artificially, like [[Esperanto]]."{{sfn|Kruchenykh|2005|p=183}}

Examples of zaum include Kruchenykh's poem "[[Dyr bul shchyl]]",{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=49}} Kruchenykh's libretto for the Futurist opera ''[[Victory over the Sun]]'' with music by [[Mikhail Matyushin]] and stage design by [[Kazimir Malevich]],{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=111}} and Khlebnikov's so-called "[[language of the birds]]", "[[language of the gods]]" and "language of the stars".{{sfn|Janecek|1996|pp=137–138}} The poetic output is perhaps comparable to that of the contemporary [[Dadaism]] but the linguistic theory or metaphysics behind zaum was entirely devoid of the gentle self-irony of that movement and in all seriousness intended to recover the [[sound symbolism]] of a lost [[glottogony|aboriginal tongue]].{{sfn|Janecek|1996|p=79}} Exhibiting traits of a Slavic [[national mysticism]], Kruchenykh aimed at recovering the primeval Slavic mother-tongue in particular.

In modern times, since 1962 [[Serge Segay]] was creating zaum poetry.&lt;ref name="У Голубой Лагуны"&gt;''[[Кузьминский, Константин Константинович|Кузьминский К.]], Ковалёв Г.'' [http://www.kkk-bluelagoon.ru/tom5b/transpoety.htm Антология новейшей русской поэзии у Голубой Лагуны]. — Т. 5Б.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ry Nikonova|Rea Nikonova]] started creating zaum verses probably a bit later, around 1964.&lt;ref name="Zhumati"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their zaum poetry can be seen e.g. in issues of famous "Transponans" samizdat magazine.&lt;ref name="Transponans"&gt;[http://samizdatcollections.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/samizdat%3Atransponans Transponans, made available online by Toronto University]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, contemporary [[avant-garde]] poet Sergei Biriukov has founded an association of poets called the "Academy of Zaum" in [[Tambov]].

The use of Zaum peaked from 1916 to 1920 during [[World War I]]. At this time, Zaumism took root as a movement primarily involved in [[visual arts]], [[literature]], [[poetry]], [[art manifesto]]es, [[art theory]], [[theatre]], and [[graphic design]],{{sfn|Janecek|1984|pp=149–206}} and concentrated its [[anti war]] politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in [[art]] through [[anti-art]] cultural works. Zaum activities included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publications. The movement influenced later styles, [[Avant-garde]] and [[downtown music]] movements, and groups including [[surrealism]], [[nouveau réalisme]], [[Pop Art]] and [[Fluxus]].{{sfn|Knowlson|1996|p=217}}
