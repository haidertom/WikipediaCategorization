An '''art movement''' is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time, (usually a few months, years or decades) or, at least, with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years. Art movements were especially important in [[modern art]], when each consecutive movement was considered as a new [[avant-garde]].

== Concept ==
According to theories associated with [[modernism]] and the concept of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]], art movements are especially important during the period of time corresponding to [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Man of his words: Pepe Karmel on Kirk Varnedoe&amp;nbsp;— Passages'' – Critical Essay [[Artforum]],  Nov, 2003  by Pepe Karmel&lt;/ref&gt; The period of time called "modern art" is posited to have changed approximately halfway through the 20th century and art made afterward is generally called [[contemporary art]]. [[Postmodern art|Postmodernism]] in visual art begins and functions as a parallel to [[late modernism]]&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8–171&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to that period after the "modern" period called contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp218-221"&gt;''The Citadel of Modernism Falls to Deconstructionists'', – 1992 critical essay, ''The Triumph of Modernism'', 2006, [[Hilton Kramer]], pp 218–221.&lt;/ref&gt; The postmodern period began during [[late modernism]] (which is a contemporary continuation of modernism), and according to some theorists postmodernism ended in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Post-Modernism: The New Classicism in Art and Architecture'' [[Charles Jencks]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William R. Everdell 1997, p4"&gt;William R. Everdell, [[The First Moderns|''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-century Thought'']], University of Chicago Press, 1997, p4. {{ISBN|0-226-22480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of time corresponding to "modern art" each consecutive movement was often considered a new [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Also during the period of time referred to as "modern art" each movement was seen corresponding to a somewhat grandiose rethinking of all that came before it, concerning the visual arts. Generally there was a commonality of visual style linking the works and artists included in an art movement. Verbal expression and explanation of movements has come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an [[art manifesto]],&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i8066.html "Poetry of the Revolution. Marx, Manifestos, and the Avant-Gardes" introduction, Martin Puchner] Retrieved April 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.sas.upenn.edu/05-06/mellon_postdoc.shtml "Looking at Artists' Manifestos, 1945–1965", Stephen B. Petersen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927185416/http://humanities.sas.upenn.edu/05-06/mellon_postdoc.shtml |date=September 27, 2011 }} Retrieved April 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes from [[art critic]]s and others who may explain their understanding of the meaning of the new art then being produced.

In the [[visual arts]], many artists, theorists, art critics, art collectors, art dealers and others mindful of the unbroken continuation of modernism and the continuation of modern art even into the contemporary era, ascribe to and welcome new philosophies of art as they appear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], seventh paragraph of the essay. URL accessed on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], William Dobell Memorial Lecture, Sydney, Australia, Oct 31, 1979, Arts 54, No.6 (February 1980). His final essay on modernism Retrieved October 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodern art|Postmodernist]] theorists posit that the idea of art movements are no longer as applicable, or no longer as discernible, as the notion of art movements had been before the postmodern era.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas About Art'' by Desmond, Kathleen K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;dq=ideas+about+art&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International postmodernism: theory and literary practice'', Bertens, Hans [https://books.google.com/books?id=n_Eqx2Gr1vUC&amp;dq=international+postmodernism:+theory+and+literary+practice&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], Routledge, 1997, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; There are many theorists however who doubt as to whether or not such an era was actually a fact;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; or just a passing fad.&lt;ref name="William R. Everdell 1997, p4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/The_Death_of_Postmodernism_And_Beyond Alan Kirby, ''The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The term refers to tendencies in [[visual art]], novel ideas and [[architecture]], and sometimes [[literature]]. In [[music]] it is more common to speak about [[genre]]s and [[fashion|styles]] instead. See also [[cultural movement]], a term with a broader connotation.

As the names of many art movements use the -ism suffix (for example [[cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|futurism]]), they are sometimes referred to as ''isms''.

The Rock 1 of Bedolina, the so-called '''Bedolina Map''', is a famous engraved prehistoric rock which is part of the [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica|Camonica valley]] (Alps, Italian side, [[Lombardy|Lombardy region]]) petroglyph complex. It is known as being one of the most ancient topographic maps,&lt;ref&gt;Beltrán Llorís M., 1972. ''Los grabados rupestres de Bedolina (Valcamonica)'', [http://www.ccsp.it/web/INFOCCSP/bcsp/bcsp08.html BCSP, vol. VIII], Capo di Ponte (BS): 121-158&lt;/ref&gt; interpreted as the depiction of cultivated plots, mountain paths and villages. The locality of Bedolina pertains to the [[Capo di Ponte]] municipality (BS-I), near the hamlet of Pescarzo.  The area is included in the [http://www.parcoseradinabedolina.it/ Seradina-Bedolina Archaeologic park], lying on a prominent terrace on the right slope  of  the Camonica valley, at an altitude of 530 m above the sea level. The rock, a flat surface of Permian sandstone (Verrucano of Lombardy) polished by the Pleistocene glacier, is 9&amp;nbsp;m long and 4&amp;nbsp;m wide.

The '''Cass identity model''' is one of the fundamental theories of [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] identity development, developed in 1979 by Vivienne Cass.&lt;ref&gt; Cass, V. (1979). Homosexual identity formation: A theoretical model. Journal of Homosexuality, 4 (3), 219-235.&lt;/ref&gt; This model was one of the first to treat gay people as "normal" in a [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] society and in a climate of [[homophobia]] instead of treating homosexuality itself as a problem. Cass described a process of six stages of gay and lesbian identity development. While these stages are sequential, some people might revisit stages at different points in their lives.

== The six stages of Cass' model ==
=== Identity confusion ===

In the first stage, ''identity confusion'', the person is amazed to think of themselves as a gay person. "Could I be gay?" This stage begins with the person's first awareness of gay or lesbian thoughts, feelings, and attractions. The people typically feel confused and experience turmoil.

To the question "Who am I?", the answers can be acceptance, psychological self-[[denial]] and [[Psychological repression|repression]], or rejection.

Possible responses can be: to avoid information about lesbians and gays; inhibited behavior; self-[[denial]] of homosexuality ("experimenting", "an accident", "just drunk", "just looking"). Men often keep emotional involvement separated from sexual contact; women often have deep, strongly emotional but non-sexual relationships.

The possible needs can be: the person may explore internal positive and negative judgments. Will be allowed to be uncertain regarding sexual identity. May find support in knowing that [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] occurs along a spectrum. May receive permission and encouragement to explore sexual identity as a normal experience (like career identity and social identity).

=== Identity comparison ===

The second stage is called ''identity comparison''. In this stage, the person accepts the possibility of being gay or lesbian and examines the wider implications of that tentative commitment. "Maybe this does apply to me." The self-alienation becomes isolation.
The task is to deal with the social alienation.

Possible responses can be: the person may begin to grieve for losses and the things they give up by embracing their sexual orientation (marriage, children). They may compartmentalize their own sexuality&amp;mdash;accept lesbian/gay definition of behavior but maintain "heterosexual" identity. Tells oneself, "It's only temporary"; "I'm just in love with this particular woman/man"; etc.

The possible needs can be: will be very important that the person develops own definitions. Will need information about sexual identity, lesbian, gay community resources, encouragement to talk about loss of heterosexual life expectations. May be permitted to keep some "heterosexual" identity (as "not an all or none" issue).

=== Identity tolerance ===

In the third stage, ''identity tolerance'', the person comes to the understanding they are "not the only one".

The person acknowledges they are likely gay or lesbian and seeks out other gay and lesbian people to combat feelings of isolation. Increased commitment to being lesbian or gay.
The task is to decrease social alienation by seeking out lesbians and gays.

Possible responses can be: beginning to have language to talk and think about the issue. Recognition that being lesbian or gay does not preclude other options. Accentuate difference between self and heterosexuals. Seek out lesbian and gay culture (positive contact leads to more positive sense of self, negative contact leads to devaluation of the culture, stops growth). The person may try out variety of stereotypical roles.

The possible needs can be: to be supported in exploring own shame feelings derived from [[heterosexism]], as well as [[internalized homophobia]]. Receive support in finding positive lesbian, gay community connections. It is particularly important for the person to know community resources.

=== Identity acceptance ===

The ''identity acceptance'' stage means the person accepts themselves. "I will be okay." The person attaches a positive connotation to their gay or lesbian identity and accepts rather than tolerates it. There is continuing and increased contact with the gay and lesbian culture.
The task is to deal with inner tension of no longer subscribing to society's norm, attempt to bring congruence between private and public view of self.

Possible responses can be: accepts gay or lesbian self-identification. May compartmentalize "gay life". Maintain less and less contact with heterosexual community. Attempt to "fit in" and "not make waves" within the gay and lesbian community. Begin some selective disclosures of sexual identity. More social coming out; more comfortable being seen with groups of men or women that are identified as "gay". More realistic evaluation of situation.

The possible needs can be: continue exploring grief and loss of heterosexual life expectation, continue exploring internalized homophobia (learned shame from heterosexist society). Find support in making decisions about where, when, and to whom to disclose.

=== Identity pride ===

In the ''identity pride'' stage, sometimes the coming out of the closet arrives, and the main thinking is "I've got to let people know who I am!" The person divides the world into heterosexuals and homosexuals, and is immersed in gay and lesbian culture while minimizing contact with heterosexuals. Us-them quality to political/social viewpoint.
The task is to deal with the incongruent views of heterosexuals.

Possible responses include: splits world into "gay" (good) and "straight" (bad)&amp;mdash;experiences disclosure crises with heterosexuals as they are less willing to "blend in"&amp;mdash;identify gay culture as sole source of support, acquiring all gay friends, business connections, social connections.

The possible needs can be: to receive support for exploring anger issues, to find support for exploring issues of heterosexism, to develop skills for coping with reactions and responses to disclosure to sexual identity, and to resist being defensive.

=== Identity synthesis ===

The last stage in Cass' model is ''identity synthesis'': the person integrates their sexual identity with all other aspects of self, and sexual orientation becomes ''only one aspect'' of self rather than the entire identity.

The task is to integrate gay and lesbian identity so that instead of being the identity, it is an aspect of self.

Possible responses can be: continues to be angry at heterosexism, but with decreased intensity, or allows trust of others to increase and build. Gay and lesbian identity is integrated with all aspects of "self". The person feels "all right" to move out into the community and not simply define space according to sexual orientation.

== Criticisms of the model ==

Joanne Kaufman and Cathryn Johnson have argued that based upon more recent research, this model is less valid today than it was at its inception for several reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Joanne and Johnson, Cathryn (2004) Stigmatized Individuals and the Process of Identity, ''The Sociological Quarterly'', 45 (4), 807–33&lt;/ref&gt;

#This model does not take into account socio-cultural factors that can impact identity development.
#The nature of the [[social stigma]] and its management practices have changed since the inception of the model.
#The linear nature of the model would suggest that anyone who abandons the model or fails to go through each of the six stages would not be able to be considered as a well adjusted homosexual, which may no longer be true.

'''Circumpolar studies''' (also ''Northern studies'') is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[field of study]] combining [[social science]] and [[Earth science|geoscience]] and involving topics like [[land]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[Ethnic group|peoples]], [[culture]]s, and [[politics]] in [[Arctic]] and [[Subarctic]] [[Arctic Council|states]], that is, the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Canada]], [[Denmark]] ([[Greenland]]), [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], and [[Russia]]. Because of circumpolar regions' past as [[Colonization|colonised]] territories inhabited by [[nomad]]s, circumpolar studies focusses on [[Circumpolar peoples|indigenous peoples]] as well as [[Early modern period|early]] [[Agrarian society|agricultural]] [[settler]]s.&lt;ref name="UArctic Circumpolar Studies"/&gt;

== Information ==
Circumpolar studies is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study of regions located on and above the [[Arctic Circle|polar circle]]. As such, circumpolar studies embraces wider than [[Arctic studies]], which deals with the [[Arctic]] ''[[sensu stricto]]''.

Classified as [[Area studies|regional studies]], circumpolar studies finds a parallel in [[European studies]], [[African studies]], [[Latin American studies]], and so on. Gaining increased prominence in the wake of post-[[Cold War]] initiatives like the [[Arctic Council]], circumpolar studies is maintained as an independent field of study by [[University|universities]] like the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] and [[Nord University]] and recognised as ditto by [[Publishing|publishers]] like [[Berghahn Books]].&lt;ref name="UArctic Where to Study"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berghahn Books"/&gt;

Based on a degree model developed by the [[University of the Arctic]], over twenty educational institutions in [[Arctic Circle|circumpolar regions]] offer circumpolar studies at [[Undergraduate degree|undergraduate level]], including [[bachelor's degree]]s and short-term programmes.&lt;ref name="UArctic Where to Study"/&gt; There is also a [[France|French]] university offering circumpolar studies at graduate level.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The Arctic Centre at the [[University of Groningen]] publishes an eponymous series with biennial volumes,&lt;ref name="UG Circumpolar Series"/&gt; while the ''Journal of Northern Studies'' is published at [[Umeå University]]. Related research centres include the [[Center for Northern Studies]] at Nord University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">'''Cognized environment''' is a concept first introduced by the late anthropologist, [[Roy Rappaport]] (1968), in contrast to what he called the ''operational environment'' (see Rappaport 1979:97-144, 1984:337-352).  Rappaport was an ecological anthropologist, like [[Andrew P. Vayda]], and wished to contrast the actual reality and adaptations (the operational environment) within a people's ecological niche  – say, the existence of tsetse flies and their role in causing sleeping sickness among humans – with how the people’s culture understands nature (the cognized environment) – say, the belief that witches live in those areas that science knows is the habitat of the tsetse.  Rappaport’s principal concern was the role of ritual in mediating the cognized and operational environments.

Another group of anthropologists later took up the use of Rappaport’s concepts and applied them toward developing a school of [[neuroanthropology]] called [[Biogenetic Structuralism]] (see Laughlin and Brady 1978: 6, d'Aquili, Laughlin and McManus 1979: 12ff, Rubinstein, Laughlin and McManus 1984: 21ff, and Laughlin, McManus and d'Aquili 1990:82-90).  According to this group, all properties and qualities of experience are mediated by our body’s neuroendocrine systems.  These systems function individually and collectively to model reality.  The sum total of these models in the brain is the cognized environment.  The operational environment refers to the actual niche in which the human or other animal with a brain dwells and adapts.  The operational environment is the real world that is modelled by our cognized environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17173">{{Distinguish|mass noun|collective number|collective numeral}}
In [[linguistics]], a '''collective noun''' refers to a collection of things taken as a whole. Most collective nouns in everyday speech are mundane and ''not'' specific to just one kind, such as the word "group", which is applied to "people" in the phrase "a group of people", but is also applied to "dogs" in the phrase "a group of dogs". Other collective nouns ''are specific'' to one kind, especially [[#Terms of venery|terms of venery]], which identify specific groups of animals. For example, "pride" as a term of [[game (hunting)|venery]] always refers to [[lion]]s, never to [[dog]]s or [[cow]]s. Similarly, a group of owls is called a "parliament".{{citation needed| date= November 2018|reason= Not the word used in the main article linked to in the 'Terms of venery' section below}}

Different forms of English handle verb [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with collective [[count noun]]s differently; in particular, users of [[British English]] generally accept that collective nouns take either singular or plural verb forms depending on context and the [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift that it implies.

== Derivation ==
[[Morphological derivation]] accounts for many collective words and various languages have common [[affix]]es for denoting collective nouns. Because derivation is a slower and less productive [[word formation]] process than the more overtly [[syntax|syntactical]] morphological methods, there are fewer collectives formed this way. As with all derived words, derivational collectives often differ [[Semantics|semantically]] from the original words, acquiring new [[connotation]]s and even new [[denotation]]s.

== Affixes ==

=== Proto-Indo-European===
Early Proto-Indo-European used the suffix *eh2 to form collective nouns. From there we have, for example, the Latin neuter plural ending -a. Late Proto-Indo-European used the ending *t. From there we have the English ending -th, as in "youth".

=== English ===
The English endings ''-age'' and ''-ade'' often signify a collective. Sometimes, the relationship is easily recognizable: ''baggage, drainage, blockade.'' Though the [[etymology]] is plain to see, the derived words take on a distinct meaning. This is a [[Productive (linguistics)|productive]] ending, as evidenced in the recent [[Coined word|coin]], "[[signage]]".

=== German ===
[[German language|German]] uses the [[prefix]] ''[[wikt:ge-#German|ge]]-'' to create collectives. The root word often undergoes [[I-mutation|umlaut]] and [[suffix]]ation as well as receiving the ''ge-'' prefix. Nearly all nouns created in that way are of [[neuter gender]]:
* ''{{lang|de|das Gebirge}}'', "group of hills, mountain range" {{abbr|&lt;|from}} ''{{lang|de|der Berg}}'', "mountain" or "hill"
* ''{{lang|de|das Gepäck}}'', "luggage, baggage" &lt; ''{{lang|de|der Pack}}'', "pack, bundle, pile"
* ''{{lang|de|das Geflügel}}'', "poultry, fowl (birds)" &lt; late [[Middle High German|MHG]] ''{{lang|gmh|gevlügel(e)}}'', under the influence of ''{{lang|de|der Flügel}}'', "wing" &lt; MHG ''{{lang|gmh|gevügel}}'' &lt; [[Old High German|OHG]] ''{{lang|goh|gifugili}}'' = collective formation of ''{{lang|goh|fogal}}'', "bird"
* ''{{lang|de|das Gefieder}}'', "plumage" &lt; ''{{lang|de|die Feder}}'', "feather"
* ''{{lang|de|das Geschwisterkind}}'', "sibling" &lt; ''{{lang|de|die Schwester}}'', "sister"
* ''{{lang|de|die Geschwister}}'', "siblings" &lt; ''{{lang|de|die Schwester}}'', "sister"
* "Der Gebirgszug" and "die Bergkette" also mean "mountain range", drawing on the words "der Zug" = train, and "die Kette" = chain.
There are also several endings that can be used to create collectives, such as "welt" and "masse".

=== Dutch ===
[[Dutch language|Dutch]] has a similar pattern but sometimes uses the (unproductive) [[circumfix]] ''{{linktext|ge- -te}}'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Morphology of Dutch|last=Booij|first=Geert|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{lang|nl|berg}}'' 'mountain' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gebergte}}'' 'mountain range'
* ''{{lang|nl|been}}'' 'bone' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gebeente}}'' 'skeleton'
* ''{{lang|nl|vogel}}'' 'bird' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gevogelte}}'' 'poultry'
* ''{{lang|nl|blad}}'' 'leaf' &gt; ''{{lang|nl|gebladerte}}'' 'foliage'

=== Swedish ===
The following [[Swedish language|Swedish]] example has different words in the collective form and in the individual form:
* An individual mosquito is a ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:mygga|mygga]]}}'' (plural: ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:myggor|myggor]]}}''), but mosquitos as a collective is ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:mygg|mygg]]}}''.

=== Esperanto ===
[[Esperanto]] uses the collective suffix -''[[wikt:-ar#Esperanto|ar]]'' to produce a large number of derived words:
* ''monto'' 'mountain' &gt; ''montaro'' 'mountain range'

== Metonymic merging of grammatical number ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}{{Main|Synesis|Plurale tantum}}Two good examples of collective nouns are "team" and "government", which are both words referring to groups of (usually) people. Both "team" and "government" are [[count noun]]s (consider: "one team", "two teams", "most teams"; "one government", "two governments", "many governments").

=== Agreement in different forms of English ===
{{Main|American and British English grammatical differences#Subject-verb_agreement}}

Confusion often stems from the way that different forms of English handle [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with collective nouns—specifically, whether or not to use the '''collective singular''': the singular verb form with a collective noun. The [[plural verb]] forms are often used in [[British English]] with the singular forms of these [[count noun]]s (e.g., "The team ''have'' finished the project."). Conversely, in the English language as a whole, singular verb forms can often be used with nouns ending in "-s" that were once considered plural (e.g., "Physics ''is'' my favorite academic subject"). This apparent "number mismatch" is a natural and logical feature of human language, and its mechanism is a subtle [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift in the concepts underlying the words.

In British English, it is generally accepted that collective nouns can take either singular or plural verb forms depending on the context and the [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift that it implies. For example, "the team ''is'' in the dressing room" (''[[formal agreement]]'') refers to ''the team'' as an ensemble, while "the team ''are'' fighting among themselves" (''[[notional agreement]]'') refers to ''the team'' as individuals. That is also the British English practice with names of countries and cities in sports contexts (e.g., "[[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] ''have'' won the competition.").

In [[American English]], collective nouns almost always take singular verb forms (formal agreement). In cases that a metonymic shift would be revealed nearby, the whole sentence should be recast to avoid the metonymy. (For example, "The team are fighting among themselves" may become "the team ''members'' are fighting among themselves" or simply "The team is infighting.") Collective [[proper noun]]s are usually taken as singular ("[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] is expected to release a new phone this year"), unless the plural is explicit in the proper noun itself, in which case it is taken as plural ("The [[Green Bay Packers]] are scheduled to play the [[Minnesota Vikings]] this weekend").
More explicit examples of collective proper nouns include "[[General Motors]] is once again the world's largest producer of vehicles," and "[[Texas Instruments]] is a large producer of [[electronics]] here," and "[[British Airways]] is an airline company in Europe." Furthermore, "[[American Telephone &amp; Telegraph]]" is a [[telecommunications]] company in North America." Such phrases might look plural, but they are not.

=== Examples of metonymic shift ===
A good example of such a metonymic shift in the singular-to-plural direction (which, generally, occurs only in British English) is the following sentence: "The team have finished the project." In that sentence, the underlying thought is of the individual members of the team working together to finish the project. Their accomplishment is collective, and the emphasis is not on their individual identities, but they are still discrete individuals; the word choice "team have" manages to convey both their collective and discrete identities simultaneously. A good example of such a metonymic shift in the plural-to-singular direction is the following sentence: "Mathematics is my favorite academic subject." The word "mathematics" may have originally been plural in concept, referring to mathematic endeavors, but metonymic shift (the shift in concept from "the endeavors" to "the whole set of endeavors") produced the usage of "mathematics" as a singular entity taking singular verb forms. (A true [[mass noun|mass-noun]] sense of "mathematics" followed naturally.)

Nominally singular pronouns can be collective nouns taking plural verbs, according to the same rules that apply to other collective nouns. For example, it is correct usage in both British English and American English usage to say: "None are so fallible as those who are sure they're right." In that case, the plural verb is used because the context for "none" suggests more than one thing or person.&lt;ref&gt;Strunk &amp; White, The Elements of Style (4th ed., 2000), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples include:
*"[[Creedence Clearwater Revival]] ''was'' founded in [[El Cerrito, California]]".
*"[[Nintendo]] ''is'' a [[video game]] company headquartered in Japan".

This does not, however, affect the tense later in the sentence:
*"Cream ''is'' a [[psychedelic rock]] band who ''were'' primarily popular in the 1960s.

Exceptions to the rule{{which|date=March 2013}} include singular group names preceded by an article:
* "The Who ''are'' a rock band from Great Britain."

This exception does not apply to artists whose name is preceded by an article, but ends in a singular:
* "The Band ''is'' a band primarily performing roots rock."

Abbreviations provide other "exceptions" in American usage concerning plurals:
* "Runs Batted In" becomes "RBIs". "Smith had 10 RBIs in the last three games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garner|first=Bryan|title=Garner's Modern American Usage|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford; New York|isbn=978-0-19-538275-4|page=638}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Revised Statutes Annotated" or RSAs.  "The RSAs contain our laws."

When only the name is plural but not the object, place, or person:
* "[[Decompression sickness|The bends]] ''is'' a deadly disease mostly affecting SCUBA divers."
* "''[[Hot Rocks]]'' ''is'' a greatest hits compilation by [[The Rolling Stones]]"

== Terms of venery ==
{{further|List of English terms of venery, by animal}}
The tradition of using "terms of [[game (hunting)|venery]]" or "nouns of assembly", collective nouns that are specific to certain kinds of animals, stems from an [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[medieval hunting|hunting tradition]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The fashion of a consciously developed hunting language came to England from [[medieval France|France]]. It was marked by an extensive proliferation of specialist vocabulary, applying different names to the same feature in different animals. The elements can be shown to have already been part of French and English hunting terminology by the beginning of the 14th century. In the course of the 14th century, it became a courtly fashion to extend the vocabulary, and by the 15th century, the tendency had reached exaggerated proportions.

''[[The Treatise (Walter of Bibbesworth)|The Treatise]]'', written by [[Walter of Bibbesworth]] in the mid-1200s, is the earliest source for collective nouns of animals in any European vernacular (and also the earliest source for animal noises).&lt;ref&gt;William Sayers, "Animal vocalization and human polyglossia in Walter of Bibbesworth's 13th-century domestic treatise in Anglo-Norman French" in Sign System Studies (Tartu, 2009) pp. 173–187&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Venerie'' of Twiti (early 14th century) distinguished three types of [[droppings]] of animals, and three different terms for [[herd]]s of animals. [[Gaston Phoebus]] (14th century) had five terms for droppings of animals, which were extended to seven in the ''Master of the Game'' (early 15th century). The focus on collective terms for groups of animals emerged in the later 15th century. Thus, a list of collective nouns in Egerton MS 1995, dated to c. 1452 under the heading of "termis of venery &amp;c.''"'', extends to 70 items,&lt;ref&gt;David Dalby, ''Lexicon of the Mediaeval German Hunt: A Lexicon of Middle High German Terms (1050–1500), Associated with the Chase, Hunting with Bows, Falconry, Trapping and Fowling'', Walter de Gruyter, 1965, {{ISBN|978-3-11-081860-4}}, p. xli.&lt;/ref&gt; and the list in the ''[[Book of Saint Albans]]'' (1486) runs to 165 items, many of which, even though introduced by "the compaynys of beestys and fowlys", relate not to venery but to human groups and professions and are clearly humorous, such as "a Doctryne of doctoris"'', "''a Sentence of Juges"'', "''a Fightyng of beggers"'', "''an uncredibilite of Cocoldis"'', "''a Melody of harpers"'', "''a Gagle of women"'', "''a Disworship of Scottis", etc.&lt;ref&gt;1901 facsimile reprint, E. Stock, London ([https://archive.org/stream/bokeofsaintalban00bernuoft#page/114/mode/2up pp. 115-117).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Transactions of the Philological Society
Volume 26, Issue 3, pages 79–175, August 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Book of Saint Albans'' became very popular during the 16th century and was reprinted frequently. [[Gervase Markham]] edited and commented on the list in his ''The Gentleman's Academic'', in 1595. The book's popularity had the effect of perpetuating many of these terms as part of the [[Standard English]] lexicon even if they have long ceased to have any practical application.&lt;ref name="Todd&amp;Hancock"&gt;{{cite book | last = Todd | first = Loreto |author2=Hancock, Ian | year = 1986 | title = International English Usage | publisher = Psychology Press | pages = 133–134 | isbn = 0-415-05102-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iccd5KAUnYQC&amp;pg=PA133 | accessdate = 2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in their original context of medieval venery, the terms were of the nature of [[kenning]]s, intended as a mark of erudition of the gentlemen able to use them correctly rather than for practical communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Exaltation of Larks|last=Lipton|first=James|publisher=Penguin|year=1993|isbn=978-0140170962|location=|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of the terms in the modern period has resulted in the addition of numerous lighthearted, humorous or facetious&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Literacy Dictionary|last=Harris|first=Theodore L.|author2=Hodges, Richard E.|publisher=International Reading Association|year=1995|isbn=0-87207-138-3|page=271}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2011-04-04--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; collective nouns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41653">The '''coloniality of gender''' is a  concept developed by feminist philosopher [[Maria Lugones|María Lugones]], which she defines as "the analysis of [[racialized]], [[capitalist]], gender oppression", while the process of potentially overcoming this practice can be defined as "decolonial feminism".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"&gt;Lugones, María. Toward a Decolonial Feminism. Hypatia vol. 25, no. 4 (Fall 2010). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|747}} Central to these terms is the definition and recognition of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] social structures and their relation to land, and the articulation of how these [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] occupy an oppositional consciousness&lt;ref&gt;[[Chela Sandoval|Sandoval, Chela]]. US Third World Feminism: the Theory and Method of Oppositional Consciousness in the Postmodern World. pp. 1-24. Genders, no. 10, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to colonial systems of social, sexual, ecological, spatial, and temporal hierarchy. María Lugones describes this difference as the 'oppressing ←→ resisting' relationship.

Colonialism of gender has altered the indigenous sense of self, identity and to the larger extent their cosmology and gender relationships. With the colonization of indigenous groups, it allowed European to implement their idea of gender and sex. This covered up the preexisting conception of  sex and gender in the indigenous group during the pre-colonialism times. This is evident with the lack of representation or awareness in Western society for the indigenous concept of being "Two Spirited"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://transhealth.phsa.ca/trans-101/two-spirit|title=Two-Spirit - Transgender Health Information Program|work=Transgender Health Information Program|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of gender itself was believed to be introduced by Western colonizers as a way to distinct two dualistic social categories which are men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/topics/coloniality-of-gender/|title=Coloniality of Gender – GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|website=globalsocialtheory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonizers had introduced the idea of gender itself into Indigenous groups as this was originally a colonial concept which was made to organize production, territory and behavior. The desire for the colonizer to put forth the idea of gender onto an Indigenous group was to have control over their labor, authority, influence their subjectivity and ideas of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jstor.org.proxy.library.carleton.ca/stable/pdf/4640051.pdf|title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial / Modern Gender System|last=Lugones|first=María|date=December 12, 2017|website=www.jstor.org.proxy.library.carleton.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In relation to race, land, and sovereignty ==

According to [[Glen Sean Coulthard]] in his essay ''For the Land: the Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination'', Indigenous resistances against "capitalist imperialism" can be understood as struggles surrounding the question of land and knowledge-based practices encompassing the "relation to one another and our surroundings in a respectful, nondominating and nonexploitative way".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"&gt;Coulthard, Glen Sean. "For the Land: The Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination." Red Skin White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} Coulthard defines this system of relationality as "grounded normativity"&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} stating, "the late Lakota philosopher [[Vine Deloria Jr.]] argues that one of the most significant differences that exist between Indigenous and Western [[metaphysics]] revolves around the central importance of land to Indigenous modes of being, thought, and ethics".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Further to this, Coulthard argues that Indigenous "philosophies of nonoppression" are defined through spatial as well as temporal relationships.&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|62}} Lugones refers to these Western-versus-Indigenous epistemologies as 'cosmologies'&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|754, 749}} in her essay ''Toward a Decolonial Feminism'', where she analyzes these structures in relation to the colonial imposition of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] on Indigenous communities.

According to Lugones, colonial modernity is positioned as "the dichotomous hierarchy between the human and the non-human",&lt;ref name=Foot01/&gt; summarized by Lugones' use of the term "colonial difference".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones states that within the context of colonization in the Americas and the Caribbean, this hierarchy was employed as a tactic of subordination of the colonized to "Western man".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones argues that related hierarchies were constructed by colonizers to create a binary division between men and women, describing this distinction as "a mark of the human and a mark of civilization. Only the civilized are men or women," which excluded Indigenous peoples and Africans as being non-human animals, while upholding the status of "bourgeois European women" as passive reproductive servants of "white bourgeois" male colonizers.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} According to Lugones, colonial relations of power constructed through such binaries constitute the "colonial difference", a term with open-ended origins that Lugones attributes to Walter Mignolo's book ''Local Histories/Global Designs''.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|751}}

Logones has stated that colonial notions of [[femininity]] as inversions of [[masculinity]] did not grant human status, but rather established a [[gender dimorphism]] of [[hypersexuality]] and sexual passivity that rendered colonized "men" and "women" as non-human gendered entities.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Through the performance of colonial [[anthropocentrism]] and the disruption of Indigenous [[cosmologies]] of grounded normativity, extreme acts of sexualized violence could be justified towards gendered and dehumanized colonized subjects, as stated by Lugones.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Lugones writes that through murder and rape,&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} control of colonized bodies institutionalized the internalization of colonial systems. Religious indoctrination, with divisions between good and evil equating colonized females with Satan, arguably established not only a colonization of bodies, but of memory.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}} Systematic replications of these ideologies, according to Lugones, facilitated the erasure of Indigenous cosmologies of reciprocal relations to place, psychologically clearing the way for the re-appropriation of land toward the implementation of capitalist projects.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}}

Within Lugones' analysis of Mignolo's usage of the colonial difference is her assertion that the colonial difference (and the coloniality of gender) is "not an affair of the past";&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752}} as such, as a contemporary phenomenon, Lugones argues that seeking parity with the colonizer by erasing colonial difference does not eliminate oppression.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752–753}} [[Rey Chow]] terms the act of seeking parity with the colonizer as "the ascendancy of whiteness",&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"&gt;Arvin, Maile; Tuck, Eve; and Morrill, Angie. Decolonizing Feminism: Challenging Connections between Settler Colonialism and [[Heteropatriarchy]]. Feminist Formations, vol. 25 No. 1 (Spring 2013). pp. 8-34. Print. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; which Arvin, Tuck and Morrill further elaborate as taking part in the colonial "settling process" to dispossess "'other-ed' peoples globally".&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt; Instead, Lugones proposes a "feminist border thinking" that positions learning from subalternity at the colonial difference as central to a decolonial feminism.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|753}} This concept embraces movements toward coalitional social relations between feminists of color, which Lugones describes as "the oppositional consciousness of a social erotics."&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|755}}

In this context, according to Arvin, Tuck, and Morrill, "Indigenous communities' concerns are often not about achieving formal equality or civil rights within a nation-state, but instead achieving substantial independence from a Western nation-state—independence decided on their own terms."&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt;

== Colonialism of gender in Canada ==
Some researchers believe that contact with patriarchal, European colonial contact reduced the value of Indigenous women in Canadian society.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Cindy|last2=Regina|first2=University of|date=2016|title=Gender, Justice, and the Indian Residential School Claims Process|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/iipj/vol7/iss1/3/|journal=International Indigenous Policy Journal|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.18584/iipj.2016.7.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, colonialism greatly shifted the role of women in Indigenous communities through patriarchal laws and regulations placed on marriage and other sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men, to whom the Indigenous people were viewed as inferior.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trafficking of Aboriginal Women and Girls|last=Boyer|first=Yvonne|last2=Kampouris, Peggy|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1-100-23756-5|location=Canada|pages=5–7 &amp; 31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal impositions on sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men resulted in such relations to have underlying monetary agendas, a commodification of women that caused many Indigenous women to involve themselves in prostitution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this Indigenous people as a whole were encouraged to adopt what  European Canadians and the Canadian government considered to be "[[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]]", eschewing their native culture and traditions in favor of assimilation.&lt;ref name="RoyalCom-sg3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|title=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Stage Three: Displacement and Assimilation|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada.|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071124124236/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|archive-date=November 24, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|title=Report-Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples-Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 6 of the ''Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples''|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]]|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071115053257/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|archive-date=November 15, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] in 1847 contributed to the [[systemic racism]], violence, and sexual mistreatment of Indigenous people, which led to the normalization and repeated occurrence of this abuse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cindy Hanson feels that this has contributed to a lingering sense of trauma among Indigenous women and girls that has caused them to become further victimized and [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], as well as impact how they interact with their families and communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The issue of [[Missing and murdered Indigenous women|Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls]] has been cited by researchers such as Robyn Bourgeois as an example of how colonial exploitation has led to systemic racism, causing Indigenous women to be stereotyped or discriminated against as dirty, sexually indiscriminate bodies that can be violated and thrown away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourgeois|first=Robyn|date=2015|title=Colonial exploitation: The Canadian state and the trafficking of Indigenous women and girls in Canada.|url=|journal=UCLA Law Review|volume=62 |issue=6|pages=1426–1463|via=Hein Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination towards Indigenous ==
The impact of colonialism of gender is evidently seen in Canada with Indigenous women as they often migrate to urban areas due to a lack of education and opportunities in general. While there is a lack of survey regarding the migration of indigenous people from rural to urban the 1991 Aboriginal People's Survey suggests that  61% of Aboriginal people have moved at some point in their life indicating their strong desire to seek out better career and livelihood.&lt;ref name="Trovato"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-people-demography/|title=Demography of Indigenous People|last=Trovato|first=Frank|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 and 1980, the ''Indian Act'' created by Canadian government dictating Indigenous women as the act controlled their status, land, resources...etc. This act made it so if an indigenous women marries an individual without the same status, the women will lose their status.&lt;ref name="Trovato"/&gt; Since making this act obsolete. the number of registered Indians doubled as many were reinstated. This is seen in 1985 there were approximately 360,000 registered and 778.000 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/native-womens-issues/|title=Indigenous Women's Issues|last=McNab|first=Miriam|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indigenous women are seen to be most affected by Colonialism of Gender as there are many missing reports or homicides among Aboriginal females. A study shows that between 1980 and 2012, a total of 1,017 Aboriginal female were homicide victims and 164 women currently missing with additional 225  unsolved cases. As of November 4, 2013, 11.3% (1,455 total) female were considered missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/missing-and-murdered-aboriginal-women-national-operational-overview#sec3|title=Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational Overview {{!}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police|last=Police|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-colonial Indigenous idea of gender ==
Not only has the idea of gender and sexuality changed due to colonialism, but power distribution and family structure as well. In the pre-colonial times, Indigenous families were not organized through an authoritative figure but rather it was more communal. Some pre-colonial Indigenous communities were matrilineal and gave women very powerful roles within the society.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}}

This drastically changed once they became colonized, European values and structures were enforced onto this community thus covering their pre-existing idea of gender and family.

===Indonesia===

==== Westernised roles of women ====
Prior to the 1945 independence, the role of women only revolved around the household. To be a good woman is to be a good wife that provide support for the family. It was not until 1941 that women were allowed access to education as it would increase the possibility for Indonesia to gain independence. After the independence in 1945, the role of women in society has expanded beyond the domestic sphere and the National Women’s Congress keep in touch with women’s organizations abroad. For example, the government allowed women to be involved in activities such as police work training and other national defense related institutions, which would be considered out of the ordinary before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=WOMEN IN INDONESIA: Gender, Equity and Development.|last=Robinson &amp; Bessell|first=|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2002|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Women’s role in the public sphere ====

===== Employment =====
According to the 2014 World Development Indicators, labour participation rate of Indonesian women from the age of fifteen is 51.4%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is considered low by international standards. Although the gender pay gap is 5.3 %, Indonesian women are relatively paid more than men. It is because gender pay gap also included underemployment rate. For instance, the number of women working in higher position are lacking compared to male.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Megawati Soekarnopoetri, the daughter of the first president of Republic of Indonesia, was elected as the first female ruler of the country in 2001 after her predecessor was impeached. She served as president until 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muslim women of power gender, politics, and culture in Islam|last=Bennett|first=C|publisher=Continuun|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

===== Education =====
According to the data collected by the World Economic Forum in 2013, women in Indonesia has equal or nearly equal education participation rate to men. The female-to-male ratio in secondary education is one, meaning that the number enrolled is equal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2013/#section=list-of-countries&amp;ol=info|title=The Global Gender Report 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A figure that started the fight for women’s right to education is Kartini. During the colonial period, she opened up the first school for native girls in Indonesia with the help of her sisters. At that time, girls do not have the opportunity to get education. Her legacy continued with the founding of Kartini School in Batavia, three years after she passed away&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letters of a Javanese princess|last=Kartini and Symmers|first=Raden Ajeng and A.L.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== Economy =====
Women’s participation in entrepreneurship is still low, with ‘only 23% of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises are owned by women’. Although 45% of manufacturing business owners are women, they mostly relied on unpaid female workers while businesses owned by male have more paid workers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Women’s role in the private sphere ====

===== Community =====
There are many women’s organizations in Indonesia that are based on various interest of its members. One of the well-known organizations is Dharma Wanita Persatuan (DWP), composed of the wives of government employees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.liputan6.com/regional/read/3392512/kegiatan-dharma-wanita-jangan-hanya-lomba-masak-dan-kecantikan|title=Kegiatan Dharma Wanita Jangan Hanya Lomba Masak dan Kecantikan.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The younger generation are more focused on gender equality, preventing sexual assault and empowerment. A few organisations include National Commission on Violence Against Women, Hollaback! Jakarta, Community Legal Aid Institute. The organisations mentioned, along with several others, participate in the ‘Women’s March’ in 2018, a rally to voice out their opinion regarding gender-based violence in Indonesia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jakartaglobe.id/features/women-behind-womens-march-jakarta/|title=The Women Behind Women’s March Jakarta|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== During Colonisation =====
In the year 1893-1907, the French had colonized Laos along with Vietnam and Cambodia incorporating into French Cochin China&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stuart-Fox|first=Martin|date=1995|title=The French in Laos, 1887-1945|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/312913?seq=4#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=29|pages=111-139|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== After colonisation =====
Lao colonisation last for several years until the World War II, Japanese had occupy Laos. ( Japanese occupation of Laos) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30006843/logan-landofthe-2007.pdf|title=Land of the lotus-eaters: Vientiane under the French|last=Logan and William|first=|date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since the 1957, women are formally equal in the eye of state however, gender is how the social practices are organised besides age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diversicare.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Profile_LaoSML.pdf|title=Laos Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1975 Lao women’s concerns were first formally addressed by national government. The Lao People Revolutionary Party, the new communist establishment had guarantee on equality between women and men in all fields, economic, cultural, social and political, also the neglect toward women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk/sites/bridge.ids.ac.uk/files/reports/re9c.pdf|title=Women and Development in Laos|last=Thomson|first=Sheila|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s role in the public sphere ====

===== Politics =====
Despite women contribution in the developing of Lao, the gender data on health education and political show that women still absence to political power and basis services. However, Lao women still related to national level through the Lao Women Union (LWU)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk/sites/bridge.ids.ac.uk/files/reports/re9c.pdf|title=Women and Development in Laos|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only female minister is the president of the LWU.

===== Education =====
Education status of women in Laos has improve significantly since 1975, the percentage of female students in school increase from 37,6% to 45,3% in 1980. In regards of salary, educated women tend to face inequalities5. However, the overall average education level of Lao women still lower than men. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk/sites/bridge.ids.ac.uk/files/reports/re9c.pdf|title=Women and Development in Laos|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s role in the private sphere ====

===== Community =====
Women and men are equal in regards of legal right. Many families take part in agriculture, farming. Also, work is divide by gender role, women are often take care of their child, cooking maintaining the household and household finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/lao-culture/family-edd122c0-5b12-4cd9-8e34-22029325a9aa|title=Lao culture|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;women who live in urbanised area work in companies and civil service position. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/lao-culture/family-edd122c0-5b12-4cd9-8e34-22029325a9aa|title=Lao culture|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men mostly is the head of family and decision maker.

===== Conclusion =====
The gender inequality and gender issues tend to conflict with urban areas and rural areas, but overall women are still mainly seen as a home maker or care taker. However, they are still opportunities for women to hold positions in many industries and work area. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edmund Hodgson|first=Yates|date=1865|title=French Cochin China.|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/docview/6506789?rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo|journal=Temple bar : a London magazine for town and country readers, Dec. 1860-Dec. 1881; London|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===

==== Westernised Roles of Women ====
Under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, China is a male-dominated society while women had a relatively subordinate familial role which they were assumed to be taking care of housework and children. While for Hong Kong, due to the emergence of western culture during the british colonial period, westernization leads to a mix of traditional chinese thoughts and western culture and a significant different women roles in Hong Kong were found. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Sangwha|date=1999|title=The Patriarchy in China: An Investigation of Public and Private Spheres.|url=|journal=Asian Journal of Women's Studies|volume=5(1)|pages=9-49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

===== Employment =====
The labour force participation rate for women increased gradually from 48.7% in 2004 to 50.7% in 2014. On the other hand, the labour force participation rate of men decreased from 71.6% in 2004 to 68.7% in 2014. 2 In 2017, there are 45.8% female and 54.2% males recorded in the employment rate, this indicated the equal and fair workplaces between male and female. There are different rights for the employed women including maternity protection and sick leave, however, there are different difficulties women facing for example some companies required a male supervisor instead of a female one.

===== Economy =====
According to the Women and Men Hong Kong Key Statistics 2018 Edition, there is 331 thousand female employed person, excluding foreign domestic helper, earned more than 30,000per month. 542.4 thousand male employed person earned more than 30,000 per month. contribution towards economic development by women is relatively lower than male these days. Although more Hong Kong women than men are attaining tertiary education, but are earning less than men across all professions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.women.gov.hk/download/research/HK_Women2015_e.pdf|title=Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
According to data collected in the Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015, the ratio of male and female in the Executive council is 23:6. Although the number of women who participated in the executive council is low, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (CE) 2017 is known as Carrie Lam who is the first female CE in the history. This allocated the rise of women participation in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youth.gov.hk/en/info-centre/education/education-policy.htm|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Education =====
In the past, under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, for those family who are not affordable to send all children to school, they are prioritising their son to attend school. However, after the british control, people realise the education system should have changed and discovered the importance of being educated. The education opportunities in Hong Kong are comparatively fair since the Hong Kong government is providing a 12-year free education including 6 years primary school and 6 year secondary school education. Parents are compulsory to send their children to school or stay-home study for special needs, thus all teenagers in Hong Kong can be well-educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkfw.org/chi/index.php|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
For both gender in Hong Kong, they are getting married later in their life since women are getting more independent and bare a higher responsibility in their work forces. Traditional marriage values are less important and women are less relying on men in nowadays society. People agreed that the household income should be contributed from both husband and wife, thus, women are getting their own job as well instead of being a housewife only.

===== Community =====
There are several common communities protecting Hong Kong women’s rights. The Hong Kong Federation of women founded by 11 prominent ladies was established on 28 June 1993.  Members of the federation came from various levels, occupations, races, and districts in Hong Kong. Amongst members are business women, professionals, workers and housewives as well as those who are fervent in women development and advancement.Their goal is to unite women from all walks of life, to encourage them taking an active interest in Hong Kong affairs, to improve and protect the lawful rights of women and to liaise with women organizations all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.japanpowered.com/japan-culture/gender-roles-women-modern-japan|title=Gender Roles of Women in Modern Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Japan===

==== Westernised Roles of Women ====
Through modernisation and western influence, women status and role are changed. In the past, women were very much seen as second class citizens. They had no rights or possessions and were subservient to their husbands. Women are expected to marry, produce heirs, and take care of the household. Marriage was often arranged and it is a contract between families. However, after western influence, women are making strides toward equality in Japan. Equality benefits men as much as it does women for example becoming more acceptable to want a career. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/643486/japan-female-employment-rate/|title=Female employment rate in Japan from 2007 to 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

==== Employment ====
The government takes credit for adding about 1m women to the workforce since 2012. At 66%, the female participation rate is now among the highest in the world. That is largely the result, say critics, of Japan’s drum-tight labour market rather than of innovative policies. Mindful that most of these jobs are far down the corporate totem pole, the government has also revived a decade-old target of having women occupy 30% of “leadership positions” by 2020. But it admits that this goal is nowhere near being met. In 2016, the female employment rate reach 48.9%, being one of the leading countries regarding economic key factors, showing a very low unemployment rate compared to other major industrial and emerging countries. In order to encourage women get their job, there is in-house babysitting service for the employee essential for helping working mothers make an easier transition back into the workforce. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fewjapan.com/|title=FEW: For Empowering Women in Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economy ====
Women participation in the labour force in the early development process indicates that they had a much larger role to play in the development process of Japan, which brought about such high economic growth in a short period of time. In the context of the broader debate over whether economic development expands or restricts women's economic opportunities and status, Japan  illustrates that the employment patterns of married women and the degree of gender equality is not similar to that of the industrialised west. The association between women's higher education attainment and labour market participation after marriage, which can be observed in the US and most other industrialised societies, is weak for Japan largely due to the cultural and institutional factors.  The export-oriented economic growth of Japan, which depended largely on the female reserve labour available at a low cost and used as a buffer to cyclical fluctuations, actually discouraged a large proportion of female workers from job seeking and they retired from the labour market.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Japanese women have been participants in a long history of social activism. But their participation in politics and political parties, is a more recent phenomenon. NGOs and other grassroots organisations have provided training, information and assisted with fund-raising to equip women to participate in the leadership positions in politics, especially at the local government levels. However, most political parties still continue to provide only limited leadership opportunities for women. Tokyo’s first female governor Koike Yuriko’s political background is in national politics. Before working the office of Tokyo governor, she was a member of the long-ruling government party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and had a seat in the national legislative assembly. She was influential in the preparation of policies to better utilise women’s labour largely as a strategy of improving the economy, so her commitment to “women’s empowerment” is unquestionable. She is interested in encouraging women to participate more in the workforce and take an active part in the capitalist economy.

===== Education =====
In the past, during the early stage of building modern education system, educational opportunities for girls were considerably disadvantaged. The attendance rate of girls were particularly low in the compulsory elementary school. Limited opportunities for girls to access secondary school was provided while higher education for women was not even supposed. Japanese government has developed policies and efforts for promoting education for girls and young females and encourage them to study with males. Conditions for women’s education have been gradually improved. As a result, in elementary education, gender gap in schooling was dissolved until the first decade of the 20th century. There is no gender gap in the opportunity for education in Japan recently, difference of enrollment ratios between male and female students in the upper secondary education and higher education levels is scarcely present. Enrollment of female students  in the secondary vocational schools had been increasing gradually.

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
In the past, the head of the household was responsible for finding a marriage partner for the family’s heir. Married women were expected to produce an heir. Traditionally, women are expected to submit to male authority in three ways. When young, she submits to her father; When married, she submits to her husband; When old, she submits to her sons. Motherhood is considered the defining characteristic of a woman. Besides, housework, child care, and elder care each day are daily household taken up by women at home
Thus, a lot of young Japanese women struggle to form their own sense of identity apart from this cultural expectation.

===== Community =====
There are differenet association founded in Japan. For Empowering Women (FEW), Founded in 1981 as an organization for “Foreign Executive Women”, has long been a stable source of support and learning for international women in both the Tokyo and Kansai areas. It is an exceptionally active and ever-growing Tokyo-based nonprofit business and social networking organization whose mission is to “enable internationally-minded women in Japan to achieve their full professional and personal potential.”  FEW organise exciting line-up of personal and professional development workshops and opportunities to support women’s empowerment annually.

{{Performing arts}}

A '''comedy''' is entertainment consisting of jokes intended to make an audience laugh.&lt;ref name = OED/&gt; For ancient Greeks and Romans a comedy was a stage-play with a happy ending. In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings and a lighter tone. In this sense [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Divina Commedia'').

The phenomena connected with laughter and that which provokes it has been carefully investigated by psychologists and  agreed upon the predominating [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]]s are incongruity or contrast in the object, and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a "sudden glory." Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the "play instinct" and its emotional expression.

Much comedy contains variations on the elements of surprise, incongruity, conflict, repetitiveness, and the effect of [[irony|opposite expectations]], but there are many recognized genres of comedy. [[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use ironic comedy used to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of humor.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

[[Parody]] borrows the form of some popular genre, [[Work of art|artwork]], or [[Written language|text]] but uses certain [[irony|ironic]] changes to critique that form from within (though not necessarily in a condemning way). [[Screwball comedy]] derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters. [[Black comedy]] is defined by dark humor that makes light of so-called dark or [[evil]] elements in human nature. Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], [[sexual humor]], and [[race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comedic ways.

A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms, and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.

== Etymology ==
The word "comedy" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] '''''κωμῳδία''''', which is a compound either of ''[[komos|κῶμος]]'' (revel) or ''κώμη'' (village) and ''ᾠδή'' (singing): it is possible that ''κῶμος'' itself is derived from ''κώμη'', and originally meant a village revel. The adjective "comic" (Greek κωμικός), which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of "laughter-provoking".&lt;ref name="Francis MacDonald Cornford 1934"&gt;Francis MacDonald Cornford, The Origin of Attic Comedy, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia ''and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.&lt;ref name = OED&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient [[Greece]], comedy seems to have originated in songs or recitations apropos of fertility festivals or gatherings, or also in making fun at other people or stereotypes. In the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] states that [[comedy]] originated in phallic rituals and festivals of mirth. It is basically an imitation of 'the ridiculous, which is a species of the ugly.' However, [[Aristotle]] taught that comedy is a good thing. It brings forth happiness, which for [[Aristotle]] is the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. He does believe that we humans feel pleasure oftentimes by doing the wrong thing, but he does not necessarily believe that comedy and humor is the wrong thing. It is also not true for [[Aristotle]] that a comedy must involve sexual humor to qualify as a comedy. A comedy is about the fortunate arise of a sympathetic character. A happy ending is all that is required in his opinion. 

On the contrary, the Greek Philosopher [[Plato]] taught that [[comedy]] is a destruction to the self. He believed it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In [[The Republic (Plato)]], he says that the Guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

Northrop Frye described the comic [[genre]] as a drama that pits two societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. He depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth" and a "Society of the Old", ''The Anatomy of Criticism''. 1957, but this [[dichotomy]] is seldom described as an entirely satisfactory explanation.  A later view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes; in this sense, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse to ruses which engender very dramatic.

'''Comedy rock''' is rock music mixed with [[Comedy music|comedy]], often satire and parody.&lt;ref name=AllmusicComedyRock&gt;V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, ''All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul'' (Backbeat Books, 3rd Edition., 2002), pp. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early bands and songs===
Early American examples include [[Stan Freberg]], who lampooned artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Harry Belafonte]] and [[The Platters]], and [[Sheb Wooley]]. The latter's "[[Purple People Eater]]" reached No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop chart in 1958 and stayed there 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | last = Bronson  | first = Fred  | title = The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits: The Inside Story Behind Every Number  | publisher = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]  | year = 2003  | isbn = 0-8230-7677-6  | page = 38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain during the 1950s and early 1960s comedians such as [[Charlie Drake]] and [[The Goons]] frequently appeared in the top ten with humorous rock 'n' roll records—the latter, along with [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Edward Lear]], were to influence the word-play of [[John Lennon]]'s lyrics. Later British groups specialised in comedy: these included [[The Scaffold]], [[The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] and [[Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias]]. Later in Britain, in the 2000s, [[Mitch Benn]] released several studio albums that satirised current affairs using various musical genres, but mainly rock. His 2012 ''Breaking Strings'' album was critically acclaimed for its rock sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John-Paul |last=Stephenson |title=CD Review: Mitch Benn &amp; The Distractions – Breaking Strings.|url=http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2012/02/cd-review-mitch-benn-the-distractions-breaking-strings/ |work=Giggle Beats |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allmusic]] described [[Frank Zappa]] as the "godfather" of comedy rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/comedy-rock-ma0000012139/artists |title=Comedy rock |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pop rock]] and [[folk rock]] band [[The Turtles]] released a comedy rock album, ''[[The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands]]'', in 1968, though the band had previously incorporated humor into their songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic |class=album |id=r20668 |tab=review |label="''The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands'' &gt; Review" |Michael |last=Ofjord |accessdate={{date|2011-09-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of its members, [[Howard Kaylan]] and [[Mark Volman]] later performed more explicitly comedic songs as [[Flo &amp; Eddie]] with their own band and with Frank Zappa.

===Contemporary bands===
Several modern comedy rock bands have experienced mainstream commercial success. Duos [[Tenacious D]] and [[Flight of the Conchords]] both released platinum-selling albums and starred in their own respective comedic television series. [[Dan Finnerty]] with his [[The Dan Band]] has made comedy rock appearances in the [[Todd Phillips]] films ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'' and ''[[The Hangover]]'' spoofing "[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]" and "[[Candy Shop]]", as well as his live show, which parodies female cover songs and was filmed as a one-hour TV special directed by [[McG]] and executive produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]. [[Stephen Lynch (musician)|Stephen Lynch]] from New York developed a following with several Opie and Anthony appearances which led to two specials on Comedy Central. He performed on Broadway with the production of Grease.

With over 12 million albums sold, song parodist [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] remains the highest-selling comedy act in history, with his 2014 album ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' having debuted at #1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the first comedy album to do so since [[Allan Sherman]]{{'}}s ''[[My Son, the Nut]]'' in 1963.&lt;ref name="billboardnews"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6176745/weird-al-yankovic-billboard-200-mandatory-fun-number-one | title = 'Weird Al' Yankovic Gets First No. 1 Album On Billboard 200 with 'Mandatory Fun' | first = Keith | last = Caulfield | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 23, 2014 |work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock has been the target of many [[Parody|spoof]]s and several spoof bands have gone on to have hit records, for example [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] in the U.S., and [[The Hee Bee Gee Bees]] and [[Bad News (band)|Bad News]] in the UK. The band [[Steel Panther]] has become a fixture on the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Sunset Strip]] with their parody of 80s [[glam metal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feeling The Steel Panther: Interview with Michael Starr |publisher=The Aquarian Weekly |date=4 October 2009 |work=Nightlife |url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2009/10/04/interview-steel-panther-michael-starr-feeling-the-steel/ | accessdate=10 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their success has opened the doors for other spoof bands such as [[The Jimi Homeless Experience]]. Other spoof bands such as [[Dread Zeppelin]], [[Beatallica]] and [[Those Darn Accordions]] rely on unusual or intentionally contrasting genre-mixing for comic effect. Comedy rock duo [[Ninja Sex Party]], who have collaborated with Steel Panther on occasion, blend rock and [[synthpop]] and have produced songs that parody the [[dubstep]] and heavy metal genres. They have enjoyed success from their online popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livingmythmagazine.com/blog/2013/07/11/ninja-sex-party-tales-of-strawberries-and-cream/ |last=Milne |first=Gregory |title=Ninja Sex Party: Tales of Strawberries and Cream |date=11 July 2013 |newspaper=Living Myth Magazine |publisher=Living Myth Magazine |accessdate=29 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525175156/http://livingmythmagazine.com/blog/2013/07/11/ninja-sex-party-tales-of-strawberries-and-cream/ |archivedate=25 May 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another band, [[Primus (band)|Primus]], is known for their wacky lyrics and comedic music videos.

Many bands within the [[alternative rock]] and [[college rock]] spectrum are known for their incorporation of humorous and satirical songs, with bands such as [[They Might Be Giants]], [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]], [[Bloodhound Gang]], [[System of a Down]], [[Ween]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]] finding both mainstream and independent success in the United States, as well as successful foreign bands such as [[Parokya ni Edgar]] and [[Knorkator]].

[[Punk rock]] and [[pop punk]] has made its contribution to the comedy rock ranks, with such bands as [[The Aquabats]], [[Blink-182]], [[Bowling for Soup]], [[Patent Pending (band)|Patent Pending]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[The Dead Milkmen]], [[The Meatmen]] and [[The Radioactive Chicken Heads]]. [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] has also produced many humor-oriented and satirical bands, including [[Green Jellÿ]], [[Lawnmower Deth]], [[Massacration]], [[M.O.D.]], [[Big Dumb Face]], [[Psychostick]], Crotchduster, [[Ludichrist]] and [[Scatterbrain (band)|Scatterbrain]], while other bands like [[Gwar]] and [[Rosemary's Billygoat]] utilize outrageous costumes and over-the-top stage shows. The [[virtual band]] [[Dethklok]] is [[death metal]] spoof featured in the [[Adult Swim]] animated TV Show ''[[Metalocalypse]]''&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p882076|pure_url=yes}} allmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and their album entitled ''[[The Dethalbum]]'' debuted at No. 21 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 list.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://sickdrummer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=642&amp;Itemid=2 Dethalbum Debuts At #21 On Billboard Top 200] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705003124/http://sickdrummer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=642&amp;Itemid=2 |date=5 July 2009 }}" 9 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antiques restoration.jpg|thumb|Antiques restoration]]
A '''conservator-restorer''' is a professional responsible for the [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|preservation of artistic and cultural artifacts]], also known as [[cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation#.WSymX8m1tPs About Conservation: What is conservation? What is a conservator?]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservators possess the expertise to preserve cultural heritage in a way that retains the integrity of the object, building or site, including its historical significance, context and aesthetic or visual aspects.&lt;ref name="Defining2003"&gt;Defining the Conservator: Essential Competencies. (2003). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/governance/defining-the-conservator-essential-competencies.pdf?sfvrsn=1.&lt;/ref&gt;  This kind of preservation is done by analyzing and assessing the condition of cultural property, understanding processes and evidence of deterioration, planning [[collections care]] or site management strategies that prevent damage, carrying out conservation treatments, and conducting research.&lt;ref name="Careers2014"&gt;Careers in Conservation. (2014). Retrieved from http://www.conservation-us.org/publications-resources/careers-in-conservation/become-a-conservator#.VPPIxMaLTwN.&lt;/ref&gt;  A conservator's job is to ensure that the objects in a museum's collection are kept in the best possible condition, as well as to serve the museum's mission to bring art before the [[public]].&lt;ref name="Neuman2011"&gt;Neuman, R. (2011). MFA Highlights: Conservation and Care of Museum Collections. Boston, MA: Museum of Fine Arts.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation and restoration ==
Essentially, the term "conservation" refers to a manner of care or treatment that repairs damage and also takes action to prevent or slow down further deterioration of an object.&lt;ref name="Landry2000"&gt;Landry, G. (2000). The Wintertbur Guide to Caring for Your Collection. Winterthur, Delaware, DE: Winterthur Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "restoration" refers to a manner of care or treatment in which the goal is to bring an object back to its original appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt; "Restoration" can be part of the care and treatment of an object and is a subset of the umbrella term "conservation".&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;  Both terms come into play when it comes to the treatment and care of all cultural heritage.

== Responsibilities and duties ==
Conservators and restorers care for, manage, treat, preserve, and document many different historical items including [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]], [[art]], and specimens.&lt;ref name="Baker2015"&gt;Baker, G. D. (2015). How to Become a Museum Conservator. Retrieved from http://collegemouse.com/jobs/how-to-become-a-museum-conservator.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Examining artifacts, both visually and using scientific tools such as x-rays, infrared photography and microscopic analysis to determine the extent and causes of deterioration.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013"&gt;Johnston, L. (2013). Museum/gallery conservator job description. Retrieved from http://www.prospects.ac.uk/museum_gallery_conservator_job_description.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservation science (sometimes called museum science) aids every aspect of a museum’s mission to study its collections, both inside and out of the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Maintaining full conservation records by documenting the condition of an object or site, including any previous restoration work and to outline treatment methods and materials in detail.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Documentation ensures the careful recording of treatment procedures and materials so there can be no misunderstanding in the future about what is part of the original work of art and what has been added or altered by the conservator&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Producing a visual record of the object for identification purposes and to illustrate its condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The examination of the object, treatment proposal, and the actual treatment is documented with written reports and photographs&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Monitoring and recording display and storage conditions with the aim of keeping objects in a stable condition.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Preservation is the ultimate goal of conservation.  By taking into account the possible day-to-day stresses caused by an object’s environment, museum conservators do their best to preserve art for generations to come.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Proposing and estimating the costs of treatments to halt decay and stabilize an artifact.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservators, present a proposal for work to be done as well as a report on the completion of the treatment.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Restoration to bring a deteriorated or damaged object or structure closer to a previous or assumed appearance or function.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Although conservators cannot exactly recapture the original appearance, they are able to make highly educated decisions about how to restore an object if they identify the materials from which it was made and fully understand their properties.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Organizing the logistics of long-term projects and collaborating with other conservators.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  This collaboration can take place when items are on loan or when outside help is needed for complex conservation projects.
* Working out creative solutions to clean, support and repair sensitive objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Ultimately, just as every object is unique, every conservation decision must be considered on its own and on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Developing and maintaining appropriate standards within the specialist area.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Critical information can be lost and an object permanently damaged when things are cared for without basic guidelines and information.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;
* Keeping up to date with the latest conservation techniques and practices, through research and training.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Conservation is a young profession, which means it continues to evolve over time and conservators must be able to keep up to date with the latest trends.
* Advising on procedures for the safe exhibition and travel of cultural materials .  Museum conservators strive to maintain the integrity of each work of art throughout its life, whenever it is handled, stored, displayed, or shipped to other locations for exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;
* Direct and supervise curatorial, technical, and student staff in the handling, mounting, care, and storage of art objects.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  Other museum departments look to conservators and restorers for direction on safety procedures when it comes to objects in the museum's collection.
* Recommend preservation procedures, such as control of temperature and humidity, to curatorial and building staff.&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;  The most important step you can take to ensure the preservation of any collection is to create a safe display and storage environment that will not cause further deterioration of the objects.&lt;ref name="Landry2000" /&gt;

[[File:Russian-museum-conservation-department-092.jpg|thumb|Russian-museum-conservation-department-092]]

== Knowledge and skills ==
* Working knowledge of the vocabulary of conservation and scientific methodology in order to effectively examine an object, assess its state, understand its history, and articulate its needs.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Must have a firm grasp of philosophical precepts expressed in the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice in order to formulate a treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;  The conservator must understand that it’s important to respect the integrity of the object and that his or her actions should not jeopardize the long-term preservation of the object.
* Understanding and appreciation of the aesthetic, cultural, economic, historical, political, religious, scientific, and social values of objects, buildings and sites.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;  This understanding and appreciation are critically important when devising preservation and conservation plans, strategies, and treatments.
* Working knowledge of how materials constituting cultural heritage were acquired, modified, processed, or manufactured and how craft or manufacturing techniques and processes have evolved through time.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Possess knowledge of the chemical and physical properties and long-term behavior of a wide range of materials and whether these materials were used in the original fabrication of an object or in its subsequent treatment and preservation.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Must be aware of issues that arise from the ways that culturally significant materials will be accessed or used by society.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Knowledge of the context in which cultural heritage is used, as context may be critically important to understanding its condition, formulating appropriate treatment and recommending future care.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Knowledgeable about safety in the workplace and must carry out his or her practice in compliance with federal, state, and logical regulations.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Working knowledge of scientific principles as they apply to conservation, including how to access and use scientific literature and how to assess the validity of published research in conservation and allied fields.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Ability to recognize and understand the changes that occur in cultural heritage over time and be able to distinguish the cause of the changes (natural, chemical, physical, biological, or by human influence).&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Versed in the many ways in which light, relative humidity, temperature, and pollutants can influence the long-term preservation of cultural heritage and must be familiar with techniques, equipment, and resources that can assist in managing these important environmental factors&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Ability to conduct a safe, thorough examination of cultural materials in order to gather relevant information about their condition and to formulate an appropriate plan for preservation and treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Know which tools and techniques are appropriate, how extensive the examination should be, and how or whether to perform external, intrusive, and occasionally destructive sampling.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Understand the purposes of documentation and must be knowledgeable and proficient in appropriate methods of written and pictorial documentation as well as in the maintenance and preservation of the body of information produced during examination and treatment.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;
* Awareness of various treatment methods available as well as their effects on different types of cultural heritage, based on an understanding of condition, natural use, cultural, historic, and scientific significance, and, if applicable, the artist’s or maker’s intent.&lt;ref name="Defining2003" /&gt;

== Education and training ==

=== Undergraduate and graduate education ===
Conservators can receive training through apprenticeships, internships and graduate programs. In order to be accepted into a graduate program, they will need to fulfill some undergraduate prerequisites.  This includes undergraduate coursework in science, the humanities (art history, anthropology, and archaeology), and studio art.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Some graduate programs may also require internship, volunteer, apprenticeship, or paid conservation experience.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Many may also require a personal interview where candidates are asked to present a portfolio of art and conservation project work that demonstrates manual dexterity and familiarity with techniques and materials.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Graduate programs generally require two to four years of study, which can also include a full-time internship in the final year where students work under the guidance of experienced conservators.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  There are also a limited number of Ph.D. programs for advanced study in conservation.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservation-related programs are described on the websites of the AIC,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/jobs/become-a-conservator#.WSycysm1tPt Careers in Conservation: Become a Conservator]".

=== Continued professional development ===
The specialty of conservation is ever-changing and evolving, which means that practicing conservators must stay up-to-date of advances in technology and methodology.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;  Conservators usually expand their knowledge through reading publications, attending professional meetings, and enrolling in short-term workshops or courses.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt; AIC offers many workshops, conferences, and online courses and tutorials.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/courses#.WSykcMm1tPt Professional Development Courses in Conservation Education]". American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org.

Conservation OnLine (CoOL). cool.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of specialty ==
Some conservators specialize in a particular material or group of objects, such as archaeology, ceramics and glass, furniture and wood, gilding and decorative surfaces, historic interiors, metals, paintings, paper and books, photographic materials, stained glass, stone and wall paintings, textiles, sculptures, and architecture.&lt;ref name="Careers2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnston2013" /&gt;

== Ethics ==
The primary goal for conservators and restorers is the preservation of cultural property.  In order to achieve this goal, conservators abide by a code of ethics and guidelines that establish the principles that guide conservation professionals and others who are involved in the care of cultural property.  An example of a code of ethics and guidelines for practice were created by the [[American Institute for Conservation|American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics#.VPPM0saLTwM Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practive]" (2015). American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC). www.conservation-us.org. Retrieved 2017-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most important principles in a conservator's code of ethics is that treatments should be reversible, which means that one must be able to undo any treatment in the future.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;  Conservators strive to only minimize interventions and not completely alter an object during restoration.  Conservation focuses on the material aspects of art, and respect for original materials remains a crucial element of the field's ethics.&lt;ref name="Neuman2011" /&gt;

Most often it includes content intended to teach but has incidental entertainment value. It has been used by academia, corporations, governments, and other entities in various countries to disseminate information in classrooms and/or via television, radio, and other media to influence viewers' opinions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rapeepisarn |first1=K. |last2=Wong |first2=K.

== History ==

=== Concept ===
Interest in combining education with entertainment, especially in order to make learning more enjoyable, has existed for hundreds of years, with the [[Renaissance]] and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] being movements in which this combination was presented to students.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite conference|title=Edutainment or Education: Education Possibilities of Didactic Games in Science Education|format=pdf|date=September 2007|location=Brno, Czech Republic|url=http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|access-date=12 April 2017|editor=Němec, J.|pages=55–64|conference=ICCP Brno Conference|last1=Trna|first1=Josef|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817210858/http://www.iccp-play.org/documents/brno/nemec_trna.pdf|archivedate=17 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Amos Comenius|Komenský]] in particular is affiliated with the “school as play” concept, which proposes [[pedagogy]] with dramatic or delightful elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Poor Richard Almanack 1739.jpg|link=[[:File:Poor Richard Almanack 1739]].jpg|left|thumb|213x213px|''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'']]
[[Poor Richard's Almanack|''Poor Richard’s Almanack'']] demonstrates early implementation of edutainment, with [[Benjamin Franklin]] combining entertaining and educational content, such as puzzles and rules of conduct, into an instructional entity for colonists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/turning-to-education-for-fun.html|title=Turning to Education for Fun|last=Beato|first=Greg|date=2015-03-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-12|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105130008/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/turning-to-education-for-fun.html|archivedate=2017-01-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later development of the concept of edutainment can be tied to [[Walt Disney]], with his first educational short film, [[Tommy Tucker's Tooth|''Tommy Tucker’s Tooth'']], being commissioned and shot in 1922 for the Deneer Dental Institute.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Diane Disney (1957). ''The Story of Walt Disney''. NY: Henry Holt and Co. p. 79. {{ISBN|978-0-7868-5562-9}}. As cited in Shale, Richard (1982). ''Donald Duck Joins Up: The Walt Disney Studio During World War II''. Ann Arbor, Michigan: UMI Research Press. p. 15.{{ISBN|9780835713108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the [[United States|U.S.]] into [[World War II]] also had a major impact on the popularity of educational entertainment, as a relationship between Disney and the U.S. government formed; Disney was able to experiment with educational and nonfiction films in a way that continued even after the war,&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Donald Duck Joins Up: The Walt Disney Studio During World War II|last=Shale|first=Richard|publisher=UMI Research Press|year=1982|isbn=978-0-8357-1310-8|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=67, 109, 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; with series such as ''[[True-Life Adventures]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Walt and the Promise of Progress City|last=Gennawey|first=Sam|publisher=Ayefour Publishing|year=2011|isbn=978-0-615-54024-5|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walt Disney's Disneyland|''Disneyland'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newell|first=Catherine L.|title=The Strange Case of Dr. von Braun and Mr. Disney: Frontierland, Tomorrowland, and America’s Final Frontier|journal=The Journal of Religion and Popular Culture|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=416–429|doi=10.3138/jrpc.25.3.416|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the transcript of an interview with [[Alexander P. de Seversky]] from The Walt Disney Archives, of which its date and interviewer is unknown,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; the following quotation is found:{{Quote|text=It is a new kind of entertainment that goes far beyond simply "amusing" its audience.

Initiatives in major universities, such as [[Johns Hopkins University]]&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Entertainment-Education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice|last=Singhal|first=Arvind|last2=Michael J.|first2=Cody|last3=Rogers|first3=Everett M.|last4=Sabido|first4=Miguel|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=978-1-135-62456-9|location=|pages=7, 39}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], [[NGOs]] such as PCI-Media Impact, and government agencies such as the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC)&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/entertainmented/|title=Entertainment Education {{!}} Gateway to Health Communication {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120135351/https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/ToolsTemplates/EntertainmentEd/|archivedate=2017-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have produced edutainment content.

Modern forms of edutainment include television productions, film, museum exhibits, and computer software which use entertainment to attract and maintain an audience, while incorporating deliberate educational content or messages. It is also apparent that educational elements are becoming implemented into traditionally recreational realms, such as vacations and games.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Terminology ===
The term edutainment was used as early as 1954 by [[Walt Disney]] to describe the ''[[True Life Adventures]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DISNEY|first=WALT|date=1954-01-01|title=EDUCATIONAL VALUES IN FACTUAL NATURE PICTURES|jstor=42922993|journal=Educational Horizons|volume=33|issue=2|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[noun]] ''edutainment'' is a [[Neologism|neologistic]] [[portmanteau]] used by Robert Heyman in 1973 while producing documentaries for the [[National Geographic Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Marta Rey-López et al. A Model for Personalized Learning. In: Adaptive Hypermedia and Adaptive Web-Based Systems. Springer. Berlin. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by Dr. Chris Daniels in 1975 to encapsulate the theme of his Millennium Project. This project later became known as The Elysian World Project.&lt;ref name="elysianworld2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elysianworld.com|title=Elysian World|publisher=elysianworld.com|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217052758/http://elysianworld.com/|archivedate=December 17, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The offshoot word "Edutainer" has been used by Craig Sim Webb since before the turn of the millennium to describe an individual who offers edutainment presentations and performances.&lt;ref name="edutainer2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutainer.ca|title=Inspirational speakers – Professional Inspirational Speaker, Performer, Songwriter &amp; Author|publisher=edutainer.ca|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027001013/http://edutainer.ca/|archivedate=October 27, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==

=== Audio and video ===
''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'', ''[[Wishbone (TV series)|Wishbone]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and ''[[Bill Nye the Science Guy]]'' are examples of shows that use [[music]] and video to teach topics like math, science, and history. Using music to aid memory dates back to the passing of ancient oral traditions, including the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Much of what edutainment can offer through audio and video especially, is accessible over the internet on platforms such as [[YouTube]], with such channels as ''[[Vsauce]]'', ''[[CGP Grey]]'', ''[[MinutePhysics]]'', ''Meet Arnold, ''[[Veritasium]]'', and ''[[Crash Course (YouTube)|Crash Course]]''.

[[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]] is a band that incorporates audio and footage from the [[British Film Institute]] into their music and performances, and this partnership helps the British Film Institute showcase its material; their album ''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain|Inform—Educate—Entertain]]''[[Inform-Educate-Entertain|,]] which covers topics such as the climbing of [[Mount Everest]] and [[highway safety]], demonstrates the connection between the concept of edutainment and their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|title=The Archival Delights of Public Service Broadcasting|date=2015-02-24|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2017-04-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422133120/http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/archival-delights-public-service-broadcasting|archivedate=2017-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film and television ===
{{Main|Educational television}}

Motion pictures with educational content appeared as early as 1943, such as ''[[Private Snafu]]'', and can still be seen in films such as ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''. After [[World War II]], educational entertainment shifted towards television. Television programs can be divided into three main categories: those with primarily educational intentions, those with a high degree of both education and entertainment, and entertainment shows with incidental or occasional educational value.

Mexican TV producer Miguel Sabido pioneered in the 1970s a form of edutainment via [[telenovelas]], "soap operas for social change". The "Sabido  method" has been adopted in many other countries subsequently, including India, Peru, Kenya, and China.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Rosin, "Life Lessons: How Soap Operas Can Change the World", ''The New Yorker'', June 5, 2006, pp. 40-45.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Mexico, the government in the 1970s successfully used a telenovela to promote family planning to curb the country's high birthrate.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriela Soto Laveaga, "'Let's become fewer': Soap operas, contraception, and nationalizing the Mexican family in an overpopulated world." ''Sexuality Research and Social Policy''. September 2007, vol. 4,, no. 3 pp. 19-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third season of the television show ''MTV Shuga'' was analyzed by researchers and then published online in 2017 in terms of its effects related to its goal of educating African youth about [[Sexual Health|sexual health]] and [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|HIV]], and secondarily, [[Gender based violence|gender-based violence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|title=MTV Shuga Soap Opera Turns Edutainment into a Tool to Fight HIV and Gender-Based Violence|last=|first=|date=2017-02-27|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422212033/http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2017/02/23/mtv-shuga-soap-opera-turns-edutainment-into-a-tool-to-fight-hiv-and-gender-based-violence|archive-date=2017-04-22|dead-url=no|language=en|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]], those in the treatment group who watched the show for six months were “almost twice as likely” to get tested at HIV testing centers; mixed results were found in regards to the show’s effects on gender-based violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|title=EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION OF MTV SHUGA: CHANGING SOCIAL NORMS AND BEHAVIORS WITH ENTERTAINMENT EDUCATION|last=Banerjee|first=Abhijit|last2=La Ferrara|first2=Eliana|date=2017|website=World Bank|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315174725/http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/438421467236362785/Entertainment-Edu-workshop-Flyer-6-3-16.pdf|archive-date=2017-03-15|dead-url=no|access-date=|last3=Orozco|first3=Victor|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the article [["Walt Disney: Master of Laughter and Learning"]] Walt Disney believed in education through the entertainment of film and television. He is known as the master of communications who brought both entertainment and education into the world in distinctive ways. His creation of mickey mouse and his adventures taught his audience that life is not always so simple, there will be obstacles that will stand in your way. Mickey mouse's is unpolished and imperfect which make him so realistic to his audience. In many of his stories we see him battle and adventure which he overcomes teach a value in life for viewers, keep going in life. Disney achieved and educational characteristic in his work through the picture series of live animals in their natural habitat by which some film techniques added to the drama of the series.

=== Healthcare ===
Educating the public about health issues is a focus for many stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry. In recent years, several initiatives have used educational entertainment principles to highlight specific conditions or wider healthcare issues. Examples include In Memory about dementia,&lt;ref name="HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY"&gt;{{cite web|title=HEALTHCARE FEATURE FILMS: IN MEMORY|url=https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|website=Bedrock|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107022823/https://bedrock-health.com/healthcare-feature-films/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Millefeuille about psoriasis&lt;ref name="Millefeuille"&gt;{{cite web|title=Millefeuille|url=http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|website=Millefeuille|publisher=Celgene|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030657/http://www.millefeuillemovie.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and This is Axiom about the challenges facing the UK's National Health Service.&lt;ref name="This is Axiom"&gt;{{cite web|title=This is Axiom|url=http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|website=This is Axiom|publisher=Celgene|accessdate=3 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020639/http://thisisaxiommovie.com/|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Games ===
{{Main|Educational game}}

Games fulfill a number of educational purposes. Some games may be explicitly designed with education in mind, while others may have incidental or secondary educational value. All types of games, including [[board game|board]], [[card game|card]], and video games, may be used in an educational environment. Educational games are designed to teach people about certain subjects, expand concepts, reinforce development, understand an historical event or culture, or assist them in learning a skill as they play.

According to Paraskeva (2010), at least 68% of American households play video games. Many recent research articles postulate education and gaming can be joined to provide academic benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paraskeva | first1 = F. | last2 = Mysirlaki | first2 = S. | last3 = Papgianni | first3 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Multiplayer online games as educational tools: Facing new challenges in learning | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131509002413 | journal = Computers and Education | volume = 54 | issue = | pages = 498–505 | doi=10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Van Eck (2006), there are three reasons why games are considered learning tools: 1. Ongoing research that has included the last 20 years of educational findings have proven that digital games can be educational; 2. The new generation of today wants "multiple streams of information" (p.&amp;nbsp;1), which includes quick and frequent interaction that allows inductive reasoning; and 3. The mere popularity of games has created a billion-dollar industry. The idea of playing a game assumes the person is engaging in that activity by choice. The activity should have some value of "fun". This does not mean that the person is engaging in the activity only for leisure pursuits; it can also include the desire to learn a skill, connect with other gamers (social community), and spend time in a chosen activity. The activity needs to remain one of choice for the gamer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Eck|first=R.|year=2006|title=Digital game-based learning: It's not just the digital natives who are restless...|publisher=Educase Review|volume=41|issue=2|pages=1–16|url=http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|format=PDF|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229182518/http://edergbl.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/47991237/digital%20game%20based%20learning%202006.pdf|archivedate=2016-12-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim (2008) supports the use of off-the-shelf games with [[Metacognition|meta-cognitive]] strategies to provide an increase in students' cognitive performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, B., Park, H., &amp; Baek, Y. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Computers and Education, 52, 800-810&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radio and podcasts ===

[[Radio]] can serve as an effective vehicle for educational entertainment. The British radio soap opera ''[[The Archers]]'' has for decades been systematically educating its audience on agricultural matters; likewise, the [[Tanzania]]n radio soap opera ''Twende na Wakati'' ("Let's Go With the Times") was written primarily to promote [[family planning]].

Likewise, [[podcast]]s have begun to exemplify the concept of edutainment, with some radio programs also becoming available in this digital format. Not only are there are series with educational elements that are listened to recreationally, but there are also [[Uses of podcasting#Education and academia|podcasts used as an educational tool]]. Lessons based on podcasts have increased in popularity, with [[Teacherspayteachers.com|''TeachersPayTeachers'']] finding that lesson plans relating to podcasts rose in downloads by 21 percent and 650 percent in 2014 and 2015, respectively, which corresponded with the release of ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|title=Using 'Serial' to Get Students to Read More|last=Godsey|first=Michael|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209125945/https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/03/the-benefits-of-podcasts-in-class/473925/|archivedate=2017-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toys ===
{{Main|Educational toy}}

Toys are perhaps the earliest "edutainment" objects a person encounters, as many toys have also an educational aspect beside their [[aesthetic]] appeal. They can teach children literacy, numerical, conceptual or motor skills. Many toys (e.g., a miniature [[piano]]) are simply colorful, scaled-down versions of more complex objects, and thus can base children in skills and benefits associated with the latter. It is up to grown-ups to guide children to the toy's proper use in order to make the most out of it.

Toys are often employed in the context of [[mimicry]] and [[roleplay]] to partially experience personalities or situations not otherwise possible, very akin to [[simulation]] in video games. They can be used as primitive means to nurture an [[instinct]] or a [[character trait]] in children. Often, toys work simultaneously the other way, providing children with the means to ''express'' those things: a doll may be used by a girl to mimic her mother or express [[motherhood]] as much as to explore it.

Even for toys that don't possess explicit educational value, a thoughtful parent or teacher can turn a static [[figurine]], for example, into an object of interest, by pointing out its features or costumes, or referring to its history or science (e.g., a figurine of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] may be a starting point for exploring American history; a [[Santa Claus]] may be used to explore the roots of Christmas; a toy [[astronaut]] to explore science...), which can be done in conjunction with a more-explicitly "edutaining" object, such as a [[picture book]]. Most children are naturally inquisitive (possibly why they sometimes break their toys; simply to know what is inside or how it moves or what produces that sound), and caregivers should not waste this opportunity.

Even ''grown-ups'' can learn through toys about children: what are their [[Aptitude|talents]] or interests; if they are more [[extrovert]] or [[introvert]]; indeed if they dislike toys and prefer social activities or sport, and thus capitalize on the children's abilities and correct what is wrong or lacking.

Some toys are of considerable appeal and benefit to both children and adults, such as [[Lego]] or [[Rubik's Cube]], as their design and implementation can range from the simple to the sophisticated.

=== Hip hop culture ===
The term "edutainment" was first made popular amongst the hip hop community by [[KRS-One]] (a.k.a. The Teacha) thanks to his [[Boogie Down Productions]] [[Edutainment (album)|album by the same name]].

The term has since been borrowed to describe hip hop culture's innate pedagogical aesthetics. Examples of this include how Hip Hop uniquely combines both thought and action (see [[Paulo Freire]]'s use of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] in ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]'') and values both Eurocentric values of rational thought and Afrocentric epistemology of kinetic, affective and emotional ways of knowing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New York|pages=72|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is in the transmission of technical and historical knowledge, the manner in which Hip Hop practitioners learn and exchange by sharing moments of performance together through ''building'' or ''building sessions.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hip-Hop Culture in College Students' Lives|last=Petchauer|first=Emery|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88971-1|location=New-York|pages=76–77|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporations ===
The concept of educational entertainment is being used for building learning programs for organizations. High technology is used to make the programs entertaining and educational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=E-Content: Technologies and Perspectives for the European Market|last=Nagy|first=Atilla|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2006|isbn=3-540-25093-X|location=|pages=79–96|chapter=The Impact of E-Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, [[PowerPoint]] presentations may become more entertaining with the addition of flashy animations or graphics. An article in a satirical newspaper, ''[[The Onion]]'', poked fun at the concept of embellishing boring presentations with attention-catching effects.&lt;ref name="Onion2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|title=Wow Factor Added To Corporate Presentation &amp;#124; The Onion – America's Finest News Source|publisher=theonion.com|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106232425/http://www.theonion.com/articles/wow-factor-added-to-corporate-presentation,2766/|archivedate=November 6, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fictional marketing executive in the article noted the previous lack of excitement in the presentation, saying "When we first finished the PowerPoint, the content was all there, but it still lacked that certain something."&lt;ref name="Onion2" /&gt;

=== Theme parks ===
{{Main|Amusement park#Educational theme parks}}
[[File:Spaceship Earth at EPCOT.jpg|link=[[:File:Spaceship Earth at EPCOT]].jpg|thumb|[[Spaceship Earth (Epcot)|Spaceship Earth]], an attraction at [[Epcot]]]]
Theme parks are a specific kind of setting in which the combination of entertaining and educational elements can be prevalent. [[Epcot]] at [[Walt Disney World]], which is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]], is highly based on edutainment; the park features attractions that teach about the past, conservation, imagination, future technologies, and the world. The park's dedication plaque, written by [[Marty Sklar]] and Erwin Okun, states the following: “May [[EPCOT Center]] entertain, inform and inspire. And above all, may it instill a new sense of belief and pride in man’s ability to shape a world that offers hope to people everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dream It!

The offerings and promotions at [[SeaWorld]] associated with the educational topics of [[marine biology]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]], and animal rescue efforts are increasing at their current locations and in plans for the upcoming [[SeaWorld Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi theme park]], which is likely due to activism for animal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SeaWorld Shifts to Educational Entertainment, Adds Virtual-Reality Ride; Theme-park moves further away from controversial orca shows|last=Hufford|first=Austen|date=27 September 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal (Online)|access-date=|publisher=Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=SeaWorld writes a new chapter with first killer whale-free park|last=Lindsay|first=Rowena|date=14 December 2016|work=The Christian Science Monitor|access-date=|location=Boston, Mass.|issn=0882-7729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable theme parks that incorporate educational elements and topics are [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]], [[Holy Land Experience]], [[Dinosaur World (theme parks)|Dinosaur World]], [[Busch Gardens]], and [[Puy du Fou]].

=== Museums and public access areas ===

Edutainment is also a growing [[paradigm]] within the [[Science museum|science center]] and [[children's museum]] community in the United States, as well as in many other locations such as the [[zoo]] or a [[botanical garden]]. Educational locations such as these are constantly looking for new and innovative ways to reach the surrounding public and get them interested in areas such as the fine arts, science, literature, and history. Additionally, [[field trip]] visits to these educational places provide participants with interactional stimulus to learn about the content offered there. Since people are used to flashy, polished entertainment venues like movie theaters and theme parks, they demand similar experiences at science centers or museums. Consequently, interactive experiences, such as games and [[mobile app]]s, are implemented in museums in order to more effectively help people learn about what they are seeing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ART; TAP AND TOUR; Museums are quietly adapting to the app-happy 'selfie culture'|last=Gelt|first=Jessica|date=25 October 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museums are also embracing the ability to use storytelling to engage people, especially those who are young, in hopes to increase attendance; all the while, though, it is possible for the focus and purpose of museums to be diluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=ARENA --- The Museum of The Future --- From 3-D headsets to holograms, new technologies are revolutionizing exhibits; is it entertainment or education?|last=Gamerman|first=Ellen|date=16 October 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=|location=New York, N.Y.|edition= Eastern|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a museum or a zoo can be seen as just another business competing for entertainment dollars from the public, rather than as an institution that serves the public welfare through education or historical preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=High Tech Heretic|last=Stoll|first=Clifford|publisher=Doubleday|year=1999|isbn=0-385-48975-7|location=|pages=485–499|doi=|id=|coauthors=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects in the classroom ==
{{Main|Entertainment in education}}Much research has been done in association with edutainment and its effectiveness in its various forms. Particularly, the effects of the implementation of the concept of edutainment in the classroom setting have been studied on multiple occasions. The concept of [[flipped classroom]]s, in association with edutainment, was studied by Retta Guy and Gerald Marquis (2016), in which students were assigned [[video lesson]]s and podcasts as opposed to projects prior to class; it was found that these students outperformed those in traditional classrooms, found the actual time in class to prompt more interaction, and thought the class to be more enjoyable, although there was a noticeable period of adaption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guy|first=Retta|last2=Marquis|first2=Gerald|date=2016|title=The Flipped Classroom: A Comparison of Student Performance Using Instructional Videos and Podcasts Versus the Lecture-Based Model of Instruction|url=|journal=Issues in Informing Science &amp; Information Technology|volume= 13|pages= 1–13|issn=1547-5840|doi=10.28945/3461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Ruby Lynch-Arroyo and Joyce Asing-Cashman (2016), ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numb3rs]]'', which is an example of edutainment in the form of a television show, was integrated into the education of [[Pre-service teacher education|preservice]] mathematics teachers. The subsequent results exemplified the potential for edutainment to promote [[critical thinking]], increased engagement, and [[growth mindset]]s.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch-Arroyo|first=Ruby|last2=Asing-Cashman|first2=Joyce|date=2016|title=Using Edutainment to Facilitate Mathematical Thinking and Learning: An Exploratory Study|url=http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|journal=Journal of Mathematics Education|volume=9|pages= 37–52|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817203754/http://educationforatoz.com/images/2016_Research_3.pdf|archivedate=2017-08-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Craig D. Cox, ''et al''. (2017) conducted a study in which a mini-series that combined educational and entertaining elements was developed and presented to pharmacy [[preceptor]]s; it was effective in increasing the confidence of the participants and was an honorable mention for the [[American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy]] Innovations in Teaching Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Craig D.|last2=Cheon|first2=Jongpil|last3=Crooks|first3=Steven M.|last4=Lee|first4=Jaehoon|date=2017|title=Use of Entertainment Elements in an Online Video Mini-Series to Train Pharmacy Preceptors|url=|journal=American Journal of Pharmaceutical Education|volume= 81|issue=1|pages= 1–13|issn=0002-9459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A system that incorporated the concept of edutainment through the use of games has also been studied in association with [[Disability|disabled]] students by Amal Dandashi, ''et al''. (2015), and it was found that the system had a positive impact in terms of scores, coordination, communication, and memorization skills; after replaying, higher scores were often achieved as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dandashi|first=Amal|last2=Karkar|first2=Abdel Ghani|last3=Saad|first3=Sawsan|last4=Barhoumi|first4=Zaara|last5=Al-Jaam|first5=Jihad|last6=Saddik|first6=Abdulmotaleb El|date=2015-01-01|title=Enhancing the Cognitive and Learning Skills of Children with Intellectual Disability through Physical Activity and Edutainment Games|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1155/2015/165165|journal=International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks|language=en|volume=11|issue=6|doi=10.1155/2015/165165|page=165165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for podcasts and narration specifically, according to a study conducted by Trish L. Varao Sousa, Jonathan S. A. Carriere, and Daniel Smilek (2013) with student participants, these forms may not be particularly helpful, as their use can result in both less information actually internalized and less engagement overall when compared to other "reading encounters."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varao Sousa|first=Trish L.|last2=Carriere|first2=Jonathan S.

Debate regarding the value of educational entertainment and its implementation has been had for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|title=That's Edutainment|last=Rozen|first=Joel|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323160117/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/thats-edutainment/305126/|archivedate=2016-03-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative feedback received by Walt Disney for his ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'' series represents the views of some skeptics of the concept of edutainment. For example, the use of music along with the footage of animals, such as the circumstance in which "The courtship of tarantulas was set to a tango, while the movements of two scorpions were showcased with square dance music in the background" was criticized at the time; the purpose of the music was to enhance the footage, but some people took issue with this humanization. Additionally, without approval, some of the film crew of ''[[White Wilderness (film)|White Wilderness]]'' prompted unnatural behavior in lemmings that would be filmed, which then generated a negative response.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|title=Walt and the True-Life Adventures|last=admin|date=2012-02-09|work=The Walt Disney Family Museum|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170419053222/http://waltdisney.org/blog/walt-and-true-life-adventures|archivedate=2017-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television show that demonstrates the concept of edutainment, has also specifically been subject to criticism. For instance, in an article published in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in May 1971, [[John Holt (educator)|John Holt]] criticizes the promotion of "Right Answers" in the television show without actual action being taken by the children, and also argues that it is nonsensical and perplexing to have adults convey to children that everything that is to be discovered is logical and easy to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|title=Big Bird, Meet Dick and Jane|last=Holt|first=John|date=May 1971|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523172022/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1971/05/big-bird-meet-dick-and-jane/305125/|archive-date=2016-05-23|dead-url=no|language=en-US|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument that the concept of edutainment hurts the actual value of education has been prevalent as well. The book entitled ''[[Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' by theorist [[Neil Postman]] demonstrates this notion, as it is claimed that areas of study have been “transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business.”&lt;ref&gt;Neil., Postman, (1986-01-01). {{oclc|14271773}} ''Amusing ourselves to death : public discourse in the age of show business''.

Retrieved 2017-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Museum professionals especially have faced this dilemma, as in study conducted by Pierre Balloffet, François H. Courvoisier, and Joëlle Lagier (2014), museum professionals did not have severe negative opinions of the incorporation of educational entertainment, but individuals nevertheless had varying viewpoints on "the appropriateness or potential risks of edutainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Balloffet|first=Pierre|last2=Courvoisier|first2=François H.|last3=Lagier|first3=Joelle|date=2014|title=From Museum to Amusement Park: The Opportunities and Risks of Edutainment|url=|journal=International Journal of Arts Management|volume=16 |issue=2|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10180">The '''epideictic oratory''', also called '''ceremonial oratory''', or praise-and-blame [[rhetoric]], is one of the three branches, or "species" (eidē), of rhetoric as outlined in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', to be used to praise or blame during ceremonies.

== Origin and pronunciation ==
The term's root has to do with display or show (''deixis''). It is a literary or rhetorical term from the Greek (ἐπιδεικτικός). It is generally pronounced {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|aɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|eɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}}.[http://www.wordreference.com/definition/epideictic] Another English form, now less common, is ''epidictic'' {{IPAc-en|ɛ|p|ᵻ|ˈ|d|ɪ|k|t|ɪ|k}}.

== Characteristics ==
This is rhetoric of ceremony,  commemoration, declamation, demonstration, on the one hand,  and of play, entertainment,  display, including self-display.  It is also the rhetoric used at festivals, the [[Olympic Games|Olympic games]], [[state visit]]s and other formal events like  openings, closings,  anniversaries as well as at births, deaths, or marriages.  Its major subject  is praise and blame, according to  Aristotle in the limited space  he  provides  for it  in the ''Art of  Rhetoric'' (Freese translation).  

This rhetoric deals with  goodness, excellence, nobility, shame,  honor, dishonor,  beauty, and matters  of virtue and vice. The  virtues  or the "components" of  virtue  according to Aristotle,  were "justice, courage, self-control, magnificence, magnanimity, liberality, gentleness, practical and speculative wisdom"  or "reason". Vice  was the "contrary" of virtue. 

In his book ''Rhetoric and Poetics in Antiquity'', Jeffrey Walker claims that epideictic rhetoric predates the rhetoric of courts and politics, the study of which began in the 5th or 4th century BC with the [[Sophists]]. The other two kinds of public speech were deliberative or political speech, and forensic, judicial, or legal speech. Epideictic rhetoric  or style is according to Aristotle most appropriate for material that is written or read. In the ''Art of Rhetoric'', Aristotle stated  that  "The epideictic style is especially suited to written compositions; for its function  is reading." (423){{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Aristotle on epideixis ==
{{main|Rhetoric (Aristotle)}}
Aristotle instructs that in creating a speech of praise or blame, the author should consider the attitude of his audience: Will they be moved to see his object of praise (be it a person or a thing) in a new light, or will he be wasting everyone's time by "preaching to the choir"? What values and behavior does this particular audience find praiseworthy? Whether the audience is sympathetic, hostile, or indifferent to his object of praise or blame determines how difficult the task is that lies before him. As Aristotle reminds the reader, "[F]or as Socrates used to say, it is not difficult to praise Athenians in Athens" (''Rhetoric'',1367b).&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''On Rhetoric'' Trans. by George A. Kennedy. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to [[Aristotle]]’s conception of epideixis, “the present is the most important; for all speakers praise or blame in regard to existing qualities, but they often make use of other things, both reminding [the audience] of the past and projecting the course of the future” (''Rhet.'' 1358b). Epideixis is Aristotle’s least favored and clearly defined topic.  Now considered to be the stuff of ceremonies with its exhortations, [[panegyric]]s, [[encomia]], funeral orations and displays of oratorical prowess, epideictic rhetoric appears to most to be discourse less about depth and more attuned to style without substance. Still, the ''Art of Rhetoric'' is cited as an example of epideictic  work (Lockwood, 1996).

Epideixis may not deserve the charge of lacking depth. The charge that this branch of rhetoric lacks depth can be countered by the recognition that it systematizes the successful attribution of [[value (ethics)|value]] (to things, people, or concepts). Attributing value (whether in terms of "the good" and "the bad" or of "virtue" and "vice") to 1) perception, 2) emotions, 3) thought, 4) action, and 5) goals is the fundamental basis of relativistic conceptions of 1) [[aesthetics]], 2) human [[Sociology of emotions|character]], 3) [[intelligence]], 4) [[ethics]], and 5) [[wisdom]]. For instance, applying epideixis to 'human perceptions' yields [[aesthetics]], and its application to 'human action' yields fundamental relativistic [[ethics]]. Nevertheless, epideixis can always be reduced to simply the study of how best to preach the positive or negative characteristics of creatures, contraptions, concepts (etc.) to an audience. Epideictic rhetoric appeals to - and serves to sway - personal and cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], whereas pure deliberative and judicial rhetoric appeal to reason alone.

And, Lockwood,  also in ''Reader's Figure'',  describes how readers are figured by their readings, and how readers figure their readings, and that readers can accept the readers' account, and forget  their  own account  of their present and past,   and that the rhetor's account is  produced by language.{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}

== Modern authors on epideixis ==
For centuries, epideictic [[Public speaking|oratory]] was a contested term, for it is clearly present in both forensic and deliberative forms, but it is difficult to clarify when it appears as a dominant discursive form. According to [[Chaïm Perelman]] and Lucy Olbrechts-Tyteca, “The speaker engaged in epidictic discourse is very close to being an [[educator]]. Since what he is going to say does not arouse [[controversy]], since no immediate practical interest is ever involved, and there is no question of attacking or defending, but simply of promoting values that are shared in the community . . .” (52).&lt;ref&gt;Chaïm Perelman, Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, ''The new rhetoric: a treatise on argumentation'', University of Notre Dame Press, 1969, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  
Some of the defining terms for epideictic discourse include declamation, demonstration, praise or blame of the personal, and pleasing or inspiring to an audience.  

Lawrence W. Rosenfield contends that epideictic practice surpasses mere praise and blame, and it is more than a showy display of rhetorical skill: “Epideictic’s understanding calls upon us to join with our community in giving thought to what we witness, and such thoughtful beholding in commemoration constitutes memorializing” (133){{fcn|date=September 2018}}. Epideictic rhetoric also calls for witnessing events, acknowledging temporality and contingency (140).  However, as Rosenfield suspects, it is an uncommon form of [[discourse]] because of the rarity of “its necessary constituents — openness of mind, felt reverence for reality, enthusiasm for life, the ability to congeal significant experiences in memorable language . . .” (150).

The philologist [[Ernst Curtius]] provides an account of its history, and many examples, in ''[[European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages]]''. Praise and blame were "reduced" to praise by  Aristotle, he wrote; and recently another author called it a "blameless genre". He and Lockwood seem to say that what was in the past called rhetoric was later called literature. Curtius believed that misinterpretations  of [[medieval literature]] occur because so much of it is epideictic, and the epideictic is so alien to us today. During the Middle Ages it became a "school subject" as the sites for political activity diminished in the West, and as the centuries went on the word "praise" came to mean that which was written. During this period literature (more specifically histories, biographies, autobiographies, geographies) were called praise(s).

[[Ben Witherington III]], writing from a biblical perspective on sacred exhortation, noted that "in general, epideictic rhetoric is highly emotional and meant to inspire the audience to appreciate something or someone, or at the other end of the spectrum, despise something or someone.  Epideictic rhetoric seeks to charm or, to cast odium." - I &amp; II Thessalonians: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary &lt;ref&gt;Ben Witherington III, I &amp; II Thessalonians: A Socio-Rhetorical Commentary - [http://libraryofrhetoric.org/lor/?page_id=90 More Quotes on Epideixis]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In poetry==
Epideictic writing in [[Chinese poetry|poetry]] is often associated with the [[Fu (poetry)|''fu'' rhapsody]] that developed in the early [[Han Dynasty]].

'''Folk etymology''' or '''reanalysis''' – sometimes called '''pseudo-etymology''', '''popular etymology''', or '''analogical reformation''' – is a change in a word or phrase resulting from the replacement of an unfamiliar form by a more familiar one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |folk-etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sihler2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sihler|first=Andrew|title=Language History: An introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BXlAYlCSoZQC|year=2000|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-8546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trask2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Trask|first=Robert Lawrence|authorlink=Larry Trask|title=The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EHeGzQ8wuLQC|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-218-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form or the meaning of an archaic, foreign, or otherwise unfamiliar word is reanalyzed as resembling more familiar words or [[morpheme]]s. [[Rebracketing]] is a form of folk etymology in which a word is broken down or "bracketed" into a new set of supposed elements. [[Back-formation]], creating a new word by removing or changing parts of an existing word, is often based on folk etymology.

The term ''folk etymology'' is a [[loan translation]] from [[German language|German]] '''''Volksetymologie''''', coined by  [[Ernst Förstemann]] in 1852.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Förstemann|first=Ernst|editor=Adalbert Kuhn|title=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete des Deutschen, Griechischen und Lateinischen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kMNAAAAYAAJ|year=1852|publisher=F. Dümmler.|chapter=Ueber Deutsche volksetymologie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folk etymology is a [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] process in [[historical linguistics]], [[language change]], and [[social relation|social interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g.[http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/ENGINEERING.pdf ''''Etymythological''' Othering' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]] in ''Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion'' (2006), ed. by Tope Omoniyi &amp; [[Joshua A. Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–258.&lt;/ref&gt; Reanalysis of a word's history or original form can affect its spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. This is frequently seen in relation to [[loanword]]s or words that have become archaic or obsolete.

Examples of words created or changed through folk etymology include the English dialectal form [[wikt:sparrowgrass|''sparrowgrass'']], originally from Greek {{lang|el|ἀσπάραγος}} ("[[asparagus]]") remade by analogy to the more familiar words ''sparrow'' and ''grass'',&lt;ref name="Anttila1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anttila|first=Raimo|title=Historical and Comparative Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2C25_9m7U-AC|year=1989|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=90-272-3556-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the word ''[[hamburger|burger]]'', originally from ''[[Hamburg]]'' + ''-er'' ("thing connected with"), but understood as ''ham'' + ''burger''.&lt;ref name="Shukla"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shukla|first1=Shaligram|last2=Connor-Linton|first2=Jeff|editor=R. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton|title=An Introduction to Language and Linguistics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlzthEZGkmsC|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84768-1|chapter=Language change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Productive force ==
The technical term "folk etymology" refers to a change in the form of a word caused by erroneous popular beliefs about its etymology. The English word is a translation of the [[German language|German]] term ''Volksetymologie'', coined by [[Ernst Förstemann]]. Förstemann noted that in addition to scientific etymology based on careful study in [[philology]], there exist scholarly but often unsystematic accounts, as well as popular accounts for the history of linguistic forms.&lt;ref name="Forstemann"/&gt; Until academic linguists developed comparative philology and described the laws underlying [[sound changes]], the derivation of words was a matter mostly of guess-work. Speculation about the original form of words in turn feeds back into the development of the word and thus becomes a part of a new etymology.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Etymology|volume=9|pages=864-865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Believing a word to have a certain origin, people begin to pronounce, spell, or otherwise use the word in a manner appropriate to that perceived origin.  This popular etymologizing has had a powerful influence on the forms which words take. Examples in English include ''[[crayfish]]'' or ''crawfish'', which are not historically related to ''fish'' but come from [[Middle English]] ''crevis'', [[cognate]] with French ''écrevisse''. Likewise ''chaise lounge'', from the original French ''chaise longue'' ("long chair"), has come to be associated with the word ''lounge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pyles |first1=Thomas |last2=Algeo |first2=John |title=The Origins and Development of the English Language |edition=4th |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|isbn=0030970547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==
{{further|Rebracketing|Back-formation}}
[[Rebracketing]] is a process of [[language change]] in which parts of a word that appear to be meaningful (such as *''ham'' in ''hamburger'') are mistaken as elements of the word's etymology (in this case, the word ''[[ham]]''). Rebracketing functions by reanalyzing the constituent parts of a word. For example, the [[Old French]] word ''orenge'' ("orange tree") comes from [[Arabic]] {{lang|ar|rtl=yes|النرنج }} ''an nāranj'' ("the orange tree"), with the initial ''n'' of ''nāranj'' understood as part of the [[Article (grammar)|article]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 2013 | title = orange ''n''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''adj''.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary online | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | url =http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/132163 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[back-formation]] a new word is created, often by removing elements thought to be [[affix]]es. For example, [[Italian language|Italian]] ''pronuncia'' ("pronunciation; accent") is derived from the verb ''pronunciare'' ("to pronounce; to utter") and English ''edit'' derives from ''editor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|title=Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-5675-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases of back-formation are based on folk etymology.&lt;ref name="Shukla" /&gt;

== Examples in English ==
In linguistic change caused by folk etymology, the form of a word changes so that it better matches its popular rationalisation.  Typically this happens either to unanalyzable foreign words or to compounds where the word underlying one part of the compound becomes obsolete.

=== Loanwords ===
There are many examples of words borrowed from foreign languages, and subsequently changed by folk etymology.

The spelling of many borrowed words reflects folk etymology. For example, ''[[Wikt:andiron|andiron]]'' borrowed from Old French was variously spelled ''aundyre'' or ''aundiren'' in Middle English, but was altered by association with ''iron''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|andiron, n.|year=1884}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Old French loans altered in a similar manner include ''[[belfry (architecture)|belfry]]'' (from ''berfrei'') by association with ''bell'', ''female'' (from ''femelle'') by ''male'', and ''penthouse'' (from ''apentis'') by ''house''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The variant spelling of ''licorice'' as ''[[wikt:liquorice|liquorice]]'' comes from the supposition that it has something to do with liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology |last=Barnhart |first=Robert K. |editor-link=[[Robert Barnhart]] |year=1988 |publisher=H.W. Wilson |isbn=978-0-8242-0745-8|page=593|quote=The development of Late Latin ''liquiritia'' was in part influenced by Latin ''liquēre'' 'to flow', in reference to the process of treating the root to obtain its extract.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Norman ''licoris'' (influenced by ''licor'' "liquor") and [[Late Latin]] ''liquirītia'' were respelled for similar reasons, though the ultimate origin of all three is Greek ''{{lang|he|γλυκύρριζα}}'' (glycyrrhiza) "sweet root".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1|liquorice licorice, n.|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of loan words can affect their spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. The word ''cockroach'', for example, was borrowed from Spanish ''cucaracha'' but was assimilated to the existing English words ''cock'' and ''[[Common Roach|roach]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|cockroach, n.|year=1891}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jerusalem artichoke]]'', from Italian ''girasole'', is a kind of sunflower; it is not related to [[artichoke]]s and does not come from Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Artichoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''forlorn hope'' originally meant "storming party, body of skirmishers"&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, Lesley (ed.). 2002. ''Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', vol. 1, A–M. 5th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 1600.&lt;/ref&gt; from Dutch ''verloren hoop'' "lost troop". But confusion with English ''hope'' has given the term an additional meaning of "hopeless venture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|forlorn hope, n.|year=1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes imaginative stories are created to account for the link between a borrowed word and its popularly assumed sources. The names of the ''[[serviceberry]]'', ''service tree'', and related plants, for instance, come from the Latin name ''[[sorbus]]''. The plants were called ''syrfe'' in Old English, which eventually became ''service''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|serve, n1|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fanciful stories suggest that the name comes from the fact that the trees bloom in spring, a time when circuit-riding preachers resume church services or when funeral services are carried out for people who died during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Small|first=Ernest|title=North American Cornucopia: Top 100 Indigenous Food Plants|year=2013|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-8594-2|page=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A seemingly plausible but no less speculative etymology accounts for the form of ''[[Welsh rarebit]]'', a dish made of cheese and toasted bread. The earliest known reference to the dish in 1725 called it ''Welsh rabbit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrom|first=John|title=The Private Journal and Literary Remains of John Byrom|year=1854|publisher=Chetham society|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of that name is unknown, but presumably humorous, since the dish contains no rabbit. In 1785 [[Francis Grose]] suggested in ''A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' that the dish is "a Welch rare bit",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grose|first=Francis|title=A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue|year=1785|publisher=S. Hooper|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RyVKAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the word ''rarebit'' was not common prior to Grose's dictionary. Both versions of the name are in current use; individuals sometimes express strong opinions concerning which version is correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Welsh rabbit, Welsh rarebit|encyclopedia=Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|page=952|year=1994|isbn=978-0-87779-132-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obsolete forms ===
When a word or other form becomes obsolete, words or phrases containing the obsolete portion may be reanalyzed and changed.

Some [[compound word]]s from [[Old English]] were reanalyzed in Middle or Modern English when one of the constituent words fell out of use. Examples include ''[[wikt:bridegroom|bridegroom]]'' from Old English ''[[wikt:brydguma|brydguma]]'' "bride-man". The word ''[[wikt:gome|gome]]'' "man" from Old English ''[[wikt:guma|guma]]'' fell out of use during the sixteenth century and the compound was eventually reanalyzed with the Modern English word ''[[wikt:groom|groom]]'' "male servant".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Groom}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar reanalysis caused ''[[wikt:sandblind|sandblind]]'', from Old English ''sāmblind'' "half-blind" with a once-common prefix ''sām-'' "semi-", to be respelled as though it is related to ''sand''. The word ''island'' derives from Old English ''igland''. The modern spelling with the letter ''s'' is the result of comparison with the synonym ''[[wikt:isle|isle]]'' from Old French and ultimately Latin ''insula'', though the Old French and Old English words are not historically related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|title=A Dictionary of English Etymology: E - P|year=1862|publisher=Trübner|page=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the spelling of ''[[wikt:wormwood|wormwood]]'' was likely affected by comparison with ''wood''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|wormwood|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smythe Palmer|first=Abram|title=Folk-etymology: A Dictionary of Verbal Corruptions Or Words Perverted in Form Or Meaning, by False Derivation Or Mistaken Analogy|year=1882|publisher=Johnson Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|449}}

The phrase ''[[wikt:curry favor|curry favour]]'', meaning to flatter, comes from Middle English ''curry favel'', "[[horse grooming|groom]] a [[chestnut horse]]". This was an [[allusion]] to a fourteenth century French morality poem, ''Roman de Fauvel'', about a chestnut-colored horse who corrupts men through duplicity. The phrase was reanalyzed in early Modern English by comparison to ''favour'' as early as 1510.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Gary|year=2017|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: 'Curry favour'|work=Phrase Finder|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/curry-favour.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words need not completely disappear before their compounds are reanalyzed. The word ''[[wikt:shamefaced|shamefaced]]'' was originally ''[[wikt:shamefast|shamefast]]''. The original meaning of ''fast'' "fixed in place" still exists but mainly in frozen expressions such as ''stuck fast'', ''hold fast'', and ''[[wikt:play fast and loose|play fast and loose]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The songbird ''[[wheatear]]'' or ''white-ear'' is a back-formation from Middle English ''whit-ers'' "white arse", referring to the prominent white rump found in most species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=White-ear|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/white%E2%80%93ear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both ''white'' and ''arse'' are common in Modern English, the folk etymology may be [[euphemism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Wheatear |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wheatear |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reanalysis of archaic or obsolete forms can lead to changes in meaning as well. The original meaning of ''[[hangnail]]'' referred to a [[Corn (medicine)|corn]] on the foot.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=hangnail|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hangnail |encyclopedia=Merriam Webster Online|accessdate=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from Old English ''[[wikt:ang-|ang-]]'' + ''[[wikt:nægel|nægel]]'' ("anguished nail" or "compressed spike"), but the spelling and pronunciation were affected by folk etymology in the seventeenth century or earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|hangnail|accessdate=2017-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the word came to be used for a tag of skin or torn [[cuticle]] near a [[fingernail]] or toenail.&lt;ref name="MW-hangnail" /&gt;

== Other languages ==

Several words in [[Medieval Latin]] were subject to folk etymology. For example, the word ''widerdonum'' meaning "reward" was borrowed from [[Old High German]] ''widarlōn'' "repayment of a loan". The ''l{{nbsp}}→{{nbsp}}d'' alteration is due to confusion with Latin ''donum'' "gift".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED1 |guerdon|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|157}} Similarly, the word ''baceler'' or ''bacheler'' (related to modern English [[Bachelor#Etymology and historical meanings|''bachelor'']]) referred to a junior knight. It is attested from the eleventh century, though its ultimate origin is uncertain. By the late Middle Ages its meaning was extended to the holder of a university degree inferior to master or doctor.  This was later re-spelled ''baccalaureus'', probably reflecting a false derivation from ''bacca laurea'' "laurel berry", alluding to the possible laurel crown of a poet or conqueror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brachet|first=Auguste|title=An Etymological Dictionary of the French Language: Crowned by the French Academy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TvENAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA354|year=1882|publisher=Clarendon Press|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}}

In the fourteenth or fifteenth century French scholars began to spell the verb ''savoir'' ("to know") as ''sçavoir'' on the false belief it was derived from Latin ''scire'' "to know".  In fact it comes from ''sapere'' "to be wise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singleton|first=David|title=Language and the Lexicon: An Introduction|year=2016|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-83594-3|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian word ''liocorno'' "unicorn" derives from 13th century ''lunicorno'' (''lo'' "the" + ''unicorno'' "unicorn"). Folk etymology based on ''lione'' "lion" altered the spelling and pronunciation. Dialectal ''liofante'' "elephant" was likewise altered from ''elefante'' by association with ''lione''.&lt;ref name="Smythe Palmer" /&gt;{{rp|486}}

The [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "[[hammock]]" is ''hangmat''. It was borrowed from Spanish ''hamaca'' (ultimately from [[Arawak language|Arawak]] ''amàca'') and altered by comparison with ''hangen'' and ''mat'', "hanging mat". German ''Hängematte'' shares this folk etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hängematte|work=Wörterbuch Deutsch|url=http://en.worterbuchdeutsch.com/de/hangematte |date=October 2016|accessdate=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] compound word for "jealous" ''mustasukkainen'' literally means "black-socked" (''musta'' "black" and ''sukka'' "sock"). However, the word is a case of a misunderstood loan translation from Swedish ''svartsjuk'' "black-sick". The Finnish word ''sukka'' fit with a close phonological equivalent to the Swedish ''sjuk''

''[[Names of Istanbul#Islambol|Islambol]]'', a folk etymology meaning "full of Islam", is one of the names of [[Istanbul]] used after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of 1453.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Necdet Sakaoğlu|title=Dünden bugüne İstanbul ansiklopedisi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t51PAQAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=Kültür Bakanlığı|language=tr|isbn=978-975-7306-04-7|pages=253–255|chapter=İstanbul'un adları}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|type=Turkish-language|date=February 2017}}

An example from [[Persian language|Persian]] is the word [[shatranj]] (chess), which is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] [[chaturanga]] (2nd century BCE), and after losing the "u" to [[Syncope (phonetics)|syncope]], becomes ''chatrang'' in [[Middle Persian]] (6th century CE). Today it is sometimes factorized as ''shat'' (hundred) + ''ranj'' (worry / mood), or "a hundred worries".{{citation needed|reason=is this analysis the reason for the segmental change, or is that just passage through Arabic?|date=October 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13731">'''Genre criticism''', a method within [[rhetorical criticism]], analyzes texts in terms of their genre: the set of generic expectations, conventions, and constraints that guide their production and interpretation. In [[rhetoric]], the theory of [[genre]] provides a means to classify and compare artifacts in terms of their formal, substantive and contextual features. By grouping artifacts with others which have similar formal features or rhetorical exigencies, rhetorical critics can shed light on how authors use or flout conventions for their own purposes. Genre criticism has thus become one of the main methodologies within rhetorical criticism. 

Literary critics have used the concepts of genres to classify speeches and works of literature since the time of [[Aristotle]], who distinguished three rhetorical genres: the [[Forensic rhetoric | legal or judicial]], the [[Deliberative rhetoric | deliberative]] or political, and the ceremonial or [[epideictic]].  Since then, rhetorical approaches to genre and understanding of the term "genre" have evolved in several ways. New genres have been studied for their rhetorical effectiveness - like sermons, letters, and (more recently) non-verbal genres like political cartoons, film, and public monuments.  Further contemporary genre criticism has revised understanding of genre in several ways. The first [[turn (disambiguation) | turn]], represented by [[Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin]] (1895-1975), among others, focused on the formal features of communication. The second turn, represented by Carolyn Miller, among others, focused on recurring socio-cultural circumstances. In the latest turn, critics have begun applying formalist and socio-cultural concepts to [[new media | new-media]] artifacts that tend to resist classification into traditional genre-categories.

The first group of rhetorical critics, following the example of theorists like [[M. M. Bakhtin]], used formal features to analyze texts. For these critics, language is formed through a series of utterances that reflect specific conditions and goals of certain linguistic aspects. These aspects include thematic content, style, and compositional structure which form speech genres. Speech genres are diverse because of the various possibilities of human activity. In "The Problem of Speech Genres" (1986), Mikhail Bakhtin draws attention to the very significant difference between primary (simple) and secondary (complex) speech genres.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, M. M. (1986). [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LO_agE_GTcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Problem of Speech Genres"]. ''Speech genres and other late essays''. Trans. V. W. McGee. University of Texas Press. p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bahktin, primary speech genres form secondary speech genres and examples of secondary speech genres include novels, dramas, all kinds of scientific research, and major genres of commentary. Since these secondary genres involve complex and comparatively highly developed and organized cultural communication that is artistic and scientific, they absorb and digest various primary genres that have taken form in mediated speech communion. Bakhtin continues to explain that there are three factors of the whole utterance which include semantic exhaustiveness of the theme, the speaker’s plan or speech will, and the typical compositional and generic forms of finalization.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, ''Speech genres and other late essays'', p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; The first factor refers to the way utterances are used within speech which is linked to the second factor of how the speaker determines to use the utterance.The third factor explains that all our utterances have definite and stable typical forms of construction, but that these forms can change when needed. As Bahktin writes, "These genres are so diverse because they differ depending on the situation, social position, and personal interrelations of the participants in the communication".&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, ''Speech genres and other late essays'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical approaches to genre==
The word “[[genre]]” is derived from the [[Latin]] term ''genus'', to mean “kind”, “class” or "sort".

[[Aristotle]] was one of the first scholars to develop a rhetorical approach to genre. He divided the art of rhetoric into three genres: [[deliberative]], [[forensic]], and [[epideictic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, F.I (1995). "The Rhetoric of Aristotle". ''A Synoptic History of Classical Rhetoric'' (2nd rev. ed.), Davis, CA. Hermagoras Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The deliberative genre of rhetoric involves speeches or writing meant to persuade an audience to take action. Deliberative rhetoric thus includes rhetoric that is used for political persuasion, discusses matters of public policy in order to determine what is advantageous or disadvantageous, and is usually concerned with the future. Rhetoric of the [[forensic]] genre questions guilt or innocence, is concerned with legalities, and concentrates on events that occurred in the past. The [[epideictic]] genre of rhetoric encompasses all rhetoric used for ceremonial and commemorative purposes. Epideictic rhetoric praises and blames, acknowledging that which is noble or shameful, honorable or dishonorable. 

The [[rhetorical situation]] is a concept important for understanding rhetorical approaches to genre and the creation of new genres.&lt;ref&gt;Bitzer, L.F. (1968). "The rhetorical situation". ''Philosophy and Rhetoric'', vol. 1, pp. 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Campaign speeches are an example of how rhetorical situations recur, producing sedimented genres. As a result of the institutions that execute the [[U.S. Constitution]], every four years at the time of presidential elections, candidates deliver campaign speeches. Campaign speeches have become a distinct genre because they respond to highly similar situations that recur because of a structural or institutional basis.

U.S. rhetoricians [[Karlyn Kohrs Campbell]] and [[Kathleen Hall Jamieson]] refer to genre as a “constellation of elements."&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"&gt;Karlyn Kohrs Campbell and Kathleen Hall Jamieson (1978), ''Form and Genre: Shaping Rhetorical Action''. The Speech Communication Association. Falls Church, VA. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; They say, “A genre is a group of acts unified by a constellation of forms that recurs in each of its members.” Genres are formed when examined constituents are similar. The metaphors of genres as “constellations” serves to explain how genres, like constellations of stars, are constructed of individual members, but are under the influence of each other and outside elements. As a result they move together and remain in a similar relation to each other despite their ever-changing positions.&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"/&gt; According to Campbell and Jamieson, “when a generic claim is made, the critical situation alters significantly because the critic is now arguing that a group of discourses has a synthetic core in which certain significant rhetorical elements, e.g., a system of belief, lines of argument, stylistic choices, and the perception of the situation, are fused into an indivisible whole".&lt;ref name="Kathleen Hall Jamieson 1978"/&gt;

Many contemporary scholars refer to the fusion of traits from different genres in speeches and texts as a "generic [[Hybrid genre|hybrid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Jamieson, K.M.; Campbell, K.K. (1982). "Rhetorical hybrids: "'Fusion of generic elements'". ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (68), pp. 146-157.&lt;/ref&gt; These generic hybrids can be formed from a blend of the three rhetorical genres.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'', (Trans. W.R. Roberts, 1954), New York: Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept can be explained through an example of a generic hybrid of deliberative and epideictic elements, in which a newly elected President delivers an inaugural address. The President is speaking at a formal ceremony recognizing the current state of the nation (characteristic of the epideictic genre), while simultaneously announcing his policy plans for the upcoming four years. 

U.S. rhetorician Carolyn R. Miller is the author of the article "Genre as Social Action" (1984). She argues, “Rhetorical criticism has not provided firm guidance on what constitutes a genre” and a “rhetorically sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish.” &lt;ref name="Miller 1984"&gt; Miller, C. R. (1984). "Genre as social action." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (70), pp. 151-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also argues that new media genres may develop and formalize more quickly than traditional, written genres. She is among other rhetoricians who have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of traditional genre theory for new media communication. They argue that because genre theory originally was developed for describing written texts, the theory should be modified to account for nonlinguistic communication. Miller and colleague Dawn Shepherd illustrate an example of applying socio-cultural theories to genre studies in "Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog". They explain how the weblog may be establishing a new genre because of its integration of current social and cultural trends.&lt;ref name ="blogging"&gt;Miller, C. R.; Shepherd, D.(2004). [http://blog.lib.umn.edu/blogosphere/blogging_as_social_action.html "Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog"], Into the Blogosphere. Retrieved 10 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socio-cultural approach to genre studies==
In the 1980s, scholarship in genre theory and criticism has turned towards a socio-cultural approach to the study of genre by actively interrogating the rhetorical situation of a given communication artifact in light of its particular generic form. In this mode of inquiry, the rhetorical artifact is examined as a social response to a set of recurrent rhetorical exigencies rather than a collection of formal, generic elements. In the rhetorical tradition of genre criticism, Carolyn R. Miller's work on the socio-cultural approach to genre theory has been influential. Again in her 1984 journal article, Miller argues that “rhetorical criticism has not provided firm guidance on what constitutes a genre” and that a “rhetorically sound definition of genre must be centered not on the substance or the form of discourse but on the action it is used to accomplish”.&lt;ref name="Miller 1984"/&gt; Later, when Miller and Shepherd engaged the socio-cultural approach to genre criticism in “Blogging as Social Action: A Genre Analysis of the Weblog” (2004), they exposed some of the difficulties of applying genre theory to new media. In their analysis, Miller and Shepherd examine the extent to which the weblog might constitute a genre in light of its interaction with current social and cultural trends.

==Genres studies in new media==
Recently scholars and researchers in [[rhetoric]], [[linguistics]], and [[information sciences]] have begun to explore the relationships between new media and socio-contextual genre theories (like those of Carolyn Miller, Mikhail Bakhtin, and Charles Bazerman). These researchers have expressed concerns about the appropriateness of traditional genre theory for new media communication. Some scholars have argued that since genre theory was originally developed to describe written texts, the theory needs to be modified to account for nonlinguistic communication. Linguist and semiotician Gunter Kress suggested that much of the vocabulary of generic analysis is ill-equipped to address non-written communication, arguing that “there are no genre terms for describing what [a] drawing is or does…” &lt;ref&gt;Kress, G. &amp; Van Leeuwen, T (1996). ''Multimodal Discourse''. London: Routledge. p.110.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, rhetoricians Miller and Shepherd have argued that traditional written genre theory does not appropriately address the visual features of a genre’s format.&lt;ref name="blogging"/&gt;

Rhetoricians and [[Information science|information scientists]] have also pointed out that new media genres may develop and formalize more quickly than traditional written genres. The authors of the article "Genres and the web" argue that the personal home page is functioning as a new and discrete genre, and they explore the entirely digital nature of home pages, suggesting that home pages “have no obvious paper equivalent”.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Andrew; Gushrowski, Barbara A. (2000). "Genres and the web: Is the personal home page the first uniquely digital genre?" ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science]]'', 51(2), pp. 202-205.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally recent work in new media genre theory has explored how new communication technologies allows for forms of “genre [[hybridity]].” Spinuzzi, for example, explores what can happen when multiple related genres are [[Remediation (Marxist theory)|remediated]] into a single new media artifact.&lt;ref name="Clay Spinuzzi 2003"&gt;Spinuzzi, C. (2003). ''Tracing genres through organizations: A sociocultural approach to information design''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saxo original 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A gloss is a marginal notation regarding the main text in a document. Shown is a parchment page from the Royal Library of Copenhagen.]]
A '''gloss''' ({{ety|la|glossa}}; {{ety|gre|''γλῶσσα'' glōssa|language}}) is a brief notation, especially a [[marginalia|marginal]] one or an [[interlinear gloss|interlinear]] one, of the meaning of a word or wording in a text. It may be in the language of the text, or in the reader's language if that is different. 

A collection of glosses is a ''[[glossary]].'' A collection of medieval legal glosses, made by [[glossators]], is called an ''apparatus''. The compilation of glosses into glossaries was the beginning of [[lexicography]], and the glossaries so compiled were in fact the first [[dictionary|dictionaries]]. In modern times a glossary, as opposed to a dictionary, is typically found in a text as an appendix of specialized terms that the typical reader may find unfamiliar. Also, satirical explanations of words and events are called glosses. The [[German Romanticism|German Romantic movement]] used the expression of gloss for poems commenting on a given other piece of poetry, often in the Spanish [[Décima]] style. 

Glosses were originally notes made in the margin or between the lines of a text in a [[classical language]]; the meaning of a word or passage is explained by the gloss. As such, glosses vary in thoroughness and complexity, from simple marginal notations of words one reader found difficult or obscure, to interlinear [[translation]]s of a text with cross references to similar passages. Today [[bracket#Parentheses|parenthetical]] explanations in [[scientific writing]] and [[technical writing]] are also often called glosses. [[Hyperlink]]s to a [[glossary]] sometimes supersede them.

==Etymology==
The word "gloss" was first used in the 1570s to refer to the insertion of a word as an explanation. It began to be used to mean to "explain away" in the 1630s, and originated from the concept of a note being inserted in the margin of a text to explain a difficult word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.etymonline.com/word/gloss|title=Gloss|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In theology==
{{Main|Biblical gloss}}
Glosses and other marginal notes were a primary format used in medieval Biblical [[theology]], and were studied and memorized for their own merit. Many Biblical passages came to be associated with a particular gloss, whose truth was taken to be scriptural. Indeed, in one case, it is generally reckoned that an early gloss explicating the doctrine of the Trinity made its way into the Scriptural text itself, in the passage known as the "three heavenly witnesses" or the ''[[Comma Johanneum]]'', which is present in the Vulgate Latin and the third and later editions of the Greek [[Textus Receptus]] collated by Erasmus (the first two editions excluded it for lack of manuscript evidence), but is absent from all modern critical reconstructions of the New Testament text, such as [[Westcott and Hort]], [[Tischendorf]], and [[Nestle-Aland]].

==In law==
{{See also|Glossator}}
In the medieval legal tradition, the glosses on [[Roman law]] and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] created standards of reference, so-called ''sedes materiae'' (literally: seat of the matter). In [[common law]] countries, the term "judicial gloss" refers to what is considered an authoritative or "official" [[Statutory interpretation|interpretation]] of a statute or regulation by a [[judge]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 7th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Judicial glosses are often very important in avoiding contradictions between statutes, and determining the [[constitutionality]] of various provisions of law.

==In literature==
A gloss, or ''glosa'', is a verse in traditional [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] literature and music which follows and comments on a refrain (the "''mote''"). See also [[villancico]].

==In philology==
[[Image:Codiceemil.jpg|thumb|The [[Glosas Emilianenses]] are glosses added to this Latin codex that are now considered the first phrases written in the [[Castilian language]].]]
Glosses are of some importance in [[philology]], especially if one language&amp;mdash;usually, the language of the author of the gloss&amp;mdash;has left few texts of its own. The [[Reichenau Glosses]], for example, gloss the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] [[Bible]] in an early form of one of the [[Romance languages]], and as such give insight into late [[Vulgar Latin]] at a time when that language was not often written down. A series of glosses in the [[Old English language]] to Latin Bibles give us a running translation of Biblical texts in that language; see ''[[Old English Bible translations]]''. Glosses of Christian religious texts are also important for our knowledge of [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]]. Glosses frequently shed valuable light on the vocabulary of otherwise little attested languages; they are less reliable for [[syntax]], because many times the glosses follow the word order of the original text, and translate its [[idiom]]s literally.

==In linguistics{{anchor|In linguistics}}==
{{Main|Interlinear gloss}}
In [[linguistics]], a simple gloss in running text may be marked by quotation marks and follow the transcription of a foreign word. Single quotes are a widely used convention.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Lyle. 2004. ''Historical Linguistics: An Introduction''. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; For example: 

* A [[Cossack]] longboat is called a ''chaika'' 'seagull'.
* The [[moose]] gains its name from the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] ''mus'' or ''mooz'' ('twig eater').

A longer or more complex transcription may rely upon an ''[[interlinear gloss]]''.  Such a gloss may be placed between a [[text corpus|text]] and its translation when it is important to understand the structure of the language being glossed, and not just the overall meaning of the passage.

===Glossing sign languages{{anchor|Glossing signed languages}}{{anchor|Glossing sign languages}}===
[[Sign language]]s are typically transcribed word-for-word by means of a gloss written in the predominant oral language in all capitals; [[American Sign Language]] and [[Auslan]] would be written in English. [[Prosody (linguistics)|Prosody]] is often glossed as superscript words, with its scope indicated by brackets. 

{{quotation|[I LIKE]&lt;sup&gt;NEGATIVE&lt;/sup&gt; [WHAT?]&lt;sup&gt;RHETORICAL&lt;/sup&gt;, GARLIC.
&lt;br&gt;"I don't like garlic."}}

Pure [[fingerspelling]] is usually indicated by hyphenation.  Fingerspelled words that have been lexicalized (that is, fingerspelling sequences that have entered the sign language as linguistic units and that often have slight modifications) are indicated with a hash.  For example, ''W-I-K-I'' indicates a simple fingerspelled word, but ''#JOB'' indicates a lexicalized unit, produced like ''J-O-B'', but faster, with a barely perceptible ''O'' and turning the "B" hand palm side in, unlike a regularly fingerspelled "B".

[[File:Venus de Milo Louvre Ma399 n4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Venus de Milo]] on display at the [[Louvre]].]]

The '''history of art criticism''', as part of art history, is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts, i.e. [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]], which include aesthetic considerations.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the "major" arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture as well as the "minor" arts of ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.

As a term, the history of art history (also [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying and assessing the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, the history of art criticism is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement from the standpoint of its history and of its major scholars. It is also distinguished from [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and How did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. Unfortunately the current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of art criticism is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. The history of art criticism often roots its studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. It attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
The history of art criticism as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians, in performing their assessment within the history of art criticism,  employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Practitioners of art criticism often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Practitioners of art criticism also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many practitioners of art criticism use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012). [https://www.academia.edu/1841926/Evocative_Research_in_Art_History_and_Beyond_Imagining_Possible_Pasts_in_the_Ways_to_Heaven_Project Evocative Research in Art History and Beyond: Imagining Possible Pasts in the Ways to Heaven Project], Digital Creativity, 23, 1, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of Prominent Methods==

===Pliny the Elder and ancient precedents===
The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history or art criticism are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/xenocrates.htm Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H.

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''. Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were "Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst, published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome (Fuseli published an English translation in 1765 under the title Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks), and Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums (History of Art in Antiquity), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyone Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Nochlin and feminism===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "Why have there been no great women artists?" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. In it she applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training. Nochlin argues that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields. The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success.[[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above. While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women.

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the [[Mona Lisa]]. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum Studies and Collecting===

Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New Materialism===

Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

[[Contemporary Art History]] refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Human Terrain System''' ('''HTS''') was a [[United States Army]], [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command|Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)]] support program employing personnel from the social science disciplines – such as [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[political science]], regional studies, and [[linguistics]] – to provide military commanders and staff with an understanding of the local population (i.e. the "human terrain") in the regions in which they are deployed.&lt;ref name="HTS website" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forte|first=Maximilian C.|authorlink=Maximilian Forte|title=The Human Terrain System and Anthropology: A Review of Ongoing Public Debates|journal=American Anthropologist|year=2011|volume=113|issue=1|pages=149–153|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1433.2010.01315.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;

The concept of HTS was first developed in a paper by [[Montgomery McFate]] and Andrea Jackson in 2005,&lt;ref name=McFate&amp;Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|author2=Andrea Jackson|title=An Organizational Solution for DODs Cultural Knowledge Needs|journal=Military Review|date=July–August 2005|pages=18–21|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/milreview/mcfate2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which proposed a pilot version of the project as a response to "identified gaps in [US military] commanders' and staffs' understanding of the local population and culture", such as became particularly visible during the US invasion of [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="HTS website" /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|author2=Steve Fondacaro|title=Reflections on the Human Terrain System During the First Four Years|journal=Prism|date=September 2011|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://www.ndu.edu/press/reflections-human-terrain-system.html|publisher=NDU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;  HTS was subsequently launched as a [[proof-of-concept]] program, run by the [[United States Army Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC), in February 2007, with five HTS teams deployed between Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; Since 2007, HTS has grown from a program with five deployed teams and a $20 million two-year budget to one with 31 deployed teams and a $150 million annual budget.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; HTS became a permanent US Army program in 2010.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

Ever since its launch, HTS has been surrounded by controversy.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fattahi|first=Kambiz|title=US Army enlists anthropologists|publisher=BBC News|date= 16 October 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/americas/7042090.stm|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schactman2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title='Human Terrain' Chief Ousted|publisher=Wired|date=15 June 2010|url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/06/human-terrain-chief-ousted/#more-26041|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the program initially received positive coverage in the US media, it quickly became the subject of heavy criticism – particularly from anthropologists, but also from journalists, military officials and HTS personnel and former personnel.&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt; Most notably, on 31 October 2007, the Executive Board of the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) published a statement opposing HTS as an "unacceptable application of anthropological expertise" that conflicted with the AAA's Code of Ethics.&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/pdf/EB_Resolution_110807.pdf American Anthropological Association’s Executive Board Statement on the Human Terrain System Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101015936/http://www.aaanet.org/pdf/EB_Resolution_110807.pdf |date=1 November 2012 }} American Anthropological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAstatement&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=Statement on HTS|url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/statement-on-HTS.cfm|publisher=AAA|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"/&gt; Following the publication of a report on HTS by the Commission on Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Services (CEAUSSIC) in 2009,&lt;ref name=Glenn&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glenn|first=David|title=Program to Embed Anthropologists with Military Lacks Ethical Standards, Report says|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=3 December 2009|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Program-to-Embed/49344/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|title=Panel Criticizes Military's Use of Embedded Anthropologists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/04/arts/04anthro.html|accessdate=22 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the AAA released a further statement of disapproval, which they re-iterated in 2012 after rumours that the controversy had died down.&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt;&lt;ref name=C41SR&gt;{{cite news|last=Albro|first=Robert|title=Comment: Do No Harm|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120425/C4ISR02/304250001/Commentary-8216-Do-no-harm-8217-?odyssey=mod%7Cnewswell|accessdate=16 June 2012|newspaper=C4ISR|date=April 2012|author2= Gusterson, Hugh|agency=Defense News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program evolved into a mechanism for supporting security force assistance. The program ended operations on September 30, 2014.

==Background==
In the most immediate sense, HTS was developed as a response to concerns about mismanagement of US military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and, in particular, to the negative effects of recognized "deficiencies" in US military "cultural understanding" of these countries. In 2006 the Human Terrain System was launched by the Pentagon, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalezA&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Roberto|title=Human Terrain: Past, Present and Future Applications|journal=Anthropology Today|date=February 2008|volume=24|issue=1|pages=21–26|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8322.2008.00561.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fawcett&gt;{{cite web|last=Fawcett|first=Grant S.|title=Cultural Understanding in Counterinsurgency: Analysis of the Human Terrain System|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA505497|publisher=Army Command and General Staff Coll Fort Leavenworth KS School of Advanced Military Studies|accessdate=18 June 2012|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, military analysts and academics have also suggested earlier historical contexts for the program's development.

===CORDS: a US military precedent===
A number of military officials have invoked [[Civil Operations and Rural Development Support]] (CORDS) – a counterinsurgency program developed by the US military during the [[Vietnam war]] – as a precedent for HTS.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilon"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilon|first=Juliana Geran|title=Cultural Intelligence for Winning the Peace|year=2009|publisher=[[The Institute of World Politics]] Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-9824888-0-7|pages=|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|144}}&lt;ref name=Burke&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Carol|title=Military Culture and Education|year=2010|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=9781409407577|pages=29–38 [32]|url=https://books.google.com/?id=56HiId0a84QC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=CORDS+vietnam+Human+Terrain+system+military#v=onepage&amp;q=CORDS%20vietnam%20Human%20Terrain%20system%20military&amp;f=false|editor=Douglass Higbee|accessdate=21 June 2012|chapter=Combat Ethnography}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a foundational article on HTS, a group of military analysts, Kipp ''et al'', described the program as "a CORDS for the 21st Century".&lt;ref name=Kipp&gt;{{cite web|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA457490|publisher=Defense Technology Information Center (DTIC)|accessdate=18 June 2012|author2=Lester Grau |author3=Karl Prinslow |author4=Don Smith |date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KippB&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century (full document)|journal=Military Review|date=September–October 2006|pages=8–15|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA457490|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MilitaryReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kipp|first=Jacob|title=Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century|volume=4|issue=11|date=September–October 2006|url=http://www.army.mil/professionalWriting/volumes/volume4/december_2006/12_06_2.html|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their article appraised CORDS as a successful and effective program that was "premised on a belief that the war would ultimately be won or lost not on the battlefield, but in the struggle for the loyalty of the people". Kipp ''et al'' contended that the only major problems with the CORDS program were that it lacked adequate [[Reachback#Defense usage|reachback]] facilities and that it "was started too late and ended too soon".  As such, they argued that it provided "many important lessons" to "guide" the development of HTS as an "effective cultural intelligence program" that could "support tactical and operational-level commanders today".&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;{{rp|10–11}} By contrast, critics of HTS have drawn attention to the fact that, in Vietnam, CORDS was run in conjunction with the [[Phoenix Program]], which used information gathered through CORDS in its effort to "neutralize" (by means of assassination, infiltration and capture) supporters of the [[Viet Cong]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burke /&gt;&lt;ref name=GonzalesInterview&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Counterinsurgency, Anthropology and Disciplinary Complicity|journal=Counterpunch|date=3 February 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/02/03/counterinsurgency-anthropology-and-disciplinary-complicity/|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the concept of "human terrain"===
The concept of "human terrain" has been defined in military documents pertaining to HTS as "the human population in the operational environment ... as defined and characterized by sociocultural, anthropologic and ethnographic data and other non-geographical information".&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;{{rp|15}} According to Roberto J. Gonzalez (Associate Professor of Anthropology at [[San Jose State University]], and one of the most vocal critics of HTS), this concept can be traced back to a 1968 report by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities|House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) about "the perceived threat of the [[Black Panthers]] and other militant groups".&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt; He argues that the concept gradually gained in popularity and usage, in the military and elsewhere, through the writing of military officials, such as [[Ralph Peters]], and pundits, such as [[Max Boot]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;

===History of anthropological engagement with the military===
Commentators on HTS have also drawn attention to the long history of anthropological involvement in military operations in the US and Europe, though for different reasons.  In a 2005 article, [[Montgomery McFate]] (HTS's Senior Social Scientist from 2007 to 2010, and an anthropologist by training) argued that anthropology was born as a "warfighting discipline", having served in its early history as "the handmaiden of colonialism".&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFate2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFate|first=Montgomery|title=Anthropology and counterinsurgency: the strange history of their curious relationship|journal=Military Review|date=March–April 2005|url=http://www.pratiquesciencessociales.net/upload/mcfate2005.pdf |accessdate=18 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813124239/http://www.pratiquesciencessociales.net/upload/mcfate2005.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suggested that anthropology had retreated "into the Ivory Tower" following the Vietnam war, and contended that anthropologists should become involved in developing "military applications of cultural knowledge". [[David Price (anthropologist)|David Price]] (Professor of anthropology and sociology at [[Saint Martin's University]]) also noted that anthropology and warfare have "merged" many times before, but argued that the difference with HTS was that the program had been "clearly identified" as involving activities that betrayed "basic ethical standards for protecting the interests and well-being of studied populations".&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Human Terrain Systems, Anthropologists and the War in Afghanistan|journal=Counterpunch|date=1 December 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/12/01/human-terrain-systems-anthropologists-and-the-war-in-afghanistan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil L Whitehead]] (Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]) likewise argued that the "collaboration" between anthropological theory and colonial practice was "nothing new", but went on to suggest that this history – and particularly recent developments such as HTS and the [[Minerva Initiative]] – should prompt a critical re-assessment and transformation of anthropological methodology.&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whitehead|first=Neil L.|title=Ethnography, Torture and the Human Terrain / Terror Systems|journal=Fast Capitalism|year=2009|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://www.uta.edu/huma/agger/fastcapitalism/5_2/Whitehead5_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The "cultural turn" in the US Army===
A number of commentators on HTS have described the program as part of a "[[cultural turn]]" in US military policy, particularly pertaining to the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=Derek|title=The Rush to the Intimate: Counterinsurgency and the Cultural Turn|journal=Radical Philosophy|date=July–August 2008|volume=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jager&gt;{{cite book|last=Jager|first=Sheila Miyoshi| authorlink = Sheila Miyoshi Jager| title=On the Uses of Cultural Knowledge|year=2007|publisher=Strategic Studies Institute|location=Washington|isbn=1-58487-330-2|pages=v|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub817.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gilmore&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilmore|first=Jonathon|title=A kinder, gentler counter-terrorism: counter-insurgency, human security and the War on Terror|journal=Security Dialogue|date=February 2011|volume=42|issue=1|pages=25–26|doi=10.1177/0967010610393390|url=http://sdi.sagepub.com/content/42/1/21.abstract|publisher=Sage|format=([[PDF]]), Restricted Access.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gusterson2010&gt;{{cite book|last=Gusterson|first=Hugh|title=Anthropology and Global Counterinsurgency|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-42994-6|pages=279–298|url=https://books.google.com/?id=du5kcfUuL9oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=cultural+turn+in+the+u+s+army#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20turn%20in%20the%20war%20on%20terror&amp;f=false|editor=John Kelly|chapter=The Cultural Turn in the War on Terror|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zehfuss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zehfuss|first=Maja|title=Culturally sensitive war?

== History and recent developments ==

===Chronological history of developments in HTS===
The beginnings of HTS can be traced to a pilot proposal for a "Pentagon Office of Operational Cultural Knowledge", published in 2005 by Montgomery McFate and Andrea Jackson.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In July 2005, the [[Foreign Military Studies Office]] (FMSO) initiated an HTS pilot project (named Cultural Operations Research – Human Terrain System, or COR-HTS), which was headed up by Captain Don Smith, and housed at the Training and Doctrine Command in [[Fort Leavenworth]].&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  The pilot lasted until August 2006.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In July 2006, [[Colonel]] Steve Fondacaro (retired) was hired by TRADOC to transition the pilot into an active program.&lt;ref name=Schactman2010 /&gt;  In October 2006, Jacob Kipp and colleagues outlined the Human Terrain System in an official FMSO public press release.&lt;ref name=Kipp /&gt;

HTS began recruiting in early 2007.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  In February 2007, the first team was deployed to Afghanistan. Further teams were deployed to Iraq in the summer of that year.&lt;ref name=GonzalezA /&gt;  Originally, HTS project leaders McFate and Fondacaro had planned for the program to run at a small scale (five teams: two in Afghanistan, three in Iraq) for two years.&lt;ref name="McFate2011" /&gt;  However, in response to a Joint Urgent Operational Needs Statement (JUONS) from Central Command issued in April 2007, calling for an HTS Team in every Army Brigade and Marine Corps Regiment in Iraq and Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;CENTCOM JUONS dated 7 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Defense Secretary]], [[Robert M. Gates]], authorized a $40 million expansion of the program in September 2007.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geller, Adam, "Odyssey Took Man From Campus to Combat", ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' ([[Associated Press]]), 8 March 2009, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The JUONS demanded a 420 per cent expansion of HTS, from the existing five teams to twenty-six teams divided between Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; McFate and Fondacaro referred to this as a "catastrophic success", meaning that "while the boost from the DOD ([[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]) was gratifying, fulfilling the mandate would stretch a new organization to the limit".&lt;ref name="McFate2011" /&gt;

Following the public statement of disapproval from the AAA, and significant media coverage of the controversy surrounding HTS, the [[United States Congress]] issued an order for an independent assessment of HTS to be undertaken by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) in September 2009.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; In May 2010, the [[House Armed Services Committee]] (HASC) temporarily limited the Army's funding obligation towards the program while this assessment was completed. The CNA report, which contained the results of interviews with 19 out of 71 commanders supported by HTS,&lt;ref name=PublicIntelligenceA /&gt; was completed in October 2010.&lt;ref name=CNAR&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton|first=Yvette|title=Congressionally Directed Assessment of the Human Terrain System|url=http://openanthropology.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/gettrdoc.pdf|publisher=CNA|accessdate=20 June 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently published on the [[Defense Technical Information Center]] (DTIC) website in February 2011, but withdrawn from the website shortly after.&lt;ref name=PublicIntelligenceA&gt;{{cite web|last=Anon|title=Retracted Center for Naval Analyses Assessment of Human Terrain System|publisher=Public Intelligence|date=7 March 2011|url=http://publicintelligence.net/retracted-center-for-naval-analyses-assessment-of-the-human-terrain-system|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, HTS was approved by the US Army and became a permanent Army program.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; In June 2010, [[Maxie McFarland]], the Deputy Chief of Staff for Intelligence at TRADOC, terminated Fondacaro's temporary position as HTS Program Manager.&lt;ref name=Schactman2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Weinberger2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberger|first=Sharon|title='Human Terrain' hits rocky ground|journal=Nature|date=22 June 2010|volume=465|issue=993|doi=10.1038/465993a|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100622/full/465993a.html|accessdate=22 June 2012|pages=993|pmid=20577178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonel Sharon Hamilton was appointed as his replacement. McFate also left HTS in 2010.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

On 8 March 2011, the Center for Complex Operations at the [[National Defense University]] hosted a conference titled Inter-agency Human Terrain Program and Requirements.&lt;ref name=CCO&gt;{{cite web|last=Centre for Complex Operations|title=CCO Event: Interagency Human Terrain Programs and Requirements|date=8 March 2011|url=http://ccoportal.org/event/2011/cco-event-interagency-human-terrain-programs-and-requirements|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center stated that the aims of the conference were to "improve understanding of human terrain information and analysis and of how it is currently being used"; to discuss the "effectiveness" of HTS; and to discuss ethical and legal issues associated with the program.&lt;ref name=CCO /&gt; In June 2011, [[United States Africa Command|AFRICOM]] requested and launched a pilot HTS program.&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin&gt;{{cite journal|last=US Army HQ|journal=Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin|title=Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin: Human Terrain System|date=October–December 2011|volume=37|issue=4|url=https://fas.org/irp/agency/army/mipb/2011_04.pdf|accessdate=23 June 2012|publisher=US Army Military Intelligence Center of Excellence|id=PB 34-11-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In December 2011, Colonel Hamilton reported that the US Central Command had issued a requirement for an increase of 9 HTS teams in Afghanistan by summer 2012, to bring the total number of teams in Afghanistan up to 31.&lt;ref name=Bertuca&gt;{{cite web|last=Bertuca|first=Tony|title=Army increasing number of Human Terrain Teams; advising allies|url=http://defensenewsstand.com/NewsStand-General/The-INSIDER-Free-Article/army-increasing-number-of-human-terrain-teams-advising-allies/menu-id-720.html|publisher=Inside Washington Publishers|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, HTS officials began prioritizing HTS involvement in "Phase Zero" or, in other words, the earliest, "prevention of conflict" stage of a military campaign.&lt;ref name=McFate2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hodges&gt;{{cite news|last=Hodges|first=Jim|title=Cover Story: US Army's Human Terrain Experts May Help Defuse Future Conflicts|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120322/C4ISR02/303220015/Cover-Story-U-S-Army-8217-s-Human-Terrain-Experts-May-Help-Defuse-Future-Conflicts|accessdate=20 June 2012|newspaper=C4ISR|date=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, ''Defense News'' reported that the Director of HTS, Colonel Sharon Hamilton, had been "working on a plan" to expand the use of HTS into other regions such as Africa and Latin America, and was considering whether HTS personnel could be deployed in Mexico to support military counter-narcotic work.&lt;ref name=DNanti-drug&gt;{{cite news|last=Iannotta|first=Ben|title=New tool eyed by U.S. for anti-drug war|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20120425/C4ISR01/304250006/New-tool-eyed-by-U-S-anti-drug-war|accessdate=18 June 2012|newspaper=Defense News|date=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schactman 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title=Que Curioso!

As part of the ongoing drawdown from Afghanistan in 2013–2014, the Army programmed HTS funding to drop proportionately, eliminating human terrain teams as units were removed from [[Theater (warfare)|theater]]. By September 2014, all HTS teams and personnel had been withdrawn from Afghanistan. Contract and personnel support to the program ceased at the end of the month, effectively ending the program's operations as of 1 October 2014. However, money was still allocated for the program in FY 2015.

===Notable operations===

====Operation Khyber====
During a 15-day operation in the late summer of 2007, 500 [[Afghan army|Afghan]] and 500 US soldiers were deployed to clear an estimated 200 to 250 Taliban insurgents out of [[Paktia Province]], secure southeastern Afghanistan's most important road, and halt a string of [[suicide attacks]] on US troops and local governors. During the operation, an HTS anthropologist, Tracy St. Benoit,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} identified an unusually high concentration of widows in poverty, creating pressure on their sons to join the well-paid insurgents.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite web|last=Peterson|first=Scott|title=US Army's strategy in Afghanistan: better anthropology|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=7 September 2007|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0907/p01s08-wosc.htm|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing St. Benoit's advice, US officers developed a job training program for the widows.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; She also interpreted the beheading of a local tribal elder as an effort to divide and weaken the [[Zadran (Pashtun tribe)|Zadran]], rather than as a more general attempt at intimidation. As a result, Afghan and US officials focused on uniting the Zadran, one of southeastern Afghanistan's most powerful [[tribe]]s, as a way of hindering the Taliban's operations in the area.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

====Operation Maiwand====
800 Afghan soldiers, 400 US soldiers and 200 Afghan policemen took part in Operation Maiwand, in which Afghan soldiers raided houses of suspected militants.&lt;ref name="IHT"&gt;''International Herald Tribune'', [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/03/asia/AS-GEN-Afghan-Army-Operation.php Afghan army plans, executes first big operation, taking step forward in US exit strategy], 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607094440/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/07/03/asia/AS-GEN-Afghan-Army-Operation.php |date=7 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' reported that in one [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] village, [[Kuz Khadokhel]], the Human Terrain Team (HTT) made it possible for negotiator Captain Aaron White to understand [[body language]] in the context of the culture, to identify leaders during negotiations, and to reinforce a perception of leadership by not conferring with fellow officers and by demonstrating good faith through projects facilitated by the Ghazni [[Provincial Reconstruction Team]] (PRT), which included roads, a visit by the PRT's [[field hospital|mobile medical clinic]], the construction of a deep well for irrigation, and the beginnings of a road to Afghanistan's main [[Highway 1 (Afghanistan)|Highway 1]].&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"/&gt;

===Deaths===
[[Michael V. Bhatia]], a member of HTT AF1, was killed along with two other soldiers by an [[Improvised explosive device|IED (Improvised Explosive Device)]] while riding in a [[Humvee]] in [[Khost]], Afghanistan in May 2008.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|17}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Geller|first=Adam|title=Professor Pays Ultimate Price in Country He Loved|newspaper=''[[Arizona Republic]]''|publisher=([[Associated Press]])|date=9 March 2009|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/2009/03/08/20090308dangerous-onlinePART2.html|page=1|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Geller /&gt;

Nicole Suveges, a member of HTT IZ3, was killed on 24 June 2008, along with 11 other soldiers, Iraqi government officials and United States Embassy personnel when a bomb exploded at the District Council building in [[Sadr City]].&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref name="hts.army" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SuevgesCNN&gt;{{cite news|title=American Grad Student Dies in Iraq|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/06/26/iraq.american.death/|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=CNN News|date=26 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 November 2008, HTS member Paula Loyd was fatally injured whilst surveying the village of [[Chehel Gazi]] with a US Army platoon. She was doused with gasoline disguised in a jar of cooking oil and lit on fire by Abdul Salam, an Afghan national. Loyd was severely burned over 60 percent of her body.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|110}} Salam was captured by Don. M Ayala (another member of HTS) and other US Army personnel almost immediately after the attack, as he tried to escape.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|112}} About ten minutes later, after learning of the severity of Loyd's injuries, Ayala shot Salam in the head, killing him instantly. Loyd, 36, died at [[Brooke Army Medical Center]] in [[San Antonio]] on 7 January 2009.&lt;ref name="hts.army"&gt;[http://hts.army.mil/htsImageSliderMemoriam.aspx HTS Memoriam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818025311/http://hts.army.mil/htsImageSliderMemoriam.aspx |date=18 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayala pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in federal court in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] in February 2009.

===End of the HTS===
With the end of major American presences in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a shift towards electronic data collection, the need for HTS became less apparent.  On 30 September 2014, funding ended for the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2015/06/29/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-human-terrain-system/ The Rise and Fall of the Human Terrain System]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and organizational structure==
[[File:Human terrain teams.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Human Terrain Team at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|An HTS senior seminar leader provides feedback to Human Terrain Teams at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in May 2010]]

=== Role of HTS in the US Army ===
HTS is defined as an "intelligence enabling capability",&lt;ref name=ProfBulletin /&gt;{{rp|1}} and is categorized as "Intelligence support activity".&lt;ref name=HTSFAQs&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS website – FAQs|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsFAQ.aspx|publisher=HTS|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the HTS website, the aim of the program is to "provide sociocultural teams to commanders and staff" in the US Army in order to "improve the understanding of the local population", and to "apply this understanding to the [[Military Decision Making Process]] (MDMP)".&lt;ref name="HTS website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Terrain System|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/Default.aspx|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website also argues that the program was designed to address an identified "operational need" in the US Army for "sociocultural support".&lt;ref name=HTSBackground&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS website – Background|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsAboutBackground.aspx|publisher=HTS|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HTS components===
HTS has two main components: an institutional component referred to as the "Army Enduring Base", and an operational component referred to as "Deployed Teams".&lt;ref name=HTSComp&gt;{{cite web|last=HTS|title=HTS Components|url=http://humanterrainsystem.army.mil/htsComponentsDeployed.aspx|work=HTS website|publisher=www.army.mil|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both components include numerous sub-divisions.

====Army Enduring Base====

=====Project Office=====
The Project Office is based in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] and is composed of the Director, the Deputy Director, and Project staff (including human resources, social scientists, knowledge management, and [[information technology]] (IT) teams).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Reachback Research Center (RRC)=====
The RRC is a [[Contiguous United States#CONUS and OCONUS|Continental United States (CONUS)]]-based research and analysis program that provides support to deployed HTTs, HTATs, and TCEs.  It is made up of a combination of social scientists, military analysts and civilian analysts who are organized into teams that specialize in research in a particular geographical region.  RRC personnel are responsible for supplying information from [[Open-source intelligence|open source]] and classified sources to deployed HTS teams, and for continuously updating HTS databases.&lt;ref name=KippB /&gt;&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====HTS training=====
HTS training is based at [[Fort Leavenworth]] in [[Kansas]]. Training focuses on field research methods, staff planning and procedures, and equipment training.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

====Deployed teams====

=====Human Terrain Teams (HTT)=====
Human Terrain Teams (HTT) work at the brigade or regimental level of the US Army. They undertake research among the local population, and represent that population (referred to as the "human terrain") in the various stages of military operations: planning, preparation, execution, and assessment.&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"&gt;
{{cite news| title = U.S. Military, Oblivious of Iraqi Culture, Enlists Anthropologists for Occupation| publisher = Middle East Online| date = 19 January 2008| accessdate = 11 February 2008| url = http://www.alternet.org/waroniraq/74326/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Human Terrain Teams contain 5–6 members and consist of a Team Leader, who is a principal adviser and is responsible for the entire team; one or two Social Scientists, who are responsible for conducting and managing ethnographic and social-science research for the brigade staff's area of operations; one Research Manager, who is responsible for integrating the HTT's research into their military unit's intelligence collection effort and interacting with other agencies and organizations; and one or two Human Terrain Analysts, who have specific local knowledge and act as the primary human terrain data researcher.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|149–50}}&lt;ref name="StarsAndStripes"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morin|first=Monte|title=Cultural advisers give US teams an edge|journal=Stars and Stripes|date=28 June 2007|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/cultural-advisers-give-u-s-teams-an-edge-1.65900|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt; HTTs are responsible for providing a constantly updated, user-friendly ethnographic and socio-cultural database of the area of operations that comprises data maps showing specific ethnographic or cultural features; raising points on cultural or ethnographic issues of specific concern to the unit commander; and sustaining a connection with RRC.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

=====Human Terrain Analysis Teams (HTAT)=====
Human Terrain and Analysis Teams provide support to echelons of the US Army that are above brigade or regimental level (e.g., [[Division (military)|division]] or regional command).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;  They form a part of the Commander's staff and are responsible for analyzing the information provided by HTTs in order to support the Commander's Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt; HTATs are made up of one Team Leader, one or two Social Scientists, one or two Research Managers, and one or two Human Terrain Analysts.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Theater Coordination Elements (TCE)=====
TCEs are made up of a mixture of military and civilian staff. They are responsible for providing sociocultural support to the military staff and commanders of a particular operational region or theater.  A TCE comprises one Team Leader, three Social Scientists, one or two Research Managers, and one or two Human Terrain Analysts.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Theater Support Office (TSO)=====
TSOs are responsible for providing administrative and logistics support to HTTs in a particular operational region or theater.  They are made up of one Theater Support Officer and a variably-sized support team.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

=====Social Science Research and Analysis (SSRA)=====
SSRA is responsible for liaising with indigenous polling organizations and [[Small and medium enterprises|small or medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs) in order to gather data and information from the local population.  This information is then passed on to the TCE.&lt;ref name=HTSComp /&gt;

===Methods===
The HTS program focuses on mapping the "human terrain" (i.e. the local population in an area in which military are deployed). In order to do this, HTTs create databases of information about local leaders, tribes or social groups, political disputes, economic issues, and social problems. This information is then analyzed by HTATs, used to advise military staff and commanders, and used to inform the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR" /&gt; Collected data is compiled and stored in a larger archive in order to be accessible for the military and other government agencies.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|150}}

===Equipment===
HTS has developed the MAP-HT Toolkit, an integrated software suite provided to HTTs for data visualization and reporting.&lt;ref name="Pilon"/&gt;{{rp|150}}&lt;ref name="MilitaryReview"/&gt;  This includes software for mapping (of the spatial distribution of social groups, for example), and for producing link charts (of power structures and social networks in informal economies, for example) and timelines.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulrine|first=Anna|title=The Culture Warriors|newspaper=US News and World Report|date=30 November 2007|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/iraq/2007/11/30/the-pentagon-deploys-social-scientists-to-help-understand-iraqs-human-terrain.html|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Components in the toolkit include: ANTHROPAC, UCINET, Axis PRO, [[i2 Limited|i2]] [[Analyst's Notebook]], and TerraExplorer, a 3D earth visualization application provided by Skyline Software Systems.

===Funding===
The initial funding for the Human Terrain System came from the [[Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization]] (JIEDDO).&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=John|authorlink=John Stanton (journalist)|title=General David Patraeus' Favorite Mushroom: Inside the U.S. Army's Human Terrain System|year=2009|publisher=Wiseman Publishing|location=|isbn=978-90-8963-019-3|pages=189|oclc=677926603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}} The JIEDDO funding of $20 million, granted in the summer 2006, supported the pilot HTS project from mid-2006 to 2007.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt; Following the Central Command JUONS request for the major and rapid expansion of HTS in April 2007, the Defense Secretary approved a $40 million expansion of HTS to be funded by the Department of Defense (DOD).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USNWR"/&gt;  DOD provided HTS funding until 2009 when funding responsibilities were assumed by Army [[Staff (military)#Continental Staff System|G2]] (i.e., the Army's Military Intelligence budget).&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt; In 2009 it was reported that the annual budget for the program was $143 million.&lt;ref name=Christian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christian|first=Caryl|title=Human Terrain Teams|journal=Foreign Policy|date=8 September 2009|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/09/08/reality_check_human_terrain_teams?page=0,0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010 the HASC temporarily limited the funding obligation to HTS until the Army submitted an assessment of the program that addressed concerns that had been raised.&lt;ref name=Forte2010&gt;{{cite web|last=Forte|first=Maximilian|title=Human Terrain System Criticized by US Congress|url=http://zeroanthropology.net/2010/05/21/human-terrain-system-criticized-by-u-s-congress/|publisher=zeroanthropology.net|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, McFate stated that HTS had a $150 million annual budget.&lt;ref name=McFate2011 /&gt;

==Public debate: praise, criticism and controversy==

===Praise and support===

====US government officials====
In a speech in 2008, [[Robert Gates]] (US Defense Secretary) praised HTS, saying that although the program had experienced early "teething problems" the "net effect" of HTS efforts was often "less violence across the board, with fewer hardships and casualties among civilians as a result".&lt;ref name=Jaschik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|title=A Pentagon Olive Branch to Academe|journal=Inside Higher Ed|date=16 April 2008|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/04/16/minerva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 article on HTS in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[David Rohde]], an American journalist who has twice won the [[Pulitzer Prize]], reported that one of the first HTTs to be deployed in Afghanistan had received "lavish" praise from officers for "helping them see the situation from an Afghan perspective and allowing them to cut back on combat operations".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; He wrote that HTS had also been praised by Afghan and Western civilian officials in the area, although they had been "cautious about predicting long term success".&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Rohde also cited Colonel David Woods (Commander of the 4th Squadron of the [[73rd Cavalry Regiment (United States)|73rd Cavalry Regiment]]) as having remarked: "Call it what you want, it works ... It works in helping you define the problems, not just the symptoms."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

In a statement to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2008, Colonel Martin Schweitzer, Commander of the 4th [[Brigade Combat Team]] of the [[82nd Airborne Division]], claimed that HTS capabilities had reduced his unit's "kinetic operations" in Afghanistan by 60–70 per cent within a year.&lt;ref name=Schweitzer&gt;{{cite web|last=Schweitzer|first=Martin P.|title=Statement of Colonel Martin P.

The US media has reported a number of positive review from HTS employees.  In 2008, ''World Politics Review'' ran a feature article on David Matsuda (a former professor of anthropology at [[California State University]]) who described HTS as "the chance to change the nature of warfare, the chance to anthropologize the military – and not the other way around – the chance to lessen casualties, avoid conflict, take people through the post-conflict to peace".&lt;ref name=McLeary&gt;{{cite news|last=McLeary|first=Paul|title=Human Terrain Teams|url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/2774/human-terrain-teams?page=2|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=World Politics Review|date=14 October 2008|format=.

====In the media====
In 2006, [[George Packer]], author of ''The Assassin's Gate: America in Iraq'' and ''New Yorker'' magazine staff writer, wrote an article about the increasing use of social science in US military operations and the early trials of the HTS program. He reflected: "At a moment when the Bush Administration has run out of ideas and lost control, it could turn away from its "war on terror" and follow a different path – one that is right under its nose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Packer|first=George|title=Knowing the Enemy|newspaper=New Yorker (magazine)|date=18 December 2006|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/12/18/061218fa_fact2#ixzz1bytdTVKw|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a (mainly critical) book about HTS entitled ''David Petraeus's Favorite Mushroom: Inside the US Army's Human Terrain System'' (2009), [[John Stanton (journalist)|John Stanton]] stated that HTS had been successful in advising a US military unit in Iraq on proper mealtime etiquette, i.e., not only how to properly eat, but also the gestures during the meal, and especially how to observe the Ramadan feast.&lt;ref name="Stantonbook"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

On 31 October 2007, the [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) published a statement opposing HTS as an "unacceptable application of anthropological expertise".&lt;ref name="aaanet.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAstatement"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MiddleEastOnline011908"/&gt; The statement argued that HTS personnel would have responsibilities to the U.S military working in war zones that would conflict with anthropologists' duty, as outlined in the AAA Code of Ethics (Section III, A, 1), to "do no harm to those they study".&lt;ref name=AAAstatement /&gt; It further maintained that, working in a war zone, HTS personnel would be unable to ensure the "voluntary informed consent (without coercion)" of those whom they communicate with, as is also required by the AAA Code of Ethics (Section III, A, 4).&lt;ref name=AAAstatement/&gt;

In December 2008, the AAA Executive Board followed up their initial statement of disapproval by asking the Commission on Engagement of Anthropology with the US Security and Intelligence Services (CEAUSSIC) to thoroughly review the HTS program.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt; CEAUSSIC's "Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain Proof-of-Concept System" was released in December 2009.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR&gt;{{cite book|last=CEAUSSIC|title=Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain System Proof of Concept Program |year=2009|publisher=AAA|url=https://www.box.com/shared/kg8t2cop82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CEAUSSIC|title=Final Report on the Army's Human Terrain System Proof of Concept Program |date=14 October 2009|url=http://www.policyscience.net/CEAUSSIC_HTS_Final_Report.pdf|accessdate=22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CEAUSSIC's 74-page report argued that the "goals" and "basic identity" of HTS were characterized by "confusion", and that the program was designed to simultaneously perform multiple tasks that were "potentially irreconcilable"; e.g., serving as research function whilst also operating as "a source of intelligence" and a "tactical function in counterinsurgency warfare".&lt;ref name=Glenn /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; It added that this confusion would make it unclear to anthropologists whether they could follow the Code of Ethics or not.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; The commission further maintained that HTS personnel would be unable to "maintain reliable control" over the information they collected, and that there was a "significant likelihood" that HTS data would be used "as part of military intelligence", which would place "researchers and their counterparts in the field in harm's way".&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICFR /&gt; It also noted that if HTS were a research organization, "it would be required to comply with federal law for subject protection" and suggested that it was "unusual" that the program had avoided oversight by an [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB).&lt;ref name=Zehfuss /&gt; In conclusion, the report stated: "When ethnographic investigation is determined by military missions, not subject to external review, where data collection occurs in the context of war, integrated into the goals of counterinsurgency, and in a potentially coercive environment – all characteristic features of the HTS concept and its application – it can no longer be considered a legitimate professional exercise of anthropology". It recommended that the AAA emphasize the incompatibility of HTS with [[Anthropology|anthropological]] disciplinary ethics and practice.&lt;ref name=CEAUSSICreport&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=CEAUSSIC Releases Final Report on Army HTS Program|url=http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/CEAUSSIC-Releases-Final-Report-on-Army-HTS-Program.cfm|publisher=AAA|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the AAA restated their disapproval of the HTS program after a cover story article in [[C4ISR Journal|''C4ISR'']] (a ''[[Defense News]]'' publication) claimed that "the controversy ha[d] cooled" and that HTS would have a recruiter at the annual AAA meeting in November that year.&lt;ref name=Hodges /&gt;&lt;ref name="C41SR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAblog&gt;{{cite web|last=AAA blog|title=Anthropologists and the Human Terrain System|url=http://blog.aaanet.org/2012/04/25/anthropologists-and-the-human-terrain-system/|publisher=AAA|accessdate=16 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAA denied both claims.&lt;ref name=C41SR /&gt;

====Anthropologists====
In 2007, the [[Network of Concerned Anthropologists]] (NCA) was founded by a group of anthropologists, largely in response to the HTS program.&lt;ref name=JacksonMIT&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Jean|title=Anthropologists Express Concern Over Government Plan to Support Military Research|journal=MIT Faculty Newsletter|date=May–June 2008|volume=20|issue=1|url=http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/205/jackson.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCAWebsite&gt;{{cite web|last=Network of Concerned Anthropologists|title=NCA website|url=https://sites.google.com/site/concernedanthropologists/|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Network wrote an "Anthropologists' Statement on the Human Terrain System Program" to the [[United States House of Representatives]], which was signed by over 700 anthropologists.&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gusterson|first=Hugh|title=Do Professional Ethics Matter in War?|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=March 2010|url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/do-professional-ethics-matter-war|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement called for Congress to halt governmental support to HTS and cancel plans for its expansion, giving the following reasons: "There is no evidence that HTS is effective"; "HTS is dangerous and reckless"; "HTS wastes taxpayers money"; "HTS is unethical for anthropologists and other social scientists".&lt;ref name=NCAWebsite /&gt;

Roberto J. Gonzalez (Associate Professor of Anthropology at [[San Jose State University]]), [[Hugh Gusterson]] (Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at [[George Mason University]]), and [[David Price (anthropologist)|David Price]] (Professor of Anthropology and Sociology at [[Saint Martin's University]]) – three of the founding members of NCA – have all written numerous articles criticizing HTS as an effort to "weaponize anthropology". In a 2010 article, Gusterson wrote of the program: "The Pentagon seems to have decided that anthropology is to the war on terror what physics was to the [[cold war]]".&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS /&gt;  He criticized HTS for performing "drive-by research" as well as violating disciplinary ethics, arguing that the AAA Code of Ethics is comparable to the [[Hippocratic oath]]: "Asking an anthropologist to gather intelligence that may lead to someone's death or imprisonment ... is like asking an army doctor to kill a wounded insurgent".&lt;ref name=GustersonBAS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Flintoff&gt;{{cite web|last=Flintoff|first=Corey|title=Marines Tap Social Sciences in Afghan War Effort|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125502485|publisher=NPR|accessdate=25 June 2012|date=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Price has described HTS as part of a "[[neocolonialism|neocolonial]]" mission.&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009 /&gt; "Human Terrain System", he maintained, "is not some neutral humanitarian project, it is an arm of the US military and it is part of the military's mission to occupy and destroy opposition to US goals and objectives ... HTS's goal is a gentler form of domination".&lt;ref name=PriceCP2009 /&gt; In an article in ''[[CounterPunch|Counterpunch]]'' in April 2009, Price disputed Colonel Schweitzer's claims that HTS had reduced kinetic action by 60–70%, reporting that his efforts to track the studies (via the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]) on which these statistics were based resulted in Schweitzer's admission that there were no such studies and that the statistics were a "loose estimate".&lt;ref name=counterpunch.com /&gt;  In the same article, Price also criticized the coverage of HTS in the US media and published a list of ten fundamental issues that reporters needed to address.&lt;ref name="counterpunch.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Counterinsurgency's free ride|journal=Counterpunch|date=7 April 2009|url=http://www.counterpunch.com/price04072009.html |accessdate=23 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026015533/http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/04/07/counterinsurgency-s-free-ride/ |archivedate=26 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper from 2009, [[Neil L Whitehead]], Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], questioned whether HTS can work in the way that it is promoted to do.  Drawing on anthropological studies of warfare that demonstrate the socially transformative effects of warfare and military action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferguson|first=R. Brain|title=War in the Tribal Zone: Expanding States and Indigenous Warfare|year=2000|publisher=School of American Research Press|isbn=0933452802|author2=Neil L. Whitehead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitehead argued that the practice of anthropology becomes "highly problematic" in a situation where anthropology is being deployed to report on "the very phenomenon it is a part of changing, whether consciously or not".&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"/&gt; He therefore suggested that ethical objections to HTS are not limited to the anthropologist's potential violation of their duty of confidentiality and responsibility to their informants, but also include the questionable "ethical responsibility" of those anthropologists and military planners "erroneously" promoting HTS as being able to work in ways that "in all likelihood" cannot actually work, thereby "endangering anthropologists and soldiers alike".&lt;ref name="Whitehead 2009"/&gt;

Other anthropologists who have criticized HTS include [[Marshall Sahlins]], who describes HTS as "manipulating local culture, imposing [our government's objectives] on them, transforming anthropologists into spies, and putting people you work with [in the locale] at risk"; and Maximilian Forte, who has published numerous articles on HTS in academic journals and on internet websites.&lt;ref name=ForteA /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jacobsen&gt;{{cite news|last=Jacobsen|first=Kurt|title=Are we there just to help the Army aim better?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/may/13/internationaleducationnews.highereducation|accessdate=24 June 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=13 May 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ForteZA&gt;{{cite web|last=Forte|first=Maximilian C.|title=Max Forte|url=http://zeroanthropology.net/about-the-bloggers/max-forte/|publisher=Zeroanthropology.net|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military officials and former HTS personnel====
In 2009, Major Ben Connable ([[Marine Corps]]) published an article in ''[[Military Review]]'' which argued that HTS was "undermining" the US Army's "cultural competence".&lt;ref name=Christian /&gt;&lt;ref name=Connable&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connable|first=Ben|title=All our Eggs in a Broken Basket: How the Human Terrain System is Undermining Sustainable Military Cultural Competence|journal=Military Review|date=March–April 2009|pages=57–64|url=http://usacac.army.mil/CAC2/MilitaryReview/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20090430_art010.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of former HTS personnel have also criticized the program. In 2007, social scientist Zenia Helbig was fired from HTS after raising concerns that the program was disorganized and provided insufficient region-specific training.&lt;ref name=WeinbergerN2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinberger|first=Sharon|title=Military Research: The Pentagon's Culture Wars|journal=Nature|date=October 2001|volume=455|pages=583–585|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081001/full/455583a.html|doi=10.1038/455583a|accessdate=25 June 2012|issue=7213|pmid=18833247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SchactmanZH&gt;{{cite news|last=Schactman|first=Noah|title=Army Social Scientists Calm Afghanistan, Make Enemies at Home|url=https://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2007/11/human_terrain?currentPage=1|accessdate=25 June 2012|newspaper=Wired|date=29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HelbigAAA&gt;{{cite news|last=Helbig|first=Zenia|title=Personal Perspective on HTS: Address to AAA Conference (.doc)|url=https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/files/aaa_helbig_hts.pdf|accessdate=25 June 2012|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Matt Tompkins, an HTT Leader, remarked that defense contractors supporting HTS were not providing sufficient training or staffing, and that the social scientists on his team lacked region-specific expertise.&lt;ref name=WeinbergerN2012 /&gt; After resigning from the program in 2010, John Allison criticized HTS for its doctrinal inflexibility and lack of openness to anthropological perspectives and suggestions for improvement.&lt;ref name=Price2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=David|title=Human Terrain System Dissenter Resigns, Tells Inside Story of Training's Heart of Darkness|journal=Counterpunch|date=15 February 2010|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2010/02/15/human-terrain-systems-dissenter-resigns-tells-inside-story-of-training-s-heart-of-darkness/|accessdate=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NDU Study====
In June 2013, a team of four researchers from the US [[National Defense University]] in Washington, DC published an in-depth assessment of HTS and the HTTs in Afghanistan, entitled ''Human Terrain Teams: An Organizational Innovation for Sociocultural Knowledge in Irregular Warfare''.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamb|first1=Christopher|last2=Orton|first2=James Douglas|last3=Davies|first3=Michael C.|last4=Pikulsky|first4=Theodore T.|title=Human Terrain Teams: An Organizational Innovation for Sociocultural Knowledge in Irregular Warfare|year=2013|publisher=Institute of World Politics Press|location=|isbn=978-0988864207}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first publicly released book with a history of the program as well as an assessment of the teams in the field. The study's conclusions were also published in ''Joint Force Quarterly'' in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Christopher|title=The Way Ahead for Human Terrain Teams|url=http://www.hsdl.org/?view&amp;did=739537|publisher=NDU Press|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study emerged from the [[Project for National Security Reform]] and its flagship assessment of the US national security system, [[Forging a New Shield]]. The study interviewed 87 individuals in a total of 105 interviews. The participants were principally team members, with commanders (primarily Brigade- and Task Force-level commanders) being the core variable able to define effectiveness of the team under their command. HTS program managers, knowledgeable defense-related persons, and some Iraq team members were interviewed.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"/&gt;{{rp|157}} In researching the program's history, the study's authors found that the relationship between HTS and the Army's [[Training and Doctrine Command]] (TRADOC) was one of the primary reasons for the problems within the program. Decisions made about HTS by TRADOC, such as new personnel contracts, had a negative impact on the program. However, the lack of a theory of performance in the beginning by HTS, and the lack of continual assessments of the teams in the field by HTS, meant that the program managers lacked the knowledge to train and deploy effective HTTs.

The authors also point out that the study's assessments strongly agree with the conclusions of earlier studies conducted by faculty at [[West Point]], the [[Center for Naval Analyses]] (CNA), and the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA). All four studies concluded that the program suffered from multiple problems in its creation and implementation, which inhibited the effectiveness of the teams in the field. Yet, all agree that a high majority of commanders were extremely supportive of the teams and found them effective.&lt;ref name="Lambbook"/&gt;{{rp|175–176}}

The NDU study was different in that it categorized the commanders' assessments according to basic concepts of "Cultural Awareness" (Description), "Cultural Understanding" (Explanation), and "Cultural Intelligence" (Prediction). It was found that most commanders only found and used their HTTs at the first level, Awareness. Some of the better performing HTTs could offer Understanding. Only a few HTTs, the very high performing teams with highly effective individuals, held a strong sense of teamwork and were commanded by culturally aware units and commanders. If commanders did not care about cultural issues, which did occur in some cases, the team would have no impact regardless of the team's effectiveness in other circumstances.

Finally, the nature of the intelligence architecture in Afghanistan was seen as the issue that had the biggest impact on HTT performance. Because the intelligence architecture did not value sociocultural knowledge and was not built to provide it, HTTs themselves had to be the ground sensors, a role they had not been designed to fulfill. HTTs were intended to be the aggregators of knowledge at the Brigade level to synthesize information to commanders directly. If HTTs had been built to be the sensors, they would have had to be multiplied in size and number many times over. By utilizing the HTTs as the primary interviewers and data analysts, their effectiveness was constrained. Since HTT members had relatively short tours (9–12 months), and would usually have a new Brigade arrive in the middle of their tour, their effectiveness was further reduced by their constant need to train new units on area features. The NDU team concluded that had soldiers themselves been the primary sensors on the ground, as recommended in LTG [[Michael T. Flynn]]'s ''Fixing Intel'' monograph, HTTs would have better been able to perform the role they were originally intended to serve.&lt;ref name="Flynnbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Flly|first1=Michael T.|last2=Pottinger|first2=Matthew|last3=Batchelor|first3=Paul D.|title=Fixing Intel|year=2010|publisher=Center for a New American Security|location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NDU book ends by suggesting that HTS be turned over to the [[U.S. Army Special Operations Command]] (USASOC). There were a number of reasons the team suggested USASOC would be a better fit for HTS: TRADOC had been a prime cause of multiple programmatic problems for HTS throughout its history; the US military has a history of intentionally forgetting and deinstitutionalizing cultural programs; and the future operating environment would be utilizing Special Operations forces to a greater degree than regular Army/Marines units.

====In the media====
[[Ann Marlowe]] wrote a piece about HTS for the ''Weekly Standard'' in November 2007, stating that "there are some things the Army needs in Afghanistan, but more academics are not at the top of the list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marlowe|first=Ann|title=Anthropology Goes to War|newspaper=The Weekly Standard (magazine)|date=26 November 2007|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/article/15464 |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural references===
In 2010, [[James Der Derian]], David Udris, and Michael Udris released a documentary film about HTS entitled ''[[Human Terrain: War Becomes Academic]]''.&lt;ref name=HTSmovie&gt;{{cite web|last=Der Derian|title=Human Terrain the Movie|url=http://humanterrainmovie.com/|accessdate=24 June 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;{{cite web|last=IMDb|title=Human Terrain (2010)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1632527/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=24 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacLeish&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacLeish|first=Kenneth|title=Is Empathy a Weapon?|journal=Anthropology Now|date=September 2011|volume=2|issue=1|pages=90–96|format=[[JSTOR]]|postscript=Restricted Access|jstor=3738032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Middup&gt;{{cite journal|last=Middup|first=Luke|title=James Der Derian, David Udris and Michael Udris, ''Human Terrain: War Becomes Academic'' – A Review|journal=Journal of American Studies|year=2011|volume=45|doi=10.1017/S0021875811001228|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=8432766&amp;jid=AMS&amp;volumeId=45&amp;issueId=04&amp;aid=8432764|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been described as having two main narrative components: the first is an inquiry into the HTS program and its history; the second is a narrative of the "tragic" story of [[Michael Bhatia]]'s involvement in HTS.&lt;ref name=Middup /&gt;  The film features interviews with numerous individuals who have played an important role in the history of HTS and the public debate surrounding the program, including Michael Bhatia, Steve Fondacaro, Roberto Gonzalez, Hugh Gusterson, and Montgomery McFate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1036">[[File:Humanities College.png|thumb|logo used to show Humanities status]]'''Humanities Colleges''' were introduced in 2004 as part of the [[Specialist school|Specialist Schools Programme]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. The system enables [[Secondary education#England, Wales and Northern Ireland|secondary schools]] to specialise in certain fields, in this case, [[humanities]]. Schools that successfully apply to the [[Specialist Schools Trust]] and become Humanities Colleges will receive extra funding from this joint private sector and government scheme. Humanities Colleges also act as a local point of reference for other schools and businesses in the area, with an emphasis on promoting humanities within the community.

'''Incest between twins''' or '''twincest'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wagner|first1=Roy|title=An Anthropology of the Subject: Holographic Worldview in New Guinea and its meaning and significance for the world of anthropology|date=2001|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a subclass of [[sibling incest]] and includes both [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] relationships. While in modern Western European culture such behaviour is considered [[incest taboo|taboo]], incest between twins is a common feature in [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Asia]]n (such as Japan) and [[Oceania]]n [[mythology]], and there are a few societies in which the prohibition on it is limited or it is partially accepted.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== In Asian culture ==
In traditional [[Bali]]nese culture, it was{{when|date=December 2013}} common for a set of [[twin]]s of the opposite sex to marry each other, since it was assumed that they had had sex in utero. The standard anthropological explanation of this custom is based in explications of the conflicts between [[Cultural heritage|descent]] and affinity in Balinese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boon|first=James A.|title=Affinities and Extremes: Crisscrossing the Bittersweet Ethnology of East Indies History, Hindu-Balinese Culture and Indo-European Culture|year=1990|publisher=Chicago University Press|isbn=978-0-226-06463-5|pages=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEp1lzmyceYC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=incest%20twin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twin incest was a common feature of Balinese mythology. As in many other mythologies, the Balinese [[deities]] frequently marry their siblings without any of the incest-related issues faced by similarly-situated human couples.

This was commonplace in [[Southeast Asia]]n [[creation myth]]s which prominently featured twin or sibling couples. In these stories, the brother usually wooed and wed his sister, who bore his child(ren), but on discovering that they are siblings, they are often (but not always) forced to part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Errington, Atkinson |first=Shelley, Jane Monnig|title=Power and Difference: Gender in Island Southeast Asia|year=1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-1781-8|pages=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgWrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=%22incest%22%20%22twins%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] mythology, Malakás ("strong") and Magandá ("beautiful"), the first humans on earth, were fraternal twins born of the same bamboo stalk.

An old Japanese myth says that if two [[star-crossed lovers]] commit [[Suicide pact|dual suicide]], they are [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] as fraternal twins.

== In European culture ==
Twin incest is a prominent feature in ancient Germanic mythology, and its modern manifestations, such as the relationship between Siegmund and Sieglinde in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walküre]]'', and a feature in some [[Greek mythology]], such as the story of [[Byblis]] and [[Kaunos (mythology)|Kaunos]]. There are strong parallels between the Germanic portrayals of twin incest and those of the Balinese [[Ramayana]], and some scholars have speculated an early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boon|first=James A.|title=Affinities and Extremes: Crisscrossing the Bittersweet Ethnology of East Indies History, Hindu-Balinese Culture and Indo-European Culture|year=1990|publisher=Chicago University Press|isbn=978-0-226-06463-5|pages=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEp1lzmyceYC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=incest%20twin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme also appears in [[English literature]], such as the incest between the twins Polydore and Urania in [[Delarivier Manley]]'s ''The New Atlantis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollak|first=Ellen|title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684-1814|year=2003|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-7204-4|pages=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heN14DHX_IIC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=%22incest%22%20%22twins%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1983 review of the scholarly literature on twin homosexuality and twin incest, Ray Bixler concluded that "most same-sex homosexual twins, if reared with their co-twins, do not attempt or even want to seduce them in adulthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bixler |first=Ray H. |date=August 1983 |title=Homosexual Twin Incest Avoidance |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=296–302 |doi=10.1080/00224498309551190  |jstor=3812342}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study drew on [[Edvard Westermarck]]'s [[Westermarck effect|hypothesis]] that sexual desire is generally absent in relationships between members of a [[nuclear family]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edvard Westermarck|Westermarck, Edvard]] (1922). ''The History of Human Marriage'', Vol. II. New York: Allerton, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

One case of incest between twins, in which twins who were adopted by separate families as babies later married without knowing they were brother and sister, was mentioned in a [[House of Lords]] debate on the Human Fertility and Embryology Bill in January 2008. According to the charity Adults Affected by Adoption, there had been other cases of this sort that had involved siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parted-at-birth twins 'married' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7182817.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was widely publicised in the British press,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/shock-for-the-married-couple-who-discovered-they-are-twins-separated-at-birth-6682411.html|title=Shock for the married couple who discovered they are twins separated|last=|first=|date=2008-01-11|website=|publisher=The Evening Standard|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its truthfulness was called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Henley |title=Did a pair of twins really get married by mistake? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/15/familyandrelationships.jonhenley |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech identical twins Michal and Radek Cuma are male pornographic actors who in 2009 began having sex together in video performances as "Milo and Elijah Peters". They consider themselves both brothers and romantic partners, and report that, outside their video performances with other actors, they have sex solely with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas|last=Rogers|title=Gay Porn's Most Shocking Taboo|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/05/21/twincest/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faculty of Music, University of Toronto - from Philosopher's Walk - DSC09874.JPG|alt=EJB@UofT|thumb|203x203px|The [[University of Toronto, Faculty of Music|Faculty of Music]] at the [[University of Toronto]] offers a Master of Music in Composition, Music Technology and Digital Media, Instrumental (solo piano, woodwinds, brass, percussion, strings), Collaborative Piano, Conducting, Jazz Performance, Opera, Piano Pedagogy, Voice, and Vocal Pedagogy. The first program for the degree was introduced in 1954.]]
The '''Master of Music''' ('''M.M.''' or '''M.Mus.''') is, as an academic title, the first graduate [[academic degree|degree]] in [[Music]] awarded by universities and [[Conservatory of music|conservatories]]. The M.M. combines advanced studies in an applied area of specialization (usually performance in singing or instrument playing, composition, or conducting) with graduate-level academic study in subjects such as [[music history]], [[music theory]], or music [[pedagogy]]. The degree, which takes one or two years of full-time study to complete, prepares students to be professional performers, conductors, and composers, according to their area of specialization. The M.M. is often required as the minimum teaching credential for university, college, and conservatory instrumental or vocal teaching positions. 

==Types==
The M.M. is widely available in performance (sometimes with a specialization in music teaching/pedagogy and/or music literature), composition, conducting, and, less commonly, [[music education]]. In 2005, Boston University launched an online Master of Music program in [[music education]], the only fully online program at this level as of November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;As of November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The music education degree may also be awarded as a more specifically titled Master of Music Education (M.M.Ed.). The master's in music theory, musicology (commonly called "music history"), and ethnomusicology is typically the [[Master of Arts]] (M.A.). Nevertheless, some universities in the UK (e.g. [[Sheffield University]]) utilize the M.M. as a special research degree, in which the student undertakes original research and prepares a written thesis or similar document. Programs focusing on preparing musicians for careers in sacred music for churches and houses of worship may alternatively be called Master of Sacred Music (M.S.M.).

==Components of degree==

===Applied studies and courses===
One of the major differences between a typical M.A. degree and the M.M. is that whereas M.A. degree students often undertake original research and prepare and submit a [[thesis]] or similar research document, M.M. students focus on practical, applied areas, as set out in their M.M. area of specialization, which are typically instrumental or vocal performance, composition of new music, or [[conducting]] (the latter may focus on orchestral conducting, choral conducting, or a combination of both. 

In M.M. programs, the student spends intensive lesson time with a professor. For singers and instrumentalists, this is with a voice and instrument professor, respectively. For composition students, they take coaching sessions with composer-professors. For conducting students, they get conducting coaching from a conductor-professor at the university. M.M. students typically complete applied studies, such as lessons with a professor, and take courses within their area of specialization. In many M.M. programs, all of the different M.M. streams (e.g., performance, composition, conducting) take a common core of music theory and music history courses, as these core courses are a necessary background for all three careers. The different streams may also have different required courses for each stream. For example, vocal performance students may be required to take an opera or art song class; orchestral instrumentalists may be required to take an orchestral excerpts or orchestral audition preparation class; composition students may be required to take composition courses; and conducting students may be required to take conducting, score-reading, or piano classes.

Some programs additionally require a sub-specialization in a cognate area, such as music history or performance practice, which contributes to their area of specialization. For example, a student doing an M.M. in Baroque violin might do a sub-specialization in Baroque music history (e.g., on [[historically authentic performance]]). Some institutions permit M.M. students to do a sub-specialization in a field outside music that contributes to their professional and academic goals. For example, a student completing a M.M. in piano [[pedagogy]] may be able to do a sub-specialization in the psychology of learning in the university's department of [[psychology]] or take a sub-specialization in educational methods in the university's department of education. Doing sub-specializations outside the faculty of music typically requires the approval of both the faculty of music and the other faculty (e.g., psychology, education, etc.).

===Recitals and comprehensive exams===
The last stage of the M.M. is usually the performance of one or two recitals and completion of comprehensive exams. Most programs require that the recitals include advanced-grade pieces that are drawn from the different eras of music history, such as Baroque-era solo suites (late 17th to mid 18th century), a Classical-era (mid to late 18th century) sonata or concerto; a Romantic-era (19th century) concerto or solo; and a Contemporary era (20th and 21st century) piece. The specific components of the recital vary between schools. Some programs allow students to include chamber pieces, in which the student plays a major role as part of a chamber group, for some of the pieces.

In some schools, students are required to give a lecture for one or both of the recitals, in which they explain the historical context or music theory or compositional issues involved in the pieces. This approach, called a lecture-recital, is designed to give students experience explaining and contextualizing the pieces or songs they perform. This skill is important for performers because many also teach or coach students, and some will go on to become professors, where they may be required to give lectures on music history, theory, or composition. 

Some M.M. programs require students to pass [[comprehensive exams]] on their area of specialization and subjects such as music history and music theory. The goal of this exam is to ensure that the student has obtained a well-rounded knowledge and understanding that extends beyond their specialization. Since the M.M. is the standard minimum credential to teach applied subjects (performance or composition) at universities and conservatories, it is important that M.M. graduates have this broader understanding of music history and theory.

==Admission requirements==
To be admitted to a M.M. program, most institutions require an undergraduate degree or diploma in music, such as a B.M. or B.A. with a major in music, usually with a grade average of B+ or higher. M.M. programs in performance usually require a live [[audition]] that includes advanced pieces (or for singers, songs) from a wide range of styles, typically ranging from the Baroque era (1600-1750), the Classical music period (1750-1800), the [[Romantic music era]] (1800-1910) to the 20th and/or 21st century. Singers typically perform arias from operas and [[art song]]s, which are typically accompanied by a pianist. Instrumental musicians typically perform solo [[J.S. Bach]] or other unaccompanied repertoire, a movement from a sonata, and a movement from a virtuoso concerto. Instrumentalists who play [[orchestra|orchestral]] instruments (violin family, woodwinds, brass, etc.) may be asked to perform excerpts from the standard orchestral repertoire. Auditionees are typically told which pieces and movements to prepare; some schools even give the bar numbers or rehearsal letters (e.g., Beethoven Symphony no. 5, movement 1, bar 100 to 120).

Some institutions use videotaped recitals or performances as a pre-screening method. This approach helps to eliminate candidates who do not meet the school's minimum performance standards, and as such, it saves those candidates the time and cost of traveling to the institution for an in-person audition, and it also saves the school the cost of having a panel of professors hear the candidate on location. Some universities have multiple audition locations to reduce the traveling expenses faced by candidates. For example, a school located on the west coast of the United States might offer the option of auditioning at a central and eastern US location. The school's professors who form the audition panel travel to these other locations to hear auditionees. Some schools which normally require in-person auditions waive this requirement for students who play the larger instruments (e.g., double bass and tuba), and allow a videotape to be sent instead.

Applicants are typically asked for official transcripts from all post-secondary programs and letters of recommendation from music professors and teachers. For most graduate programs, transcripts of every program or degree are required, whether or not the degree was completed. For students who have started out, but then withdrawn from a number of programs, they may have to request transcripts from many institutions. To protect against applicants changing marks on the transcripts using forgery, most schools require that the transcripts be sent directly from the previous institution's registrar to the music school, or that the transcripts be in sealed envelopes with the other school's registrar's seal (stamp) over the closure. Some programs may also request a statement of intent/statement of purpose or another type of essay, in which the candidate explains why she wishes to be admitted, and sets out her professional, performance or career goals. Some programs may request copies of recital programs from previous performances or a list of performance experience, which may include, for orchestral instrumentalists, orchestra experience. 

In some universities, candidates must also be admitted to the university's [[graduate school]]; as such, applicants may have to achieve a certain mark on [[standardized test]]s, such as the [[GRE]]. Similarly, students from countries where the official language is not that of the university may be required to achieve a certain mark on standardized language tests. For example, students applying to a US M.M. program who come from a country where English is not an official language, may be required to pass the [[Test of English as a Foreign Language]] (TOEFL). Admission to M.M. programs in conducting often requires a video recording of a live rehearsal and performances as a pre-screening element. Composition programs usually require the submission of a portfolio of compositions, including scores and recordings (audio or video) of live performances.

==Careers==
The M.Mus degree is usually undertaken to prepare students to be professional performers (typically either singers or instrumental musicians), conductors, and composers. As such many recipients of the M.Mus. degree do not seek further formal education after they complete the M.Mus. The M.Mus. is typically the minimum credential that allows them to teach instrumental or vocal performance at universities, colleges, and conservatories (some institutions will also hire teachers who do not have the M.Mus. who hold an Artist's Diploma or similar diploma, and/or who have had a significant performing career as either a solo recitalist, chamber musician or orchestral musician). Some graduates do additional graduate or professional study in other areas, such as a law degree or medical degree. The combination of an M.Mus. and a professional degree could enable the degree holder to work in fields where music and law (or medicine) overlap. Recipients of the M.Mus. may also make use of the general education provided in the degree (e.g., in writing and researching) to get a job in government, university administration, or in the non-profit or [[arts administration]] sector.

Other recipients of the M.Mus. may go on to further graduate studies in music by continuing their M.Mus. specialization in performance or conducting at the doctoral level, by completing a [[Doctor of Musical Arts|DMA]] (Doctor of Musical Arts) degree in those areas. Some students branch out to another area of music at the PhD level, such as musicology or music theory. While PhD programs in musicology and music theory normally require an MA in music, in some cases, students with a M.Mus. in performance or composition who show strong promise may be conditionally admitted to PhD programs in musicology or music theory.

As well, some recipients of the M.Mus. degree may go on to do graduate work in another area in which music is a supporting field, such as an Ed.D. in music education (e.g., specializing in music instruction) or a master's degree in Library Science, in order to become a music reference librarian. M.Mus. graduates who wish to pursue graduate studies in an area that is not directly connected with music may be conditionally admitted to PhD programs in areas such as [[women's studies]] or [[sociology]], subject to the condition that they complete a list of qualifying courses.

A '''millennium''' (plural '''millennia''' or '''millenniums''') is a period equal to [[1000 (number)|1000]] [[year]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/millennium millennium]", ''Oxford Dictionaries'' (Oxford University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; also called kiloyears. It derives from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|mille}}'', thousand, and ''{{lang|la|annus}}'', year. It is often, but not always, related to a particular [[calendar|dating system]].

Sometimes, it is used specifically for periods of a thousand years that begin at the starting point (initial reference point) of the calendar in consideration (typically the year "1"), or in later years that are whole number multiples of a thousand years after it. The term can also refer to an interval of time beginning on any date. Frequently in the latter case (and sometimes also in the former) it may have religious or theological implications (see [[millenarianism]]).

==Counting years==
There are two methods of counting years: current years (the count begins at the epoch) and elapsed years (the count is of completed years since the epoch).

The original method of counting years was [[ordinal number|ordinal]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} whether ''1st year [[AD]]'' or [[regnal year|regnal]] ''10th year of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]''. This ordinal numbering is still used in the names of the millennia and centuries, for example the ''1st millennium'' or the ''10th century'', and sometimes in the names of decades, e.g., ''1st decade of the 11th century''.

The main issues arise from the ''content'' of the various year ranges. Similar issues affect the ''contents'' of centuries. Decades are not subject to ambiguity, as they are named according to their leading numbers: the decade called the 1990s by its naming does not include 2000.

Those following ordinal year names naturally choose
* 2001–2100 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2001–3000 (inclusive) as the current millennium
Those who are influenced by the leading digit equally naturally choose
* 2000–2099 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2000–2999 (inclusive) as the current millennium

==Debate over millennium celebrations==
There are two viewpoints about how millennia should be thought of in practice. One viewpoint relies on the formal operation of the calendar, while the other appeals to [[Popular culture|popular culture]]. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that the choice is arbitrary, and since the question revolves around rules made by people, rather than a natural phenomenon that is subject to experimental measurement, the matter cannot be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay, ''Questioning the Millennium'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1997), part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO 8601]], employed in [[ISO 8601 usage|a number of contexts]], uses the [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical calendar]], in which year counting starts at 0. Thus, when using this calendar, the millennium starts at x000 and ends at x999. There was a popular debate leading up to the [[Millennium celebrations|celebrations of the year 2000]] as to whether the beginning of that year should be understood (and celebrated) as the beginning of a new millennium. Historically, there has been debate around the turn of previous decades, centuries, and millennia.

The issue is tied to the convention of using [[ordinal number]]s to count millennia (as in "the third millennium"), as opposed to "the two thousands", which is unambiguous as it does not depend on which year counting starts. The first convention is common in English speaking countries, but the latter is favored in for example Sweden (''tvåtusentalet'', which translates literally as the ''two thousands period'').

===Viewpoint 1: X001–Y000===
Those holding that the arrival of the new millennium should be celebrated in the transition from 2000 to 2001 (i.e., December 31, 2000 to January 1, 2001), argued that because the Gregorian calendar has no year zero, the millennia should be counted from 1 AD. Thus the first period of one thousand complete years runs from the beginning of 1 AD to the end of 1000 AD, and the beginning of the second millennium took place at the beginning of 1001.

[[Arthur C. Clarke]] gave this [[analogy]] (from a statement received by [[Reuters]]): "If the scale on your grocer's weighing machine began at 1 instead of 0, would you be happy when he claimed he'd sold you 10 kg of tea?" This statement illustrates the common confusion about the calendar.

If one counts from the beginning of AD 1 to the ending of AD 1000, one would have counted 1000&amp;nbsp;years. The next 1000&amp;nbsp;years (millennium) would begin on the first day of 1001. So the calendar has not 'cheated' anyone out of a year. Clarke made reference to this viewpoint in his book ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' referring to the Millennium Celebrations on December 31, 2000. In other words, the argument is based on the fact that the last year of the first two thousand years in the Gregorian calendar was 2000, not 1999.

===Viewpoint 2: X000–X999===
The "year 2000" has also been a popular phrase referring to an often [[utopia]]n future, or a year when stories in such a future were set, adding to its cultural significance. There was also media and public interest in the [[Y2K bug]]. People liked to compared their [[Odometer|odometer]] as a reason to celebrate the new millennium which goes from 1999 to 2000. Thus, the populist argument was that the new millennium should begin when the zeroes "rolled over" to 2000, i.e., the day after December 31, 1999. People&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/newmill.htm "When Does the New Millennium Begin?"] January 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; felt that the change of the hundreds digit in the year number, and the zeros rolling over, created a sense that a new century had begun.

This is similar to the common demarcation of decades by their most significant digits, e.g., naming the period 1980 to 1989 as the 1980s or "the eighties". Similarly, it would be valid to celebrate the year 2000 as a cultural event in its own right, and name the period 2000 to 2999 would be "the 2000s". In other words, the time period between 1 and 999 (999 years only) would be called the "0s" and the period between 1000 and 1999 would be the "1000s".

===Popular approach===
The popular&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/01/news/mn-7177 "Y2K It Wasn't, but It Was a Party"], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; approach was to treat the end of 1999 as the end of a millennium and to hold millennium celebrations at midnight between December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000, as per viewpoint 2. The cultural and psychological significance of the events listed above combined to cause celebrations to be observed one year earlier than the formal Gregorian date.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; This does not establish that insistence on the formal Gregorian date is "incorrect", though some view it as pedantic.

Some event organisers hedged their bets by calling their 1999 celebrations things like "Click" referring to the [[odometer]]-like rolling over of the nines to zeros. A second approach was to adopt two different views on the millennium problem and celebrate the new millennium twice.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]], in his essay ''Dousing Diminutive Dennis' Debate (or DDDD = 2000)'' (''[[Dinosaur in a Haystack]]''), discussed the "high" versus "pop" culture interpretation of the transition. Gould noted that the high culture, strict construction had been the dominant viewpoint at the 20th century's beginning, but that the pop culture viewpoint dominated at its end. Gould also included comments on adjustments to the calendar, such as those by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (the eponymous "Diminutive Dennis") and the timing of celebrations over different transitional periods. Further of his essays on this topic are collected in ''Questioning the Millennium: A Rationalist's Guide to a Precisely Arbitrary Countdown''.

== Characteristics ==
Some museum folklorists work full-time in museums of [[ethnography]], [[ethnology]], [[cultural history]], or [[folk art]], often as educators, [[curators]], and directors. Others work in other settings, such as in [[public folklore]] programs, academic departments, community-based organizations, and consultancies. Such folklorists either partner with museums in the development of scholarly and public programs or study the history and impact of such work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewhurst|first1=C. Kurt|title=Folklife and Museum Practice: An Intertwined History and Emerging Convergences|journal=Journal of American Folklore|date=2014|volume=127|issue=505|pages=247–263|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key themes in museum folklore include policies and practices relating to tangible and intangible [[cultural heritage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China-US Folklore and Intangible Cultural Heritage Project|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?page=FICH|website=American Folklore Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intangible Cultural Heritage and Ethnographic Museum Practice|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?page=FICH2|website=American Folklore Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; museums as [[sites of conscience]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of International Folk Art (USA)|url=http://www.sitesofconscience.org/members/museum-of-international-folk-art/|website=International Coalition of Sites of Conscience|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; museums and cultural tourism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|first1=Barbara|title=Destination Culture: Tourism, Museums, and Heritage|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520209664}}&lt;/ref&gt; and museums as sites of innovation relative to the digital preservation, presentation, and access to cultural heritage collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bol|first1=Marsha|last2=Dewhurst|first2=C.

There is significant interaction and overlap between museum folklore and the neighboring field of [[museum anthropology]], as well as the interdisciplinary field of [[material culture]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berlinger|first1=Gabrielle A.|title=Ethnography as a Strategy in Museum Preservation|journal=Practicing Anthropology|date=2015|volume=37|issue=3|pages=34-34|doi=10.17730/0888-4552-37.3.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewhurst|first1=C.

A '''naked butler '''is a popular type of entertainment used at [[Bachelorette party|hen parties]] and for corporate entertainment. It was introduced into the UK in the early 2000s and is now popular across the USA, New Zealand, Australia and Canada.

==Attire==

===Naked butler===
[[File:Naked butlers with a hen party, Bristol 2013.jpg|320px|thumbnail|right|Naked butlers serving guests at a hen party]]
The standard attire for a naked butler is only an [[apron]] or [[Trunks (clothing)|trunks]], [[cuff]]s, [[detachable collar]] and [[bow tie]]. It is seen as a more conservative entertainment option to hiring a [[male stripper]] for a [[Bachelorette party]] as it can be suitable for a broader range of guests.

===Topless waiter===

In this case the apron will be replaced with smart black trousers. This option may be more commonly used during corporate entertainment where the attire needs to be smarter and the exposing of a butlers naked bottom is not appropriate.

==In popular culture==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:A naked butler on X factor, July 2011.jpg|thumb|223x223px]] --&gt;
Naked butlers have become a popular [[gimmick]] on television shows in the UK and this is demonstrated by appearances on TV shows including ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', ''[[Come Dine with Me]]'' and ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|the X Factor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/1806642/x-factor-half-naked-butlers-endless-booze-and-hot-tub-romps-what-really-happened-at-the-x-factor-contestants-party/|title=Boozy wannabes have X-rated romp in boot camp hot tub as  Simon warns some have blown their chances|date=2016-09-18|work=The Sun|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, the role and job of a naked butler was discussed in the documentary ''Going to work Naked'' on [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]].&lt;ref&gt;Star 7th February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, naked butlers were part of an international news feature after being hired by a retirement home as part of the resident's wish program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/16988603.milton-lodges-hunks-in-trunks-visit-goes-international/|title=Care home's Hunks in Trunks visit goes international|website=Gazette|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2018}}
{{IPA notice}}
In [[linguistics]], '''Optimality Theory''' (frequently abbreviated '''OT'''; the term is normally capitalized by convention) is a linguistic model proposing that the observed forms of [[language]] arise from the optimal satisfaction of conflicting constraints. OT differs from other approaches to phonological analysis, such as [[autosegmental phonology]] and [[linear phonology]] (SPE), which typically use rules rather than constraints. OT models grammars as systems that provide mappings from inputs to outputs; typically, the inputs are conceived of as [[underlying representation]]s, and the outputs as their surface realizations.

In linguistics, Optimality Theory has its origin in a talk given by [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991&lt;ref&gt;"Optimality". Proceedings of the talk given at Arizona Phonology
Conference, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.&lt;/ref&gt; which was later developed in an article by the same authors in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan, and Smolensky, Paul (1993) "Optimality Theory: Constraint interaction in generative grammar." Technical Report CU-CS-696-93, Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado at Boulder.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
There are three basic components of the theory:

* Generator ({{sc1|Gen}}) takes an input, and generates the list of possible outputs, or candidates,
* Constraint component ({{sc1|Con}}) provides the criteria, in the form of strictly ranked violable constraints, used to decide between candidates, and
* Evaluator ({{sc1|Eval}}) chooses the optimal candidate based on the constraints, and this candidate is the output.

Optimality Theory assumes that these components are universal. Differences in grammars reflect different rankings of the universal constraint set, {{sc1|Con}}. Part of [[language acquisition]] can then be described as the process of adjusting the ranking of these constraints.

Optimality Theory as applied to language was originally proposed by the linguists [[Alan Prince]] and [[Paul Smolensky]] in 1991, and later expanded by Prince and [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]. Although much of the interest in Optimality Theory has been associated with its use in [[phonology]], the area to which Optimality Theory was first applied, the theory is also applicable to other subfields of [[linguistics]] (e.g. [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]).

Optimality Theory is like other theories of [[generative grammar]] in its focus on the investigation of [[linguistic universal|universal principles]], [[linguistic typology]] and [[language acquisition]].

Optimality Theory also has roots in [[neural network]] research. It arose in part as an alternative to the [[connectionist]] theory of [[Harmonic Grammar]], developed in 1990 by [[Géraldine Legendre]], [[Yoshiro Miyata]] and [[Paul Smolensky]]. Variants of Optimality Theory with connectionist-like weighted constraints continue to be pursued in more recent work (Pater 2009).

==Input and {{sc1|Gen}}: the candidate set==
Optimality Theory supposes that there are no language-specific restrictions on the input. This is called ''richness of the base''. Every grammar can handle every possible input. For example, a language without [[Consonant cluster|complex clusters]] must be able to deal with an input such as {{IPA|/flask/}}. Languages without complex clusters differ on how they will resolve this problem; some will [[epenthesis|epenthesize]] (e.g. {{IPA|[falasak]}}, or {{IPA|[falasaka]}} if all codas are banned) and some will [[Elision|delete]] (e.g. {{IPA|[fas], [fak], [las], [lak]}}).

{{sc1|Gen}} is free to generate any number of output candidates, however much they deviate from the input. This is called ''freedom of analysis''. The grammar (ranking of constraints) of the language determines which of the candidates will be assessed as optimal by {{sc1|Eval}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|p=20}}

=={{sc1|Con}}: the constraint set==
In Optimality Theory, every constraint is universal. {{sc1|Con}} is the same in every language. There are two basic types of constraints:

* Faithfulness constraints require that the observed surface form (the output) match the underlying or lexical form (the input) in some particular way; that is, these constraints require identity between input and output forms.
* Markedness constraints impose requirements on the structural [[well-formedness]] of the output.

Each plays a crucial role in the theory. Markedness constraints motivate changes from the underlying form, and faithfulness constraints prevent every input from being realized as some completely unmarked form (such as {{IPA|[ba]}}).

The universal nature of {{sc1|Con}} makes some immediate predictions about language typology. If grammars differ only by having different rankings of {{sc1|Con}}, then the set of possible human languages is determined by the constraints that exist. Optimality Theory predicts that there cannot be more grammars than there are permutations of the ranking of {{sc1|Con}}. The number of possible rankings is equal to the [[factorial]] of the total number of constraints, thus giving rise to the term ''factorial typology''. However, it may not be possible to distinguish all of these potential grammars, since not every constraint is guaranteed to have an observable effect in every language. Two total orders on the constraints of {{sc1|Con}} could generate the same range of input–output mappings, but differ in the relative ranking of two constraints which do not conflict with each other. Since there is no way to distinguish these two rankings they are said to belong to the same grammar. A grammar in OT is equivalent to an [[antimatroid]] (Merchant &amp; Riggle 2016). If rankings with ties are allowed, then the number of possibilities is an [[ordered Bell number]] rather than a factorial, allowing a significantly larger number of possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Review: The Best of All Possible Words (review of ''Optimality Theory: An Overview'', Archangeli, Diana &amp; Langendoen, D. Terence, eds., Blackwell, 1997)|first1=T. Mark|last1=Ellison|first2=Ewan|last2=Klein|journal=Journal of Linguistics|volume=37|issue=1|year=2001|pages=127–143|jstor=4176645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faithfulness constraints===
McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) propose three basic families of faithfulness constraints:

* {{sc1|Max}} prohibits [[elision|deletion]] (from "maximal").
* {{sc1|Dep}} prohibits [[epenthesis]] (from "dependent").
* {{sc1|Ident}}(F) prohibits alteration to the value of feature F (from "identical").

Each of the constraints' names may be suffixed with "-IO" or "-BR", standing for ''input/output'' and ''base/reduplicant'', respectively—the latter of which is used in analysis of [[reduplication]]—if desired. ''F'' in {{sc1|Ident}}(F) is substituted by the name of a [[distinctive feature]], as in {{sc1|Ident-IO}}(voice).

{{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}} replace {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} proposed by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993), which stated "underlying segments must be parsed into syllable structure" and "syllable positions must be filled with underlying segments", respectively.{{sfnp|Prince|Smolensky|1993|p=94}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}} {{sc1|Parse}} and {{sc1|Fill}} serve essentially the same functions as {{sc1|Max}} and {{sc1|Dep}}, but differ in that they evaluate only the output and not the relation between the input and output, which is rather characteristic of markedness constraints.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=209}} This stems from the model adopted by Prince &amp; Smolensky known as ''containment theory'', which assumes the input segments unrealized by the output are not removed but rather "left unparsed" by a syllable.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=99–100}} The model put forth by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995, 1999), known as ''correspondence theory'', has since replaced it as the standard framework.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=27}}

McCarthy &amp; Prince (1995) also propose:

* {{sc1|I-Contig}}, violated when a word- or morpheme-internal segment is deleted (from "input-contiguity");
* {{sc1|O-Contig}}, violated when a segment is inserted word- or morpheme-internally (from "output-contiguity");
* {{sc1|Linearity}}, violated when the order of some segments is changed (i.e. prohibits [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]);
* {{sc1|Uniformity}}, violated when two or more segments are realized as one (i.e. prohibits [[fusion (linguistics)|fusion]]); and
* {{sc1|Integrity}}, violated when a segment is realized as multiple segments (i.e. prohibits [[unpacking]] or [[vowel breaking]]—opposite of {{sc1|Uniformity}}).

===Markedness constraints===
Markedness constraints introduced by Prince &amp; Smolensky (1993) include:

{| class="wikitable"
! Name
! Statement
! Other names
|-
| {{sc1|Nuc}}
| Syllables must have nuclei.
|
|-
| {{sc1|&amp;minus;Coda}}
| Syllables must have no codas.
| {{sc1|NoCoda}}
|-
| {{sc1|Ons}}
| Syllables must have onsets.
| {{sc1|Onset}}
|-
| {{sc1|HNuc}}
| A nuclear segment must be more [[Sonority hierarchy|sonorous]] than another (from "harmonic nucleus").
|
|-
| {{sc1|*Complex}}
| A syllable must be V, CV or VC.
|
|-
| {{sc1|CodaCond}}
| Coda consonants cannot have place features that are not shared by an onset consonant.
| {{sc1|CodaCondition}}
|-
| {{sc1|NonFinality}}
| A word-final syllable (or [[foot (prosody)|foot]]) must not bear stress.
| {{sc1|NonFin}}
|-
| {{sc1|FtBin}}
| A foot must be two syllables (or [[Mora  (linguistics)|moras]]).
| {{sc1|FootBinarity}}
|-
| {{sc1|Pk-Prom}}
| Light syllables must not be stressed.
| {{sc1|PeakProminence}}
|-
| WSP
| Heavy syllables must be stressed (from "weight-to-stress principle").
| {{sc1|Weight-to-Stress}}
|}

Precise definitions in literature vary. Some constraints are sometimes used as a "cover constraint", standing in for a set of constraints that are not fully known or important.{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|p=224}}

Some markedness constraints are context-free and others are context-sensitive. For example, *V&lt;sub&gt;nasal&lt;/sub&gt; states that vowels must not be nasal in any position and is thus context-free, whereas *V&lt;sub&gt;oral&lt;/sub&gt;N states that vowels must not be oral when preceding a tautosyllabic nasal and is thus context-sensitive.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=29–30}}

===Alignment constraints===
{{expand section|date=June 2018}}

===Local conjunctions===
Two constraints may be conjoined as a single constraint, called a ''local conjunction'', which gives only one violation each time both constraints are violated within a given domain, such as a segment, syllable or word. For example, [{{sc1|NoCoda &amp; VOP}}]&lt;sub&gt;segment&lt;/sub&gt; is violated once per voiced [[obstruent]] in a coda ("VOP" stands for "voiced obstruent prohibition"), and may be equivalently written as {{sc1|*VoicedCoda}}.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}{{sfnp|McCarthy|2008|pp=214–20}} Local conjunctions are used as a way of circumventing the problem of [[phonological opacity]] that arises when analyzing [[chain shift]]s.{{sfnp|Kager|1999|pp=392–400}}

=={{sc1|Eval}}: definition of optimality==
Given two candidates, A and B, A is better, or more "harmonic", than B on a constraint if A incurs fewer violations than B. Candidate A is more harmonic than B on an entire constraint hierarchy if A incurs fewer violations of the highest-ranked constraint distinguishing A and B. A is "optimal" in its candidate set if it is better on the constraint hierarchy than all other candidates.

For example, given the constraints C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, where C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which dominates C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), A is optimal if it does better than B on the highest ranking constraint which assigns them a different number of violations. If A and B tie on C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but A does better than B on C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, A is optimal, even if A has however many more violations of C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; than B does. This comparison is often illustrated with a tableau. The [[index (typography)|pointing finger]] marks the optimal candidate, and each cell displays an asterisk for each violation for a given candidate and constraint. Once a candidate does worse than another candidate on the highest ranking constraint distinguishing them, it incurs a fatal violation (marked in the tableau by an exclamation mark and by shaded cells for the lower-ranked constraints). Once a candidate incurs a fatal violation, it cannot be optimal, even if it outperforms the other candidates on the rest of {{sc1|Con}}.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Tableau

Other notational conventions include dotted lines separating columns of unranked or equally ranked constraints, a check mark ✔ in place of a finger in tentatively ranked tableaux (denoting harmonic but not conclusively optimal), and a circled asterisk ⊛ denoting a violation by a winner; in output candidates, the angle brackets {{angle bracket|&amp;nbsp;}} denote segments elided in phonetic realization, and □ and □́ denote an epenthetic consonant and vowel, respectively.{{sfnp|Tesar|Smloensky|1998|pp=230–1, 239}} The "much greater than" sign ≫ (sometimes the nested ⪢) denotes the domination of a constraint over another ("C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≫ C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;" = "C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; dominates C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;") while the "succeeds" operator ≻ denotes superior harmony in comparison of output candidates ("A ≻ B" = "A is more harmonic than B").{{sfnp|McCarthy|2001|p=247}}

Constraints are ranked in a hierarchy of strict domination. The ''strictness of strict domination'' means that a candidate which violates only a high-ranked constraint does worse on the hierarchy than one that does not, even if the second candidate fared worse on every other lower-ranked constraint. This also means that constraints are violable; the winning (i.e. the most harmonic) candidate need not satisfy all constraints, as long as for any rival candidate that does better than the winner on some constraint, there is a higher-ranked constraint on which the winner does better than that rival. Within a language, a constraint may be ranked high enough that it is always obeyed; it may be ranked low enough that it has no observable effects; or, it may have some intermediate ranking. The term ''the emergence of the unmarked'' describes situations in which a markedness constraint has an intermediate ranking, so that it is violated in some forms, but nonetheless has observable effects when higher-ranked constraints are irrelevant.

An early example proposed by McCarthy &amp; Prince (1994) is the constraint {{sc1|NoCoda}}, which prohibits syllables from ending in consonants. In [[Balangao]], {{sc1|NoCoda}} is not ranked high enough to be always obeyed, as witnessed in roots like ''taynan'' (faithfulness to the input prevents deletion of the final {{IPA|/n/}}). But, in the [[reduplication|reduplicated]] form ''ma-tayna-taynan'' 'repeatedly be left behind', the final {{IPA|/n/}} is not copied. Under McCarthy &amp; Prince's analysis, this is because faithfulness to the input does not apply to reduplicated material, and {{sc1|NoCoda}} is thus free to prefer ''ma-tayna-taynan'' over hypothetical ''ma-taynan-taynan'' (which has an additional violation of {{sc1|NoCoda}}).

Some optimality theorists prefer the use of comparative tableaux, as described in Prince (2002b). Comparative tableaux display the same information as the classic or "flyspeck" tableaux, but the information is presented in such a way that it highlights the most crucial information. For instance, the tableau above would be rendered in the following way.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|+ Comparative tableau
! !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 1 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 2 !! {{sc1|Constraint}} 3
|-
! A ~ B
| e || W || L
|}

Each row in a comparative tableau represents a winner–loser pair, rather than an individual candidate. In the cells where the constraints assess the winner–loser pairs, "W" is placed if the constraint in that column prefers the winner, "L" if the constraint prefers the loser, and "e" if the constraint does not differentiate between the pair. Presenting the data in this way makes it easier to make generalizations. For instance, in order to have a consistent ranking ''some'' W must dominate ''all'' L's. Brasoveanu and Prince (2005) describe a process known as fusion and the various ways of presenting data in a comparative tableau in order to achieve the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given argument.

==Example==
As a simplified example, consider the manifestation of the English plural:

* {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/ → [dɒɡz]}} (''dogs'')
* {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/ → [kæts]}} (''cats'')
* {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/ → [dɪʃɪz]}} (''dishes'')

Also consider the following constraint set, in descending order of domination:

{| class="wikitable"
! Type !! Name !! Description
|-
| rowspan="2" | Markedness || *SS || Two successive sibilants are prohibited. One violation for every pair of adjacent [[sibilants]] in the output.
|-
| {{sc1|Agree}}(Voice) || Output segments agree in specification of [[Distinctive feature|&amp;#91;±voice&amp;#93;]]. One violation for every pair of adjacent [[obstruent]]s in the output which disagree in voicing.
|-
| rowspan="3" | Faithfulness || {{sc1|Max}} || Maximizes all input segments in the output. One violation for each segment in the input that does not appear in the output. This constraint prevents deletion.
|-
| {{sc1|Dep}} || Output segments are dependent on having an input correspondent. One violation for each segment in the output that does not appear in the input. This constraint prevents insertion.

No matter how the constraints are re-ordered, the allomorph {{IPA|[ɪs]}} will always lose to {{IPA|[ɪz]}}. This is called ''harmonic bounding''. The violations incurred by the candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡɪz]}} are a subset of the violations incurred by {{IPA|[dɒɡɪs]}}; specifically, if you epenthesize a vowel, changing the voicing of the morpheme is a gratuitous violation of constraints. In the {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}} tableau, there is a candidate {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} which incurs no violations whatsoever. Within the constraint set of the problem, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} harmonically bounds all other possible candidates. This shows that a candidate does not need to be a winner in order to harmonically bound another candidate.

The tableaux from above are repeated below using the comparative tableaux format.

From the comparative tableau for {{IPA|/dɒɡ/ + /z/}}, it can be observed that any ranking of these constraints will produce the observed output {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}}. Because there are no loser-preferring comparisons, {{IPA|[dɒɡz]}} wins under any ranking of these constraints; this means that no ranking can be established on the basis of this input.

The tableau for {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} contains rows with a single W and a single L. This shows that {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, and {{sc1|Dep}} must all dominate {{sc1|Ident}}; however, no ranking can be established between those constraints on the basis of this input. Based on this tableau, the following ranking has been established
: {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}.

The tableau for {{IPA|/dɪʃ/ + /z/}} shows that several more rankings are necessary in order to predict the desired outcome. The first row says nothing; there is no loser-preferring comparison in the first row. The second row reveals that either *SS or {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, based on the comparison between {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} and {{IPA|[dɪʃz]}}. The third row shows that {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. The final row shows that either *SS or {{sc1|Ident}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. From the {{IPA|/kæt/ + /z/}} tableau, it was established that {{sc1|Dep}} dominates {{sc1|Ident}}; this means that *SS must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}.

So far, the following rankings have been shown to be necessary:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

While it is possible that {{sc1|Agree}} can dominate {{sc1|Dep}}, it is not necessary; the ranking given above is sufficient for the observed for {{IPA|[dɪʃɪz]}} to emerge.

When the rankings from the tableaux are combined, the following ranking summary can be given:
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}} ≫ {{sc1|Agree}}, {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}
::or
: *SS, {{sc1|Max}}, {{sc1|Agree}} ≫ {{sc1|Dep}} ≫ {{sc1|Ident}}

There are two possible places to put {{sc1|Agree}} when writing out rankings linearly; neither is truly accurate. The first implies that *SS and {{sc1|Max}} must dominate {{sc1|Agree}}, and the second implies that {{sc1|Agree}} must dominate {{sc1|Dep}}. Neither of these are truthful, which is a failing of writing out rankings in a linear fashion like this. These sorts of problems are the reason why most linguists utilize a [[Lattice (order)|lattice graph]] to represent necessary and sufficient rankings, as shown below.

[[File:Lattice 2.jpg|Lattice graph of necessary and sufficient rankings]]

A diagram that represents the necessary rankings of constraints in this style is a [[Hasse diagram]].

==Criticism==
Optimality Theory has attracted substantial amounts of criticism, most of which is directed at its application to phonology (rather than syntax or other fields).&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dresher (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hale &amp; Reiss (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Halle (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Idsardi (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is claimed that Optimality Theory cannot account for [[phonological opacity]] (see Idsardi 2000, for example). In derivational phonology, effects that are inexplicable at the surface level but are explainable through "opaque" rule ordering may be seen; but in Optimality Theory, which has no intermediate levels for rules to operate on, these effects are difficult to explain.

For example, in [[Quebec French]], high front vowels triggered affrication of {{IPA|/t/}}, (e.g. {{IPA|/tipik/ → [tˢpɪk]}}), but the loss of high vowels (visible at the surface level) has left the affrication with no apparent source. Derivational phonology can explain this by stating that vowel [[syncope (phonology)|syncope]] (the loss of the vowel) "counterbled" affrication—that is, instead of vowel syncope occurring and "[[bleeding order|bleeding]]" (i.e. preventing) affrication, it says that affrication applies before vowel syncope, so that the high vowel is removed and the environment destroyed which had triggered affrication. Such counterbleeding rule orderings are therefore termed ''opaque'' (as opposed to ''transparent''), because their effects are not visible at the surface level.

The opacity of such phenomena finds no straightforward explanation in Optimality Theory, since intermediate forms are not accessible (constraints refer only to the surface form and/or the underlying form). There have been a number of proposals designed to account for it, but most of the proposals significantly alter Optimality Theory's basic architecture and therefore tend to be highly controversial. Frequently, such alterations add new types of constraints (which are not universal faithfulness or markedness constraints), or change the properties of {{sc1|Gen}} (such as allowing for serial derivations) or {{sc1|Eval}}. Examples of these include [[John McCarthy (linguist)|John J. McCarthy]]'s sympathy theory and candidate chains theory, among many others.

A relevant issue is the existence of circular [[chain shift]]s, i.e. cases where input {{IPA|/X/}} maps to output {{IPA|[Y]}}, but input {{IPA|/Y/}} maps to output {{IPA|[X]}}. Many versions of Optimality Theory predict this to be impossible (see Moreton 2004, Prince 2007).

Optimality Theory is also criticized as being an impossible model of speech production/perception: computing and comparing an infinite number of possible candidates would take an infinitely long time to process. Idsardi (2006) argues this position, though other linguists dispute this claim on the grounds that Idsardi makes unreasonable assumptions about the constraint set and candidates, and that more moderate instantiations of Optimality Theory do not present such significant [[computational problem]]s (see Kornai (2006) and Heinz, Kobele &amp; Riggle (2009)). Another common rebuttal to this criticism of Optimality Theory is that the framework is purely representational. In this view, Optimality Theory is taken to be a model of [[linguistic competence]] and is therefore not intended to explain the specifics of [[linguistic performance]].&lt;ref&gt;Kager, René (1999). Optimality Theory. Section 1.4.4: Fear of infinity, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prince, Alan and Paul Smolensky. (2004): ''Optimality Theory: Constraint Interaction in Generative Grammar''. Section 10.1.1: Fear of Optimization, pp. 215–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objection to Optimality Theory is that it is not technically a theory, in that it does not make falsifiable predictions. The source of this issue may be in terminology: the term ''theory'' is used differently here than in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. Specific instantiations of Optimality Theory may make falsifiable predictions, in the same way specific proposals within other linguistic frameworks can. What predictions are made, and whether they are testable, depends on the specifics of individual proposals (most commonly, this is a matter of the definitions of the constraints used in an analysis). Thus, Optimality Theory as a framework is best described{{according to whom|date=June 2018}} as a [[scientific paradigm]].&lt;ref&gt;de Lacy (editor). (2007). ''The Cambridge Handbook of Phonology'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories within Optimality Theory==
In practice, implementations of Optimality Theory often assume other related concepts, such as the [[syllable]], the [[mora (linguistics)|mora]], or [[feature geometry]]. Completely distinct from these, there are sub-theories which have been proposed entirely within Optimality Theory, such as [[positional faithfulness theory]], correspondence theory (McCarthy &amp; Prince 1995), sympathy theory, and a number of theories of learnability, most notably by [[Bruce Tesar]].
There are also a range of theories specifically about Optimality Theory. These are concerned with issues like the possible formulations of constraints, and constraint interactions other than strict domination.

==Use outside of phonology==
Optimality Theory is most commonly associated with the field of [[phonology]], but has also been applied to other areas of linguistics. [[Jane Grimshaw]], [[Geraldine Legendre]] and [[Joan Bresnan]] have developed instantiations of the theory within [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, John (2001). A Thematic Guide to Optimality Theory, Chapter 4: Connections of Optimality Theory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Legendre, Grimshaw &amp; Vikner (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Optimality theoretic approaches are also relatively prominent in [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] (and the morphology–phonology interface in particular).&lt;ref&gt;Trommer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Orality''' is [[thought]] and verbal expression in societies where the technologies of [[literacy]] (especially writing and print) are unfamiliar to most of the population.  The study of orality is closely allied to the study of [[oral tradition]].  

The term “orality” has been used in a variety of ways, often to describe, in a generalised fashion, the structures of consciousness found in cultures that do not employ, or employ minimally, the technologies of writing. 

[[Walter J. Ong]]’s work was foundational for the study of orality, and reminds us that despite the striking success and subsequent power of written language, the vast majority of languages are never written, and  the basic orality of language is permanent.{{sfn|Cronin|Crosson|Eastlake|2009|p=5}} 

In his later publications Ong distinguishes between two forms of orality: 'primary orality' and 'secondary orality'. Primary orality is thought and expression un-touched by the culture of writing of print; ''[[secondary orality]]'' is explained by Ong as oral culture defined by (implicitly influenced) by the written and printed word, and includes oral culture made possible by technology such as a [[newscaster]] reading a news report on television.

In addition, 'residual orality' is also defined - it is the remnants, legacy, or influence of a predominately oral culture carried over into the written realm - an example might include the use of [[dialogue]] as a philosophical or didactic tool in written literature, such as used by the Greek thinker [[Plato]].

== Origins of philosophy and definition  ==

===Impact of literacy on culture===
Before writing became a way for many [[cultures]] before we had orality. Unfortunately many of the retained orality has been lost or drastically changed. Those that were able to be preserved gives us insight to past cultures and just how much we have evolved since then.&lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Orality and Literacy'' (2nd ed. {{harvnb|Ong|2002}}), Ong sums up his own work over the previous three decades as well as the work of numerous other scholars. With regard to oral tradition and primary orality he  draws on pioneering work by [[Milman Parry]], [[Albert B. Lord]], and [[Eric A. Havelock]]. [[Marshall McLuhan]] was among the first to fully appreciate the significance of the Ong's earlier work about print culture and the [[written and printed word]] as a [[technology]].  In his work ''The Gutenberg Galaxy'' {{harvnb|McLuhan|1962}} McLuhan quotes and discusses works by Ong in the 1950s regarding print culture.{{sfn|McLuhan|1962|pp= 104, 129, 146, 159–60, 162–63, 168, 174–76}}; Orality gave us the stepping stones that allowed us to get where we are today, it was a necessity for the growth of civilization. &lt;ref&gt;Couch, Carl J. Information Technologies and Social Orders. Transaction Publishers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;But using his own examples to amplify Ong's thought, McLuhan shows how each stage in the development of this technology throughout the [[history of communication]] – from the invention of speech (primary orality), to [[pictograms]],  to the [[Phonetic transcription|phonetic alphabet]], to [[typography]], to the electronic communications of today – restructures human consciousness, profoundly changing not only the frontiers of human possibility, but even the frontiers it is possible for humans to imagine.

===Primary orality===
'Primary orality' refers to thought and its verbal expression within cultures "totally untouched by any knowledge of [[writing]] or [[Printing|print]]."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=11}}

All [[sound]] is inherently powerful. If a hunter kills a lion he can see it, touch it, feel it and smell it. But if he hears a lion he must act, fast, because the sound of the lion signals its presence and its power. [[Speech communication|Speech]] is a form of sound that shares this common power. Like other sounds, it comes from within a living organism. A text can be ignored; it is just writing on paper. But to ignore speech can be unwise; our basic instincts compel us to pay attention.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p= 32}}

Writing is powerful in a different way: it permits people to generate ideas, store them, and retrieve them as needed across time in a highly efficient and accurate way. The absence of this technology in oral societies limits the development of complex ideas and the [[institution]]s that depend on them. Instead, sustained thought in oral settings depends on interpersonal communication, and storing complex ideas over a long period of time requires packaging them in highly memorable ways, generally by using [[mnemonic]] tools.

In his studies of the [[Homeric Question]], [[Milman Parry]] was able to show that the poetic metre found in the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' had been 'packaged' by oral [[Greece|Greek]] society to meet its information management needs. These insights first opened the door to a wider appreciation of the sophistication of [[oral tradition]]s, and their various methods of managing information.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first = Adam | editor-last = Parry | title = The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry | publisher = Clarendon Press, Oxford| year = 1971|page = 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, ancient and medieval mnemonic tools were extensively documented by [[Frances Yates]] in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]''.{{harv|Yates|1966}}

===Residual orality===
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Socrates in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', quoting the prophecy of [[Amun|Ammon]] (Thamus) : ''"[Writing] will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. [..] You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom.."'' (trans. H.N. Fowler; Line 275)]]
‘Residual orality’ refers to thought and its verbal expression in cultures that have been exposed to writing and print, but have not fully ‘interiorized’ (in McLuhan’s term) the use of these technologies in their daily lives.  As a culture interiorizes the technologies of literacy, the ‘oral residue’ diminishes.

But the availability of a technology of literacy to a society is not enough to ensure its widespread diffusion and use.  For example, [[Eric Havelock]] observed in ''A Preface to Plato'' that after the [[ancient Greeks]] invented writing they adopted a [[scribe|scribal]] culture that lasted for generations.  Few people, other than the scribes, considered it necessary to learn to read or write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Havelock | first = Eric A.| title = A Preface to Plato | publisher =  Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts| year =1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other societies, such as [[ancient Egypt]] or [[medieval Europe]], literacy has been a domain confined to political and religious elites.

Many cultures have experienced an equilibrium state in which writing and mass illiteracy have co-existed for hundreds or even thousands of years.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp= 92–93}}

Oral residue rarely disappears quickly and never vanishes completely.  [[Speech communication|Speech]] is inherently an oral event, based on human relationships, unlike texts.  Oral societies can mount strong resistance to literate technologies, as vividly shown in the arguments of [[Socrates]] against writing in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]]''.  Writing, Socrates argues, is inhuman.  It attempts to turn living thoughts dwelling in the [[human mind]] into mere objects in the physical world.  By causing people to rely on what is written rather than what they are able to think, it weakens the powers of the mind and of memory.  True knowledge can only emerge from a relationship between active human minds.  And unlike a person, a text can’t respond to a question; it will just keep saying the same thing over and over again, no matter how often it is refuted.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=78–79}}

The Canadian communications scholar, [[Harold Innis]] argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece in Plato's time. Plato conveyed his ideas by writing down the conversations of Socrates thus "preserving the power of the spoken word on the written page." [[Aristotle]], Innis wrote, regarded Plato's style as "halfway between poetry and prose." Plato was able to arrive at new philosophical positions "through the use of dialogues, allegories and illustrations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Harold | first = Innis | title = Empire and Communications | location= Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press | year = 1950 | pages = 68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as McLuhan emphasizes, modernization attenuates some oral capabilities.  For example, in medieval Europe silent reading was largely unknown.  This tilted the readers' attention towards the poetic and other auditory aspects of the text.  Educated modern adults may also occasionally long for something like "the capacious medieval memory, which, untrammeled by the associations of print, could learn a strange language with ease and by the methods of a child, and could retain in memory and reproduce lengthy epic and elaborate lyric poems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=McLuhan|edition=1962| first=H.J. | last =Chaytor | title = From Script to Print|publisher=  Heffer and Sons|location= Cambridge| year= 1945| page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
McLuhan and Ong also document the apparent re-emergence, in the electronic age, of a kind of '[[secondary orality]]' that displaces written words with audio/visual technologies like [[radio]], [[telephones]], and [[television]].  Unlike primary oral modes of communication, these technologies depend on print for their existence.  Mass Internet collaborations, such as Wikipedia, rely primarily on writing, but re-introduce relationships and responsiveness into the text.

===Importance of the concept===
:''For more details on the social, economic and other effects of literacy or illiteracy see [[Literacy]]''
It has been a habit of literate cultures to view oral cultures simply in terms of their lack of the technologies of writing. This habit, argues Ong, is dangerously misled. Oral cultures are living cultures in their own right. A 1971 study found that of 3,000 extant languages, only 78 had a written [[literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edmonson, Monro E.|title=Lore: An Introduction to the Science of Folklore and Literature|publisher= Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston|location= New York|date= 1971|pages= 323, 332}}&lt;/ref&gt; While literacy extends human possibilities in both thought and action, all literate technologies ultimately depend on the ability of humans to learn oral languages and then translate sound into symbolic imagery.

Understanding between nations may depend to some degree on understanding oral culture. Ong argues that "many of the contrasts often made between 'western' and other views seem reducible to contrasts between deeply interiorized literacy and more or less residually oral states of consciousness."{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=29}}

==Theory of the characteristics of oral culture==
Drawing on hundreds of studies from [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]] and the study of [[oral tradition]], Ong summarizes ten key aspects of the '[[psychodynamics]] of orality'. While these are subject to continuing debate, his list remains an important milestone. Ong draws his examples from both primary oral societies, and societies with a very high 'oral residue'.

===Formulaic styling===
To retain complex ideas requires that they be packaged memorably for easy recall.

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| To solve effectively the problem of retaining and retrieving carefully articulated thought, you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral recurrence. Your thoughts must come into being in heavily rhythmic, balanced patterns, in repetitions or antithesis, in alliterations or assonances, in epithetic and other formulary expressions… Serious thought is intertwined with memory systems.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=34}}
|}

Anthropologist [[Marcel Jousse]] identifies a close linkage between [[rhythm]] and breathing patterns, gestures and the bilateral symmetry of the human body in several ancient verse traditions.{{sfn|Ong|2002|loc=p.34 citing {{harv|Jousse|1978}} }} This synergy between the body and the construction of oral thought further fuels memory.

===Additive rather than subordinative===
Oral cultures avoid complex 'subordinative' clauses. Ong cites an example from the [[Douay-Rheims]] version of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] (1609–10), noting that this basic additive pattern (in ''italics'') has been identified in many oral contexts around the world:{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=37}}

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning God created heaven and earth. ''And'' the earth was void and empty, ''and'' darkness was on the face of the deep; ''and'' the spirit of God moved over the waters. ''And'' God said …
|}

Demonstrating how oral modes of communication tend to evolve into literate ones, Ong additionally cites the [[New American Bible]] (1970), which offers a translation that is grammatically far more complex:

:{|style="border:1px; border: thin solid white; background-color:#f6f6FF; margin:20px;" cellpadding="10"
|-
| In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters. Then God said …
|}

===Aggregative rather than analytic===
Oral expression brings words together in pithy phrases that are the product of generations of evolution: the 'sturdy oak tree', the 'beautiful princess' or 'clever Odysseus'. This does not apply specifically to [[poetry]] or [[song]]; rather the words are brought together out of habit during general communication. 'Analyzing' or breaking apart such expressions is risky: they represent the work of generations and "there is nowhere outside the mind to store them."

Ong cites an American example, noting that in some parts of the [[United States]] with heavy oral residue, until the early twentieth-century it was still considered normal or even obligatory to use the adjective ‘glorious’ when referring to the '[[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]'.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=39}}

===Redundant or 'copious'===
Speech that repeats earlier thoughts or thought-pictures, or shines a different light on them somehow, helps to keep both the speaker and the listener focused on the topic, and makes it easier for all to recall the key points later. "Oral cultures encourage fluency, fulsomeness, volubility. Rhetoricians were to call this [[Copia: Foundations of the Abundant Style|copia]]"{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=40}}

===Conservative or traditionalist===
Because oral societies have no effective access to writing and print technologies, they must invest considerable energy in basic [[information management]]. Storage of information, being primarily dependent on individual or collective recall, must be handled with particular thrift. It is possible to approximately measure oral residue "from the amount of memorization the culture's educational procedures require."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| editor-first =Jack|editor-last =  Goody| at = introduction, pp.13-14 | title = Literacy in traditional societies | publisher =  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge | year = 1968  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This creates incentives to avoid exploring new ideas and particularly to avoid the burden of having to store them. It does not prevent oral societies from demonstrating dynamism and change, but there is a premium on ensuring that changes cleave to traditional formulas, and "are presented as fitting the traditions of the ancestors."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=42}}

===Close to the human lifeworld===
Oral cultures take a practical approach to information storage. To qualify for storage, information must usually concern matters of immediate practical concern or familiarity to most members of the society.

Long after the invention of writing, and often long after the invention of print, basic information on how to perform a society’s most important trades was left unwritten, passed from one generation to the next as it always had been: through [[apprenticeship]], observation and practice.{{sfn|Ong|2002|p=43}}

By contrast, only literary cultures have launched phenomenological analyses, abstract classifications, ordered lists and tables, etc. Nothing analogous exists in oral societies.

===Agonistically toned===
[[File:Beowulf and the dragon.jpg|left|thumb|Beowulf fights the dragon: the oral world is agonistic]]
'Agonistic' means 'combative', but Ong actually advances a deeper thesis with this point. Writing and to an even greater extent print, he argues, disengage humans from direct, interpersonal struggle.

Products of "the highly polarized, agonistic, oral world of good and evil, virtue and vice, villains and heroes," the great works of [[oral literature]] from [[Homer]] to [[Beowulf]], from the [[Mwindo epic]] to the [[Old Testament]], are extremely violent by modern standards. They are also punctuated by frequent and intense intellectual combat and tongue-lashings on the one hand, and effusive praise (perhaps reaching its height among [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] [[griot|praise singers]]) on the other.{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=43–45}}

===Empathetic and participatory===
In an oral culture the most reliable and trusted technique for learning is to share a "close, empathetic, communal association" with others who know.

Ong cites a study of community decision-making from 12th Century [[England]]. Writing already had a long history in England, and it would have been possible to use texts to establish for example, the age of majority of the heir to an estate. But people were skeptical about texts, noting not only the cost of generating and managing them, but the problems involved in preventing tampering or frauds.

As a result, they retained the traditional solution: gathering together "mature wise seniors of many years, having good testimony", and publicly discussing the age of the heir with them, until agreement was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = M.T. |last = Clanchy | title = From Memory to Written Record, England 1066–1307 | publisher =  Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts | year =  1979 | pages = 230–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hallmark principle of orality, that truth emerges best from communal process, resonates today in the [[jury]] system.

===Homeostatic===
Oral societies conserve their limited capacity to store information, and retain the relevance of their information to the interest of their present members, by shedding memories that have lost their past significance.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|pp=31–34}}

While many examples exist, the classic example was reported by {{harvnb|Goody|Watt|1968}}. Written records prepared by the British in [[Ghana]] in the early 1900s show that [[Ndewura Jakpa]], the seventeenth century founder of the state of the [[Gonja people]], had seven sons, each of whom ruled a territorial division within the state. Six decades later two of the divisions had disappeared for various reasons. The myths of the Gonja had been revised to recount that Jakpa had five sons, and that five divisions were created.{{sfn|Goody|Watt|1968|p=33}} Since they had no practical, present purpose, the other two sons and divisions had evaporated.

===Situational rather than abstract===
In oral cultures, concepts are used in a way that minimizes abstraction, focusing to the greatest extent possible on objects and situations directly known by the speaker. A study by [[Alexander Luria]], a psychologist who did extensive fieldwork comparing oral and literate subjects in remote areas of [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kirghizia]] in 1931–2&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first = Aleksandr Romanovich | last = Luria | title = Cognitive Development: Its Social and Cultural Foundations| editor-first = Michael |editor-last = Cole| translator-first =Martin | translator-last = Lopez-Morillas |translator-first2 = Lynn | translator-last2= Solotaroff |publisher = Harvard University Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London| year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; documented the highly situational nature of oral thinking.

* Oral subjects always used real objects they were familiar with to refer to geometric shapes; for example a plate or the moon might be used to refer to a circle.
* Asked to select three similar words from the following list "hammer, saw, log, hatchet", oral subjects would reject the literate solution (removing the log to produce a list of 3 tools), pointing out that without the log there wasn't much use for the tools.
* Oral subjects took a practical, not an abstract, approach to syllogisms. Luria asked them this question. ''In the far north, where there is snow, all bears are white. Novaya Zemlya is in the far north and there is always snow there. What colour are the bears?'' Typical response: "I don't know. I've seen a black bear. I've never seen any others. … Every locality has its own animals."
* Oral subjects proved unwilling to analyze themselves. When asked "what sort of person are you?" one responded: "What can I say about my own heart? How can I talk about my character? Ask others; they can tell you about me. I myself can’t say anything."{{sfn|Ong|2002|pp=49–54}}

'''Patter''' is a prepared and practiced [[Speech communication|speech]] that is designed to produce a desired response from its audience. Examples of occupations with a patter might include the [[auctioneer]], [[salesperson]], [[dance caller]], [[magician (illusionist)|magician]], or [[comedian]].

The term may have been a colloquial shortening of "[[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]", and may have referred to the practice of mouthing or mumbling [[prayers]] quickly and mechanically.

From this, it became a slang word for the secret and equally incomprehensible mutterings of a [[cant language]] used by beggars, thieves, gypsies, etc., and then the fluent plausible talk that a [[cheap-jack]] employs to pass off his goods. Many [[illusionist]]s, e.g., [[card magic]]ians, use patter both to enhance the show and to distract the attention of the spectators.

It is thus also used of any rapid manner of talking, and of a [[patter-song]], in which a very large number of words have to be sung at high speed to fit the music. A western square dance [[Caller (dancing)#The modern Western square dance caller|caller]] may interpolate patter—in the form of metrical lines, often of nonsense—to fill in between commands to the dancers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 Square Dance Patter Sayings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102112218/http://www.ceder.net/choreo/patter_sayings.php4 |date=2013-01-02 }} Vic &amp; Debbie Ceder's Square Dance Resource Net.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some circumstances, the talk becomes a different sense of "patter": to make a series of rapid strokes or pats, as of raindrops. Here it a form of [[onomatopoeia]].

In certain forms of entertainment, [[peep show]]s (in the historical meaning) and Russian ''[[rayok]]'', patter is an important component of a show.  The [[radio DJ]] patter is among the roots of [[rapping]].

In [[hypnotherapy]], the hypnotist uses a 'patter' or script to deliver positive suggestions for change to the client.

In ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'', [[Henry Mayhew]] divides the street-sellers of his time into two groups: the ''patterers'', and everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2006/05/grafter200605?currentPage=all "The Gentleman Grafter"] by Howard Kaplan, May 2006.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2276">A '''Planning and Zoning Commission''' is a local [[election|elected]] or appointed [[government]] board charged with recommending to the local town or city council the boundaries of the various original [[zoning]] district and appropriate regulations to be enforced therein and any proposed amendments thereto and shall collect data and keep itself informed as to the best practices generally in effect in the matter city planning and zoning to the end that it may be qualified to act on measures affecting the present and future movement of traffic, the segregation of residential and business districts and the convenience and safety of persons and property in any way dependent on city planning and zoning. Some jurisdictions may refer to them also planning commissions, planning boards, zoning commissions, and zoning boards.

The [[chairman]] of the Planning and Zoning Commission (or a staff member) is responsible for publishing public hearing in the newspaper about certain matters that come before the commission.  Most [[municipal]] or [[County (United States)|county]] Planning and Zoning Commissions consist of five to seven members.  This number does not include alternates. In some states, planning and zoning commissions are regional or county.

Some communities elect planning and zoning commission members.  In other [[jurisdictions]], the Planning and Zoning Commissioners are appointed by the [[Mayor]] or [[First Selectman]] of the [[city]] or [[town]] and approved by the city's legislative body, i.e. [[city council]], [[board of aldermen]], etc. (some planning commissioners are appointed by the City Commission as a whole). 

Please note that planning and zoning commissions may also be approving agencies for development permits, variances to the zoning code. Other jurisdictions may have separate zoning board of adjustments or appeals appointed by the governing body that perform the function instead of the planning and zoning commission doing it. Some jurisdictions have featured court appointed zoning boards/boards of adjustment and appeals due to the quasi-judicial functions.

As a [[Philosophy of education|teaching methodology]], process drama developed primarily from the work of [[Brian Way]], [[Dorothy Heathcote]] and [[Gavin Bolton]]&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1979) ''Towards a theory of drama in education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M. (1984) ''Drama as education''. Longman, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, G. M.

M. and Dorothy Heathcote (1995) ''Drama for Learning: Dorothy Heathcote's Mantle of the Expert Approach to Education (Dimensions of Drama Series)''. Heinemann Drama.&lt;/ref&gt; and through the work of other leading [[drama]] practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Norah and Juliana Saxton (1987) ''Teaching Drama: A Mind of Many Wonders.''

Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrice Baldwin|Baldwin, Patrice]] (1991) ''Stimulating drama: Cross curricular approaches to drama in the primary school.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily O'Neill]] describes process drama being used to explore a problem, situation, theme or series of related ideas or themes through the use of the artistic medium of unscripted drama. Process drama was described by O'Mara (1999) as" a dynamic way of working that requires teachers to reflect-in-action",&lt;ref&gt;O'Mara, Joanne. 1999.

Accessible at: https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/items/427f6837-6772-8177-ddc0-5a341ddb544d/1/ &lt;/ref&gt; constantly dealing with unique situations that require novel approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Schön, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; It has its roots in dramatic play, where normally developing children in every [[culture]] in the world will create their own imagined worlds, often with the co-participation of an [[empathy|empathetic]] adult (usually the parent) in role.

Process drama in school settings usually involves the whole class working with the teacher in role in a made-up [[scenario]].  When they are working in process drama, the students and teachers work together to create an imaginary dramatic world within which issues are considered and problems can be solved. In this world they work together to explore problems and issues such as, "How do communities deal with change?", "How do we accept other people into our community?" or themes such as environmental [[sustainability]], betrayal, truth and other [[ethical]] and moral issues. Sometimes the work may begin as light-hearted, but the teacher always layers more dramatic tension and complexity into the work as the teacher is aiming for a [[pedagogical]] outcome. Students learn to think beyond their own points of view and consider multiple perspectives on a topic through playing different roles. For instance, if the issue being discussed is logging a forest, they may play the [[Lumberjack|loggers]], people who live in the forest community and [[environmentalist]]s. Playing a range of positions encourages them to be able to recast themselves as the "other" and to consider life from that viewpoint, thereby creating complexity and enabling us to explore multiple dimensions of the topic.  Process drama does what the character [[Atticus Finch]] advocates: the ability to work for [[social justice]] comes from the ability to understand another perspective—to be able to try on someone else's shoes and walk around in them for a while. Process drama allows us to "try on" other people's shoes, to walk the paths they tread and to see how the world looks from their point of view.

Process drama is also suggested as a tool to promote literacy development through opportunities for dramatic play in early childhood settings within which children speak for a range of purposes in role.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ping-Yun.

[[File:Mikhail bakhtin.jpg|thumb|[[Mikhail Bakhtin]], author of ''Rabelais and His World'', pictured in 1920]]
'''''Rabelais and His World''''' (Russian: Творчество Франсуа Рабле и народная культура средневековья и Ренессанса, ''Tvorčestvo Fransua Rable i narodnaja kul'tura srednevekov'ja i Renessansa''; 1965) is a scholarly work which is considered one of [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s most important texts and now a classic of [[Renaissance]] studies. In the work Bakhtin explores ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' by the French Renaissance writer [[François Rabelais]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Bakhtin argues that for centuries Rabelais’s book has been misunderstood. Bakhtin attempts to redress this and clarify Rabelais's intentions through two methods: recovery of sections of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'' that were previously either ignored or suppressed, and analysis of the [[Renaissance]] social system in order to discover the balance between language that was permitted and language that was not. Through this analysis, Bakhtin pinpoints two important subtexts: ''carnival'' ([[carnivalesque]]) which Bakhtin describes as a social institution, and ''[[grotesque body|grotesque realism]],'' which is defined as a literary mode.  

Thus, in ''Rabelais and His World'' Bakhtin studies the interaction between the social and the literary, as well as the meaning of the body.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 297-299&lt;/ref&gt; As written, ''Rabelais and His World'' not only examines the openness of ''Gargantua and Pantagruel'', it also serves as an example of such openness.

==History of the text==
Bakhtin completed his book on Rabelais (titled ''Rabelais in the History of Realism'') in 1940. After several attempts to get the book published fell through, it was submitted as a dissertation for the [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree at the [[Gorky Institute of World Literature]] in Moscow. At the dissertation's defense in 1946, all three official opponents were in favor of awarding Bakhtin a [[Higher doctorate|higher doctoral degree]]: the [[Doctor of Sciences]], and their motion was accepted with a narrow majority vote. However, following an assault on the institute published in the press at the time, and after six years of repeated revisions and deliberations, USSR's [[Higher Attestation Commission|VAK]] decided Bakhtin would only receive the [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree&lt;ref&gt;See commentary to vol. 4 of Bakhtin's Collected Writings (''Sobranie sochinenii'', Moscow: Russkie Slovari, 2008–2010)&lt;/ref&gt; (roughly equivalent to a [[research doctorate]]). The book was eventually published in Russian in 1965, under the title ''Rabelais and Folk Culture of the Middle Ages and Renaissance''. Its 1968 English translation by Hélène Iswolsky was given the title, ''Rabelais and His World''.

==Carnival==
{{Main article|Carnivalesque}}
For Bakhtin, ''carnival'' is associated with the collectivity. Those attending a carnival do not merely constitute a crowd; rather the people are seen as a
whole, organized in a way that defies socioeconomic and political organization.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist 302"&gt;Clark and Holquist 302&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bakhtin, “[A]ll were considered equal during carnival.  Here, in the town square, a special form of free and familiar contact reigned among people who were usually divided by the barriers of caste, property, profession, and age”.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin 10&lt;/ref&gt; The carnival atmosphere holds the lower strata of life most important, as opposed to higher functions (thought, speech, soul) which were usually held dear in the signifying order. At carnival time, the unique sense of time and space causes individuals to feel they are a part of the collectivity, at which point they cease to be themselves.  It is at this point that, through costume and mask, an individual exchanges bodies and is renewed.  At the same time there arises a heightened awareness of one’s sensual, material, bodily unity and community.&lt;ref name="Clark and Holquist 302"/&gt;

==Grotesque==

{{Main article|Grotesque body}}

Bakhtin’s notion of ''carnival'' is connected with that of the ''grotesque''. In the carnival, usual social hierarchies and proprieties are upended; emphasis is placed on the body in its open dimension, in its connection to the life of the community. This emphasis on the material dimension which links humans, rather than on the differences and separations between them, allows for the consciousness of the historical dimension of human life: for every death, there is a birth, a renewal of the human spirit. This process allows for progress.&lt;br&gt;
In the grotesque body, emphasis is placed on the open, the penetrative, and the "lower stratum." The open (the mouth, the anus, the vagina, etc.) and the penetrative (the nose, the penis, etc.) allow exchange between the body and the world (mostly through sex, eating, and drinking), but also to produce degrading material (curses, urine, feces, etc.). The lower stratum (belly, womb, etc.) is the place where renewal happens, where new life is forged, thus connecting degradation to renewal. The grotesque body is one of excess, rebellious to authority and austerity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakhtin|first=Mikhail|title=Rabelais and His World|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|isbn=9780253348302|pages=303–436}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Due to its inscription in time and its emphasis on bodily changes (through [[eating]], [[Defecation|evacuation]], and [[sex]]), the ''grotesque'' has been interpreted by some critics as a dimension of the body that permits to perceive the historicity of man: it is in this reading used as a measuring device.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Holquist 303&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of laughter==
Bakhtin opens this work with a quotation from [[Alexander Herzen]]: "It would be extremely interesting to write the history of laughter".&lt;ref&gt;chap.1, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary expressions of the [[ancient world]]'s conceptions of laughter is the text that survives in the form of apocryphal letters of  [[Hippocrates]] about [[Democritus]] ([[Hippocratic Corpus]], ''Epistles'' 10–21).&lt;ref name="p.66-67"&gt;p.66-67&lt;/ref&gt; The laughter of Democritus had a philosophical character, being directed at the life of man and at all the vain fears and hopes related to the gods and to life after death. Democritus here made of his laughter a complete conception of the world, a certain spiritual premise of the man who has attained maturity and has awakened. Hippocrates finally perfectly agreed with him.&lt;ref name="p.66-67"/&gt;

'''Reflexiveness''' is one of [[Charles Hockett]]'s 16 [[Design features of language]] which states that in a language the speaker can use his/her language to talk about language. Speakers of a language are able to have knowledge about their language and be able to reflect upon it.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, Matthew. "Child Language: acquisition and development".

'''Regional geography''' is a major branch of [[geography]]. It focuses on the interaction of different cultural and natural geofactors in a specific land or landscape, while its counterpart, systematic geography, concentrates on a specific geofactor at the global level. 

== Basics ==
Attention is paid to unique characteristics of a particular region such as natural elements, human elements, and [[Regionalism (politics)|regionalization]] which covers the techniques of delineating space into [[region]]s. Rooted in the tradition of the German speaking countries, the two pillars of regional geography are the idiographic study of ''Länder'' or spatial individuals (specific places, countries, continents) and the typological study of ''Landschaften'' or spatial types (landscapes such as coastal regions, mountain regions, border regions, etc.).

== Approach ==
Regional geography is also a certain approach to geographical study, comparable to [[quantitative revolution|quantitative geography]] or [[critical geography]]. This approach prevailed during the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, a period when then regional geography paradigm was central within the geographical sciences. It was later criticised for its descriptiveness and the lack of theory. Strong criticism was leveled against it in particular during the 1950s and the [[quantitative revolution]]. Main critics were G. H. T. Kimble&lt;ref&gt;Kimble, G.H.T. (1951): ''The Inadequacy of the Regional Concept'', London Essays in Geography, edd. L.D. Stamp and S.W. Wooldridge, pp. 492-512.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fred K. Schaefer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, F.K. (1953): ''Exceptionalism in Geography: A Methodological Examination'', [[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]], vol. 43, pp. 226-245.&lt;/ref&gt; The regional geography paradigm has influenced many other geographical sciences, including [[economic geography]] and [[geomorphology]]. Regional geography is still taught in some universities as a study of the major regions of the world, such as Northern and Latin America, Europe, and Asia and their countries. In addition, the notion of a city-region approach to the study of geography, underlining urban-rural interactions, gained credence since the mid-1980s. Some geographers have also attempted to reintroduce a certain amount of regionalism since the 1980s. This involves a complex definition of regions and their interactions with other [[scale (spatial)|scale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod, G. and Jones, M. (2001): ''Renewing The Geography of Regions'', Environment and Planning D, 16(9), pp. 669-695.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable figures ==
Notable figures in regional geography were [[Alfred Hettner]] in Germany, with his concept of [[chorology]]; [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] in France, with the [[Possibilism (geography)|possibilism]] approach (possibilism being a softer notion than [[environmental determinism]]); and, in the United States, [[Richard Hartshorne]] with his concept of areal differentiation. The school of [[Carl O. Sauer]], strongly influenced by  Alfred Hettner and Paul Vidal de la Blache, is also seen as regional geography in its broadest sense.

'''Repurposing''' is the process by which an object with one [[use value]] is transformed or redeployed as an object with an alternative use value.

==Description==
Repurposing is as old as [[human civilization]], with many contemporary scholars investigating that way that different societies re-appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/04/medieval-recycling/ | title=Medieval Recycling | publisher=Harvard Gazette | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, repurposing has been celebrated by 21st century hobbyists and arts-and-crafts organizations such as [[Instructables]] and other [[Maker culture]] communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the 21st century.  Recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to American left- and right-[[libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Malewitz, R. (2014) {{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=22814 | title=The Practice of Misuse | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www-sup.stanford.edu/book.cgi?id=3195 | title=Throwaways: Work Culture and Consumer Education | publisher=Stanford University Press | accessdate=20 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repurposing is the use of a tool being re-channeled into being another tool, usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool-maker. Typically, repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk, garbage, or obsolete. A good example of this would be the [[Earthship]] style of house, that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls. Reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose.  Examples of repurposing include using tires as [[boat fender]]s and [[steel drum]]s or plastic drums as [[feeding trough]]s and/or composting bins. [[Incinerator]] and power plant exhaust stack [[fly-ash]] is used extensively as an [[concrete additive|additive to concrete]], providing increased strength. This type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes, for example using worn-out clothes as [[Textile|rags]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diyncrafts.com/6081/repurpose/100-ways-repurpose-reuse-broken-household-items | title=100 Ways to Repurpose and Reuse Broken Household Items | publisher=DIY &amp; Crafts | accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all repurposing is necessarily environmentally friendly, take for instance the idea of repurposing older work trucks for businesses in their infancy, in which their poor fuel economy can negate long term benefits since greater spending of money for fuel, and more fumes output to the sky can prove to be environmentally unfriendly, in which repurposing vehicles for [[Electric vehicle conversion|electric car conversion]] can be the recommended alternative to that, though its cost can be negligible upfront.

==Examples==

[[File:WestBankCowbell.jpg|thumb|An improvised [[cowbell]], used for sheep or goats. The bell was found in 1988 in a field near [[Tuqu']] (Tekoa) in the Judean hills, the West Bank. The bell's body is made of aluminum, probably a broken kitchen utensil, while the clapper is a brass cartridge case (SMI 25 NATO, probably 7.62×51mm).]]

===Automobiles===
*[[Full-size van]]s from the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] which have been used for airport shuttle service have been repurposed as church vans mainly because of some [[depreciation]] to facilitate affordable cost for thrifty church groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enrichmentjournal.ag.org/200401/200401_54_sb6_vans.cfm | title=What Church Leaders Should Know About Church Vans | publisher=Enrichment Journal | accessdate=3 August 2014 | author=Hammar, Richard R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronics===
*A [[USB dead drop]] can be mounted on a [[brick wall]] since this gives an opportunity to repurpose older USB flash drives with obsolete capacities to continue service for file transfer (especially anonymous ones) that don't demand more than one [[gigabyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deaddrops.com/dead-drops/participate/ |title=How to make your own |publisher=Deaddrops.com |date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Everdrive]] and other flash video game cartridges have offered opportunities to download [[ROM image]]s of video game cartridges onto [[SD card]]s while offering opportunities to repurpose real vintage video game consoles for retro gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130329014653/http://www.stoneagegamer.com/mega-everdrive-deluxe.html Stoneagegamer's article on the Everdrive]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Old Android smartphones, which tend to have little computing resources yet which are unused and probably contain a triaxial [[accelerometer]] of decent specifications, can be used as an amateur seismograph node for a distributed seismography project, e.g., [[Quake-Catcher Network]].
*Discarded or new consumer COTS surplus parabolic reflectors intended for use for C band satellite TV reception can be repurposed for a wide gamut of applications for which a consumer-grade reflector of low gain is adequate, incl. amateur microwave SETI (mainly [[Project Argus]]), Wi-Fi links, and microwave [[amateur radio]] [[radio beacons]].

===As a tactic for manufacturing goods===
* [[Right-hand-drive]] [[Jeep]] brand vehicles, such as the [[Jeep Wrangler]], which are initially slated for import to right-hand-drive countries, have had some specially designed versions repurposed for US and Canada [[postal service]] mail carrying, in which this tactic of repurposing can consolidate the overhead of retooling for specialty manufacturing of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rightdrivejeeps4postal.com/ US Drive Right: The Nation's Largest Seller Of Used Factory
Right Hand Drive Vehicles For Postal Carriers&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1262">A '''''roman à tiroirs''''' (French for "novel with/made of drawers") is a French term for a novel in which the principal or main [[narrative]] (or "[[frame story]]") is interrupted by secondary narratives (involving secondary characters and/or told by other narrators), which may in turn themselves be interrupted by further narratives/narrators.  As such, it is a form of the "[[story within a story]]" [[literary device]] in which the fiction is nested in two or more layers and where the resolution of the main narrative is delayed because of the inserted secondary tales/stories.  In French, the embedded narratives are referred to as ''récits enchâssés'' or ''récits emboités''.

The expression "à tiroirs" as applied to a work of literature dates from 1752, and appears to have been used originally in reference to theater and plays (a "pièce à tiroirs" or "comédie à tiroirs").&lt;ref&gt;''"Romans à tiroirs" d'hier et d'aujourd'hui: Parodie et experimentation romanesque."'' Maria Eduarda Keating. [http://encls.net/files/Keating.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3361">The '''setting''' is both the [[time]] and [[location (geography)|geographic location]] within a [[narrative]], either [[non-fiction|nonfiction]] or [[fiction]]. A [[literary element]], the setting helps initiate the main [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]] and [[Mood (literature)|mood]] for a story. Setting has been referred to as story world &lt;ref&gt;[[#Truby|Truby]], 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Social environment|milieu]]'' to include a [[Context (language use)|context]] (especially [[society]]) beyond the immediate surroundings of the story. Elements of setting may include [[culture]], [[historical period]], [[geography]], and [[hour]]. Along with the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Character (arts)|character]], [[Theme (literature)|theme]], and [[Style (fiction)|style]], setting is considered one of the fundamental components of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Obstfeld|Obstfeld]], 2002, pp.1,65,115,171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
Setting is an important element in a narrative and in some works the setting becomes a character itself. The term setting is often used to refer to the social milieu in which the events of a novel occur&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lodge|Lodge]], 1992, pp.58-60.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[novelist]] [[Donna Levin]] has described how this social milieu shapes the characters’ values.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Levin|Levin]], 1992, pp.110-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the story setting include the passage of time, which may be static in some stories or dynamic in others with, for example, changing seasons.

==Types==
Setting may take various forms:
* [[Alternate history (fiction)|Alternate history]]
* [[Campaign setting]]
* [[Constructed world]]
* [[Dystopia]]
* [[Fantasy world]]
* [[Fictional city]]
* [[Fictional country]]
* [[Fictional crossover]]
* [[Fictional location]]
* [[Fictional universe]]
* [[Future history]]
* [[Imaginary world]]
* [[Mythical place]]
* [[Parallel universe (fiction)|Parallel universe]]
* [[Planets in science fiction]]
* [[Simulated reality]]
* [[Virtual reality]]
* [[Utopia]]

'''Street theatre''' is a form of [[theatre|theatrical]] [[performance]] and presentation in outdoor [[public space]]s without a specific paying audience. These spaces can be anywhere, including [[Shopping mall|shopping centres]], [[Parking lot|car parks]], recreational reserves, college or university campus and street corners. They are especially seen in outdoor spaces where there are large numbers of people. The actors who perform street theatre range from [[busking|busker]]s to organised theatre companies or groups that want to experiment with performance spaces, or to promote their mainstream work. It was a source of providing information to people when there were no sources of providing information like television, radio etc. Nowadays, street play is used to convey a message to the crowd watching it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2011/08/street-plays-a-means-of-spreading-awareness/&lt;/ref&gt; Street play is considered to be the rawest form of acting, because one does not have a microphone or loud speakers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Sometimes performers are commissioned, especially for street [[festival]]s, children's shows or [[parade]]s, but more often street theatre performers are unpaid or gather some income through the dropping of a coin in a hat by the audience.

The logistics of doing street theatre necessitate simple [[costume]]s and [[Theatrical property|prop]]s, and often there is little or no [[Electronic amplifier|amplification]] of sound, with actors depending on their natural [[human voice|vocal]] and physical ability. This issue with sound has meant that [[physical theatre]], including dance, [[mime artist|mime]] and [[slapstick]], is a very popular genre in an outdoor setting. The performances need to be highly visible, loud and simple to follow in order to attract a crowd.

Street theatre should be distinguished from other more formal outdoor theatrical performances, such as performances in a park or garden, where there is a discrete space set aside (or [[rope]]d off) and a [[Ticket (admission)|ticketed]] audience.

In some cases, street theatre performers have to get a [[licence]] or specific permission through [[local government|local]] or [[State (subnational)|state]] [[government]]s in order to perform. Many performers travel internationally&lt;ref&gt;[http://performers.net/ International list of performers]&lt;/ref&gt; to certain locations of note.

Street theatre is arguably the oldest form of theatre in existence: most mainstream entertainment mediums can be traced back to origins in street performing, including religious [[passion plays]] and many other forms. More recently performers who, a hundred years ago, would have made their living working in [[variety theatre]]s, [[music hall]]s and in [[vaudeville]], now often perform professionally in the many well-known street performance areas throughout the world. Notable performers that began their careers as street theatre performers include [[Robin Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;Robin Williams began his career on the streets of San Francisco as a street performer: https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800013042/bio&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bowie]], [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] and [[Harry Anderson]].

Street theatre allows people who might not have ever been to, or been able to afford to go to, traditional theatre. The audience is made up of anyone and everyone who wants to watch and for most performances is free entertainment.

==Reasons for staging work on the street==

Performance artists with an interest in social activism may choose to stage their work on the street as a means of directly confronting or engaging the public. For example, multimedia artist Caeser Pink and his group of performers known as The Imperial Orgy staged a piece titled ''Our Daily Bread''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/CaeserPinkOurDailyBread-OrgyStreetTheateronWallStreet Archive Video]&lt;/ref&gt; that brought performers onto the streets of the New York's financial district to ceremoniously lay loaves of [[Wonder Bread]] along the sidewalks, each with an advertisement from Satan offering to buy people's souls in exchange for material possessions. The performance caused an uproar when police were called out and bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in to inspect the loaves of bread for explosives.

Other artists consider a paying, theatre-going public to be unrepresentative of the public to whom they are trying to communicate, and performing to 'the man on the street' may be considered a more democratic form of dissemination.

Some contemporary street theatre practitioners have extensively studied pre-existing street and popular theatre traditions, such as [[Carnival]], [[commedia dell'arte]] etc. and wish to present them in a situation close to their original context.

Whatever the reason for choosing the street, the street is a place with a different set of possibilities than the conventional theatre space. Sue Gill of [[Welfare State International]] argues that a street theatre performance is not a lesser form than an indoor performance, nor is it simply taking what you do on stage and placing it outdoors, but a form with an energy and an integrity of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor-last = Coult | editor-first = Tony | editor2-last = Kershaw | editor2-first = Baz | title = Engineers of the Imagination: The Welfare State Handbook | publisher = Methuen | year = 1983 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oPkCAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=engineers+of+the+imagination&amp;dq=engineers+of+the+imagination&amp;pgis=1 | isbn = 0-413-52800-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PSI India street play.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A street play (''nukkad natak'') in [[Dharavi]] slums in Mumbai]].
Many companies are politically motivated and use street theatre to combine performance with protest. This has occurred through the [[guerrilla theatre]] of [[San Francisco Mime Troupe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Doyle | first = Michael William | title = Imagine Nation: The American Counterculture of the '60s and '70s | publisher = Routeledge | year = 2001 | url = http://www.diggers.org/guerrilla_theater.htm | isbn = 0-415-93040-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Living Theatre]], the carnivalesque parades of [[Bread and Puppet Theatre]], and the work of [[Ashesh Malla]] and the Sarwanam Theatre Group of [[Nepal]].

A character-based street theatre which developed in the 1960s and 1970s was developed by groups like Lumiere and Son, John Bull Puncture Repair Kit, Exploded Eye and Natural Theatre Company. The performances were unannounced and featured characters who acted out a pre-arranged scenario, looking beautiful or surreal or simply just involving passers by in conversation. They did not seek to trick in a ''[[Candid Camera]]'' way, but rather invited the audience to pretend along with them. No amount of planning or rehearsal could dictate what would happen.

Another example would be Natural Theatre's Pink Suitcase scenario. A number of smartly dressed people carrying bright pink suitcases enter a set of streets or buildings. They search for and miss their companions. In their search they get on buses, hail cabs, end up in shop windows, etc. By the time they meet up at a pre-arranged spot with the help of passers-by, perceptions of the area have changed and shopping has ceased for at least a few moments. The humour is universal and this piece has been seen in nearly seventy countries. It is usually performed by four or five actors, but has been done with twenty-five.

'''''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought''''' is a book on [[Modernism]] by historian [[William Everdell]], published in 1997 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. A ''[[New York Times]]'' Notable Book of 1997, ''The First Moderns'' suggests that "the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/07/books/notable-books-of-the-year-1997.html, "Notable Books of the Year 1997"], ''The New York Times,'' December 7, 1997. Accessed July 11, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997), 351&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and overview==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Everdell, Dean of Humanities at [[Saint Ann's School (New York City)|Saint Ann's School]] in Brooklyn Heights,&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/17/books/it-s-about-time-it-s-about-space.html "It's About Time. It's About Space."], ''The New York Times,'' August 17, 2003. Accessed July 28 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; posits that Modernism first emerged in the field of mathematics rather than the arts, specifically in the work of German mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]], who, in 1872, demonstrated that mathematicians operate without a continuum; this represents the formalization of Everdell's axiom of "ontological discontinuity," which he goes on to examine in a multiplicity of contexts. He examines this emerging framework of discreteness in science ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s mechanics, [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal|Cajal]]'s neuroscience, [[Hugo de Vries]]'s conception of the gene and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s quantum work, [[Einstein]]'s physics); mathematics, logic, and philosophy ([[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and the linguistic turn, [[Husserl]] and the beginnings of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]); in addition to the arts ([[James Joyce]]'s novels, [[Picasso]]'s [[Demoiselles d'Avignon|''Demoiselles D'Avignon'']], [[Schoenberg]]'s twelve-tone music).

==Reviews==

Critics largely reviewed ''The First Moderns'' favorably, appreciating Everdell's interdisciplinary approach, in publications including the [[New york review of books|''New York Review of Books'']], the ''New York Times,'' the [[Los Angeles Times|''Los Angeles Times,'']] and the [[Washington Post Book World|''Washington Post''.]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1999/05/20/infinitesimally-yours/ "Infinitesimally Yours"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''New York Review of Books,'' May 20, 1999. "Drawing together such disparate manifestations as Seurat's pointillism, Muybridge's stop-motion photography, the poetry of Whitman, Rimbaud, and Laforgue, the tone rows of Schoenberg, and the novels of Joyce, the author [Everdell] makes an engrossing and persuasive case for his claim that 'the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Kenner]], [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/970629.29kennert.html "A Change of Mind], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought'', ''The New York Times'', June 29, 1997. "The change started to happen in the 1870's [sic], and not, as William R. Everdell arrestingly demonstrates in ''The First Moderns,'' in painting or in literature but in number theory. He's aware that word-focused people will be startled: ''Everyone who has heard of modernism has heard of Picasso. Most have heard of Joyce. But who has heard of Dedekind?'' Yet it was an 1872 pamphlet of Richard Dedekind's that first, to use the terminology of 19th-century positivism, ''rigorized'' modernism's generic concept -- which, as Everdell reveals, is discontinuity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Morton]], [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/20/books/bk-14342 "Deconstructing Modernism"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''Los Angeles Times'', July 20, 1997. "''The First Moderns'' brilliantly maps the beginning of a path at whose end loom as many diasporas as there are men."&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3322">'''The Immanent Frame''' is a digital forum that publishes interdisciplinary perspectives on [[secularism]], [[religion]], and the [[public sphere]]. It was formed in conjunction with projects on [http://www.ssrc.org/programs/religion-and-the-public-sphere/ religion and the public sphere] at the [[Social Science Research Council]] (SSRC).  Initially conceived as an experimental blog that invited multiple contributions from a number of leading scholars in the humanities and social sciences, The Immanent Frame was launched in October 2007 by an SSRC team led by program director [http://blogs.ssrc.org/tif/author/vanantwerpen/ Jonathan VanAntwerpen], who served for several years as editor-in-chief.

Among other topics, The Immanent Frame launched with an extensive discussion of [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]]'s ''[[A Secular Age]]'' ([[Harvard University Press]], 2007). Sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] called ''A Secular Age'' "one of the most important books to be written in my lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssrc.org/blogs/immanent_frame/2007/10/19/secularism-of-a-new-kind/ The Immanent Frame: Secularism of a new kind]&lt;/ref&gt; The Immanent Frame's discussion of Taylor's book included original contributions by [[Robert Bellah]], [[Wendy Brown (political scientist)|Wendy Brown]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], and several others. The name of the digital forum itself alludes to a central concept in Taylor's book.

Additional contributors to The Immanent Frame have included: [[Arjun Appadurai]], [[Talal Asad]], [[Rajeev Bhargava]], [[Akeel Bilgrami]], José Casanova, [[Craig Calhoun]], [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[William E.

'''Theodorus of Gadara''' ({{lang-el|Θεόδωρος ὁ Γαδαρεύς}}) was a [[Greek language|Greek]] rhetorician of the 1st century BC who founded a rhetorical school in [[Gadara]] (present-day [[Um Qais]], [[Jordan]]), where he taught future [[Roman emperor]] [[Tiberius]] the art of [[rhetoric]]. It was written of Tiberius that:

: ''...even in his boyhood, his cruel and cold nature did not lie hidden. Theodorus of Gadara was his teacher of rhetoric and, in all his wisdom, seems to have been the first to have understood Tiberius and to have capped him with a very pithy saying when he taunted Tiberius, calling him 'Mud kneaded with blood'... ''.&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', Tiberius 57&lt;/ref&gt;

His other well-known pupil was Greek rhetorician [[Hermagoras of Temnos]], who later taught [[Public speaking|oratory]] in [[Rome]].

Theodorus was one of the two most famous rhetoric teachers of the time, the other being [[Apollodorus of Pergamon]]. Students of Apollodorus were commonly referred to as ''[[Apollodorean]]s'', while students of Theodorus were known as ''[[Theodorean]]s''.

==Works==
According to the [[Suda]], Theodorus wrote the following books, among others&lt;ref&gt;Suda θ 151&lt;/ref&gt;: 
*''On Questions in Pronunciation'' (Περὶ τῶν ἐν φωναῖς ζητουμένων, in 3 books)
*''On History'' (Περὶ ἱστορίας, 1 book)
*''On Thesis'' (Περὶ θέσεως, 1 book)
*''On the Similarity of Dialects and its Demonstration'' (Περὶ διαλέκτων ὁμοιότητος καὶ ἀποδείξεως, 2 books)
*''On the Constitution'' (Περὶ πολιτείας, 2 books)
*''On Coele Syria'' (Περὶ Κοίλης Συρίας, 1 book)
*''On the Capacity of the Orator'' (Περὶ ῥήτορος δυνάμεως, 1 book)

'''''ToryBoy The Movie''''' is a 2011 [[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]-style British documentary feature film directed by and starring [[John Walsh (filmmaker)|John Walsh]]. It follows Walsh as he becomes a political candidate for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the north east England constituency of [[Middlesbrough]]. 

==Background==
A staunch [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] supporter all his life, Walsh had become disillusioned with the party. When [[David Cameron]] opened the door to allow non party members to run for the Conservative candidacy ahead of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/5377839/David-Cameron-to-open-up-candidate-list-to-everyone.html|title=David Cameron to 'open up candidate list to everyone'|author=Chris Irvine|date=24 May 2009|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Walsh decided to do just that and document his experiences on camera.&lt;ref name="Young People"&gt;[https://youngpeopleinpolitics.org.uk/inspiration/interviews/ John Walsh interview, Young People In Politics, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt; He came third in the election; Stuart Bell remained the MP of Middlesbrough,&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-13960870|title=Tory Boy takes on Sir Stuart Bell in documentary film|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; but increased the Conservative vote to its highest in thirty years with an 18.8% share of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/c92.stm|title=BBC News - Election 2010 - Constituency - Middlesbrough|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The film==
The film was based on the 72 hours of footage made by Walsh on the campaign trail.&lt;ref name="Young People"/&gt; It made the case that [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Stuart Bell]] should not be the [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) of [[Middlesbrough]], as Bell was absent so often from Middlesbrough that he is an unsuitable candidate. Walsh showed the finished film in a free showing a year after the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723|title=Toryboy The Movie documentary up for award|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=5 August 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ''Who Can I vote For?'' website a humorous warning is given, "this film contains strong language throughout and scenes of politicians that some viewers may find offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/person/493/john-walsh|title=John Walsh for Member of Parliament for Middlesbrough in the 2010 General Election|website=Who Can I Vote For? by Democracy Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mike Amesbury]] appeared in the documentary protesting outside the Conservative conference in Manchester.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

Walsh paid homage to the great title designer [[Saul Bass]] and recreated his angular animations to create a fresh approach to telling this story. “This map cap comedy best captured the visual style and the transition of the film was making from a serious expose of the political shenanigans in the North East, to a political satire.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewhitebalance.com/work/toryboy-the-movie.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Walsh said that he took a risk making this film in an article with Digital Journal "For something like this, an investigative film, there will be some who think that I have exceeded my brief as a candidate. I would say that it is right to look at injustice and in this country people have died so that we may all have the right to question those in authority and those in public office."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/11509&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Northern Echo]]'' discussed the possible of the film forcing a new by election as a result of its findings. Walsh said he had been serious about becoming an MP and had self-funded his £15,000 election campaign. "When I got to Middlesbrough I found a town that politics had forgotten and a MP who was there in name only, a truly depressingly affair.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The film received positive reviews, with a high score of 8.8 on [[IMDb]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1740117/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2011 the film was nominated for the [[Grierson Awards]] for "Best Documentary on a Contemporary Theme".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.griersontrust.org/grierson-awards/past-awards/2011/the-grierson-awards-2011-shortlist/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://lfs.org.uk/content/john-walshs-tory-boy-movie-shortlisted-grierson-awards&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''[[Radio Times]]'' film review by Jeremy Aspinall on the film's re-release gave it four stars, and called it "A revealing and droll fly-on-the-wall documentary. It's a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations. Who would have thought politics could be so entertaining?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie|title=Toryboy the Movie|author=Jeremy Aspinall|work=RadioTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Details of the film's award nomination was covered by the Middlesbrough ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/toryboy-movie-documentary-up-award-3691723&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Irish Post]]'' Walsh’s “documentary about a rookie Conservative candidate aimed to provide an insight into British political culture, and in doing so uncovered the next big political scandal.” &lt;ref&gt;http://irishpost.co.uk/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election/&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Richard Moss]], the [[BBC]]'s North East &amp; Cumbria Political editor, "some silliness aside, it is a thought-provoking insight into the way our political system works or doesn't work on the ground... But I'm not sure he quite nails down a case against Stuart Bell.. And John Walsh doesn't help his case with some of the content in the film."&lt;ref name="bbc.com"/&gt; [[Liberal Democratic Party|Liberal Democrat]] commentator Mark Pack wrote on his blog that "John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is. It is a hugely enjoyable documentary, which mixes humour, drama and education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.markpack.org.uk/29694/toryboy-john-walsh-portrays-life-on-the-campaign-trail-as-it-really-is/|title=ToryBoy: John Walsh portrays life on the campaign trail as it really is|date=1 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A screening at the [[Frontline Club]] took place on 22 November 2011 followed by a Q&amp;A with John Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineclub.com/toryboy_visits_the_frontline_club/|title=ToryBoy visits the Frontline Club|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire Magazine]]'' gave it three stars and called it a "shit stirring exposé of local politics that will make you cross".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=510147455692929&amp;set=pb.191458757561802.-2207520000.1384175778.&amp;type=3&amp;theater screenshot at Facebook] 20 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2017}} Samuel Scott from review site DVD Compare gave it a B- and wrote "I found this documentary very intriguing and very honest. John is a very likable character, and I wouldn't hesitate in voting for someone with so much passion for a second."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dvdcompare.net/review.php?rid=3637 DVD Compare] 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Doc Geeks commented that the film was "a blunt exposé combined with a tinge of lightheartedness. Satirical animation cleverly frames Britain in its political context".&lt;ref&gt;[http://docgeeks.com/2011/11/14/review-toryboy-the-movie/ Doc Geeks] November 14th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On his blog, novelist [[Christopher Fowler]] wrote that ''ToryBoy The Movie'' was "a snapshot of our country’s political apathy in microcosm. It’s heartbreaking to see people blindly supporting their own demise as if they’re playing some kind of long game they’ll probably never live to see the outcome of. Oh, and it’s also very funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christopherfowler.co.uk/blog/2011/12/02/review-toryboy/|title=Re:View – ‘Toryboy’ - Christopher Fowler|website=www.christopherfowler.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the DVD was released Ben Kamal interviewed Walsh for the Aberdeen student newspaper ''[[Gaudie]]'', and wrote "I was prepared for some careful sneering in the interview and subsequent write-up. This did not (and could not) transpire: firstly because of the film, which comes across as [[Frank Capra]] scripted by [[Evelyn Waugh]]; secondly because of Walsh himself.

Two years after the film release, Lord [[Michael Ashcroft]] wrote on his blog: "I’d defy anyone with an interest in politics not to enjoy this film".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2012/05/lord-ashcroft-two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-ge.html|title=Lord Ashcroft: Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that "despite the zany tone of the film, it also has a hard-hitting message which questions whether one MP in his safe seat, and perhaps other MPs in similar situations, do enough to justify their salary and expenses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lordashcroft.com/2012/05/two-years-on-a-controversial-film-gives-a-witty-thought-provoking-snapshot-into-the-general-election/|title=Two years on, a controversial film gives a witty, thought-provoking snapshot into the general election - Lord Ashcroft|date=6 May 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 the political Guido Fawkes website also known as Order Order, ran an article entitled “Inside The Greatest Election Scandal of All Time” says that Walsh “lifted the lid on the real-life world of political campaigning.”&lt;ref&gt;https://order-order.com/2017/04/28/inside-greatest-election-scandal-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vice (magazine)|Vice Mangazine]]’s Joe Zadeh’s article suggests a link between how Labour in Middlesbrough lost the votes of blue collar people and its shift to the right. He cited ToryBoy The Movie as an example of this shift.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev445j/how-labour-lost-the-working-class&lt;/ref&gt;

In a podcast interview with BritFlicks Walsh talks about ToryBoy and the difficulties in making the film and also his plans to develop lost [[Ray Harryhausen]] film projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://britflicks.com/blog.aspx?blogid=24084&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerdly.co.uk/2018/01/01/interview-john-walsh-tory-boy-the-movie-ray-harryhausen-podcast/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Although not explicitly inspired by the film, Neil Macfarlane, in a report for local newspaper''[[Teesside Gazette]]'', asked "Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?" when he failed to answer over 100 telephone calls made to his constituency office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/teessiders-getting-enough-sir-stuart-3693031|title=Are Teessiders getting enough from Sir Stuart Bell?|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=6 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Gazette'' story was picked up by national newspapers. ''[[The Independent]]'' asked "is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brown [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/no-surgeries-for-14-years--is-sir-stuart-bell-britains-laziest-mp-2350953.html No surgeries for 14 years - is Sir Stuart Bell Britain's laziest MP?], ''Independent'', 7 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;Richard Moss [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-14847291 Middlesbrough MP Sir Stuart Bell fights laziest MP tag], BBC, 9 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guardian'' fact-checked the "laziest MP" claim and found that the laziest MP was [[Roger Godsiff]] but the report did confirm that Sir Stuart Bell did not maintain the pivotal role for a MP, an office in their constituency. &lt;ref name="reality check"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2011/sep/08/reality-check-britain-s-laziest-mp|title=Reality check: Who are Britain's laziest parliamentarians?|author=Polly Curtis|work=the Guardian|date=8 September 2011}}: "Bell has been an MP for nearly 30 years and has had a distinguished career in parliament as a frontbench spokesman on trade and industry in opposition and the spokesman for the Church of England in the House of Commons and member of the House of Commons commission until last year.

One measure of their parliamentary work is the proportion of votes they turn up to."&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party said it would be totally unacceptable if constituents had been unable to contact their MP. [[Ed Miliband]] and the Labour Party expect the highest standards from Labour representatives. It is totally unacceptable if the public cannot reach their MP.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/labour-launches-probe-middlesbrough-mp-3693109|title=Labour launches probe into Middlesbrough MP|author=gazettelive Administrator|date=8 September 2011|work=gazettelive}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sir Stuart Bell did have a right of reply, which appeared in the short film ''ToryBoy The AfterMath''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2014/05/john-walsh-toryboy-the-aftermath-or-the-town-that-politics-forgot.html|title=John Walsh: ToryBoy – the aftermath (or: the Town That Politics Forgot…)|work=Conservative Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's expose nearly forced a By Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/9028657.Documentary__could_force_by_election_/|title=Documentary 'could force by-election'|work=The Northern Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's re-release in 2015 caused more controversy after a showing in Middlesbrough by [[Teesside University]] was cancelled to avoid breaching union rules on political neutrality in the run up to the general election. According to Walsh's interview with ''[[Teesside Gazette]]''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1G1-408518499/director-upset-as-toryboy-film-screening-cancelled&lt;/ref&gt; the film was booked in by the Student Union, but at the last minute the screening was halted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2015/04/john-walsh-toryboy-the-move-banned-in-middlesbrough.html|title=ToryBoy The Movie – banned in Middlesbrough|author=John Walsh|work=Conservative Home|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Brown [http://mmj.tees.ac.uk/~project22/index5d95.html?p=863 Student Union involved in row over planned screening of controversial Toryboy the Movie], ''[[The North Crowd]]'' 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; "I think it's a shame really," said Walsh.

==Re-releases==
The film received a re-release in cinemas in 2015 in the lead up to the [[2015 UK General Election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishpost.co.uk/entertainment/documentary-that-exposed-labour-scandal-back-in-theatres-ahead-of-election|title=Satirical film ToryBoy The Movie returns to big screen|work=The Irish Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/11807584.BAFTA_nominated_Greenwich_filmmaker_s_controversial_ToryBoy_returns_to_cinemas_before_election/|title=BAFTA-nominated Greenwich filmmaker's controversial ToryBoy returns to cinemas before election|work=News Shopper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soundtrack ==
The film used older film ques from films across the last six decades to create a unique soundscape. ''[[Radio Times]]'' described it as "a fascinating odyssey illuminated by pithily informative animations and music from films like ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/film/c5xq27/toryboy-the-movie/|title=Toryboy the Movie – review - cast and crew, movie star rating and where to watch film on TV and online|website=Radio Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Tractatus coislinianus''''' is an ancient Greek manuscript outlining a theory of [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]] in the tradition of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.

==Dramatic theory==
The ''Tractatus'' states that comedy invokes laughter and pleasure, thus purging those emotions ([[catharsis]]), in a manner parallel to the description of [[tragedy]] in the ''Poetics''. It proceeds to describe the devices used and manner in which [[catharsis]] is brought about.

==History==
The manuscript now resides in [[Paris, France]], at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]]; it is labeled "Coislinianus 120". The 10th-century manuscript resided at [[Great Lavra]] on [[Mount Athos]]. In 1643, [[Athanasius Rhetor]] sent it from [[Cyprus]] to [[Pierre Séguier|Séguier de Coislin]]. The classicist [[J. A. Cramer]], poring through the collection of [[Henri Charles du Cambout de Coislin]], was struck by the content, believing it to be the work of a commentator on Aristotle's theory of comedy, and published it in 1839. This belief was soon derided, but it has gained force in the 20th century; [[Richard Janko]] has argued that it is the notes or sketches of the lost second section of the ''Poetics''. Nesselrath argues that it is a later work, perhaps by [[Theophrastus]].

'''Women's empowerment'' is the procedure in which women elaborate and recreate what is that they can be, do, and accomplish in a circumstance that they previously were denied.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Gender equality and women's empowerment: A critical analysis of the third millennium development goal 1." ''Gender &amp; Development'' 13.1 (2005): 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosedale|first=Sarah|date=2005-03-01|title=Assessing women's empowerment: towards a conceptual framework|journal=Journal of International Development|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=243–257|doi=10.1002/jid.1212|issn=1099-1328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows for them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted from such an ability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are several principles defining women's empowerment such as, for one to be empowered, they must come from a position of disempowerment. Furthermore, one must acquire empowerment themselves rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Lastly, empowerment and disempowerment is relative to other  at a previous time; therefore, empowerment is a process, not a product.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Women empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in [[Human development (humanity)|development]] and [[economics]]. It can also point to the approaches regarding other trivialized [[gender]]s in a particular political or social context.

Women's [[economic empowerment]] refers to the ability for women to enjoy their right to control and benefit from the 
resources, [[asset]]s, [[income]] and their own time, as well as the ability to [[Risk management|manage risk]] and improve their economic status and well being.&lt;ref name="Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&gt;Oxfam (Forthcoming), "Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&lt;/ref&gt;

While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of [[gender empowerment]] refers to people of any gender, stressing the [[Sex and gender distinction|distinction]] between biological  and [[Gender role|gender as a role]]. It thereby also refers to other marginalized genders in a

== Importance of women's empowerment in societies ==
Entire nations, businesses, communities and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/40248/1/IDL-40248.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency|year=2009|editor2=Lila Shahani|publisher=Earthscan|location=Sterling, VA|editor1=Deneulin, Séverine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowerment of women is a necessity for the very development of a society, since it enhances both the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Kamla|last2=Yesudian|first2=P. Princy|date=2006|title=Evidence of women's empowerment in India: a study of socio-spatial disparities|url=|journal=GeoJournal|volume=65|issue=4|pages=365–380|doi=10.1007/s10708-006-7556-z|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]].

== Methods ==
Scholars have identified two forms of empowerment, economic empowerment and political empowerment.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Contextualising the Economic Pathways of Women's Empowerment: Findings from a Multi-Country Research Programme." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/inclusive-political-institutions/regional-organizations--gender-equality-and-the-political-empowe.html|title=Regional Organizations, Gender Equality and the Political Empowerment of Women|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic empowerment ===
Economic empowerment increases women's agency, access to formal government programs, mobility outside the home, economic independence, and purchasing power. Policy makers are suggested to support job training to aid in entrance in the formal markets.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duflo|first=Esther|date=2012|title=Women Empowerment and Economic Development|jstor=23644911|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1051–1079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strengthening women's access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and [[bargaining power]] needed to address [[gender inequalities]]. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped nations are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they wouldn't normally have; in turn, they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.

Another popular methodology for women's economic empowerment also includes [[microcredit]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low interest rates without the requirement of collateral.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Geleta, Esayas Bekele. "Microfinance and the politics of empowerment: a critical cultural perspective." ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' 49.4 (2014): 413-425.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, they aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The success and efficiency of microcredit and microloans is controversial and constantly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parmar, A.|year=2003|title=Microcredit, Empowerment, and Agency: Re-evaluating the Discourse|journal=Canadian Journal of Development Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=461–76|doi=10.1080/02255189.2003.9668932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critiques claim that microcredit alone doesn't guarantee women have control over the way it is used. Microfinance institutions don't address cultural barriers that allow men to still control household finances; as a result, microcredit may simply be transferred to the husband. Microcredit doesn't relieve women of household obligations, and even if women have credit, they don't have the time to be as active in the market as men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Ellis, Amanda. ''Gender and economic growth in Kenya: Unleashing the power of women''. World Bank Publications, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political empowerment ===
Political empowerment supports creating policies that would best support gender equality and agency for women in both the public and private spheres. Popular methods that have been suggested are to create affirmative action policies that have a quota for the number of women in policy making and parliament positions.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; As of 2017, the global average of women whom hold lower and single house parliament positions is 23.6 percent.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Further recommendations have been to increase women's rights to [[vote]], voice opinions, and the ability to run for office with a fair chance of being elected.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; Because women are typically associated with child care and domestic responsibilities in the home, they have less time dedicated to entering the labour market and running their business. Policies that increase their [[bargaining power]] in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the [[household]], in schools, and the ability to make choices for oneself. Some theorists believe that bargaining power and agency in the household must to be achieved before one can move onto broader political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Human Development: The Capabilities to Approach|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9781139459358|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=1–33|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and assessment ==
Women empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM), which shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. GEM is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence".&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt;

Some critiques of GEM is that it is not concerned with factors regarding society, such as gender, religion, cultural context, legal context, and violations of women's rights.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Charmes, Jacques, and Saskia Wieringa. "Measuring women's empowerment: an assessment of the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure." ''Journal of Human Development'' 4.3 (2003): 419-435.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender empowerment measure attempts to makes a consistent standardized approach to measure women's empowerment; in doing so, it has been critiqued that the GEM doesn't account for variation in historical factors, female autonomy, gender segregation, and women's right to vote.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pillarisetti|first=J.|last2=McGillivray|first2=Mark|date=1998-06-01|title=Human Development and Gender Empowerment: Methodological and Measurement Issues|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=197–203|doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00059|issn=1467-7679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) is a way in which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) measures the inequality between genders within a country. Some critique of this measurement is that, because GDI calculations rely solely on the achievement distribution between males and females of a population, GDI doesn't measure gender inequality; rather, it measures absolute levels on income, education and health&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A more qualitative form of assessing women's empowerment is to identify constraints to action. This allows for the identification of power relations between genders. Because this is a participatory process, it facilitates conversation on gender discrimination.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Comparing constraints on women at a later time also allows for any changes or expansion to be better identified. The evaluation of the development of women's agency allows for an evaluation of actions taken. These assessments must also be based on the action taken by women, and not external groups. External groups can help facilitate women's empowerment, but cannot bestow it on them.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

== Barriers ==

Many of the barriers to women's empowerment and equity lie ingrained in cultural norms. Many women feel these pressures, while others have become accustomed to being treated inferior to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Culture, and Development: A Study of Human Capabilities|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=9780198289647|editor1=Martha C. Nussbaum|location=Oxford|pages=1–15|chapter=Introduction|editor2=Jonathan Glover|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if [[legislators]], [[NGOs]], etc. are aware of the benefits women's empowerment and participation can have, many are scared of disrupting the status of the women and continue to let [[societal norms]] get in the way of development.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that the increasing access to the internet can also result in an increased exploitation of women.&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000" /&gt; Releasing personal information on websites has put some women's personal safety at risk. In 2010, Working to Halt Online Abuse stated that 73% of women were victimized through such sites. Types of victimization include [[cyber stalking]], harassment, [[online pornography]], and [[flaming (Internet)|flaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morahan-Martin, J.|year=2000|title=Women and the Internet: Promise and Perils|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=683–691|doi=10.1089/10949310050191683}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] in particular is a large barrier for women in the workplace. It appears in almost all industries, but is most notable in the following: business, trade, banking and finance, sales and marketing, hospitality, civil service, and education, lecturing and teaching.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aware.org.sg/training/wsh-site/14-statistics/|title=Statistics|date=22 April 2010|work=AWARE RSS|publisher=AWARE|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), sexual harassment is a clear form of gender discrimination based on sex, a manifestation of unequal power relations between men and women. Furthermore, the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is urging for increased measures of protection for women against sexual harassment and violence in the workplace. 54% (272) had experienced some form of workplace sexual harassment. 79% of the victims are women; 21% were men.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt;

Recent studies also show that women face more barriers in the workplace than do men. Gender-related barriers involve sexual harassment, unfair hiring practices, career progression, and unequal pay where women are paid less than men are for performing the same job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stein, A.I.|year=2009|title=Women Lawyers Blog for Workplace Equality: Blogging as a Feminist Legal Method|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&amp;context=yjlf|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Feminism|volume=20|issue=2|pages=357–408}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taking the median earnings of men and women who worked full-time, year-round, government data from 2014 showed that women made $0.79 for every dollar a man earned. The average earnings for working mothers came out to even less—$0.71 for every dollar a father made, according to a 2014 study conducted by the National Partnership for Women and Children. While much of the public discussion of the "[[Gender pay gap|wage gap]]" has focused around women getting equal pay for the same work as their male peers, many women struggle with what is called the "pregnancy penalty". The main problem is that it is difficult to measure, but some experts say that the possibility of having a baby can be enough for employers to push women back from their line.&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/careers/motherhood-penalty-can-affect-women-who-never-even-have-child-n548511|title='Motherhood Penalty' Can Affect Women Who Never Even Have a Child|author=Safia Samee Ali|date=April 11, 2016|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women are put in a position where they need to make the decision of whether to maintain in the workforce or have children. This problem has sparked the debate over maternity leave in the United States.

However, despite the struggle for equal pay in the United States, the tech industry{{clarify|date=June 2017}} has made progress in helping to encourage equal pay across gender. In March 2016, tech career website Dice released a study of more than 16,000 tech professionals that found that when you compare equivalent education, experience and position, there is no pay gap—and hasn't been for the last six years.&lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt; This new industry is paving a way for other companies to do the same. However, this industry also struggles to employ women in executive positions. This is partially due to the barrier of sexual harassment and pregnancy that was aforementioned.

Such barriers make it difficult for women to advance in their workplace or receive fair compensation for the work they provide.

== Role of education ==
It is said that education increases "people's self-confidence and also enables them to find better jobs and they can work shoulder to shoulder with men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marniemi|first=J.|last2=Parkki|first2=M. G.|date=1975-09-01|title=Radiochemical assay of glutathione S-epoxide transferase and its enhancement by phenobarbital in rat liver in vivo|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=24|issue=17|pages=1569–1572|issn=0006-2952|pmid=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They engage in public debate and make demands on government for health care, social security and other entitlements".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNDP. 2013. Human Development Report. The Rise of the South. Human Progress in a Diverse World; New York, UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, education empowers women to make choices that improve their children's health, their well-being, and chances of survival.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013/2014: Teaching and Learning, Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Education informs others of preventing and containing the disease, and it is an essential element of efforts to reduce malnutrition. Furthermore, it empowers women to make choices that can improve their welfare, including marrying beyond childhood and having fewer children. Crucially, education can increase women's awareness of their rights, boost their self-esteem, and provide them the opportunity to assert their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002343/234325E.pdf|title=Mobile phones and literacy: Empowerment in Women's Hands; A Cross-Case Analysis of Nine Experiences|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100123-9|location=33|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite significant improvements in recent decades, education is not universally available and gender inequalities persist. A major concern in many countries is not only the limited numbers of girls going to school but also the limited educational pathways for those that step into the classroom. More specifically, there should be more efforts to address the lower participation and learning achievement of [[Female education in STEM|girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Internet as a tool of empowerment ==

The growing access of the web in the late 20th century has allowed women to empower themselves by using various tools on the Internet. With the introduction of the [[World Wide Web]], women have begun to use social networking sites like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] for [[online activism]].&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, J.|author2=Pollock, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Online Activism for Women's Rights|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=699–706|doi=10.1089/10949310050191700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through online activism, women are able to empower themselves by organizing campaigns and voicing their opinions for equality rights without feeling oppressed by members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Churchyard, N.|year=2009|title=The Question of Empowerment: Women's Perspective on Their Internet Use|journal=[[Gender, Technology and Development]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=341–363|doi=10.1177/097185241001300302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on May 29, 2013, an online campaign started by 100 female advocates forced the leading social networking website, Facebook, to take down various pages that spread hatred about women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McVeigh, T.|date=June 6, 2013|title=Online Feminist activists of the digital age|work=Taipei Times|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2013/06/06/2003564076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[blogging]] has also become a powerful tool for the educational empowerment of women. According to a study done by the University of California, Los Angeles, medical patients who read and write about their disease are often in a much happier mood and more knowledgeable than those who do not.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephan, P.|date=August 13, 2013|title=Breast cancer patients blog their blues away|url=http://breastcancer.about.com/b/2013/08/13/blog-the-blues-away.htm|journal=Breastcancer.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reading others' experiences, patients can better educate themselves and apply strategies that their fellow bloggers suggest.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"/&gt;

With the easy accessibility and affordability of [[e-learning]] (electronic learning), women can now study from the comfort of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Radovic-Markovic, M.|author2=Nelson-Porter, B.|author3=Omolaja, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=The new alternative women's entrepreneurship education: E-learning and virtual universities|journal=International Women Online Journal of Distance Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=46–54|url=http://wojde.org/FileUpload/bs295854/File/06a.markovic.pdf|issn=2147-0367}}&lt;/ref&gt; By empowering themselves educationally through new technologies like e-learning, women are also learning new skills that will come in handy in today's advancing globalized world.

Often times, the internet is very useful as source of empowerment for women through its creation, dispersion, and utilization of hashtags on social media. One prime example of hashtags supporting women empowerment was in 2017 when the #AintNoCinderella hashtag came into existence. This hashtag spread like wildfire on social media after Varnika Kundu (a 29-year-old woman in India) was driving home past midnight on August 4 when she was followed and harassed by two men in a SUV{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Kundu was blamed for being out late at night, particularly by the BJP government Vice-President Ramveer Bhatti. This lead to women all across India and the world posting pictures of themselves out late at night with the hashtag "#AintNoCinderella" to show that women do not have a particular curfew to which they have to adhere to (like Cinderella did). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/ain-t-no-cinderella-women-hit-out-bjp-leader-blaming-chandigarh-stalking-victim-66456|title=Ain’t no Cinderella: Women hit out at BJP leader for blaming Chandigarh stalking victim|date=2017-08-08|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ongoing projects ==
The UN came out with a set of goals called the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, to help make the world a better place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable development goals - United Nations|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 17, the fourth goal works to allow access to education for all people alike. A large effort has been made to include women in schools to better their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/|title=Education - United Nations Sustainable Development|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the fifth goal focuses on empowering women and girls to achieve gender equality through equal access to various types of opportunities (health care, education, work, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some prominent non-profits that help empower women:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thepowerofpurpose.com/10-amazing-nonprofits-empowering-women-2017/|title=10 Amazing Nonprofits Empowering Women in 2017 - The Power of Purpose|date=2017-01-26|work=The Power of Purpose|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. involvement ===
[[File:First Lady Melania Trump and Under Secretary Shannon Pose for a Photo With the 2017 International Women of Courage Awardees (33338548780).jpg|thumb|[[Melania Trump]] with 2017 [[International Women of Courage Award]]ees]]
Domestically, the U.S. empowered women through passings of laws such as allowing women to vote in 1920, banning discrimination based on gender in 1964, banning discrimination against pregnant women in 1978, etc. Additionally, the inclusion of women in politics allowed for more gender equality. The first female speaker of House, the first First Lady to run for president, and first women to serve on the Supreme Court were monumental events that proved socially the acceptance of "subservient" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org/resources/womens-rights-movement/detailed-timeline/|title=Detailed Timeline {{!}} National Women's History Project|website=www.nwhp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. provides foreign aid to third world countries in various forms, one of which is by providing education programs. There are currently bills in Congress that work to ensure education to girls, one of which is the Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act. These are enacted with the belief that proper education will pull them out of poverty and reduce exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2408|title=H.R.2408 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act|last=Steve|first=Chabot|date=2017-10-04|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another action taken on by the U.S is the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|PEPFAR]] program, initiated by the Bush administration in 2003. The U.S. spent more than $1.4 billion in funding sub-Saharan Africa during the duration of the program. This program was taken into effect in response to the global HIV/AIDS crisis, and it promoted abstinence among young girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jon|date=June 15, 2007|title=Bush Boosts AIDS Relief: Cause for Applause and Pause|jstor=20036459|journal=Science|volume=316|issue=5831|pages=1552|pmid=17569832|doi=10.1126/science.316.5831.1552}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a partnership with DREAMS, and its main purpose with PEPFAR was to allow both girls and women to develop into Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pepfar.gov/partnerships/ppp/dreams/|title=Working Together for an AIDS-Free Future for Girls and Women|website=www.pepfar.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are criticisms that this program did not really do much to reduce HIV risk behavior, and critics such as John Dietrich worried that the context of aid enforced Western beliefs of choosing abstinence before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendavid|first=Eran, et al.|date=May 2016|title=Abstinence Funding Was Not Associated With Reductions In HIV Risk Behavior In Sub-Saharan Africa|url=|journal=Health Affairs|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/03/476601108/u-s-spent-1-4-billion-to-stop-hiv-by-promoting-abstinence-did-it-work|title=U.S. Spent $1.4 Billion To Stop HIV By Promoting Abstinence. Did It Work?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was and still is controversy regarding the effectiveness of this program in reducing HIV/AIDS through advocating abstinence and whether this would actually empower women in Africa.

Historically, women in the [[United States]] have been represented at lower rates than men in both [[science]] and [[engineering]] [[college]] programs and careers.  Over time, this pattern has led to a significantly higher concentration of male professional engineers compared to women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Rossi, Alice 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Polacheck, Soloman 1978&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, this disparity has led to careers in [[Education]], [[History]], [[English language|English]], [[Humanities]] and the like to be seen as “feminine” careers and areas of study.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt; Some Feminist theorists suggest that these social and historical factors have perpetuated women’s low participation rates in engineering over time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt; Numerous explanations and points of view have been offered to explain women's participation rates in this field. These explanations include beliefs regarding women's lack of interest in science and engineering, their physiological inability to succeed as engineers, and environmental factors in women's [[childhood]]s that discourage them from entering science and engineering fields.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;

Negative perceptions of female engineers may play a role in explaining their low numbers within the field.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Graham, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent statistics, college-educated women are less than half as likely as men to be employed in science and engineering jobs.

Two forms of [[activism]] tasked with raising awareness include both organizations on college campuses and those geared towards society at large.

==History==

In the early 1960s, a President’s Commission on the Status of Women emphasized the need for women to fill a shortage of jobs in [[teaching]], science, and engineering.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; In 1960, however, less than 1% of recorded engineers were women. Furthermore, female engineers that were employed were less likely to have obtained advanced degrees in their field than men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; Research has shown that these trends were reflective of both men's and women's dominant opinions regarding women's role in the workforce throughout this period. At the time, both groups largely emphasized women’s roles as traditional homemakers and mothers rather than as serious scientists or engineers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pendleton, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite changing political views towards women and minorities during the [[civil rights movement]], college women’s enrollment rates into engineering were still relatively low when compared to men's.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt; For example, in a study of over 440 college campuses nationwide throughout 1971-72, approximately 17% of polled Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) majors were women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Montinelli, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; This coincides with the fact that, throughout this period, there was little recorded formal discrimination in the American educational system.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;Cole, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;  Women who actually applied to engineering programs were enrolled at similar rates to men. Early increases in these numbers did occur, though, throughout 1968-78. During this period, there was an estimated 100% increase in the number of female science and engineering majors throughout the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated11/&gt; However, it was also estimated that they still accounted for less than 4.9% of such majors throughout this period.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11/&gt;

Despite women’s increasing numbers in science and engineering fields, [[affirmative action]] and similar efforts were implemented throughout the U.S. to increase STEM enrollment rates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated10/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;Cummings,1970&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed, among other factors, that early socialization by elementary schools and social stereotyping was to blame for this issue.  In the mid 1980s, a shortage of qualified engineers was predicted by the year 2000, further instigating efforts to both recruit and retain women in these fields.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;Freckman, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;  Existing groups that promote women in engineering: ASCE Task force Committee on Women in Civil Engineering, Extraordinary Women Engineers Project Coalition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=dKptTDl6eUcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=changing+our+world++hatch&amp;ots=bwbqjKQJTG&amp;sig=KktAZNNjtdSF8EqIbchgJKGNvM8|title=Changing Our World: True Stories of Women Engineers|last=Hatch|first=Sybil E.|date=2006-01-01|publisher=ASCE Publications|isbn=9780784408353|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics and relevant data==
[[File:Percentage of Engineering Bachelor’s Degrees Awarded to Women by School.png|right|300px|Percentage of Engineering Bachelor’sDegrees Awarded to Womenby School]]
According to the [[National Science Foundation]], overall, women have higher college graduation rates compared to men. However, men disproportionately outnumber women in the number of Science and Engineering (STEM) degrees received.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14&gt;National Science Foundation, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1989 and 2008, the approximate percentages of women receiving their [[Bachelor’s degree]] in any engineering field were 17% and 19.6%, respectively. The percentage increase in the computer science industry displayed was larger, increasing from approximately 10% in 1989 to 21% in 2008.

Concerning [[ethnic group|minority]] ([[African American]], [[Hispanic]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]) women, the percentages of engineering bachelor’s recipients increased from approximately 7% in 1989 to 12% in 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14/&gt; The percentages of minority  women with engineering [[doctoral degrees]] were much lower, however, barely increasing from 1% throughout this period. [[Southeast Asians|Asian]] women actually accounted for a lower rate of engineering bachelor's degree during this time period, from approximately 2.5% to 5%. PhD  recipient rates from 1989 to 2008 were nearly identical to minority women’s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated14/&gt;

According to the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] in 2004, there were approximately 192,900 female engineers throughout the country, compared with over 1,515,000 men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15&gt;National Society of Professional Engineers, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Of these women, approximately 1/3 of them were [[software engineers]] (62,900). Women were also employed in higher rates than men in [[environmental engineering]] (9% to 4%) and [[chemical engineering]] (7% to 4%). However, they were less likely than men to be employed in [[mechanical engineering]] (8% to 17%) and [[electrical engineering]] (12% to 18%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated15/&gt;

In 1999, women made up approximately one quarter of all engineers under the age of 25, whereas they constituted one-twentieth of those over age 49. This age discrepancy has been attributed to women's notable, but recent, movement into engineering within the past few decades.&lt;ref name=autogenerated15/&gt; According to the Society of Women Engineers, women and other minorities constituted approximately 16%-17% of engineering graduate students from 1990-2003. Furthermore, in 2003 approximately 20% (approximately 12,000)of new engineers were women, compared with about 80% of men (approximately 49,000).&lt;ref name=autogenerated16&gt;Society of Women Engineers, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations for low participation rates==

Numerous explanations have come forth to account for the lack of women engineering majors in college. Historically, women have both majored and remained in college engineering programs at lower rates than men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated26&gt;Corell, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; One of the reasons used to explain this trend has been a supposed overemphasis on the traditional "male breadwinner" household model when it comes to organizing families today.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt; Although the percentage of families organized according to this model has declined considerably in recent decades, many individuals, including women, still see adult men as the primary [[wage]] earners in households where men were present.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27&gt;Seymore, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Even if this is the case women represent close to  60% of university graduates, including biology mayors. [https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=72 IES:  What is the percentage of degrees conferred by race and sex?]

Recently, greater emphasis has been given to women’s socialization throughout their childhoods and [[adolescence]]s. Socialized early in their childhoods, girls are said to be raised in societies where science, engineering, and mathematics are largely promoted as “male [[professions]]”.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt; The [[media (communication)|media]] has also been criticized for giving little representation of prominent female engineers.  Instead, some scholars feel the media is guilty of perpetuating [[gender stereotype]]s by representing women in traditionally “female occupations” such as [[nurses]], school teachers, [[housewives]], etc.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated24/&gt;

[[Christina Hoff Sommers]] has suggested that subjects such as Engineering may be less popular among women because they do not accommodate some of their typical interests: caring for/interaction with living beings may be one example. This is not necessarily to suggest, with [[Lawrence Summers]], that women are incapable, or less fundamentally capable than men at Engineering, but rather that they tend to be less interested in the subject.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-6usiN4uoA&amp;list=PLytTJqkSQqtr7BqC1Jf4nv3g2yDfu7Xmd&amp;index=19&lt;/ref&gt; The principle strength of this argument is that it explains the phenomenon without drawing tenuous links with difficult-to-measure influences such as 'culture' and 'role-models', but it is also to some degree reinforced by academic consensus, which was identified in the 'Social and Political views of American Professors' paper as 75% in favor of the claim that differing interests between men and women caused the disparity, rather than discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.147.6141&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of [[role model]]s, and especially female role models, has also been emphasized as a means of increasing women’s numbers in engineering.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated28"&gt;Seymore, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Women with one or two engineering parents are said to be moderately more likely to major in such a field themselves.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt; Additionally, encouragement from teachers, [[school counselor|counselor]]s, [[Academic administration|administrator]]s, etc. are all said to positively impact women's chances at moving into engineering. Better high school preparation in mathematics, [[biology]], and [[chemistry]] were also said to better women's chances for an engineering career. However, according to some scholars, the above factors do not occur in a great enough number to compensate for women's current disadvantages.&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated28/&gt; Thus, generally speaking, it is said that hopeful women engineers will remain largely [[discriminate]]d against and have inadequate resources at improving their outlook unless substantial [[social change]]s are made.

==Socialization and societal outcomes==

===Educational outcomes===
It has been suggested that, due to the social and environmental factors described above, [[high school]] and college women tend to have lower [[confidence]] levels in their mathematical ability compared to men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated26/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated24/&gt; Shelley Correll's observations using the National Educational Longitudinal Survey (NELS) revealed that, on average, women who positively assessed their math ability before testing had a higher average score than women who did not rate themselves well. Moreover, [[longitudinal studies]] on both sets of women also revealed that the ones who did rate themselves highly were more likely to subsequently enroll in college-level [[calculus]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated26/&gt;

Goldman later discovered that positive [[math]] assessments played an important role in women's choices to enroll in engineering.&lt;ref name=autogenerated24/&gt; However, other studies have before and since emphasized women’s early life experiences in shaping their career aspirations. Feeling they are not skilled enough to successfully complete an engineering program or other advanced mathematical and/or science courses, some women perform poorly and thus complete a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated26/&gt; If at all, differences in men’s and women’s innate spatial memories were reported to account for about a 2:1 ratio of male-female engineers. Instead, in the U.S [[labor force]], there is approximately less than 1 female engineer for every 10 males.&lt;sup&gt;&amp;#x5B;''[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|citation needed]]''&amp;#x5D;&lt;/sup&gt; According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2011, 13.6% of those employed in Architecture and engineering occupations were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/cps/wlf-databook-2012.pdf|title=Women in the Labor Force: A Databook|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further studies have also shown that a lack of pre-degree training in high school did not sufficiently explain women engineer's [[dropping out|dropout]] rates later in college.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated25/&gt; Analyses of males' and females' grades revealed that, on average, women who had dropped out of engineering programs were either approximately as qualified or even more qualified than their male peers who continued their studies. Additionally, surveyed female dropouts revealed that very few (approximately 9.8% to 11.5%) actually dropped out because they viewed the work as too difficult.&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated28/&gt; Among their primary reasons for dropping were: loss of interest in the field, the inability to see themselves as professional engineers, inappropriate behavior from male [[peer group|peer]]s, and the highly pressured environment professional engineers worked under.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt; A phenomenon called "[[stereotype threat]]" may also help explain women's educational outcomes. Because of existing stereotypes regarding women's ability to excel in mathematics-intensive coursework, they are sometimes said to perform worse than they originally would have had the stereotypes not existed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated34&gt;Ceci and Williams, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace outcomes===

According to Hersch, a significant number of [[corporation]]s have increased the number of women engineers hired in the past couple of decades in response to [[political]] and social pressures.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30&gt;Hersh, Marion 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their engineering expertise, women engineers are said to bring unique [[ethics of care|caring]] and non-technical problem solving skills along with an enlarged customer support base. Typically preceding these management changes were other policy shifts such as: 1) a company move from heavy to light [[manufacturing]]; 2) a greater emphasis on service and professional jobs; 3) improved working conditions, and 4) a general improvement of women’s status on the job.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated31&gt;Preston, Anne 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, however, engineering is said to remain a highly gender-stratified occupation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated16/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated27/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt; Among the engineers currently employed, men substantially outnumber women. On average, men are also said to hold higher supervisory and [[management]] positions than females, whose [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] prospects are usually more limited.&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated31/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated32&gt;Devine, Fiona 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This reason, family and child obligations, and [[layoff]]s combined to account for a drop-out rate of approximately 20% among all female engineers from 1982-1990—a statistic over twice of that of men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated31/&gt;

It has been suggested by Crompton and Sanderson that discrimination in high-level technical jobs is actually ''decreasing'' on the whole.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;  Moreover, they suggest that [[equal opportunity|equal-opportunities]] legislation ensures that men and women with appropriate [[human capital]] are treated equally in recruitment chances. Direct and indirect forms of exclusion were no longer said to be significant in sustaining gender segregation in engineering positions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt; Statistically, [[gender pay gap]]s in engineering are actually lower than the national average. In STEM jobs, female wages are approximately 84% of men’s, compared to 71% in non-STEM jobs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated12/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated30/&gt; Moreover, it has also been stated that traditionally stereotypical images of engineering as “dirty”, “rugged”, or “manly” jobs are gradually being eroded—opening employment opportunities for prospective women nationwide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated31/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated21/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated23/&gt;

However, recent evidence suggests that gender discrimination is still a significant issue affecting women’s confidence and performance in STEM careers. According to Logel, interacting with [[sexist]] men may trigger a stressed-induced phenomenon called “social identity threat” in women.&lt;ref name=autogenerated33&gt;Logel, Christine 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Women engineers who faced regular exposure to sexist men on the job were said perform worse on aptitude tests than women who weren’t exposed to such individuals. While women who worked in low-[[stress (psychological)|stress]] environments reported higher levels of confidence and [[self-actualization|self-fulfillment]], discriminated women were reportedly more likely to suppress their feelings and/or let their problems go unannounced.&lt;ref name=autogenerated33/&gt; Such behavior is said to be detrimental to both the women engineers themselves and the workplace, where sexist behavior is likely to persist.

==Initiatives to promote engineering to women==

As science and engineering have become more pervasive in [[society]], women's participation rates in these fields have not seen a proportionate increase.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated18&gt;Cuny and Aspray, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cuny and Aspray, this may potentially result in a lack of women's [[aptitude|talent]] in the fields, which may further reduce employment opportunities for both employer and employee &lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt; In order to make engineering more appealing to young women, a broader acceptance criteria into such programs has been proposed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt; Specifically, admissions boards are encouraged to take other admissions factors into account such as: [[extracurricular]] accomplishments, applicants' desire to be admitted into the program, and [[communication skills]]. Additionally, it has been strongly suggested that admissions boards prioritize ethnic diversity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated18/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated19&gt;Milgrim, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has revealed that [[high school]]- and college-age women commonly see the STEM environment as a "chilly, male-dominated" environment that is highly impersonal and unsympathetic to women's unique needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated22&gt;Vrcelj and Krishnan, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated21&gt;Morganson and Jones, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated23&gt;Bona and Kelly, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; "Social [[coping (psychology)|coping]]" has thus been a mechanism which has been cited to help women deal with the challenges and [[stress (psychological)|stress]] associated with engineering's rigorous coursework and careers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21/&gt; [[Multiple regression]] analysis has revealed that high levels of social coping were a stronger predictor of commitment to staying in engineering studies for women than men. Put more simply, women who used social coping were less likely than men (who were actually found to be ''more'' likely) to drop out of college engineering programs. Consequently, school [[teacher]]s, staff, parents, and other figures have been encouraged to provide a more accommodating environment for social coping.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated19/&gt;

An increase in influential female role models has also been cited as a way to increase women's engineering enrollment rates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated23/&gt; [[Survey methodology|survey]]s collected among 141 female engineering students across the country have shown that many women who placed high confidence levels in their math and science ability also had parents who modeled less traditional [[gender roles]]. Thus, to increase women's enrollment and retention rates in engineering, scholars have suggested that a de-emphasis away from the highly popularized "[[nuclear family]]" model is crucial.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated25&gt;Haines and Wallace,2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated24&gt;Goldman and Hewitt, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Women Engineers (SWE) was established in May 27, 1950&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; by [[Elsie Eaves]] as a non-profit educational and service organization that attempted both to raise awareness of female engineers and increase their enrollment rates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated16/&gt; SWE held their first meeting with 50 engineers at Cooper Union in NJ.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With membership now exceeding 17,000 members in over 300 student organizations across the United States, the SWE's principal aims are to inform female students about opportunities in the field of engineering and to encourage female engineers to attain high levels of achievement.
