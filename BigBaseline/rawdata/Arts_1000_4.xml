Learners of [[Afrikaans]] as an additional language could be enabled to respond to aesthetical, [[emotion]]al, cultural and social values.  Through the use of Afrikaans [[folklore]] [[teacher]]s can focus on developing the learners' ability to behave with cultural and aesthetic sensitivity in different social contexts. Afrikaans examples of folklore are mentioned and discussed briefly to include stories with humour, magic, the transmission of social and [[Culture|cultural]] values and [[tradition]]s, ecological meaning, [[Idiom|idiomatic expressions]], [[praise poems]], [[ogre]] characters and [[stereotype]]s.

By means of a well-known background and/or context of a text, learners of Afrikaans as an [[Second language|additional language]] can become aware of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] range of the target language; they can become acquainted with the depth and content of meaning implied in the text. If a text is understood, the reader becomes personally involved and this, in itself, can lead the reader to interact creatively with the text - from the mechanical aspect of the language system to the analytical aspect - where s/he can participate in the story. The learner can thus discover how the events unfold, s/he can share the characters' emotional experiences and communicate their personal responses. Herein lies the relevance of a good reading text (despite the origin) - because the reader inhabits the text and in the process the language becomes transparent.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Moyo, T. 1997. Are the current high school literature texts of relevance to the culture of ESL learners? ''Journal for Language Teaching'' 31(1):42-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore facilitates [[language learning]] ==
The degree to which learners understand and identify with learning material is enhanced by the use of cultural contexts well known to them.&lt;ref&gt;Zulu, N.S. 1996. Teaching ESL literature: the problems of cultural selection in South Africa. ''Journal for Language Teaching,''  30(1):50-58.&lt;/ref&gt; All people are active participants in a dynamic cultural process.&lt;ref&gt;Lessing, A.C. &amp; De Witt, M.W. 1999. Riglyne vir die samestelling van 'n leesprogram vir T2-leerders. ''Journal for Language Teaching'' 33(1):46-59.&lt;/ref&gt; If folklore is made part of the [[literature]] teaching programme, learning Afrikaans as an additional language can come to play a significant role in the learner's everyday life, instead of remaining little more than an intellectual exercise performed in the isolation of a language class.

Folklore, as Potter&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; describes it, can be seen as a "lively [[fossil]] which refuses to die. It is a precipitate of the scientific and cultural lag of centuries and millennia of human experience ... folklore develops as the traditional, and usually oral, explanation of the origins and early history of man."

The American anthropologist Bascom&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; defines folklore as "a part of culture but not the whole of culture. It includes myths, legends, tales, proverbs, riddles, the texts of ballads and other songs, and other forms of lesser importance, but not folk art, folk dance, folk music, folk costume, folk medicine, folk custom, or folk belief."

Miruka&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; gives a specific account of what a narrative is: "a [[prose]] account of people, events, places, etc. that may be factual or fictional. The accounts are principally handed down from person to person and generation to generation through word of mouth. The term 'tale' and 'folktale' have been used to denote the same concept."

The significance of the above for the teaching programme of Afrikaans as an additional language is that the [[Culture|cultural]] experiences of the learner could be included, enriched and adapted through folklore as an instrument in a literary context.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Experience with Zulu teacher education students&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; showed that African [[folklore|folktales]] (by Minnie Postma, Eugène Marais and folktales from East Africa) as well as the comic strips by T.O. [[T. O. Honiball|Honiball]] captured the attention and interest of the students. They did not have to struggle to understand the background while acquiring new vocabulary. They were immediately able to identify with the characters and could participate in extended readings. While reading these stories and comic strips, their receptive vocabulary increased and this eventually facilitated their progression to a more active and productive form of language (speaking and writing).

== Folklore as part of a core literature ==
One way of bringing about harmony in our multicultural nation, is to assist today's learners to acquire intercultural [[:wikt:sensitivity|sensitivity]]. The teaching of a core literature can contribute to this aim, and my understanding of this concept is that it will represent all the activities and experiences of being human that we share with one another in our South African society. Folklore is an example of such a core literature. It comprises the transmitted verbalisation of events and values that are inherently part of the human race as a species - values that are specific and nonetheless universal, such as integrity, loyalty, honour, freedom, etc.

The [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] character of South African society implies that each community creates its own images of universal values and ideas. When studying a literature text, the educator in the additional language classroom will have to lead the learners to the discovery and study of the relevant values involved. This should be done in such a way, through folklore as a literary instrument, that no-one's integrity or self-esteem is threatened. The educator should always take into account the fact that each learner brings with him/her his/her own version of these values into the classroom.

Harmon&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Leach, M. (ed).  1972. ''Standard dictionary of folklore, mythology and legend.''  Toronto: Funk &amp; Wagnalls Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt; defines folklore as follows: "Folklore is something which the individual has in common with his fellows ... It makes possible - perhaps it might be defined as that which constitutes - his rapport with his particular segment of mankind."

The article should like to plead in favour of an increased awareness of and active use of folklore (in Afrikaans), within an African context (inter alia), in the language curriculum. The term "folklore" has a wide range of meanings and some researchers&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Dundes, A. 1965. ''The study of folklore''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; interpret the concept loosely and differently, so much so that there is an entire dictionary for this one term.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The article will limit itself to oral forms of expression and concentrate on folktales which involve [[humour]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], the transmission of culture, ecological narrations, [[idiomatic expression]]s, [[praise poems]] and [[stereotype]]s when the term "folklore" is used.

== Afrikaans examples of folklore ==
The following important elements of folklore can be identified and analysed in the literature teaching classroom where Afrikaans is being learned.

=== Humour: the comical use of language, events, and [[Trickster|trickery]] ===
The practical implementation of the research done by Bosch&lt;ref&gt;Bosch, B. 1997. Humor in die taalklaskamer. ''Journal for Language Teaching'' 31(2):190-201.&lt;/ref&gt; on different aspects of humour can add to the enjoyment of reading humorous folktales - thus contributing to a sense of fun in learning Afrikaans as an additional language. Experience has shown that the humour expressed and understood by Zulu learners in the additional language classroom consists mostly of imitating [[comedy|comical]] situations, tone of voice, facial expressions and body language. Additional language learners struggle to appreciate humour that involves the implicit subtlety of word games.

Morain&lt;ref&gt;Valdes, J.M. 1986. ''Culture bound - bridging the cultural gap in language teaching.'' New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to "kinesics" which should be part of any learning programme that includes perception. Morain is of the opinion that kinesics can contribute to the understanding of social and intercultural relationships, because those who have "learned" a language without including the nonverbal component are seriously handicapped if they intend to interact with living members of the culture instead of with paper and print.

[[Kinesics]] includes understanding and interpreting body language to provide a creative means of communication across borders and add another dimension to the appreciation and expression of humour in the additional language classroom.

One of the functions of folklore is to entertain the audience. Therefore, humorous events set in motion by [[trickster]]s can contribute to amusement&lt;ref&gt;Bascom, W.R. 1965. Folkore and Anthropology. In: DUNDES, A. ''The study of folklore''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; and mental stimulation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Miruka, O. 1994. ''Encounter with oral literature.'' Nairobi: East African Educational Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the actions of the "Jakkals en Wolf" characters of Afrikaans folktales which Honiball&lt;ref&gt;Honiball, T.O. 1942. Jakkals en Wolf-reeks. ''Die Jongspan''.&lt;/ref&gt; portrayed in comic strips and cartoons. Lategan&lt;ref&gt;Lategan, F.V. 1985. T.O. Honiball - 'n waardering. ''Lantern'' (January):46-59.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the remarkable way in which Honiball used the Jakkals and Wolf stories that he had heard as a child. His stories followed an old tradition of Middle Dutch literature - that of the satirical ''Van den Vos Reynaerde'' - and Honiball became the Walt Disney of Afrikaans. He used satire to gently ridicule people and to unmask human frailty&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; among the Afrikaans-speaking society of the day, mocking the eccentric habits and customs of a community.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dégh, L. 1965. Folk narrative. In: Dundes, A. ''The study of folklore''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cartoon]]s and comics like these are not regarded by all folklore specialists as belonging to folklore, because they do not explicitly include oral traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Utley, F.L. 1965. Folk literature: an operational definition. In: Dundes, A. ''The study of folklore''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since they are based on the "Jakkals en Wolf" intertextual tradition of oral folktales that have been handed down for generations,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Steenberg, E. 1987. ''Fantasie en die kinderboek - 'n kernhandleiding'' . Pretoria: HAUM-Literêr.&lt;/ref&gt; it could be argued that Honiball's ''Adoons-hulle'' (1977) and ''Wolf en Jakkals van Uilekraal'' (1978) can indeed be regarded as part of mass-cultural folklore where city life is portrayed by the mass media. Dorson&lt;ref&gt;Dorson, R.M. 1972. ''African folklore.'' Bloomington: Indiana University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; cites Bausinger (1961) who maintains that "we no longer believe that [[Industrialisation|industrialization]] necessarily implies the end of a specific folk culture, but rather we attempt to trace the modifications and mutations undergone by folk culture in the industrialized and urbanized world."

These [[comic strip]]s by Honiball provide interesting teaching possibilities in the additional language classroom, especially because of the elements of humour in the animal tricksters,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Finnegan, R. 1970. ''Oral Literature in Africa''. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; comical situations, body language and language usage (e.g. the nicknames of some of the characters). This argument is in line with Jansen,&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, W.H. 1965. The esoteric-exoteric factor in folklore. In: Dundes, A.  ''The study of folklore''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; who is of the opinion that comics and television series should receive the interest of folklorists and should incite them to pursue further the application and significance of the esoteric-exoteric factor in folklore.

=== Magic ===
An Afrikaans story that could be classified as a [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] tale&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; in that it portrays the role of magic and the repetition of the number three, is "Die Wolfkoningin" by I.D. du Plessis.&lt;ref&gt;Du Plessis, I.D. 1970. ''Doederomandro en ander Kaapse Stories.'' Kaapstad: Human &amp; Rousseau.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this story is called a Cape story, since it reflects the culture of people of Malay origin, who are concentrated in the Western Cape (Du Plessis can be regarded as one of South Africa's leading experts on Cape Malay stories). Following Bettelheim, Steenberg&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; would probably regard the story as a fairy tale. It is a story of magic that reflects some aspects of the inner world of human beings. According to Miruka's classification of folktale content, it can be called an [[imagination|imaginary]] tale.

This imaginary tale has a typically Eastern setting, with a rural atmosphere. There are hunters, a wood, rich landowners ("wazirs") and beautiful ladies ("poeteri"). There is a definite movement from an earthly space (the house of a wood cutter) to a magical space (a dance party and a wolf's den), and ultimately a return to an earthly reality (the house of the wazir). The number three reoccurs in different spatial settings and with respect to different objects, and symbolises&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the character's search for freedom, identity and fellowship. The main character's [[incantation]] in order to release the magical power (where she changes from a wolf into a beautiful lady) also centres on this number. In this context, the symbolism of these objects can stretch "the capacity of both expression and comprehension, and becomes the medium through which some of the most universal, elemental - and intangible - concepts of man are conveyed".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The transmission of social and cultural [[Value (ethics)|values]] and [[tradition]]s ===
Some of the best examples of Afrikaans folklore are stories recorded and written by Minnie Postma,&lt;ref&gt;(a) Postma, M. 1964. ''Litsomo''. Johannesburg: Afrikaanse Pers-Boekhandel.

(b) Postma, M. 1986. ''As die maan oor die lug loop (Sotho-verhale).'' Kaapstad: Tafelberg.
&lt;/ref&gt; who grew up with and heard these tales told by Sotho people. Using these stories can give effect to a recommendation made by Robinson,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Robinson, G.L.N. 1995. ''Crosscultural understanding: Processes and approaches for foreign language, English as a second language and bilingual educators''. New York: Pergamon Institute of English.&lt;/ref&gt; namely that the integration of culture in a language programme should be a synthesis between the learner's home culture, the target language's cultural input and the learner as an individual. According to Robinson, intercultural understanding develops from cultural adaptability, that is, 'modifying one's own cultural repertoire'.

An interesting example of an Afrikaans folktale that is situated in an [[Africa]]n context and entails the transmission of cultural values, traditions and views, is Postma's story "In die begin". This story explains how things were between woman and man in the beginning. Miller&lt;ref&gt;Miller, P. 1979. ''Myths and legends of Southern Africa.'' Cape Town: T.V. Bulpin Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; gives a similar account of the same phenomenon in a discussion of a Sotho-Tswana myth called "The First Marriage and the First Bachelor".

Hattingh&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Hattingh, M. 1994. Die baie stemme van Minnie Postma se ''Litsomo''. ''Stilet'' 6:39-56.&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the validity of Postma's oral transmission in detail and notes that Postma understands and applies the different characteristics of [[Southern Sotho language|Southern Sotho]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; narratives. Jacottet (1908. in Hatthingh 1994) postulates that this story has its origin in [[San people|San]] culture, because the men in the story use bows and arrows, weapons which were never used by the [[Sotho people|Basotho]]. In both Postma's and Jacottet's representation of this myth, the woman's identity is established in terms of masculine criteria. However, Postma adds a new dimension. Her narration depicts a woman as an intelligent, creative and innovative being, even if she is the servant of the man. The dialogue in the story is typical of the oral narrative in that dramatic development, rather than description, is preferred. The relationship between male and female is exceptionally harmonious, unlike in most other Southern Sotho [[narrative]]s.

=== Ecological stories ===
The folktales of Eugène Marais&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Marais, E.N. 1965. ''Dwaalstories''. Kaapstad: Human &amp; Rousseau.&lt;/ref&gt; are typical examples of African ecological narratives concerning the relationship between things and people. Marais follows the tradition of San stories, more specifically those that are known as wandering stories,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Kannemeyer, J.C. 1978. ''Geskiedenis van die Afrikaanse literatuur I.'' Kaapstad: Academica.&lt;/ref&gt; in that songs and poems are included.

In "Die Vaal Koestertjie" we find well-known themes of threatened [[innocence]] and beauty, and the weaker character's victory over physical strength and mockery. According to Kannemeyer,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; this story - with its use of the apostrophe, paradox, inversion and cumulative and progressive parallelism - follows to a great extent the traditional line of fairy-tale literature. A young Koisan girl, Nampti, has a very special relationship with a little bird, which she calls 'her little grey sister' because they are both pipits.

This character fits in very well with Miruka's general description&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; of birds in [[Ecology|ecological]] stories - she seems unfailingly to appear in times of crisis and she acts as a messenger bearing urgent and important messages, more specifically information about the magic formula that can transform and enrich the protagonist. She (the bird) is invincible, being up in the air and out of reach of the antagonists, in this case the other young women. She counsels the protagonist and is her life guardian.

Like other folktales, this story can be used in the language classroom to discuss [[Morality|moral]] voices, choices, and values like patience and tolerance, even fatalistic benevolence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== [[Idiomatic expression]]s ===
Language plays an important role in any culture. Hyde&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Kamwangamalu, N. 1997. English and transformation to multicultural education in the new South Africa. ''Journal for Language Teaching'' 31(3):243-252.&lt;/ref&gt; observes that people are not necessarily prisoners of their language, but that the way a culture sees the world is nevertheless reflected in its language. In the same vein, Trivedi&lt;ref&gt;Trivedi, H.C. 1978. Culture in language learning. ''English Language Teaching Journal'' 32(2):92-97.
&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises the importance of the transmission of values as well as the recognition of [[emotion]]al problems that the learner might experience (like culture shock and feelings of helplessness), language anxiety and fear of failure, in being unable to understand or interpret the cultural message. The (learned) behaviour and values of learners of an additional language will be challenged through exposure to the culture of the target language. Their critical appreciation will be intensified by listening to Afrikaans folklore.

Miruka&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; mentions an important function of folklore, namely that of [[mind|mental]] stimulation. Developmental aspects such as memory training, [[sensory system|sensory]] awareness, analysis and synthesis, as well as affective development can be specifically emphasised in this regard. The development of all mental and other capacities can be enhanced by the use of an Afrikaans folktale full of idiomatic expressions: "Klein Riet-alleen-in-die-roerkuil" by Eugène Marais, which is included in the volume ''Dwaalstories'' (1927).

This story by Marais follows the basic pattern of Western European [[fairy tale]]s and myths&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; in that the San hero (Klein Riet) is given an important task to carry out within a specific time frame. Nolte&lt;ref&gt;Nolte, E. 1999. Terug na die teks of om stroomop te swem. ''Stilet'' 11:9-22.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the whole story might have developed around a range of Afrikaans [[idiomatic expression]]s.  These expressions can be regarded as a reflection of the values of the source culture in the classroom for Afrikaans as an additional language. This study by Nolte can serve an important function in helping to overcome the previously mentioned problems that learners of Afrikaans as an additional language often experience.

Idiomatic expressions and the like are very well received and appreciated by additional language learners from African cultures (as experience with [[Zulu language|Zulu]]-speaking learners has shown,&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Kruger, E. 2002. Folklore as a multi-cultural component in the literature curriculum for Afrikaans as additional language. ''Southern African Journal for Folklore Studies,'' 12(2):93-113.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps because they often have so many of these in their [[First language|mother tongue]]. However, because of urbanisation, many idiomatic expressions have been lost in African languages. These learners have a rich instinct for idioms and have often even created new expressions themselves in the additional language context (e.g. 'Matriek is nie matras nie').&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

A folktale full of idiomatic expressions could make African learners feel at ease (emotionally), could stimulate their senses (by making them aware of metaphors in their own environment, analysing, synthesising and trying to verbalise these in their own way in Afrikaans like the abovementioned example) and could develop their memory. It could also provide an opportunity to discuss some of these themes that are addressed in a literary way by the story, for example pride and obedience, which would be in line with what is said by Leach&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; about [[proverb]]s, namely that they are constantly used to influence the behaviour of others and as instruments of self-control.

=== Praise poems ===
A story like "Lied van die reën" by Eugène Marais&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; is an ideal example of an Afrikaans [[praise song]] that could contribute to the integration of cultural aspects of previously marginalised groups in the curriculum to achieve sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Coming from an African culture, Kamwangamalu is of the opinion that almost every element in a language programme is capable of conveying a [[Culture|cultural]] message of some sort'': "''Culture is the socially learned, shared assemblage of practices, perceptions, attitudes, world views, value systems and beliefs that determine the texture of our lives as members of a given community."

According to Mihálik&lt;ref&gt;Mihálik, A. 1988. Die lied van die reën - 'n Afrika-pryslied. ''Tydskrif vir Letterkunde'' 26:84-91.&lt;/ref&gt; this folktale by Marais, although it was considered to be an indigenous fairy tale, is an example of an African praise song that can be compared with Sotho and Zulu praise songs dedicated to nature. Mihálik refers to Finnegan's view&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; that there is a similarity between African and European folklore and that there is supposedly some primordial source for both. The impression is that Marais got these stories from a certain "old Hendrik" (probably Tswana or Sotho) during his visits to the [[Waterberg District Municipality|Waterberge]].

=== [[Ogre]] characters ===
A folktale that calls to mind the European fairy tale ''The Beauty and the Beast'' on the one hand, yet fits Miruka's description&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; of a tale involving African ogre characters, is ''Brolloks en Bittergal'' by C.J. Langenhoven.&lt;ref&gt;Langenhoven, C.J. 1977. ''Brolloks en Bittergal.'' Kaapstad: Tafelberg.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in 1925, and has kept Afrikaans-speaking listeners spellbound from one generation to the next ever since.

The main character, Brolloks, is a grotesque and monsterlike individual, scheming and decidedly untrustworthy. He is like Miruka's description&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; of Luo ogres: neither human nor animal but displaying characteristics of both; and the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] ogre: 'a [[man-eater]] as well as an eater of its own kind ... [possessing the] quality of [[grandiosity]] and [[Hedonism (Just Because You Feel Good)|hedonism]]'. Brolloks lives as a human being would. Miruka emphasises that ogres are but masks of humanity; they are no different from those in society 'who specialise in ugly deeds but who can appear very mild and sociable to gain access to the victims'. Brolloks ultimately corresponds to Miruka's interpretation of the ogre who stands "for evil and death. He symbolises the ominous flail of vice looming over humanity and threatening to reduce it to nothingness. He is a replica of those of us who are dehumanised, alienated, immoral and egotistically ready to achieve their goals ... regardless of the repercussions on the larger society".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is clear that this type of Afrikaans folklore text themes of complicated everyday moral issues, like [[Greed and fear|greed]], [[bullying]] and hedonism.

=== Stereotypes ===
Robinson&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; warns that knowledge of differences between cultures can separate rather than unite learners because it may lead to [[Stereotype|stereotyping]]. According to her it is actually the study of similarities that will lead to [[Cross-cultural communication|intercultural]] understanding. Bredella &amp; Haack&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Bredella, L. &amp; Haack, D. 1988. ''Perceptions and misperceptions: The United States and Germany.'' Tübingen: Gunter Narr Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; also looks at stereotypes and argues that "a foreign culture challenges our basic assumptions and demands that we reconstruct the original context of a culture in order to understand its symbols in terms of the people who have created them".

Lippmann&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; advises us "not to try and give up stereotypes but to learn to use them in a reflective and self-critical way ... the insight into the selective nature of [[stereotype]]s can make us self-critical and can encourage us to compare other [[point of view (philosophy)|perspectives]] and the motives behind them."

The challenge to the [[Teacher|educator]] concerned with the teaching of Afrikaans as an additional language, is to find and select literature texts carefully so that the stereotypes found in these texts can be analysed, formulated, expressed and communicated. In this way stereotypes can present opportunities in the classroom for an objective investigation into this phenomenon. The study of folklore is imminently suitable to contribute to this developmental aim.

A very good example in support of this argument, is a report by Hattingh&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; where she used the story "Tséane en die perd" (written by Minnie Postma) in a study with her Afrikaans Second Language students. This folktale tells the story of a black woman who does not fit in with the [[customary]] stereotype. Tséane is portrayed as a rebel - in spite of her strict, traditional upbringing she longs for freedom, and to play a role different to the one in which her patriarchal society wishes to cast her. This story was Hattingh's students' first encounter with Afrikaans oral literature as part of the important [[cultural heritage]] of Africa. Hattingh mentions that this story was received extremely favourably by the students. It is obvious from Hattingh's report that the shift in emphasis from literary textual analysis to a focus on everyday issues made it possible for the students to use their own life experience and to progress to [[Problem solving|problem-solving]] and [[:wikt:independent|independent]] thinking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24011">An '''album cover''' is the front of the packaging of a commercially released audio recording product, or [[album]]. The term can refer to either the printed cardboard covers typically used to package sets of {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} 78-rpm records, single and sets of {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} [[LP record|LP]]s, sets of 45 rpm records (either in several connected sleeves or a box), or the front-facing panel of a [[compact disc|CD]] [[optical disc packaging|package]], and, increasingly, the primary image accompanying a [[music download|digital download]] of the album, or of its individual [[Track (CD)|tracks]].

In the case of all types of tangible records, it also serves as part of the protective sleeve.

== Early history ==
Around 1910, 78-rpm records replaced the [[phonograph cylinder]] as the medium for recorded sound. The 78-rpm records were issued in both 10- and 12-inch diameter sizes and were usually sold separately, in brown paper or cardboard sleeves that were sometimes plain and sometimes printed to show the producer or the retailer's name. These were invariably made out of acid paper, limiting conservability. Generally the sleeves had a circular cutout allowing the record label to be seen. Records could be laid on a shelf horizontally or stood upright on an edge, but because of their fragility, many broke in storage.

German record company [[Odeon Records|Odeon]] pioneered the "album" in 1909 when it released the ''[[Nutcracker Suite]]'' by [[Tchaikovsky]] on four double-sided discs in a specially designed package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/notes.html#cylinder | title= Recording Technology History | date= 6 July 2005 | first= Steve |last= Schoenherr | publisher= [[University of San Diego]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070329065002/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/notes.html#cylinder | archivedate= 29 March 2007 | accessdate= 27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (It is not indicated what the specially designed package was.) The practice of issuing albums does not seem to have been taken up by other record companies for many years.

Beginning in the 1920s, bound collections of empty sleeves with a plain [[paperboard]] or [[leather]] cover were sold as "[[record albums]]" (similar to a photograph album) that customers could use to store their records. (The name "record album" was printed on some covers.) These empty albums were sold in both 10- and 12-inch sizes.&lt;ref name=personal&gt;Example in personal collection.&lt;/ref&gt; The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside, allowing the record album to be placed on a shelf upright, like a book, and suspending the fragile records above the shelf, protecting them.

Starting in the 1930s, record companies began issuing collections of 78-rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled collections. These albums of several 78-rpm records could include a collection of popular songs related by either performer or style, or extended-length [[classical music]], including complete symphonies.&lt;ref name=personal /&gt;

In 1938, [[Columbia Records]] hired [[Alex Steinweiss]] as its first [[art director]]. He is credited with inventing the concept of album covers and [[Cover art#Album cover art|cover art]], replacing the plain covers used before. After his initial efforts at Columbia, other record companies followed his lead. By the late 1940s, record albums for all the major companies featured their own colorful paper covers in both 10- and 12-inch sizes. Some featured reproductions of classic art while others utilized original designs.

When the 10- and 12-inch long-playing records ([[LP record|LP]]s) came along in 1948, and box sets of 45-rpm records soon followed (see [[gramophone record]]), the name "album" was used for the new format of collections, and the creation of artistic original album covers continued.

== Formats ==
From the 1950s through to the 1980s, the 12" LP record and the 45 rpm record became the major formats for the distribution of [[popular music]]. The LP format remains in use  for occasional new releases, though other formats have largely supplanted it. The size of the typical cardboard LP sleeve cover is {{convert|12.375|in|cm|abbr=on}} square.

Since the mid-1990s, the [[compact disc]] (CD) has become the most common form of physically-distributed music products. [[Optical disc packaging|Packaging formats]] vary, including the jewel case (which since 1982 has been the most popular form of CD packaging), and the cardboard and plastic combination commonly known as a [[Digipak]] (which has been a popular alternative form of packaging in recent years, but remains supplanted by the jewel case due to higher manufacturing costs and lower durability). Typically the album cover component of these packages is approximately {{convert|4.75|in|cm|abbr=on}} square.

== Design ==

The Album Art Cover with eyecatching illustration, vibrant colours and lettering, is generally attributed to the American designer Alex Steinweiss in the 1950s.
{{see also|Cover art#Album cover art}}
The cover became an important part of the culture of music.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393"&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Doggett|year=2015|title=Electric Shock: From the Gramophone to the iPhone: 125 Years of Pop Music |publisher=The Bodley Head|location=London|isbn=978-1-847922182|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of designers like [[Bob Cato]],{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} who at various stages in his long music career was vice president of creative services at both [[Columbia Records]] and [[United Artists]], album covers became renowned for being a marketing tool and an expression of artistic intent.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt; Album art has also been discussed as an important postwar cultural expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958205262|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962-|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=|oclc=958205262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1960s, [[the Beatles]]' ''[[With the Beatles]]'', [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' and [[the Rolling Stones]]' [[The Rolling Stones (album)|self-titled debut album]] each contained a cover photograph designed to further the musical artist's public image. Author [[Peter Doggett]] also highlights the cover of [[Otis Redding]]'s ''[[Otis Blue]]'', containing a photo of a young white woman, as a design that "played a dual role: she represented the transcendent power of the music, and obscured the race of its creator."&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt; The standard portrait-based LP cover was further challenged over 1965–66 by Dylan's ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'', through the inclusion of symbolic artefacts around the singer; the artificially stretched faces of the Beatles shown on their ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album; and the darkened hues applied to the Rolling Stones on ''[[Aftermath (The Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]''.&lt;ref name="Doggett p 393" /&gt;

[[Gatefold|Gatefold cover]]s (a folded double cover) and inserts, often with lyric sheets, made the album cover a desirable work in its own right. Notable examples are [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which had cut-out inserts, printed lyrics, and a gatefold sleeve, even though it was a single album; [[the Rolling Stones]]' ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'', which had a gatefold and a series of 12 perforated postcards as inserts (taken by photographer [[Norman Seeff]]); and [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'', which had a gatefold, lyrics, no title on the sleeve, and poster and sticker inserts. [[The Band]]'s 1970 release ''[[Stage Fright (album)|Stage Fright]]'', which included a photograph by Seeff as a poster insert, is an early example of LP artwork quickly becoming a collector's item. The move to the small (less than 1/4 the size of a record) CD format lost that impact, although attempts have been made to create a more desirable packaging for the CD format, for example the reissue of ''Sgt. Pepper'', which had a cardboard box and booklet, or the use of oversized packaging.

The importance of design was such that some cover artists specialised or gained fame through their work. Such people include the design team [[Hipgnosis]], through their work on [[Pink Floyd]] albums, amongst others; [[Roger Dean (artist)|Roger Dean]], famous for his [[Yes (band)|Yes]] and [[Greenslade]] covers; [[Cal Schenkel]], for [[Captain Beefheart]]'s ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' and [[Frank Zappa]]'s ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]''.

The talents of many photographers and illustrators from both inside and outside of the music industry have been used to produce a vast array of memorable LP/CD covers. Photographer [[Mick Rock]] produced some of the most iconographic album covers of the 1970s, including [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s ''[[Queen II]]'' (recreated for their classic music video [[Bohemian Rhapsody]]), [[Syd Barrett]]'s ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'', and [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Transformer (album)|Transformer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6613107.stm Photographer lives the Rock dream] BBC News. Retrieved May 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; From 1972 to 1975, photographer [[Norman Seeff]] was Creative Director at [[United Artists]] and in addition to his many cover photographs ([[The Band]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]'s [[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter than Hell]], [[Joni Mitchell]]'s [[Hejira (album)|Hejira]] etc.), he art directed dozens of album covers including ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'', many of which received [[Grammy]] nominations. In addition to the examples mentioned previously, a number of world-renowned graphic artists and illustrators such as [[Ed Repka]] ([[Megadeth]]), [[Andy Warhol]] ([[The Velvet Underground]],&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1987) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/Andy-Warhol-Velvet-Underground "Andy Warhol &amp; the Velvet Underground"]. In ''Cross-Overs: Art into Pop, Pop into Art'' (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Rolling Stones]]), [[Mati Klarwein]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Miles Davis]]), [[H. R. Giger]] ([[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]], [[Debbie Harry]]), [[Frank Frazetta]] ([[Molly Hatchet]]), [[Derek Riggs]] ([[Iron Maiden]]), [[Jamie Reid]] ([[The Sex Pistols]]), [[Howard Finster]] ([[R.E.M.]], [[Talking Heads]]), [[Al Hirschfeld]] ([[Aerosmith]]), [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]] ([[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Manowar]]), [[Gottfried Helnwein]] ([[Marilyn Manson]]), [[Rex Ray]] ([[David Bowie]]), [[Robert Crumb]] ([[Big Brother &amp; the Holding Company]]), [[John Van Hamersveld]] (The Rolling Stones), and [[Shepard Fairey]] ([[Johnny Cash]]) have all applied their talents to memorable music packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/948670847|title=Total records : photography and the art of the album cover|others=Beaupré, Antoine de,, Vincendet, Serge,, Stourdzé, Sam,, Denis, Jacques,, Mondino, Jean-Baptiste, 1949-|isbn=9781597113847|edition=First Aperture|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=948670847}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/952207403|title=Art record covers|last=1978-|first=Spampinato, Francesco,|others=Wiedemann, Julius,|isbn=9783836540292|location=[Koln, Germany]|oclc=952207403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of record covers have also used images licensed (or borrowed from the public domain) from artists of bygone eras. Well-known examples of this include the cover of [[Derek and the Dominos]] ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (from the painting "La Fille au Bouquet" by French painter and sculptor [[Émile Théodore Frandsen de Schomberg]]), 'The Downfall of Icarus' by Genisson on the cover of the first album by [[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]]; [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]] on the cover of [[Deep Purple (album)|Deep Purple]]; [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Breugel]] on the cover of [[Fleet Foxes (album)|Fleet Foxes]]; the cover of Kansas's debut album, adapted from a mural by painter [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Norman Rockwell]]'s cowboy ([[Pure Prairie League]]), and, more recently, [[Coldplay]]'s ''[[Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends|Viva La Vida]]'', which features [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s painting ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (a favorite in [[The Louvre]]) with the words "VIVA LA VIDA" brushed on top in white paint.

Legends from photography and video/film who have also produced record cover images include [[Drew Struzan]] ([[Black Sabbath]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Iron Butterfly]], [[The Beach Boys]] and others), [[Annie Leibovitz]] ([[John Lennon]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Patti Smith]]), [[Richard Avedon]] ([[Whitney Houston]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]]), [[David LaChappelle]] ([[No Doubt]], [[Elton John]]), [[Anton Corbijn]] ([[U2]], [[The Killers]], [[Depeche Mode]]), [[Karl Ferris]] ([[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Donovan]], [[The Hollies]]), [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] ([[Patti Smith]], [[Peter Gabriel]]) and [[Francesco Scavullo]] ([[Diana Ross]], [[Edgar Winter]]), [[David Michael Kennedy]] others.

A number of artists and bands feature members who are, in their own right, accomplished illustrators, designers and photographers and whose talents are exhibited in the artwork they produced for their own recordings. Examples include [[Jimmy Page]] (''Led Zeppelin IV''), [[Chris Mars]] (Replacements' ''Pleased to Meet Me'' and others), [[Marilyn Manson]] (''Lest We Forget...''), [[Michael Stipe]] (REM's ''Accelerator''), [[Thom Yorke]] (credited as "Tchocky" on misc. [[Radiohead]] records), [[Michael Brecker]] (''Ringorama''), [[Freddie Mercury]] (''Queen I''), [[Lynsey De Paul]] (''Surprise''), [[John Entwistle]] (''Who By Numbers''), [[Graham Coxon]] (''13'' and most solo albums), [[Mike Shinoda]] (various [[Linkin Park]] albums), [[Joni Mitchell]] (''Miles of Aisles'' and several others) as well for [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]] (''So Far''), and [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] (credited variously on [[Elastica]]'s ''The Menace'', her records), and [[Captain Beefheart]], 'Mona Bone Jakon', 'Tea for the Tillerman' and 'Teaser and the Firecat' by [[Cat Stevens]], [[Mika (singer)|Mika]] (all albums released to date), ''[[Music from Big Pink]]'' (for The Band), ''Self Portrait'' and ''Planet Waves'' by [[Bob Dylan]], ''Walls and Bridges'' by [[John Lennon]].

Album cover art was the subject of a 2013 documentary film, ''The Cover Story: Album Art'', by Eric Christensen, a [[San Francisco Bay Area]] record collector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sam Whiting |url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/Film-puts-lively-spin-on-album-cover-art-4209802.php#page-1 |title=Film puts lively spin on album cover art |publisher=SFGate |date=2013-01-20 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical design of album covers has been the subject of creative innovation. ''[[Ogden's Nut Gone Flake]]'' by the [[Small Faces]] was originally in a circular metal tin, and ''[[Happy to Meet – Sorry to Part]]'' by [[Horslips]] was in an octagonal package. [[Anyway (album)|Anyway]] by [[Family (band)|Family]] was originally issued in an opaque plastic package through which a design (a Leonardo sketch) could be seen. ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (album)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'' by the Beatles was first released as a double [[Extended play|EP]] with a booklet between the records. ''Sgt. Pepper'' contained a cardboard sheet of images, and ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (often referred to as the White Album) contained four large glossy photos of the individual Beatles along with a poster-sized collage. ''[[Live at Leeds]]'' by [[The Who]] also contained a generous supply of posters and printed material. ''[[Led Zeppelin III]]'' had a front cover that contained a revolving disc which brought different images into view through small cut-outs in the outer sleeve. A similar effect was used for the band's later album ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' with cut-outs of the windows of a brownstone building. The original issue of ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' by [[the Rolling Stones]] had an actual zipper incorporated into the picture of the crotch area of a pair of jeans. ''[[The Velvet Underground and Nico]]'' album had a Warhol-designed cardboard banana on the cover that could be peeled back. The record company [[Vertigo Records|Vertigo]] had a black-and-white design on the centre label that produced a hypnotic optical effect when the disc revolved on the turntable.

== Packaging ==
The album cover is a component of the overall packaging of an album. Especially in the case of vinyl records with paperboard  sleeves, these packages are prone to wear and tear, although wear and tear does often take place to some degree on covers contained within plastic cases. A variety of treatments could be applied to improve both their appearance and durability, such as clear plastic wrap. Many products have been available for the storage of vinyl albums, often clear plastic sleeves.

The surface of a vinyl record is readily damaged, so aside from the outer [[paperboard]] sleeve, there is usually an inner protective cover to protect against dust and handling. This is normally shaped to allow it to readily slide within the outer cover. The inner sleeve is either thin white paper, either plain or printed with information on other recordings available from the same company, or a paper sleeve supporting a thin [[plastic bag]]. These quite often have a circular cut out so that the record label can be read without directly handling the record, though when the inner sleeve is printed with lyrics, which became quite common, then there is usually no hole. Decca Records used a system of colour-coding on these sleeves where a blue color denoted a [[stereophonic sound|stereophonic]] recording while red denoted a [[Monaural|monophonic]] recording (the mono record players of the time were not always compatible with stereo records). This system was begun in the 1960s to reduce packaging costs.

[[Optical disc packaging|Packaging formats for compact discs]] widened the variety of presentations as well, even as the size of the CD meant that album covers were no longer so large.

Besides the practicalities of identifying specific records, album covers serve the purpose of advertising the musical contents on the LP, through the use of [[graphic design]], [[photography]], and/or [[illustration]]. An album cover normally has the artist's name, sometimes in [[logo]] form; and the album title. Occasionally, though more common on historical vinyl records, the cover may include a reference number; a branding (the [[Record label|label]]), and possibly a track listing. Other information is seldom included on the cover, and is usually contained on the rear or interior of the packaging, such as a track listing together with a more detailed list of those involved in making the record, band members, guest performers, engineers and producer. On the ''spine'' of the package, the artist, title, and reference number are usually repeated so that albums can be identified while tightly packed on a shelf.

== Album covers in the age of downloads ==
With the increasing popularity of digital music downloading services and the inflating cost of conducting business, the purpose and prevalence of the album cover is evolving. While the [[music industry]] tries to keep up with technological and cultural shifts, the role that packaging (and thus the "album cover") will play in consumer music sales in the near future is uncertain, although its role is certainly changing{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}, and digital forms of packaging will continue to surface, which, to some degree (and to some consumers) take the place of physical packaging.  Both MP3 and WMA music files are able to contain embedded digital album artworks (called cover images or simply covers) in jpeg format. {{as of|2008}}, physical music products, with a physical "album cover", continue to outsell digital downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/technologyNews/idUSN3049009520071231?sp=true|title=Digital album packaging should improve in 2008|first = Antony | last= Bruno|publisher=Reuters|date=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, album cover designer [[Peter Saville (artist)|Peter Saville]], responsible for cover art on albums by [[New Order (band)|New Order]] and [[Roxy Music]], suggested that the album cover was dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/45430/designer-peter-saville-the-album-cover-is-dead|title=Peter Saville Says Album Cover is Dead|author=Jason Gregory|publisher=Gigwise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternately, some artists have used Internet technology to generate even more cover art. For instance, [[Nine Inch Nails]] initially released its album ''[[The Slip (album)|The Slip]]'' as a free download on the band's website, attaching separate but thematically connected images to each individual track.

One digital solution is the [[iTunes LP]] format for interactive album artwork introduced by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] on 9 September 2009.

Album art is still considered a vital part of the listening experience to many, and despite the less-tangible nature of digital images, there are still many collectors trading cover art and music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albumartexchange.com/about.php |title=About |publisher=Albumartexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151013083754/http://www.albumartexchange.com/about.php |archivedate=2015-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Interactive Marketing and Creative Studio [https://www.hellobeaumonde.com/ Beaumonde] released a first of its kind fully [https://www.hellobeaumonde.com/blog/trill-sammy-press-release immersive and interactive album cover] for Houston-based rapper Trill Sammy. For the first time ever fans can view the 2D album like they traditionally would, then dive into the album cover via an immersive world available on Trill Sammy's Website. 

== Banned covers ==
{{expand section|date=September 2012}}
{{see also|List of controversial album art}}
Some album covers have been banned due to violence, nudity and other imagery. [[Guns N' Roses]]'s 1987 album ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]''{{'}}s cover depicted a robot rapist about to be punished by a metal avenger. [[Kanye West]]'s 2010 album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'' depicted West naked being straddled by a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] with her bare breasts and bare buttocks showing.

An '''art squat''' is a name used to describe the action of artists to occupy (or [[Squatting|squat]] in) an abandoned building, thereby creating studio space to create art. Art squats often have a semi-legal or illegal status.

[[Kunsthaus Tacheles|Tacheles]], in [[Berlin]], Germany, was one of many buildings occupied by artists in the years after [[World War II]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/arts/writings-on-the-wall-for-art-squat/2009/01/26/1232818332460.html?page=fullpage "Writing's on the wall for art squat"], ''Sydney Morning Herald'', January 27, 2009. Retrieved 2013-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to operate as a studio space and gallery until 2012, when the authorities closed it for redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Jones, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/sep/05/closure-tacheles-berlin-sad-alternative-art "The closure of Berlin's Tacheles squat is a sad day for alternative art"], Jonathan Jones on Art (blog), ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 5, 2012. Retrieved 2013-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paris, France, has experienced several decades of art squats, a result of high rents and a large [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] artist population.&lt;ref name="Fills the Void"&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/travel/31headsup.html?_r=1&amp; "In Paris, Art Fills the Void"], ''The New York Times (travel)'', January 26, 2010. Retrieved 2013-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples include the [[Bateau-Lavoir]] (destroyed during the 1970s) and Hôpital Éphémère, occupied during the 1980s and 90s.&lt;ref name="Fills the Void" /&gt; In the 2000s the Paris city hall began an initiative to redevelop and legalise the city's art squats, beginning with a 6-storey squat on [[rue de Rivoli, Paris|rue de Rivoli]] which was renovated and reopened in 2009.&lt;ref name="Fills the Void" /&gt;

Art Squat was also the name of an Artists Collective co-founded by [[Johnny Otto]] in [[Los Angeles]] in the early 90's, which took over abandoned properties in the Fairfax District and converted them into Galleries. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.artrevealmagazine.com/johnny-otto-ottophobia-conspiracy-propaganda-art/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12837">'''Arte Informale''' is a term coined in 1950 by the French critic [[Michel Tapié]] to refer to the art movement that began during the mid-1940s in post-World War II Europe. This movement also paralleled the [[Abstract Expressionism]] movement that was taking place at the same time in the United States, and had ties to the [[Arte Povera]] movement.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Philip|title=Art informel|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T004408?q=art+informel&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Sometimes referred to as [[Tachism]], Art Autre or [[Lyrical Abstraction]], it was a type of abstraction in which form became less important than that of the expressive impulses of the artist, and was opposed to the rationalism of traditional abstraction.&lt;ref name=cooper /&gt;  The qualities of informal art explore the possibilities of gesture, materials (often non traditional), and signage as the basis of communication. Oftentimes art characterized as informal is executed spontaneously and the approach to painting and sculpture are generally gestural, performative, expressionistic and experimental. Certain artists such as [[Lucio Fontana]], [[Alberto Burri]] and [[Emilio Vedova]] were crucial figures of this movement.

Arte Informale is based on the convention of painting while expanding the concept to include time-based themes and viewer dependent trials.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt;  [[Alberto Burri]], [[Emilio Vedova]], and [[Lucio Fontana]] are the three main Italian artists to question the limits of painting and sculpture by reassigning the expressive qualities.&lt;ref name=Petican /&gt; They tried to create new channels of communication to forge new styles that would reach beyond their predecessors.&lt;ref name=Petican /&gt; However, they were unable to break away from the history of Italian art.&lt;ref name=Petican /&gt;

Arte Informale became an internationally accepted movement that reached the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], the Japanese Gutai Group, and the South American Abstractionists.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; However, the primary adherents were French and Italian [[avant-garde]] artists.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; It was a movement wherein artists created a dialogue between material, subject, and the world.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; It was a rejection of the constrained thoughts of previous modern painters.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt;

==Alberto Burri==
[[Alberto Burri]] worked in Rome and was a role model for younger artists.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev"&gt;Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. "Thrust into the Whirlwind: Italian Art Before Arte Povera"&lt;/ref&gt; By observing the connection between culture and nature he saw that material had an existence of its own and that he as the artist was required to use the energy from the organic materials.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; Burri introduced energy, life, death, and destruction into his work through the use of natural and industrial materials.&lt;ref name=Petican&gt;Petican, Laura. "Arte Povera and the Baroque: Building an International Identity"&lt;/ref&gt; Burri was a solitary, quiet and aloof artist.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; His style emphasised the ethical weight and burden of living in a post-world war two era.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; As a [[Modernism|modernist]] Burri tried to give shape and rationality to the disorder of post-atomic contemporary culture by extending and exploring the limits of painting.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt;

In the 1950s in Rome the Gruppo Origine was founded which, brought artist like Ettore Colla and Burri together.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; They shared in common their rejection of abstract painters as too far detached from reality and realist painters as too disengaged from the relationship between life and art.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; However, Burri showed this through his work Sacchi by using thrown away burlap sacks and the method of suture that would reference human aspects and the practice of contemporary living.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt; He used the terms 'form' and 'space' to attain synchronization and stability in his work.&lt;ref name=Sacchi&gt;Hamilton, Jaimey. "Making Art Matter: Alberto Burri's Sacchi." October 124 (2008): 31-52. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Burri addressed the issues of energy, life, death, and destruction into his work through the use of natural and industrial materials.&lt;ref name=Petican /&gt;

===''Sacchi''===
The Sacchi was first created in 1950 but hundreds were made.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt;  Burri created these Sacchi by tearing and scoring pieces of burlap, adding stitching, then placing them on a canvas. Sometimes they were singed or accompanied by paint, red plastic or resin.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; On one hand the Sacchi acted as a concept of incorporating aspects of everyday life into art.&lt;ref name="Christov-Bakargiev" /&gt;  On the other hand, it was thought to be associated with the body.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; Burri had been trained as a doctor and worked as a surgeon in the war until he was captured and sent to an American POW camp in Texas, which is where he first started using burlap sacs.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; His past was the basis for a general consensus between critics was that it was a suggestion to the troubled status of Burri after the war.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; Lorenza Trucchi suggested that the burlap acted as a skin that Burri could project his traumatized recollections on.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; Francesco Arcangeli implied that Burri used violence to recognize and remind the viewers of the war.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; However, Maurizio Calvesi brought up the meaning of the material itself.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt;  At the time when Arte Informale was starting up in Italy the war had ended, the economy was fluctuating and the U.S Marshall Plan had been put into place.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt; Calves thought that Burri’s use of the burlap sac was due to the commonality of the leftover food bags and that he was commemorating poverty.&lt;ref name=Sacchi /&gt;

==Lucio Fontana==
[[Lucio Fontana]] (1899-1968) was one of the key figures of the post-war contemporary art scene in Europe. He was the founder of the [[Spatialism]] movement in Milan, and is best known for his Concetti spaziali (Spatial Concepts) where he pierced and cut canvases that worked to open up the flat surface of the painting into real space. His ideas were influential in the development of artists’ groups such as Azimuth and the Zero Group, as well as to the development of [[Arte Povera]].&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Anthony|title=Lucio Fontana: Between Utopia and Kitsch|journal=Grey Room|year=2001|jstor=1262573}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946 he wrote Manifesto Blanco (White Manifesto) that was signed by a number of his students in Buenos Aires. At the end of the 1950s Fontana showed his work at the Venice Biennale and other parts of Europe such as Germany and France.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;

The work of Fontana during post-war Milan created a shift in autonomous art object towards an exploration of art as a total environment. Through Fontana’s Spatial Environment of 1949 he worked to tie together architecture, painting, and sculpture, and had proposed an art form which integrated both reality and ambient space.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;  In these environments, the gallery space was transformed with the manipulation of light, shadow and space to create a complete experience. These gestural and experiential qualities of form and making are both characteristics of the informal artist movement.

Fontana’s Spatial Concept of 1951 sought to propose art forms that would complement modern developments in building technology.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;  Light within space became grounds for this development in neon, which eventually was installed in the 1951 Milan Triennial. The Spatial Concept “engaged the viewer with an opulent vision of radiance that extended into real architectural space beyond the limited and private pictorial plane.” &lt;ref name="white"/&gt; This inclusion of the audience in turn also provided Fontana’s environments with performers.

Both Spatial Environment and Spatial Concept was Fontana’s response to the difficult challenge of producing utopian artwork after the distress of World War II.&lt;ref name="white"/&gt;

Fontana’s “research into ‘[[Spatialism]]’, together with his charismatic presence in Milan, were determinant in encouraging the rise of [[Arte Povera]] in Italy.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christov-Bakargiev|first=Carolyn|title=Arte Povera|year=2005|publisher=Phaidon|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fontana’s contribution lies in the transition from an art of representation to an art of sheer perception, in which the work is a part of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lista|first=Giovanni|title=Arte Povera|year=2006|location=Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fontana does not identify himself as an informal artist, the language used in his work fits within the qualities of this movement.

==Ennio Morlotti==
Ennio Morlotti was an Italian painter who was part of the Arte Informale movement.[http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] He met up with the Arte Informale group when he visited Paris in 1947. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] This meeting is what started leading him in the direction of [[Fundació Antoni Tàpies|Matter Painting]]. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] He showed his works in the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1948, 1952, and 1956. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] The main theme of his works has been landscapes and his own style focuses on color and material on the work of art. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] He works with the natural pattern of nature in organic and inorganic forms. [http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/grove/art/T059674?q=morlotti&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=2&amp;_start=1#firsthit] Morlotti along with [[Emilio Vedova]] and other artists signed the ''Manifestio del Realismo'' in 1946 in Milan stating that the style of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] is dependent on communication with others as opposed to [[Realism (arts)|Naturalism]] or [[Abstraction]].&lt;ref name=Petican /&gt;

==Emilio Vedova==
[[Emilio Vedova]] (1919-2006) was a self-taught painter from Venice. At the end of World War II he took an active part in the liberation of Venice and in 1946 he joined the Fronte Nuovo delle Arti, a movement that aimed at reconciling social revolution in artistic expression.&lt;ref name=vedova&gt;{{cite web|title=Vedova, Emilio|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/benezit/B00189079?q=vedova&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|publisher=Oxford Art Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Vedova was influenced by art movements such as [[Cubism]] and [[Expressionism]] and admired the works of [[Tintoretto]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Goya]] and [[Picasso]].&lt;ref name="vedova"/&gt;  In the 1940s his style became increasingly gestural and began to fit in with the qualities of [[Lyrical Abstraction]] or [[Abstract Expressionism]].&lt;ref name="vedova"/&gt; Vedova’s works were attempting to explore the three-dimensional space through painting and to achieve depth within space.

==Giuseppe Capogrossi==
[[Giuseppe Capogrossi]] (1900-1972) was an Italian painter from Rome. Around 1950 Capogrossi transitioned from figurative painting towards abstraction.&lt;ref name=capogrossi&gt;{{cite web|title=Capogrossi, Giuseppe|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com.ezproxymfa.flo.org/subscriber/article/benezit/B00031691?q=capogrossi&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit|publisher=Oxford Art Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 he founded the Gruppo Origine along with Ballocco, Colla and Burri. “Their manifesto advocated the refusal of three-dimensional figuration, the use of color to serve a purely expressive purpose, and the use of primitive images, whose significance dates back to the birth of writing systems and symbols”.&lt;ref name="capogrossi"/&gt; After this time, Capogrossi composed his paintings on the basis of a single symbol- a sort of trident- which is repeated on his canvases and collages.&lt;ref name="capogrossi"/&gt; In Capogrossi’s work he discussed the impossibility of communication from artist to viewer, so he stressed that the artist must show the viewer what he wishes to communicate.

An '''artist''' is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the [[arts]], or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a [[business]] context, for [[musician|musicians]] and other performers (less often for actors). "Artiste" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism.

==Dictionary definitions==
Wiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows:
# A person who creates art.
# A person who makes and creates art as an [[wikt:occupation|occupation]].
# A person who is skilled at some activity.
# A person whose trade or profession requires a knowledge of design, drawing, painting, etc.
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the older broad meanings of the term "artist":

* A learned person or Master of Arts
* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally medicine, [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[chemistry]]
* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice
* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic
* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art
* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] – traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]

==History of the term==
The Greek word "techně", often translated as "art," implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, "technicus",&lt;ref&gt;
[[Oxford English Dictionary]] s.v. ''technic''
&lt;/ref&gt;
became the source of the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], technology, [[wikt:technical|technical]].

In Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:
* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]
* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of history
* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs
* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]
* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]
* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], singing, and [[rhetoric]]
* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance
* [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of comedy and [[bucolic poetry]]
* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]

No muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.&lt;ref&gt;
''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''art'' derives from the Latin "ars" (stem ''art-''), which, although literally defined, means "skill method" or "technique", and conveys a connotation of beauty.

During the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as Italy, but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some "artisanal" products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.

The first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472): ''[[De re aedificatoria]], De statua, De pictura'', which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).&lt;ref&gt;
P.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.

Many contemporary definitions of "artist" and "art" are highly contingent on culture, resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].

==The present day concept of an 'artist'==
''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as "a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium". The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.

Most often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as drawing, painting, [[sculpture]], acting, dancing, writing, filmmaking, [[New media art|new media]], photography, and music—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline. Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[pottery|potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]]. Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level.

The term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-"art" activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.

Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among "artist" and "[[technician]]", "entertainer" and "[[artisan]]", "[[fine arts|fine art]]" and "[[applied art]]", or what constitutes art and what does not. The French word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means "artist") has been imported into the English language where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word "artiste" can also be a [[pejorative]] term.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Wilson. [https://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=artist++uncomplimentary+%22artiste%22&amp;source=web&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result The Columbia guide to standard American English].&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.

In ''Living with Art'', Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Getlein |first=Mark |date=2012 |title=Living with Art |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill Education |isbn=978-0-07-337925-8 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Create places for some human purpose.
#Create extraordinary versions of ordinary objects.
#Record and commemorate.
#Give tangible form to the unknown.
#Give tangible form to feelings.
#Refresh our vision and help see the world in new ways.

After looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies &amp; program outcomes regarding artists, arts, &amp; culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between "arts for art's sake" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that "this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down" (Eikhof &amp; Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Third System of the Arts? An Exploration of Some Ideas from Larry Shiner's The Invention of Art: A Cultural History |url=http://www.contempaesthetics.org/newvolume/pages/article.php?articleID=519 |website=www.contempaesthetics.org |accessdate=2015-07-23 |date=21 December 2008 |publisher= |authorlink= |first=David |last=Clowney}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#arts ''consumers'' don't restrict themselves to either "high" or "common" arts; instead, they demonstrate "omnivorous tastes, liking both reggae and Rachmaninoff" (Peterson &amp; Kern, 1996; Walker &amp; Scott-Melnyk, 2002)
#data indicates "artists are willing to move across sectors and no longer see working outside the commercial sector as a badge of distinction or authenticity" (Bridgstock, 2013; Ellmeier, 2003)
#academic, policy, and government leaders are adapting—widening—programs &amp; opportunities in recognition of "the role of artists as drivers of economic growth and innovation" (Bohm &amp; Land, 2009; DCMS, 2006, 2008; Florida, 2012; Hesmondhalgh &amp; Baker, 2010; Lloyd, 2010; Iyengar, 2013).
#arts graduates name "business and management skills" as the "number one area [they] wish they had been more exposed to in college" (Strategic National Arts Alumni Project [SNAAP], 2011; Tepper &amp; Kuh, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=concept of artist |url=http://www.goines.net/Writing/what_is_artist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Training and employment ==
The [[US Bureau of Labor Statistics]] classifies many visual artists as either ''craft artists'' or ''fine artists''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/craft-and-fine-artists.htm|title=Craft and Fine Artists|last=|first=|date=17 December 2015|website=|series=Occupational Outlook Handbook|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-21|edition=2016–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A craft artist makes handmade functional works of art, such as pottery or clothing.  A fine artist makes paintings, illustrations (such as [[book illustration]]s or [[medical illustration]]s), sculptures, or similar artistic works primarily for their aesthetic value.

The main source of skill for both craft artists and fine artists is long-term repetition and practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many fine artists have studied their art form at university and some have a master's degree in fine arts.  Artists may also study on their own or receive on-the-job training from an experienced artist.

The number of available jobs as an artist is increasing more slowly than other fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  About half of US artists are self-employed.  Others work in a variety of industries.  For example, a pottery manufacturer will employ craft artists, and book publishers will hire illustrators.

In the US, fine artists have a median income of approximately US $50,000 per year, and craft artists have a median income of approximately US $33,000 per year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  This compares to US $61,000 for all art-related fields, including related jobs such as [[graphic designer]]s, [[multimedia artist]]s, [[animator]]s, and [[fashion designers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Many artists work part-time as artists and hold a second job.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Please resist the temptation to add your favorite artist or artform to this list. It is intended to illustrate the breadth of the concept, not to list every possible artform and movement. It should contain only the most significant directions and mention one artist who may be considered iconic in this domain. For all practical purposes it appears to be complete.

The "perception of charm and physical beauty" through their influence on "appealingness" only have an indirect effect on the intensity of attraction emotions.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Attraction'' may also refer to the object of the attraction itself, as in ''[[tourist attraction]]''.

==Visual attractiveness==
Visual attractiveness or visual appeal is attraction produced primarily by [[visual perception|visual stimuli]].

==Physical attractiveness==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}

[[Physical attractiveness]] is the perception of the physical traits of an individual [[human]] [[person]] as pleasing or [[beauty|beautiful]]. It can include various implications, such as [[sexual attractiveness]], [[cuteness]], [[Interpersonal attraction#Similarity (like-attracts-like)|similarity]] and [[physical attractiveness|physique]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Physical attractiveness can also include the attraction of smell. Pheromones secreted by animals and humans alike can attract others, and this is viewed as being attracted to smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/14/science-of-attraction-_n_6661522.html|title=The Strange Science Of Sexual Attraction|last=Gregoire|first=Carolyn|date=2015-02-14|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=HuffPo isn't the best possible source for medicine related topics|date=June 2018}} [[Human sex pheromones]] may play a role in human attraction, although it is unclear how well humans can actually pick up on the pheromones of another. 

Judgment of attractiveness of physical traits is partly universal to all human cultures, partly dependent on culture or [[society]] or time period, partly biological, and partly subjective and individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hönekopp | first = Johannes | authorlink = | title = Once more: Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Relative contributions of private and shared taste to judgments of facial attractiveness | publisher = APA| year = 2006 | url = http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/hsw/psychologie/professuren/allpsy2/Artikel/JEPHPP_2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cognitive_emotions_1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Review_Ortony_1989"/&gt;

==The Science Behind Attraction==
According to a study determining the golden ratio for facial beauty, the most attractive face is one with average distances between facial features, and an average length and width of the face itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pallett|first=Pamela|last2=Link|first2=Stephen|last3=Lee|first3=Kang|date=November 6, 2009|title=New "Golden" Ratios for Facial Beauty|pmc=2814183|journal=Vision Research|volume=50|pages=149–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Facial attractiveness, or [[beauty]], can also be determined by symmetry. If a face is asymmetrical, this can indicate unhealthy genetic information. Therefore, if a face is symmetrical (see [[Facial symmetry]]), healthy genetic information is implied. People will judge potential mates based off the physical expression of the genetic health, which is their apparent attractiveness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=B.C.|last2=Little|first2=A.C.|last3=Penton-Voak|first3=I.S.|last4=Tiddeman|first4=B.P.|last5=Burt|first5=D.M.|last6=Perrett|first6=D.I.|date=November 2001|title=Facial symmetry and judgements of apparent health: Support for a “good genes” explanation of the attractiveness–symmetry relationship|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513801000836|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=22|pages=417-420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This supports the good genes theory, which indicates that attractiveness is seen as a way to ensure that offspring will have the healthiest genes and therefore the best chance of survival. Certain trains that indicate good genes (such as clear skin or facial symmetry) are seen as desirable when choosing a partner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/good-genes-hypothesis|title=Good genes hypothesis|last=The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Brittanica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Sexual Selection and Attraction in Non-human Animals==

Among animals, females often are "choosy" about who they pick for a mate. They will look for characteristics in their potential mates that ensure their offspring will have healthy genetic material. Therefore, they will be attracted to certain traits or behaviors of their potential mates. Attraction among animals is based mostly on what will give the females the best chance of having the most and healthiest offspring that will likely survive to adulthood because of the traits they will inherit from the male&lt;ref&gt; Alcock, J. (2001). The Evolution of Reproductive Behavior. In Animal Behavior. (7 ed. pp. 341) Sunderland, Massachusetts: Arizona State University. &lt;/ref&gt;. Females will look for signs of health in the males, such as large and fancy adornments, bright colors, or other features that the male will only have if he is in good health. &lt;ref&gt;Bateson, P. Editor. (1983). Sexual Selection by Female Choice by Peter O'Donald. in Mate Choice. (pp.&amp;nbsp;53). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Eye candy (slang for visual appeal)==
Eye candy is a slang term for superficial attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/learningenglish/marathi/features/the-english-we-speak/ep-151103 |title=The English We Speak |date=November 3, 2015 |work=BBC |accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2017 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' article about the potential for [[cheerleading]] at the Olympics, eye candy was used to describe cheerleaders as "entertainment popularized by professional sports in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Is cheerleading coming to the Olympics? |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2017/02/18/cheerleading-coming-olympics/13A4niz8VlbbE6O9enqYqO/story.html |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=February 18, 2017 |access-date=September 27, 2017 |first=Shira |last=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/columnists/ct-ryan-ending-nfl-cheerleaders-spt-0107-20160107-column.html |title=Time for NFL to end use of cheerleaders |date=January 7, 2016 |access-date=September 27, 2017|first=Shannon |last=Ryan |newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been used in professional sports in the United States referring to female athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=It's Time For Sports Broadcasting To Stop Relegating Women to Sideline Eye Candy |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/annedoyle/2013/01/21/its-time-for-sports-broadcasting-to-stop-relegating-women-to-sideline-eye-candy/#4d6ef74e3fc9 |work=Forbes |date=January 21, 2017 |access-date=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BioArt''' is an [[art]] [[practice (social theory)|practice]] where humans work with live tissues, [[Microbial art|bacteria]], living organisms, and life processes. Using scientific processes such as [[biotechnology]] (including technologies such as [[genetic engineering]], [[tissue culture]], and [[cloning]]) the artworks are produced in laboratories, galleries, or [[artist]]s' [[studio]]s. The scope of BioArt is considered by some artists to be strictly limited to "living forms", while other artists would include art that uses the imagery of contemporary medicine and biological research, or require that it address a controversy or blind spot posed by the very character of the life sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pentecost | first=Claire |editor-first=da Costa| editor-last=Beatrice |title=Tactical Biopolitics: Art, Activism and Technoscience |publisher=The MIT Press |pages=110 |chapter=Outfitting the Laboratory of the Symbolic: Toward a Critical Inventory of Bioart |isbn=978-0-262-04249-9| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although BioArtists work with living matter, there is some debate as to the stages at which matter can be considered to be alive or living. Creating living beings and practicing in the life sciences brings about [[ethical]], [[social]], and [[aesthetic]] inquiry.  The phrase "BioArt" was coined by [[Eduardo Kac]] in 1997 in relation to his artwork ''Time Capsule''. Although it originated at the end of the 20th century, through the works of pioneers like [[Joe Davis (artist)|Joe Davis]], [http://www.martademenezes.com Marta de Menezes] and the artists hosted by [[Symbiotica]], BioArt is more widely practiced now.

==Overview==
[[File:Self Portre Yin - Yang (BioArt).tif|thumb|Self Portre 1988 Yin - Yang (BioArt), playing on the parallels between image manipulation and cloning]]

BioArt is often intended to be shocking or humorous.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2017}} One survey of the field, ''Isotope: A Journal of Literary Science and Nature Writing'', puts it this way: "BioArt is often ludicrous. It can be lumpy, gross, unsanitary, sometimes invisible, and tricky to keep still on the auction block. But at the same time, it does something very traditional that art is supposed to do: draw attention to the beautiful and grotesque details of nature that we might otherwise never see."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110212142541/http://www.emilyvoigt.com/isotope.html#content  The Art is Alive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While raising questions about the role of science in society, "most of these works tend toward social reflection, conveying political and societal criticism through the combination of artistic and scientific processes."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/ethics/2007-03-05-bio-art_N.htm?csp=34 | work=USA Today | first=Jessica M. | last=Pasko | title=Bio-artists use science to create art | date=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While most people who practice BioArt are categorized as artists in this new media, they can also be seen as scientists, since the actual medium within a work pertains to molecular structures, and so forth. Because of this dual-acceptance, the Department of Cell Biology at Harvard University invites anyone to submit works based on scientific or artistic value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioart.med.harvard.edu/bioart_introduction.html BIOart] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020121935/http://bioart.med.harvard.edu/bioart_introduction.html |date=October 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can encourage anyone to submit work they strongly respond to.

==Exposing artists to laboratories==
The laboratory work can pose a challenge to the artist, at first, as the environment is often foreign to the artist. While some artists have prior scientific training, others must be trained to perform the procedures or work in tandem with scientists who can perform the tasks that are required.  Bio artists often use formations relating to or engaged with science and scientific practices, such as working with bacteria or live-tissue.

Much of the art involves tissue-culturing and transgenics, a term for a variety of genetic engineering processes through which genetic material from one organism is altered by the addition of synthesized or transplanted genetic material from another organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17387568/|title=Bio-artists bridge gap between arts, sciences|date=4 March 2007|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Eduardo Kac commissioned the creation of a transgenic [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] bunny as part of a piece called GFP Bunny. "The PR campaign included a picture of Kac holding a white rabbit and another, iconic image of a rabbit photographically enhanced to appear green."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pentecost | first=Claire |editor-first=da Costa| editor-last=Beatrice |title=Tactical Biopolitics: Art, Activism and Technoscience |publisher=The MIT Press |pages=107 |chapter=Outfitting the Laboratory of the Symbolic: Toward a Critical Inventory of Bioart |isbn=978-0-262-04249-9| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project in collaboration with [[Stelarc]] grew a 1/4 scale replica of an ear using human cells.  The project was carried out at [[Symbiotica]]: the Art &amp; Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology, [[University of Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/extra/extra_ear.html|title=Extra Ear ¼ Scale - The Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project in Collaboration with Stelarc|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art addressing topics in biology and society==
[[File:FPbeachTsien.jpg|thumb|It is debated whether BioArt must, like this work of [[microbial art]], be made with actual organisms. Artwork made with bacteria expressing 8 different colors of [[green fluorescent protein|fluorescent proteins]]]]

The scope of the term BioArt is a subject of ongoing debate. The primary point of debate centers around whether BioArt must necessarily involve manipulation of biological material, as is the case in [[microbial art]] which by definition is made of [[microorganism|microbes]]. A broader definition of the term would include work that addresses the social and ethical considerations of the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;See Bio Art entry in Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2007-2014. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these terms BioArt as a genre has many crossovers with fields such as critical or speculative design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anker |first1=Suzanne |title=The beginnings and the ends of Bio Art |url=http://www.suzanneanker.com/wp-content/uploads/2014-The-beginnings-and-the-ends-of-Bio-Art-Bio-Art-Life-in-the-Anthropocene-Artlink-Magazine.pdf |journal=Artlink |date=2014 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of work often reaches a much broader general audience, and is focused on starting discussions in this space, rather than pioneering or even using specific biological practices. Examples in this space include Ray Fish shoes, which advertised shoes made and patterned with genetically engineered stingray skin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextnature.net/2012/12/the-rise-and-fall-or-rayfish-footwear/|title=The Rise and Fall or Rayfish Footwear - Next Nature Network|date=19 December 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and BiteLabs, a biotech startup that attempted to make salami out of meat cultured from celebrity tissue samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/the-guy-who-want-to-sell-you-salami-made-out-of-james-franco-are-100-serious |title=The Guy Who Wants to Sell Lab-Grown Salami Made of Kanye West Is "100% Serious" |publisher=|date=2014-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
BioArt has been scrutinized for its apparent lack of ethics.  ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that animal rights groups accused Kac and others of using animals unfairly for their own personal gain, and conservative groups question the use of transgenic technologies and tissue-culturing from a moral standpoint.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Alka Chandna, a senior researcher with [[PETA]] in Norfolk, Virginia, has stated that using animals for the sake of art is no different from using animal fur for clothing material. "Transgenic manipulation of animals is just a continuum of using animals for human end, regardless of whether it is done to make some sort of sociopolitical critique. The suffering and exacerbation of stress on the animals is very problematic."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

However, many BioArt projects deal with the manipulation of cells and not whole organisms, such as ''[[Victimless Leather]]'' by [[Symbiotica]]. "An actualized possibility of wearing 'leather' without killing an animal is offered as a starting point for cultural discussion. Our intention is not to provide yet another consumer product, but rather to raise questions about our exploitation of other living beings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/vl/vl.html|title=Victemless Leather|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bus-Tops''' was a project for the [[Cultural Olympiad|2012 Cultural Olympiad]], part of the Artists Taking The Lead project funded by [[Arts Council England]] and in collaboration with [[LOCOG]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Color symbolism''' in [[art]] and [[anthropology]] refers to the use of color as a [[symbol]] in various [[Culture|cultures]]. There is great diversity in the use of colors and their associations between cultures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith|first=N.S. |last2=Whitfield|first2=T.W.A. |last3=Wiltshire|first3=T.J. |date=April 1990 |title=The accuracy of the NCS, DIN, and OSA-UCS colour atlases |journal=Color Research &amp; Application |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=111–116 |doi=10.1002/col.5080150209 |issn=0361-2317}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even within the same culture in different time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Color psychology and color therapy: a factual study of the influence of color on human life |last=Birren |first=Faber |date=2006 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=978-1425424107 |location=Whitefish, MT |oclc=74452551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same color may have very different associations within the same culture at any time. Diversity in color symbolism occurs because color meanings and symbolism occur on an individual, cultural and universal basis. Color symbolism is also context-dependent and influenced by changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Color symbolism |doi=10.5040/9781501303364.ch-014 |title=Color Studies |editor1=Edith Anderson Feisner |editor2=Ronald Reed |edition=3rd |year=2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=New York |isbn=978-1-50130-336-4 |oclc=1053938255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic representations of religious concepts or articles may include a specific color with which the concept or object is associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |language=de |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica|doi=10.1163/9789004337862_lgbo_com_050367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that colors have been used for this purpose as early as 90,000 BC.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

=== Green ===

==Color symbolism in marketing==
Color plays an important role in setting expectations for a product and communicating its key characteristics.&lt;ref name=Asiam&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Aslam |first=Mubeen M. |date=2006 |title=Are You Selling the Right Colour? A Cross‐Cultural Review of Colour as a Marketing Cue |journal=Journal of Marketing Communications |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15–30 |doi=10.1080/13527260500247827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color is the second most important element that allows consumers to identify brand packaging.&lt;ref name=Popa&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popa|first=C.N. |last2=Popescu|first2=S. |last3=Berehoiu|first3=R.M.T. |last4=Berehoiu|first4=S.M.T. |date=2013 |title=Considerations regarding use and role of colour in marketing |url=http://managementjournal.usamv.ro/pdf/vol.XIII/Art44.pdf |journal= Scientific Papers Series - Management, Economic Engineering in Agriculture and Rural Development |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=269–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketers for products with an international market navigate the color symbolism variances between cultures with targeted advertising. The car manufacturer, Volkswagen ran a commercial in Italy with a black sheep in the middle of a larger flock symbolizing those who owned a VW Golf as someone unique and self-assured among a crowd of others who were not. In several cultures around the world, a black sheep represents an outcast and is seen as something undesirable. In Italy, a black sheep represents confidence and independence.[[File:Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017.jpg|thumb|Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017]] There are many additional variances in color symbolism between cultures. Cold is symbolized by blue in East Asia, the USA, and Sweden while warmth is symbolized by yellow in the USA and by blue in The Netherlands. Sometimes the meanings of colors are in stark opposition across geographic boundaries, requiring products marketed to specific demographics to account for those changes across different markets. For instance, feminity is symbolized by blue in The Netherlands and pink in the USA., whereas masculinity is symbolized by blue in Sweden and the USA, and red in the UK and France.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt; In some instances color symbolism in marketing is constructed. For companies whose products are defined by the name of their color their sales are susceptible to the symbolism and association of that name. In one example, a company selling a paint color named “off white” more than doubled its sales by renaming the same color as “ancient silk.”&lt;ref name=Popa/&gt;

==Conceptualizations of colors cross-culturally==
Color symbolism has morphed over time. Between the 5th and 17th centuries color was largely related to in a religious context. Blue was symbolic of heaven and white of purity. Today, purity is still symbolized by white in Australia and the USA but by blue in other countries like India. Similarly, the church influenced the perception of colors like crimson and purple. Largely because the dyes for these colors could only be sourced from precious pigments, religious figures like Madonna, Cardinals, and the Virgin were seen in scarlet and purple. [[File:Vatican II - Dubois - Liénart.JPG|thumb|Vatican II - Dubois - Liénart]]Today, purple symbolizes evil and infidelity in Japan, but the same is symbolized by blue in East Asia and by yellow in France. Additionally, the sacred color of Hindu and Buddhist monks is orange. [[File:Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap.jpg|thumb|Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap]] The Renaissance was also a time in which black and purple were colors of mourning. Today, Mourning or death is symbolized by white in East Asia, black in the USA, and blue in Iran, while happiness is symbolized by white in Australia and NZ, and yellow in China.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

There is a general disagreement over whether reactions to color and their symbolism are a result of cultural conditioning or of instinct. Several studies concluded that color is part of the social learning process because of the significant symbolism within the culture. High quality, trustworthiness and dependability are symbolized by blue in the USA, Japan, Korea and green and yellow in China - as well as purple in China, South Korea and Japan. Because of these variances, critical cues vary across cultures. Warning signs are coded differently as danger is symbolized by green in Malaysia, and red in the USA and Mexico. The same color of green symbolizes envy in Belgium and the USA, but envy is symbolized by yellow in Germany and Russia, and purple in Mexico. Even the colors that denote powerful emotions vary. Love is symbolized by green in Japan, red and purple in China, Korea, Japan and the USA. Unluckiness is symbolized by red in Chad, Nigeria and Germany. Luckiness is symbolized by red in China, Denmark and Argentina. The traditional bridal color is red in China and white in the USA. Ambition and desire are symbolized by red in India.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

== Color symbolism in Arabic culture ==
Color has different meanings in different countries.  We can specifically look at the Arabic culture and take it into consideration. We can start with the color white. In the Arabic culture, white is thought of as the color that is symbolic for nature.  Since it related with nature, it has a meaning that is one of positivity. It also relates with that of being clean and pure.  White is a color that is commonly worn during prayers and with that, it symbolizes purity. White’s positive connotation carries out into other aspects.  It is also used as a symbol for positivity in the future. White is also used to symbolize the end of war. You will also see women adorn white at their weddings as a sign of positivity.  Since doves are white, they share the symbolic meaning that comes with the color.  This in turn causes them to be associated with positivity of good news. 

When you look at the color Black in Arabic culture you can find that it is related to funerals and death. Women will often wear black to funerals in order to show that they are sad for those who have passed.  Also relating to death, black is associated with hell. Black is also used to symbolize dark.  Hell is thought to be a dark black place associating black as negative.  Black in general is looked at as having negative connotations around it. For example, the symbolism of a black heart refers to someone who is unkind.  
[[File:Red rose with black background.jpg|thumb]]
Green is a color that is commonly found in Islam.  It is a color found in nature and with this, it is associated with and represents goodness. Green is a color that has an overall positive meaning.   The color green also has to do with truthfulness, again going with positivity.  If you look at phrases, the symbolic meanings are generally positive.  If you look at the phrase green hand, it relates to being generous which is a positive thing. 

Red has an overall positive association with it. Often you will find that red is a color associated with roses and blood.  The color red has to do with love and passion.  In sayings you can find it to have either a negative or positive meaning such as the term red eye relates with anger.  The Arabic culture also associates this color with death.

Blue is related with positivity when discussing it with nature, otherwise it can be related with negative connotations. When used in the phrase blue eyes, it refers to jealousy. A blue body relates with death and therefore is associated with negativity.

Yellow is another color that is also associated with nature and the sun.  Again, since it is a color related with nature, it takes on the symbolic meaning of positivity.  Gold is also categorized under here and is also takes on a positive meaning.  Generally, when used in phrases, the color yellow has to do with negativity.  For example, a yellow smile means to be mean.

==Colors and emotions==
[[File:Emotions - 3.png|thumb]]
Color symbolism is displayed in many ways. One of the most common ways we see color symbolism displayed in through our emotions. In this article Color-emotions associations: Past experience and personal preference it takes a look at how we connect colors with our emotions and how it depends on a person’s preference and or their past experiences. 
	This article first starts out by talking about the different colors and what they are associated with. The first color it talks about is the color blue and how people see blue as comfort and security and how they see orange as being upsetting. The next one they talk about is yellow which is more of a happy color compared to purple which they say is dignified but I have never heard of purple being seen that way. The next one this article talks about which I find very interesting is the color red. People view the color red in two different ways, one being as a strong and passionate color. However, it is also seen in a very different way, people see it as an aggressive color because it is the color of blood. The last color this article talks about is the color green and how just like red it has two different views. Green can be viewed positively as in quietness but can also be viewed negatively as in guilt. 
	This study took a look at how we associate colors with emotions. This study was done and showed that we associated lighter colors such as blue or yellow with more positive emotions. It then showed how we associated darker colors such as grey or black with more native emotions. However, something very interesting that this study did find is that most young prefer the color black over many other colors. 
	The study was done with college aged students to see how they associate their emotions with colors. Many tests were done such as matching tasks and matching color tests to see what colors they associate with their emotions. The study had 44 men and 54 women in it and they again were all college students. They identified a color sample with one emotion only and it showed what emotional response is connected to a color. 
	The results from this study did find that people mostly associate the color green with being the most positive. Over 95% off people said that green s the most positive because it makes them feel relaxed and then comfortable and at peace. It also showed that people saw yellow as the more excited and energetic emotion, with over 90% agreeing with this. 79% of students found that blue was a calming color because it reminded them of the ocean which is known as a calming place. People did have different answers when it came to red because like explained earlier, red is seen in two very different ways, It has been seen as love by many but also as evil because it remind people of blood. Many people did not seem to like the color purple very much as it was not favored by many for their preferences. The color black was seen to be more negative emotions like fear and depression. Overall, this article shows how color can be important because it is how people associate their emotions and things based on color symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Kaya &amp; H., Naz &amp; Helen.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Items attached to paintings might include photographic images, clothing, newspaper clippings, [[ephemera]] or any number of [[Dimension|three-dimensional]] objects. The term is most closely associated with the artwork of American artist [[Robert Rauschenberg]] (1925–2008) who coined the phrase&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/arts/design/adding-rauschenberg-and-richter-at-moma.html?_r=0 ''New York Times'' October 24 2013 "“We are fortunate to have six Combines from the mid-’50s through 1961,” Ms. Temkin said, referring to the term Rauschenberg coined to describe works that incorporate castoff objects like tires, flatware or furniture."]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe his own creations. Rauschenberg’s Combines explored the blurry boundaries between art and the everyday world. In addition, his cross-medium creations challenged the doctrine of [[medium specificity]] mentioned by modernist art critic [[Clement Greenberg]]. [[Frank Stella]] created a large body of paintings that recall the combine paintings of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] by juxtaposing a wide variety of surface and material in each work ultimately leading to Stella's sculpture and architecture of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haberarts.com/schwitt.htm Unhappy Medium, Frank Stella and Kurt Schwitters by John Haber].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Schimmel of the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] described Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' as "some of the most influential, poetic and revolutionary works in the history of American art."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; But they've also been called "ramshackle hybrids between painting and sculpture, stage prop and three-dimensional scrap-book assemblage" according to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s critic Adrian Searle.&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Searle believed the "different elements of the Combines have been described as having no more relation than the different stories that vie for attention on a newspaper page."&lt;ref name=tws08jan009/&gt; Jasper Johns, as well, used similar techniques; in at least one painting, Johns attached a paintbrush right inside his painting.

Examples of Rauschenberg's ''Combine paintings'' include ''Bed'' (1955), ''Canyon'' (1959), and the free-standing ''[[Monogram (artwork)|Monogram]]'' (1955–1959).&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg's works mostly incorporated [[two-dimensional]] materials held together with "splashes and drips of paint" with occasional 3-D objects.&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Critic John Perreault wrote "The Combines are both painting and sculpture–or, some purists would say, neither."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Perreault liked them since they were memorable, photogenic, and could "stick in the mind" as well as "surprise and keep on surprising."&lt;ref name=tws08jan001/&gt; Rauschenberg added stuffed birds on his 1955 work ''Satellite'', which featured a stuffed pheasant "patrolling its top edge."&lt;ref name=tws08jan011/&gt; In another work, he added a ladder. His Combine ''Broadcast'', featuring three radios blaring at once,&lt;ref name=tws08jan010/&gt; was a "melange of paint, grids, newspaper clips and fabric snippets."&lt;ref name="tws08jan012"&gt;{{cite news

The prevailing theme of Rauschenberg's "combine" paintings is ''"nonmeaning, the absurd, or antiart."'' In this regard the combine paintings relate to [[Pop art]] and their much earlier predecessor [[Dada]].&lt;ref&gt;Varieties of Visual Experience, Edmund Burke Feldman, Harry N.

]]
''Canyon,'' one of Rauschenberg's most recognizable Combines, has been the subject of art historical debate revolving around the validity of reading Rauschenberg's work iconographically. Historian [[Kenneth Bendiner]] famously proposed ''Canyon'' as a playful recreation of a 1635 [[Rembrandt]] painting depicting the abduction of [[The Abduction of Ganymede|Ganymede]], interpreting the suspended pillow as Ganymede's buttocks and the stuffed bald eagle as the form assumed by the Greek god Zeus.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Rauschenberg and the Neo-Avant-Garde|last=Branden|first=Joseph|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, and London|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians and critics, such as [[Joseph Branden]] have argued that searching for iconography in Rauschenberg's Combines is useless because it can be made to exist anywhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bendiner's interpretation is discredited for failing to account for compositional movement and for disregarding a number of elements within the work, for example the blue and red text in the center, in order to mould the interpretation to it.

Interpretations of Rauschenberg's Combines vary from: a deeply personal and subjective collage of expression (often homoerotic), to a surface of indecipherable, or rather infinitely cipher-able, materials which challenge notions of painting, sculpture, reception, and chance, to a multivalent iconographic landscape that seems to resist fixed decoding in favor of a more open-ended play of meaning. Rauschenberg himself states "I don't want a painting to be just an expression of my personality. I feel it ought to be much better than that … I’ve always felt as though, whatever I’ve used and whatever I’ve done, the method was always closer to a ''collaboration'' with materials than to any kind of conscious manipulation and control."&lt;ref&gt;Rauschenberg quoted in Calvin Tomkins, ‘Profiles: Moving Out,’ ''The New Yorker'', vol.40, 29 Feb. 1964, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moira Roth]] links the Combines to [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp's]] indifferent attitude in art, arguing that the perceived density of the content, and the integration of mass media elements is a facade born out of the alienation and indifference experienced by the artist during the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy Period]]. Jonathan Katz argues that underneath the impersonal and inexpressive appearance of his work is a secret homosexual code that can unlock some of the significance of Rauschenberg's work,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Katz: ‘Lovers and Divers’ (1998) p.24&lt;/ref&gt; but Ed Krčma points out the weakness of steering the analysis towards preconceived conclusions, especially since Rauschenberg's work is described as a poetry of infinite possibilities.

More recent interpretations of ''Canyon,'' reconsider the work in [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] terms, claiming that the Combine works more like a human mind than a human eye; Fragmented scraps of images, news cutouts, found objects and paint interact in esoteric ways and more closely resemble a cerebral process than a 'traditional' image. Yve-Alain Bois calls the search for iconographic meaning in Rauschenberg's work misguided because it is too limiting. His art's "lack of center" is a statement in itself, and the infinite permutations of meaning that can result highlight the subjectivity of art reception that postmodernism explores.&lt;ref&gt;Bois, Yve-Alain. "Eye to the Ground." Artforum International. Artforum Inc. March, 2006. p.246-247&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional note===

Under U.S. law, ''Canyon'' can never be sold since it contains a stuffed bald eagle, violating the 1940 [[Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act]] as well as the 1918 [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|Migratory Bird Treaty Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com/2012/05/01/rauschenberg-eagle-ruffles-feathers/|title=Rauschenberg Eagle Ruffles Feathers|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|date=January 5, 2012|website=Art News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beethoven's and Bruckner's copyists --&gt;
[[File:Art-students and copyists in the Louvre gallery, Paris.jpg|thumb|270px|Art-students and copyists in the [[Musée du Louvre|Louvre gallery]], [[Paris]], 1868.]]A '''copyist''' is a person who makes copies. 
The term is sometimes used for artists who make copies of other artists' paintings.  However, the modern use of the term is almost entirely confined to music copyists, who are employed by the [[music industry]] to produce neat copies from a [[composer]] or arranger's manuscript.

==Music copyists==
Until the 1990s, most copyists worked by hand to write out scores and individual instrumental parts neatly, using a [[calligraphy]] pen, [[manuscript paper]], and often a ruler. Producing parts for an entire [[orchestra]] from a full score was a huge task. In the 1990s, copyists began using [[scorewriter]]s - computer programs which are the music notation equivalent of a [[word processor]]. (Such programs include ''[[Sibelius (computer program)|Sibelius]]'', ''[[Finale (computer program)|Finale]]'', ''[[MuseScore]]'' or ''[[GNU LilyPond]]''). Scorewriters allow the composer or songwriter to "enter" the melodies, rhythms and lyrics to their compositions into the computer using a mouse or by playing the notes on a [[MIDI]]-equipped keyboard. Once a composition is fully entered into a scorewriting program, the computer can be instructed to print out the parts for all of the different instruments.

Both handwritten and computer-based copying require significant understanding of [[musical notation]], [[music theory]], the musical styles and conventions of different styles of music (e.g., regarding appropriate ornamentation, [[harmony]] rules pertaining to [[accidental (music)|accidental]]s, etc.), and strong attention to detail and past conventions. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] had a contentious relationship with his copyists, who often made mistakes that remained uncorrected until the advent of [[Urtext edition]]s; some [[musicologist]]s have devoted a lot of effort to identifying Beethoven's copyists.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson, Alan (1970). Autumn. "Notes on Five of Beethoven's Copyists" '''23''' 3 ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'' p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3288">'''Dalle de verre''', from French: "glass slab", is a [[glass art]] technique that uses pieces of coloured glass set in a matrix of [[concrete]] and [[epoxy|epoxy resin]] or other supporting material. 

==Technique==
The technique was developed by [[Jean Gaudin (glass artist)|Jean Gaudin]] in Paris in the 1930s. Slabs of coloured glass, {{convert|20|cm|inch}} to {{convert|30|cm|inch}} square or rectangular and typically up to {{convert|3|cm|inch}} thick, are shaped by breaking with a hammer or cutting with a saw. The edges of the resulting pieces may be chipped or faceted to increase the [[refraction]] and [[Specular reflection|reflection]] effects.

The pieces are laid out to a design, similar to traditional [[stained-glass]] work. The pieces are laid on a bed of sand, bounded by a wooden casting frame. A matrix material, sand and cement or epoxy resin, is poured between the glass pieces and allowed to dry, typically requiring 24 hours to harden. The visible glass faces are then cleaned and the resulting solid panel can be relocated, embedded or hung as required.

The use of thicker glass produces deeper colour effects than traditional [[lead]] [[came]] stained-glass, especially when illuminated by bright natural or artificial light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vitraildutemple.free.fr/realisations/dalle.html |title= La dalle de verre |language=french |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://osvaldsstainedglass.com/portfolio/dalle-de-verre-technique/| title=Dalle de Verre Technique |accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique achieved prominence in the stained glass literature of the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="Bubnash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.columbia.edu/files/gsapp/imceshared/lcl2127/Lacey_Bubnash_-_Thesis_Abstract.pdf |first=Lacey |last=Bubnash |work=Thesis Abstract |title=Dalle de Verre / Faceted Glass: New Approaches to a Modern Material |publisher=[[Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation|School of Architecture]], [[Columbia University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510140934/http://www.arch.columbia.edu/files/gsapp/imceshared/lcl2127/Lacey_Bubnash_-_Thesis_Abstract.pdf |archivedate=2014-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Problems and conservation==
The resulting works may be subject to structural problems over time and, just like more traditional stained glass works, pose challenges to conservators and restorers.&lt;ref name="Bubnash"/&gt;

==Dalle de verre in the UK==
Dalle de verre was brought to the UK by Pierre Fourmaintraux who joined [[James Powell and Sons]] (later Whitefriars Glass Studio) in 1956 and trained [[Dom Charles Norris]] in the technique. Norris was a Dominican Friar who went on to become arguably the most prolific British proponent of dalle de verre. His work is incorporated in several Modernist listed Catholic churches.

'''Décollage''', in [[art]], is the opposite of [[collage]]; instead of an image being built up of all or parts of existing images, it is created by cutting, tearing away or otherwise removing, pieces of an original image.&lt;ref name="ArtLex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ See D-De] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424084418/http://www.artlex.com/ |date=2005-04-24 }}, ArtLex Art Dictionary. Retrieved 2007-10-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The French word "décollage" translates into English literally as "take-off" or "to become unglued" or "to become unstuck". Examples of décollage include [[Surrealist techniques|etrécissements]] and [[cut-up technique]]. A similar technique is the ''lacerated poster'', a poster in which one has been placed over another or others, and the top poster or posters have been ripped, revealing to a greater or lesser degree the poster or posters underneath.

==Practitioners of décollage==
An important practitioner of décollage was [[Wolf Vostell]]. Wolf Vostell noticed the word "décollage" in [[Le Figaro]] on 6 September 1954, where it was used to describe the simultaneous take-off and crash of an aeroplane. He appropriated the term to signify an aesthetic philosophy, applied also to the creation of live performances, Vostell’s working concept of décollage, was the Dé-coll/age and begun in 1954, is as a visual force that breaks down outworn values and replaces them with thinking as a function distanced from [[Media (communication)|media]]. He also called his [[Happening]]s Dé-coll/age-Happening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulturstiftung.de/publikationen/arsprototo/ausgaben/3-2013/mediale-wanderungen/ Wolf Vostell, Dé-coll/age-Happening]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Beuys Brock Vostell.

The most celebrated artists of the décollage technique in France, especially of the lacerated poster, are [[François Dufrene]], [[Jacques Villeglé]], [[Mimmo Rotella]] and [[Raymond Hains]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Straram, "La veuve blanche et noire un peu détournée" (Paris Sens &amp; Tonka, 2006), 21–22, 81–82; "Figures de la négation" ([[Saint-Etienne Métropole: Musée d'Art Moderne]], 2004), 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond Hains used the lacerated poster as an artistic intervention that sought to critique the newly emerged advertising technique of large-scale advertisements. In effect his decollage destroys the [[advertisement]], but leaves its remnants on view for the public to contemplate. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously. These four artists were part of a larger group in the 1960s called [[Nouveau Réalisme]] (New realism), Paris' answer to the American [[Pop Art]] movement. This was a mostly Paris-based group (which included [[Yves Klein]] and [[Christo]] and was created with the help of critic [[Pierre Restany]]), although Rotella was Italian and moved back to Italy shortly after the group was formed. Some early practitioners sought to extract the defaced poster from its original context and to take it into areas of poetry, photography, or painting.

Lacerated posters are also closely related to [[Richard Genovese]]'s practice of excavations. Contemporary artists employing similar décollage techniques are [[Mark Bradford]], Michael Viviani and [[Brian Dettmer]], who employs a novel method of decollage by removing material from books, leaving behind select images and text to form sculptural collages. Also there is Fizz Fieldgrass, an English artist, who uses [[digital media|digitally]] enhanced photographic images, overlaid by duplication on either Japanese Conservation Grade or fine [[Paper Mulberry]], torn and rolled back to reveal other layers generating the three-dimensional image.

Décollage is now commonly used in the French language in regard to aviation (as when an aeroplane lifts off the ground). More recently the term has been used in space flight; the web page for [[ESA]] indicates its use equivalent to "We have lift-off!" at a [[NASA]] launch center.

==Déchirage==
Déchirage (from the French, déchirer: 'to tear') is an artistic style that distresses paper to create a three-dimensional patchwork. It is a form of décollage, taking the original image apart physically through incision, parting and peeling away. [[Romare Bearden]] (b. 1911 – d. 1988) the African American collage artist used déchirage as an important element of his [[Abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;'Bearden as Abstract Expressionist' http://www.courses.vcu.edu/ENG-mam/bio3.htm Maalek Marshall, Virginia Commonwealth University webpages.&lt;/ref&gt; The first public display of "Photographic" Déchirage (the tearing of layers of digital photographs to create a distinctive three-dimensional image) was at the ''Art of Giving''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saatchionline.com/art/view/artist/162075/art/91318#comment-76575-91318 Sea-cloth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220105041/http://www.saatchiart.com/art/Collage-Sea-cloth/162075/91318/view|archivedate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; exhibition at the [[Saatchi Gallery]] in 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

It can be argued that the depliage is a form of décollage, as it is made by initially removing the staples from a staple-bound [[magazine]].

[[File:Paris July 2011-30.jpg|thumb|The [[Arc de Triomphe]] of the [[Place de l'Étoile]], one of the most famous example of Empire architecture, commissioned in 1806 after the victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon|Emperor Napoleon I]]]]
The '''Empire style''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃.piːʁ}}, ''style Empire'') is an early-nineteenth-century [[design]] movement in [[architecture]], [[furniture]], other [[decorative arts]], and the [[visual arts]], representing the second phase of [[Neoclassicism]]. It flourished between 1800 and 1815 during the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] and the [[First French Empire]] periods, although its life span lasted until the late-1820s. From France it spread into much of Europe and the United States. 

The style originated in and takes its name from the rule of the Emperor [[Napoleon I]] in the [[First French Empire]], when it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The previous fashionable style in France had been the [[Directoire style]], a more austere and minimalist form of Neoclassicism, that replaced the [[Louis XVI style]].  The Empire style brought a full return to ostentatious richness.  The style corresponds somewhat to the [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal style]] in the United States, and the [[Regency style]] in Britain. 

==History==
[[File:Versailles Grand Trianon Napoleon's Chamber.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's bedchamber in the [[Grand Trianon]], [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] epitomizes the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical style]] of the [[First French Empire]]]]

The style developed and elaborated the Directoire style of the immediately preceding period, which aimed at a simpler, but still elegant evocation of the virtues of the [[Ancient Roman Republic]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[stoicism|stoic]] virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. ''Conventionels'' saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after [[Brutus]], [[Solon]] and [[Lycurgus of Sparta|Lycurgus]]. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] as antique rituals.  Even the chairs in which the committee of ''Salut Publique'' sat were made on antique models devised by David. ...In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Honour|1977|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Empire style "turned to the florid opulence of Imperial Rome. The abstemious severity of [[Doric order|Doric]] was replaced by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] richness and splendour".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Honour|1977|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two French architects, [[Charles Percier]] and [[Pierre François Léonard Fontaine|Pierre Fontaine]], were together the creators of the French Empire style. The two had studied in [[Rome]] and in the 1790s became leading furniture designers in [[Paris]], where they received many commissions from Napoleon and other statesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Fredlund |first=Jane |year=2008 |title=Stilguiden: möbler &amp; inredning 1700–2000 |edition=2nd |location=Stockholm |publisher=Prisma |page=108 |oclc=234047178 |isbn=9789151849874 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architecture of the Empire style was based on elements of the [[Roman Empire]] and its many archaeological treasures, which had been rediscovered starting in the eighteenth century.  The preceding Louis XVI and [[Directoire (style)|Directoire]] styles employed straighter, simpler designs compared to the [[Rococo]] style of the eighteenth century.  Empire designs strongly influenced the contemporary American [[Federal style]] (such as design of the [[United States Capitol]] building), and both were forms of [[propaganda]] through architecture.  It was a style of the people, not ostentatious but sober and evenly balanced.  The style was considered to have "liberated" and "enlightened" architecture just as Napoleon "liberated" the peoples of Europe with his [[Napoleonic Code]].
[[File:Église de la Madeleine 3753x3156.jpg|left|thumb|[[Église de la Madeleine]] in [[Paris]], a Temple to the Glory of Napoleon's [[Grande Armée]]]]
The Empire period was popularized by the inventive designs of [[Percier and Fontaine]], Napoleon's architects for [[Château de Malmaison|Malmaison]].  The designs drew for inspiration on symbols and ornaments borrowed from the glorious ancient Greek and Roman empires.  Buildings typically had simple timber frames and box-like constructions, [[wood veneer|veneer]]ed in expensive [[mahogany]] imported from the [[colonies]]. Biedermeier furniture also used [[ebony]] details, originally due to financial constraints. [[Ormolu]] details (gilded bronze furniture mounts and embellishments) displayed a high level of craftsmanship.

[[File:View to Kazan Cathedral by Ivan Smelov.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].]]

General Bernadotte, later to become King [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Karl Johan]] of Sweden and Norway, introduced the Napoleonic style to Sweden, where it became known under his own name. The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared from other parts of Europe. France paid some of its debts to Sweden in ormolu bronzes instead of money, leading to a vogue for crystal [[chandeliers]] with bronze from France and crystal from Sweden.

After Napoleon lost power, the Empire style continued to be in favour for many decades, with minor adaptations.  There was a revival of the style in the last half of the nineteenth century in France, again at the beginning of the twentieth century, and again in the 1980s.

The most famous Empire-style structures in France are the grand neoclassical [[Arc de Triomphe|Arc de Triomphe of Place de l'Étoile]], [[Place du Carrousel#The Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel|Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]], [[Vendôme column]], and [[Église de la Madeleine|La Madeleine]], which were built in Paris to emulate the edifices of the Roman Empire.  The style also was used widely in [[Imperial Russia]], where it was used to celebrate the victory over Napoleon in such memorial structures as the [[General Staff Building (Saint Petersburg)|General Staff Building]], [[Kazan Cathedral, St. Petersburg|Kazan Cathedral]], [[Alexander Column]], and [[Narva Triumphal Gate]]. [[Stalinist architecture]] is sometimes referred to as Stalin's Empire style.

The style survived in Italy longer than in most of Europe, partly because of its Imperial Roman associations, partly because it was revived as a national style of architecture following the unification of Italy in 1870. [[Mario Praz]] wrote about this style as the Italian Empire.  In the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States, the Empire style was adapted to local conditions and gradually acquired further expression as the [[Egyptian Revival]], [[Greek Revival]], [[Biedermeier|Biedermeier style]], [[Regency style]], and [[Federal style|late-Federal style]].

'''En plein air''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ plɛn ɛːʁ}}, [[French language|French]] for outdoors, or '''plein air painting''') is the act of [[painting]] outdoors. This method contrasts with studio painting or academic rules that might create a predetermined look.

== History ==
[[File:Sargent MonetPainting.jpg|thumb|''[[Claude Monet]] Painting by the Edge of a Wood'' (1885) by [[John Singer Sargent]]. Oil on canvas. 54.0 &amp;times; 64.8&amp;nbsp;cm. [[Tate Gallery]], London.]]
Artists have long painted outdoors, but in the mid-19th century, working in natural light became particularly important to the [[Barbizon school]], [[Hudson River School]], and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]].

In 1830, the Barbizon School in France, inspired by [[John Constable]], enabled artists like Charles-François Daubigny and Théodore Rousseau to more accurately depict the appearance of outdoor settings in various light and weather conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Auricchio | first=Laura | date=October 2004 | title=The Transformation of Landscape Painting in France | journal=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | url= https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/lafr/hd_lafr.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1800s, the en plein air approach was incorporated with the impressionists’ style, and artists such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Frédéric Bazille]], and [[Edgar Degas]] began creating their work outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Malafronte | first=Allison | date=October 2009 | title=The History of the Plein Air Movement | journal=American Artist | pages=20–24 | url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/43929615/history-plein-air-movement}}&lt;/ref&gt; From France, the movement expanded to America, starting in California then moving to other American locales notable for their natural light qualities, including the Hudson River Valley in New York.

The [[Macchiaioli]] were a group of Italian painters active in Tuscany in the second half of the nineteenth century, who, breaking with the antiquated conventions taught by the Italian academies of art, did much of their painting outdoors in order to capture natural light, shade, and colour. This practice relates the Macchiaioli to the French Impressionists who came to prominence a few years later, although the Macchiaioli pursued somewhat different purposes. Their movement began in Florence in the late 1850s.

The [[Newlyn School]] in England is considered another major proponent of the technique in the latter 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/history-of-art/newlyn-school.htm |title=Newlyn School, Landscape Painting Artist Colony, Cornwall: History, Artists, Stanhope Forbes, Frank Bramley |publisher=Visual-arts-cork.com |date= |accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of painting ''en plein air'' increased in the 1840s with the introduction of paints in tubes (like those for [[toothpaste]]). Previously, painters made their own paints by grinding and mixing dry [[pigment]] powders with [[linseed oil]].

The act of outdoor painting from observation has been continually popular well into the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adn.com/2010/06/05/1309330/artists-who-work-en-plein-air.html |title=Artists who work 'en plein air' share their motivations: Arts |publisher=adn.com |date=6 June 2010 |accessdate=20 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808223036/http://www.adn.com/2010/06/05/1309330/artists-who-work-en-plein-air.html |archivedate=8 August 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://painting.about.com/od/landscapes/a/plein_air_paint.htm |title=Plein Air Painting - Painting Outside Plein Air |publisher=Painting.about.com |date=16 August 2010|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equipment and challenges ==
[[File:Robert Antoine Pinchon, 1898, painting Le chemin, oil on canvas, 22 x 32 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Antoine Pinchon]], 1898, painting ''Le chemin'', oil on canvas, 22 × 32 cm]]
It was during the mid-19th century that the ''box easel'', typically known as the ''French box easel'' or [[Easel#field|''field easel'']], was invented. It is uncertain who developed it, but these highly portable easels with telescopic legs and built-in paint box and [[Palette (painting)|palette]] made it easier to go into the forest and up the hillsides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Invention of box/ Field easel|url = http://artmovement.weebly.com/invention-of-box-field-easel.html|website = Realism &amp; Impressionism|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still made today, they remain a popular choice (even for home use) since they fold up to the size of a [[brief case]] and thus are easy to store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/pleinair/ |title=Plein Air |publisher=PBS |date=6 August 2007|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pochade Box is a compact box that allows the artist to keep all their supplies and palette within the box and have the work on the inside of the lid. Some designs allow for a larger canvas which can be held by clamps built into the lid. There are designs which can also hold a few wet painting canvases or panels within the lid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dickblick.com/pochade/boxes/ ''Pochade Boxes'']&lt;/ref&gt; These boxes have a rising popularity as while they are mainly used for plein air painting, can also be used in the studio, home, or classroom. Since pochade boxes are mainly used for painting on location, the canvas or work surface may be small, usually not more than 20 inches (50&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pochade box|url=http://www.artworkessentials.com|website=Artwork Essentials|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenges include the type of paint used to paint outdoors, animals, bugs, onlookers, and environmental conditions such as weather. [[Acrylic paint]] may harden and dry quickly in warm, sunny weather and it cannot be reused. On the opposite side of the spectrum is the challenge of painting in moist or damp conditions with precipitation. The advent of plein air painting predated the invention of acrylics. The traditional and well-established method of painting ''en plein air'' incorporates the use of oil paint.

== Advocates ==
French [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painters such as [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] advocated plein air painting, and much of their work was done outdoors in the diffuse light of a large white umbrella. Claude Monet was an avid en plein air artist who deduced that to seize the closeness and likeness of an outside setting at a specific moment one had to be outside to do so rather than just paint an outside setting in their studio.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, F. S., ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages (15th ed.), Boston, Cengage Learning, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century in Russia, painters such as [[Vasily Polenov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], [[Valentin Serov]], [[Konstantin Korovin]] and [[I. E. Grabar]] were known for painting ''en plein air''.

But enthusiasts of plein air painting were not limited to the [[Old World]]. [[American Impressionism|American impressionists]] too, such as those of the [[Old Lyme]] school, were avid painters ''en plein air''. American impressionist painters noted for this style during this era included [[Guy Rose]], [[Robert William Wood]], Mary DeNeale Morgan, John Gamble, and [[Arthur Hill Gilbert]]. In Canada, the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] and [[Tom Thomson]] are examples of ''en plein air'' advocates.

'''''Festivals''''' is a 1973 anthology of [[festival]]-related [[folklore]] from around the world that have been compiled by [[Ruth Manning-Sanders]]. According to the book's [[dust jacket]], "This potpourri of festivals reveals fascinating customs and celebrations from many countries of the world. Each special day is preceded by background material on the origins of the holiday."

Some of the special days covered are (using Manning-Sanders' words and spellings): [[New Year's Day]], [[Brigid of Kildare|Saint Bride's Day]], the [[Sapporo Snow Festival|Japanese Snow Festival]], [[Valentine's Day|Saint Valentine's Day]], [[Saint Patrick's Day]], [[Shrove Tuesday]], [[Mardi Gras]], [[Easter|Easter Day]], [[April Fools' Day|All Fools' Day]], the [[Qingming Festival|Bright Weather Festival]], [[St George's Day|Saint George's Day]], [[May Day]], the [['Obby 'Oss festival|Padstow Hobby Horse]], [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], [[Michaelmas|Michaelmas Day]], [[Saint Crispin's Day]], [[Halloween|Hallow E'en]], the [[Guy Fawkes Night|Fifth of November]], [[Hogmanay]], and [[Christmas]].

For many of the festivals, the book includes the writings of some famous authors or historical personalities. Among those included in the book are [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[William Sharp (writer)|Fiona Macleod]], [[Marco Polo]], [[John Donne]], [[Charles James Lyall|Sir Charles Lyall]], [[Norman Hunter (author)|Norman Hunter]], [[Chiang Yee]], [[Flora Thompson]], [[Laurie Lee]], [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], [[Dylan Thomas]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Richard Cobbold]], [[P. L. Travers]], [[Oliver Herford]], [[Alison Uttley]], [[Richard Crashaw]], Jon and [[Rumer Godden]], and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].

Editor Manning-Sanders, a [[poet]] and [[author]] who was perhaps best known for her series of [[children's books]] in which she collected and retold [[fairy tales]], contributes four pieces to this book:

* ''Not 'Zactly''
* ''The Padstow Hobby Horse''
* ''The Ghost Ship'' (an excerpt from her novel ''Mystery at Penmarth'')
* ''The Christmas Crab Apples''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">'''Fictive art''' is a practice that involves the production of objects, events, and entities designed to support the plausibility of a central narrative. Fictive art projects disguise their fictional essence by incorporating materials that stand as evidence for narrative factuality and thus are designed to deceive the viewer as to their ontological status. Very often, these materials take a form that carries presumptive cultural authority, such as 'historical' photographs or 'scientific' data. The key tension in fictive art projects stems from the impossibility of 'making real' a fiction, no matter how many or what kinds of objects are produced as evidence. Since fictive art projects are designed to pass at least temporarily as 'real', fictive artists may draw opprobrium as hoaxers, pranksters, forgers, or con artists when their projects are revealed as fictional.

==History and usage==
The term fictive art was originated by the artists [[Antoinette LaFarge]] and [[Lise Patt]], in the title of a panel at the College Art Association Conference of 2004. It is allied to the terms [[superfiction]] and [[parafiction]] but, unlike both, does not construct the central activity as a departure from (super, para) fiction. Instead, it argues for the primacy of the visual art components, emphasizing the role they play in establishing, extending, and enabling the central narrative. A number of exhibitions in recent years have included examples of fictive art as part of broad explorations of the relationship between media, illusion, and deception; examples include "More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness" at SITE Santa Fe (2012) and "Faking It" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (2012).

==Examples of fictive art==
Fictive art has antecedents going back several centuries; for example, the 'Rowley' creations of [[Thomas Chatterton]], the 'Formosan' inventions of [[George Psalmanazar]], or the [[Cottingley Fairies|Cottingley fairy]] photographs. With the rise of mass media in the second half of the 20th century, the practice of fictive art has expanded; it now includes such familiar forms as [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]]. Notable practitioners and projects include David Wilson ([[The Museum of Jurassic Technology]]), [[Kahn &amp; Selesnick|Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick]] (The Circular River), [[Beauvais Lyons]] (The Hokes Archives), [[Joan Fontcuberta]] (Sputnik), [[Eve Andree Laramee]] (Yves Fissiault), and [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] (O-ism).

A '''figure painting''' is a work of [[fine art]] in any of the [[Painting#Painting media|painting media]] with the primary subject being the human figure, whether clothed or [[Nude (art)|nude]].
Figure painting may also refer to the activity of creating such a work. The human figure has been one of the constant subjects of art since the first stone age cave paintings, and has been reinterpreted in various styles throughout history.
==Depicting figures==
Unlike [[figure drawing]]s which are usually nudes, figure paintings are often [[historical]], [[mythological]], [[allegorical]] or [[Imagination|imaginary]] depictions that may have figures in appropriate costumes. A [[portrait painting]] is a figure painting that focuses on the creation of a likeness of a particular individual or group.

The nude has been a theme in [[Western art]] since [[classical antiquity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in Western Art and its Beginnings in Antiquity,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuba/hd_nuba.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in the [[Renaissance]], after being largely absent during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/numr/hd_numr.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- {{quotebox|source=Willem de Kooning|quote=Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented}} --&gt;
Oil paint historically has been the ideal media for depicting the figure. By blending and layering paint, the surface can become more like skin. "Its slow drying time and various degrees of viscosity enable the artist to achieve rich and subtle blends of color and texture, which can suggest transformations from one human substance to another."&lt;ref&gt;Scala, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Although working from [[Model (art)|live models]] is preferred, the length of time needed to complete a painting has led most modern painters to use photographs as references at least part of the time if not for the entire work.

Figure painting is not synonymous with [[figurative art]], which may depict real objects of any kind (including humans and animals).

'''Formline art''' is a feature in the [[Northwest Coast art|indigenous art]] of the [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest Coast]] of North America, distinguished by the use of characteristic shapes referred to as ''ovoids'', ''U forms'' and ''S forms''. Coined by Bill Holm in his 1965 book ''Northwest Coast Indian Art: An Analysis of Form'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-mccord.qc.ca/expositions/expositionsXSL.php?lang=1&amp;expoId=21&amp;currSectionId=7 "Haida Art - Mapping an Ancient Language", musee-mccord.qc.ca.

Retrieved Nov. 22, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; the "formline is the primary design element on which Northwest Coast art depends, and by the turn of the 20th century, its use spread to the southern regions as well. It is the positive delineating force of the painting, relief and engraving. Formlines are continuous, flowing, curvilinear lines that turn, swell and diminish in a prescribed manner. They are used for figure outlines, internal design elements and in abstract compositions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=a1ARTA0005815 Marjorie M. Halpin, "Northwest Coast Native Art," thecanadianencyclopedia.com. Retrieved Nov. 22, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
After European contact, in the late 18th century, the peoples who produced Northwest Coast art suffered huge population losses due to diseases such as [[smallpox]], and cultural losses due to assimilation into European-North [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].  The production of their art dropped drastically as well.

Toward the end of the 19th century, Northwest Coast artists began producing work for commercial sale, such as small [[argillite]] carvings.  The end of the 19th century also saw large-scale export of totem poles, masks and other [[Painting|traditional art]] objects from the region to museums and private collectors around the world.  Some of this export was accompanied by financial compensation to people who had a right to sell the art, and some was not.

In the early 20th century, very few First Nations artists in the Northwest Coast region were producing art.  A tenuous link to older traditions remained in artists such as Charles Gladstone, Stanley George (Heiltsuk) and [[Mungo Martin]].  The mid-20th century saw a revival of interest and production of Northwest Coast art, due to the influence of artists and critics such as [[Bill Reid]], a grandson of Charles Gladstone, and others. This renewal of art is part of a wider cultural and political awakening among First Nations.  It also saw an increasing demand for the return of art objects (known as Repatriation) that were illegally or immorally taken from First Nations communities.  This demand continues to the present day.  Today, there are numerous art schools teaching formal Northwest Coast art of various styles, and there is a growing market for new art in this style.&lt;ref name="Jack2"&gt;Jonathan Meuli.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4591">The '''Fundred Dollar Bill Project''' is an art project implemented by [[Mel Chin]], and is aimed to connect and represent the voices of children across the United States, with the end goal to propose a funding solution for the [[lead poisoning|lead contamination]] in the soil of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].  People in the United States and around the globe are invited to draw their own 100 dollar bills and send to collection centers, or schools, for safekeeping. During a nationwide road-trip in an armored truck, the Fundred Dollar Bills will be collected.

The completed Fundred Dollar Bills will be presented to Congress for an even exchange of U.S. dollars to help the remediation of lead in the soil of New Orleans. This funding supports [[Operation Paydirt]], which is the program that, once implemented, will make the lead content in the soil safe for inhabitants of New Orleans and cities affected by lead poisoning-across the United States.

So far nearly half a million people have created and sent in their unique Fundreds. 

'''Armored Truck Tour'''

Throughout 2010, students at hundreds of schools across the country created Fundred Dollar Bills that were picked up in a specially designed armored truck. 
As students and educators handed their Fundreds over to truck guards for safekeeping, schools held events that raised awareness of the gravity and persistence of the lead in our environment. 

These events gave local elected officials and community organizations a chance to show their support for lead cleanup while giving local press brought the issue to larger audiences.

At every stop the armored truck tour connected the national campaign for lead awareness. Each event around the country not only provided public and impassioned demonstrations against lead poisoning, but brought people together to make connections around this public health health issue.

Grand Rapids

In the fall of 2014, the ArtPrize competition in Grand Rapids, Michigan featuring the Fundred Dollar Bill Project, offered an opportunity to raise visibility of local lead issues and invite participation from the tends of thousands of expected visitors. 

Visitors to the exhibit sat at bank teller tables and drew their unique Fundreds. Once drawn, their Fundreds were added to hundreds of others on a wall in the exhibit, making their artful demonstrations part of the exhibit for its duration. In addition to creating a public display of action-oriented art, the Grand Rapids initiative brought together local public health specialists, educators, and scientists to talk about the challenges and solutions to lead poisoning in Grand Rapids.

Art Academy in Cincinnati

In 2015, the Art Academy of Cincinnati partnered with the Fundred Dollar Bill Project and the Cincinnati Health Department Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program to create a course that used art and design to address and impact issues of lead contamination in Cincinnati. 

With the Fundred Dollar Bill Project as a common starting point and inspiration, students launched group projects to increase awareness of childhood lead poisoning and our ability to put an end to it. Students exhibited their projects at a publicly accessible end of semester block party. Students explored lead poisoning through dance performance and graphic design and created a learning-through-play area. The Health Department shared information about lead, and a public Fundred drawing table provided opportunity for attendees to sit together for conversation and to creatively put their values in action.

Fundred Reserve Open Lab at H-Space, located in DC, is a space to expand the Fundred program by continuing to amplify personal stories, having fact based dialogue about problems in DC, and engaging more people to take purposeful action. 

Open Lab continues the presence after the 2017 Fundred Reserve exhibition at The Corcoran.  Open Lab programming runs from October through April 2018, with space provided by Hamiltonian Artists, and support from The Kresge Foundation through our partnership with MIT CoLab. 

As an extension of Mel Chin’s multi-venue exhibition, All Over the Place (April 8 - September 5, 2018), the Fundred Project is on view at the Queens Museum as part of the exhibition.

'''Glitch art''' is the practice of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes by either corrupting digital data or physically manipulating electronic devices. Glitches appear in visual art such as the film ''A Colour Box'' (1935) by [[Len Lye]], the video sculpture ''TV Magnet'' (1965) by [[Nam June Paik]] and more contemporary work such as ''Panasonic TH-42PWD8UK Plasma Screen Burn'' (2007) by [[Cory Arcangel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Menkman | first = Rosa | author-link = Rosa Menkman | contribution = Glitch Studies Manifesto | editor1-last = Lovink | editor1-first = Geert | editor2-last = Somers-Miles | editor2-first = Rachel | title = Video Vortex Reader II: Moving Images Beyond YouTube | volume =  | pages = 336–347 | publisher = Institute of Network Cultures | place = Amsterdam | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-90-78146-12-4 | contribution-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110827222833/http://www.networkcultures.org/_uploads/%236reader_VideoVortex2PDF.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the term ==

In a technical sense, a [[glitch]] is the unexpected result of a malfunction, especially occurring in software, video games, images, videos, audio, and other digital artefacts. Early examples of glitches used in [[new media art|media art]] include ''Digital TV Dinner'' (1978) created by Jamie Fenton and Raul Zaritsky, with glitch audio done by Dick Ainsworth. This video was made by manipulating the [[Bally Astrocade|Bally video game console]] and recording the results on videotape.&lt;ref name=betancourt&gt;Betancourt, Michael. (2015) [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/Betancourt_TheInventionofGlitchVideo.pdf The Invention of Glitch Video: Digital TV Dinner (1978) (preview)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term glitch came to be associated with music in the mid 90s to describe a genre of experimental/noise/electronica (see [[Glitch (music)|glitch music]]). Shortly after, as VJs and other visual artist began to embrace the glitch as an aesthetic of the digital age, glitch art came to refer to a whole assembly of visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, Michael. (2003) "Welcome to Cyberia" [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/MAEX_Welcome_to_Cyberia_2003.pdf], ''Miami Art Exchange,'' September 19, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2002, Motherboard, a tech-art collective, held a glitch symposium in [[Oslo]], Norway, to "bring together international artists, academics and other Glitch practitioners for a short space of time to share their work and ideas with the public and with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Motherboard. (2002) http://www.liveart.org/motherboard/&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29 thru October 3, 2010, [[Chicago]] played host to the first GLI.TC/H, a five-day conference in Chicago organized by Nick Briz, Evan Meaney, [[Rosa Menkman]] and Jon Satrom that included workshops, lectures, performances, installations and screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = McCormack| first = Tom| title = Code Eroded: At GLI.TC/H| work = Rhizome| accessdate = 2016-08-25| date = 2010-10-13| url = http://rhizome.org/editorial/2010/oct/13/code-eroded-at-glitch/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, the second GLI.TC/H event traveled from [[Chicago]] to [[Amsterdam]] and lastly to [[Birmingham]], UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/chicagos-glitch-fest-disrupts-the-traditional-gallery-space The Creators Project] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229055113/http://thecreatorsproject.com/blog/chicagos-glitch-fest-disrupts-the-traditional-gallery-space |date=February 29, 2012 }}. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; It included workshops, screenings, lectures, performance, panel discussions and a gallery show over the course of seven days at the three cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Rubin| first = Josh| title = GLI.TC/H: A Chicago convention explores artistic failures of the digital world| work = Cool Hunting| accessdate = 2016-08-26| date = 2011-11-04| url = http://www.coolhunting.com/culture/glitch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glitch Art.jpg|thumbnail|Example of glitch art, by [[Rosa Menkman]]]]

What is called "glitch art" typically means visual glitches, either in a still or moving image. It is made by either "capturing" an image of a glitch as it randomly happens, or more often by artists/designers manipulating their digital files, software or hardware to produce these "errors." Artists have posted a variety of tutorials online explaining how to make glitch art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danieltemkin.com/Tutorials Daniel Temkin, "Glitch Tutorials," DanielTemkin.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://phillipstearns.wordpress.com/glitch-art-resources/ Phillip Stearns, "Glitch Art Resources," phillipstearns.wordpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt; There are many approaches to making these glitches happen on demand, ranging from physical changes to the hardware to direct alternations of the digital files themselves. Artist [[Michael Betancourt]] identified five areas of manipulation that are used to create "glitchart."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Betancourt]], "Glitch Art in Theory and Practice," Cinegraphic.net May 20, 2016 [http://www.cinegraphic.net/article.php?story=20160520143014412]&lt;/ref&gt; Betancourt notes that "glitch art" is defined by a broad range of technical approaches that can be identified with changes made to the digital file, its generative display, or the technologies used to show it (such as a video screen). He includes within this range changes made to analog technologies such as television (in video art) or the physical film strip in motion pictures:

===Data manipulation===
[[File:My first datamosh.webm|thumb|right|200px|An example of datamoshing]]
Data manipulation  (aka ''[[databending]]'') changes the information inside the digital file to create glitches. Databending involves editing and changing the file data. There are a variety of tutorials explaining how to make these changes using programs such as HexFiend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Betancourt]], "An Easy 7-Step Protocol for Databending," ''Signal Culture Cookbook,'' 2014 [http://www.michaelbetancourt.com/pdf/Cookbook_Databending.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Woodall explains in his tutorial
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like all files, image files (.jpg .bmp .gif etc) are all made up of text. Unlike some other files, like .svg (vectors) or .html (web pages), when an image is opened in a text editor all that comes up is gobbldygook!&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fizzpop.org.uk/an-introduction-to-databending/ Adam Woodall, "An introduction to databending ," FizzPop, May 15, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Related processes such as '''datamoshing''' changes the data in a video or picture file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Datamoshing Technique for Video Art Production|journal=芸術科学会論文誌 - The Journal of The Society for Art and Science|volume=13|url=http://www.art-science.org/journal/v13n3/v13n3pp154/artsci-v13n3pp154.pdf|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="flossmanuals"/&gt;  Datamoshing with software such as [[Avidemux]] is a common method for creating glitch art by manipulating different frame types in compressed digital video: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Datamoshing involves the removal of an encoded video’s I-frames (intra-coded picture, also known as key frames—a frame that does not require any information regarding another frame to be decoded), leaving only the P- (predicted picture) or B- (bi-predictive picture) frames. P-frames contain information predicting the changes in the image between the current frame and the previous one, and B-frames contain information predicting the image differences between the previous, current and subsequent frames. Because P- and B-frames use data from previous and forward frames, they are more compressed than I-Frames."&lt;ref&gt;Zinman, Gregory (2015). ‘Getting Messy: Chance and Glitch in Contemporary Video Art,’ in Abstract Video: The Moving Image in Contemporary Art, edited by Gabrielle Jennings. Oakland: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This process of direct manipulation of the digital data is not restricted to files that only appear on digital screens. "3D model glitching" refers to the purposeful corruption of the code in [[List of 3D animation software|3D animation program]]s resulting in distorted and abstract images of 3D [[virtual world]]s, [[3D modeling|models]] and even [[3D printing|3D printed objects]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turk|first1=Victoria|title=3D-Printed Mistakes Are Inspiring a New Kind of Glitch Art|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/read/3d-printed-mistakes-are-inspiring-a-new-kind-of-glitch-art|publisher=Vice Motherboard|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misalignment===
Misalignment glitches are produced by opening a digital file of one type with a program designed for a different type of file,&lt;ref name="flossmanuals"&gt;{{cite web|title=Encoding Explained|url=https://flossmanuals.net/a-look-at-open-video/encoding-explained/|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as opening a video file as a sound file, or using the wrong codec to decompress a file.  Tools commonly used to create glitches of this type include [[Audacity (audio editor)|Audacity]] and [[WordPad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=databending and glitch art primer, part 1: the wordpad effect|url=http://blog.animalswithinanimals.com/2008/08/databending-and-glitch-art-primer-part.html|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artist Jamie Boulton explains the process and the glitches it produces, noting that these glitches depend on how Audacity handles files, even when they are not audio-encoded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The easiest way to manipulate a file in Audacity is to select a section of the file and apply one of the built in sound effects to it. Now I’m no computing whizz kid but the way I see it when you apply a sound effect to a sound file, the program takes that file and alters the file data in the manner which it’s been told will achieve that effect. So, for example, if you were to apply an echo effect then it would repeat parts of the file, diminishing the repetition after each iteration. The wonderful thing is that it will do this regardless of what the file actually is. Audacity doesn’t know or care whether the file is a sound or not, it will alter it in the manner instructed.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Boulton, "Databending using Audacity Effects," Question Something, July 26, 2012 [https://questionsomething.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/databending-using-audacity-effects/]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hardware failure===
Hardware failure happens by altering the physical wiring or other internal connections of the machine itself, such as a short-circuit, in a process called "[[circuit bending]]" causes the machine to create glitches that produce new sounds and visuals.&lt;ref name=wired1&gt;{{cite web|title=Glitch art created by 'databending'|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/glitch-art-databending|work=Wired|first=Duncan |last= Geere |accessdate=19 July 2016|date=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, by damaging internal pieces of something like a [[VHS]] player, one can achieve different colorful visual images. Video artist [[Tom DeFanti]] explained the role of hardware failure in a voice-over for Jamie Fenton's early glitch video ''Digital TV Dinner'' that used the [[Bally Astrocade|Bally video game console]] system:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
This piece represents the absolute cheapest one can go in home computer art. This involves taking a $300 video game system, pounding it with your fist so the cartridge pops out while its trying to write the menu.  The music here is done by Dick Ainsworth using the same system, but pounding it with your fingers instead of your fist.&lt;ref name=betancourt/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Physically beating the case of the game system would cause the game cartridge to pop out, interrupting the computer's operation. The glitches that resulted from this failure were a result of how the machine was set-up:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There was ROM memory in the cartridge and ROM memory built into the console. Popping out the cartridge while executing code in the console ROM created garbage references in the stack frames and invalid pointers, which caused the strange patterns to be drawn. [...] The Bally Astrocade was unique among cartridge games in that it was designed to allow users to change game cartridges with power-on. When pressing the reset button, it was possible to remove the cartridge from the system and induce various memory dump pattern sequences. Digital TV Dinner is a collection of these curious states of silicon epilepsy set to music composed and generated upon this same platform.&lt;ref name=betancourt/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Misregistration===
Misregistration is produced by the physical noise of historically analog media such as motion picture film. It includes dirt, scratches, smudges and markings that can distort physical media also impact the playback of digital recordings on media such as CDs and DVDs, as electronic music composer [[Kim Cascone]] explained in 2002:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"There are many types of digital audio ‘failure.' Sometimes, it results in horrible noise, while other times it can produce wondrous tapestries of sound. (To more adventurous ears, these are quite often the same.) When the German sound experimenters known as Oval started creating music in the early 1990s by painting small images on the underside of CDs to make them skip, they were using an aspect of ‘failure' in their work that revealed a subtextual layer embedded in the compact disc.

Oval's investigation of ‘failure' is not new. Much work had previously been done in this area such as the optical soundtrack work of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Oskar Fischinger, as well as the vinyl record manipulations of John Cage and Christian Marclay, to name a few. What is new is that ideas now travel at the speed of light and can spawn entire musical genres in a relatively short period of time."&lt;ref name=Cascone1&gt;{{cite web|title=THE AESTHETICS OF FAILURE 'Post-Digital' Tendencies in Contemporary Computer Music|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/journals/COMJ/CMJ24_4Cascone.pdf|work=''Computer Music Journal,'' 24:4 Winter 2002 (MIT Press)|first=Kim |last=Cascone | author-link = Kim_Cascone |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Distortion===
Distortion was one of the earliest types of glitch art to be produced, such as in the work of video artist [[Nam June Paik]], who created video distortions by placing powerful magnets in close proximity to the television screen, resulting in the appearance of abstract patterns.&lt;ref name=Keys1&gt;{{cite web|title=Error Message|url=http://www.richardbkeys.net/error-message/|first=Richard B. |last=Keys |accessdate=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paik's addition of physical interference to a TV set created new kinds of imagery that changed how the broadcast image was displayed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The magnetic field interferes with the television’s electronic signals, distorting the broadcast image into an abstract form that changes when the magnet is moved.&lt;ref&gt;"Nam June Paik: TV Magnet," Whitney Museum of American Art, web description for accession number 86.60a-b [http://collection.whitney.org/object/6139]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By recording the resulting distortions with a camera, they can then be shown without the need for the magnet.

'''Guerrilla art''' is a [[street art]] [[art movement|movement]] that first emerged in the [[UK]], but has since spread across the world and is now established in most countries that already had developed [[graffiti]] scenes. In fact, it owes so much to the early graffiti movement, in the [[United States]] guerrilla art is still referred to as ‘post-graffiti art’.
  
Guerrilla art differs from other art forms in it has no external boundary between the image and the environment. While a traditional painting can be moved from one gallery to another without the meaning or the artistic credibility of the piece being affected, street art is environmental, the surface to which it is applied to being as fundamental to the piece's meaning as that which is applied. Without the dynamics of modern life, guerrilla art is reduced to ‘art for arts sake’ and would be defined by ''what it is'' as opposed to ''what it does''.

The production of [[guerrilla]] art is focused on cause and effect, not the material piece itself. It aims to produce an effect within the minds of those people who live within the environment being altered. It does not necessarily aim to produce meaningful art in itself.

== Guerrilla artists ==
Guerrilla artists increasingly seem to be moving towards a philosophy of painting a continuous work of art, adding to it over time as less developed elements of the piece are erased by graffiti cleaning efforts or in the battle for space. Art on canvas is not guerrilla art. Although many guerrilla artists regularly produce ‘trapped art’, they do not generally consider it to be the same thing. This has manifested itself in a wave of new canvas styles that have a guerrilla art style, but are more comprehensive and finished. Few traditional artists would create artwork intentionally meaning for it to be [[mass produced]] with little fidelity and put up with [[wheat paste]]. Many guerrilla artists hijack major branding for their own publicity and identity, often at odds with the brand itself. This can be seen with [[D*Face]]'s hijacking of the [[Walt Disney]] signature.

It's not a movement that attempts to support or to oppose brand conditioning. It is the general public's artistic response to it.

&lt;!-- 'Vacant Lot Of Cabbages' (1978) --&gt;
&lt;!-- http://blog.tepapa.govt.nz/2012/11/02/vacant-lot-of-cabbages-documentation-enters-te-papas-archives/ --&gt;

In 1978 in downtown Wellington, [[New Zealand]] artist Barry Thomas, in collaboration with Chris Lipscombe, Hugh Walton and others, planted 180 cabbages "on the demolished Duke of Edinburgh/Roxy Theatre site in the centre of Wellington. This cabbage patch, planted in such a way as to spell the word CABBAGE immediately captured the imagination of both the media and the public and engendered a flurry of other activities on the site, culminating in a week-long festival... when the cabbages were ceremonially harvested."&lt;ref name="wellington"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harper |first1=Jenny |first2=Aaron |last2=Lister |date= |title=Wellington: A City for Sculpture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bWhH1fjliCwC&amp;q=barry+thomas#v=snippet&amp;q=barry%20thomas&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While a work of conceptual sculpture, this intervention is also an early example of Guerrilla art and [[guerilla gardening]] in New Zealand. Thomas' work remained for six months, "astonishingly unvandalised, as a living, breathing sculpture in the heart of the city." &lt;ref&gt;"The Artists' Co-op: Barry Thomas; Eva Yuen; Ian Hunter; Ross Boyd; Terry Handscombe; Robin White"&lt;/ref&gt; Christina Barton writes in the following months, "it captured the hearts and minds of Wellingtonians, who followed the growth of the cabbages, adding their own embellishments to the site, and contributed to the week of festivities (with poetry readings, performances, and the distribution of free coleslaw) that celebrated their harvest", describing the work as "a provocation to the local council and the city's developers".&lt;ref name="wellington" /&gt; Thomas' documentation of the project was recently purchased by New Zealand's national gallery Te Papa, who described the work as an "important moment in New Zealand’s art and social history" with links to the "[[Occupy movement]], [[urban farming]] and [[guerrilla gardening]]".&lt;ref&gt;"‘Vacant lot of cabbages’ documentation enters Te Papa’s archives"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic movement ==
[[Art]]istic [[Art movement|movement]]s are responsive. This movement is a response to the ever-increasing power and importance of the brand in everyday life. Developed, inner-city environments are where both [[brand]]ing and guerrilla art flourish. This is not coincidental.

The most important development in the street art movement and the reason for its 'guerrilla' tag is the adoption of guerrilla marketing techniques over traditional artistic methods. The use of [[guerrilla marketing]] methods to create ‘artistic publicity’ has seen the evolution away from artists as creative individuals and towards artists as brands.

It is this branding and the profound effect it has upon the minds of the general public that drives the guerrilla art movement.

'''Haitian Vodou art''' is art related to the [[Haitian Vodou]] religion. This religion has its roots in West African traditional religions brought to [[Haiti]] by slaves, but has assimilated elements from Europe and the Americas and continues to evolve. The most distinctive Vodou art form is the ''drapo Vodou'', an embroidered flag often decorated with sequins or beads, but the term covers a wide range of visual art forms including paintings, embroidered clothing, clay or wooden figures, musical instruments and assemblages. Since the 1950s there has been growing demand for Vodou art by tourists and collectors.

==Origins==

Art historians disagree on the origins of Haitian Vodou arts. [[Suzanne Blier]] makes the case that they come from the coastal areas of [[Benin]] and [[Togo]]. [[Robert Farris Thompson]] makes a plausible connection with Central Africa based on similarities with ''[[nkisi]]'' figures from the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]], and cosmograms, flags, drums and dances from that region.{{sfn|Vanhee|2002|p=244}}

The first slaves from West and Central Africa were brought to the Caribbean in the 16th century. Europeans often claimed that the slaves were being rescued from devil worship. 
However, the slaves maintained their religious practices in secret, and their priests were among the leaders of the first revolt in [[Haiti]] in 1791.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}}
Haiti became the first independent nation of African people in the [[Western Hemisphere]] in 1804 under President [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]].{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The traditional religion continued to be banned, and as late as the 1940s the Catholic church undertook a campaign against Vodou, ransacked temples and burned religious artifacts. 
Many of the techniques of sacred art have now been forgotten, and few sculptures were being made by 2001.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}}
The Vodou religion was finally recognized officially in 2002.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

The great majority of Haitians still practice the Vodou{{efn|The word ''Vodou'' means spirit.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}}} religion. 
The religion continues to evolve, and in addition to the traditional West African ''lwo'' (spirits) it now includes the spirits of heroes of resistance to the colonial forces, and spirits of powerful religious leaders.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The iconography of the Haitian Vodou religion combines elements from Africa, Europe and the Americas.{{sfn|Cosentino|2013}}
Thus a ''drapo'' made for an African spirit may include an image of a Catholic saint. 
The saint's image was originally in part designed to deceive Catholic missionaries, but also was chosen in recognition of similarity between the saint and the ''lwa''.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}}
Since then the saint and the spirit have become [[Syncretism|syncretized]].{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}

==Interpretation==
[[File:Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou Voudun rites.jpg|thumb|Antique ceremonial suit for Haitian Vodou rites]]
Vodou art can be difficult to classify in Western terms. 
Rachel Beauvoir-Dominique, writing of Marianne Lehmann's{{efn|Marianne Lehmann is a former Swiss diplomat who made her home in Port au Prince, Haiti, where she collected about 2,000 examples of Haitian sacred art over a twenty year period. [[UNESCO]] has contributed some funds towards indexing and photographing the collection, which includes musical instruments, figures dressed in costumes and other artifacts.{{sfn|Hodgson|2001}} }} Vodou art collection, notes that "even today, the Creole language does not possess any word to designate what Western civilization qualifies as 'art'."{{sfn|Benedicty-Kokken|2014|p=244}}
Poet and critic [[André Breton]] dismissed Haitian art, noting that Haiti had no museums or art collections. 
He apparently saw no value in the art associated with the "backward" Vodou religion.{{sfn|Benedicty-Kokken|2014|p=245}}

Some scholars distinguish narrative Haitian art, which may include depictions of events or ceremonies in which there are many images from Vodou, from "Vodou art" in the sense of art that has a sacred function. The latter would be designed for use in ceremonies or for placement in temples or on altars. 
Given the omnipresence of Vodou in Haiti, most narrative art would also include Vodou images.{{sfn|Crown|Rivers|Wilson|2013|p=110-111}}
However, the fluid and adaptive nature of Vodou makes it hard to clearly distinguish religion, art and religious art.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}

Alessandra Benedicty points out that Western scholars are led by their [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] intellectual framework into trying to explain Vodou art in terms of "intellectual truths". 
Vodou is open-ended and sometimes purposely dissimulates. 
Benedicty writes that in "the Vodou/Haitian aesthetic system, the ''objet d'art'' nurtures ambivalence and demands that the reader or the spectator interpret and thus participate in the production of an artistic text's meaning."  If there is a ''[[veve]]'' in the work, there is a possibility that the ''[[lwa]]'' the work was made for will possess the viewer.{{sfn|Glover|2010|p=194}}
The purchaser of a Vodou altar or other artwork may be possessed by their purchase.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}
A 1995 exhibit at the Fowler Museum of Cultural History in California of "The Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou"  included dramatic ritual interactions between Vodouists and ''lwa'' that may have included possession.{{sfn|Harvey|2014|p=219}}

==Drapo==
A ''drapo Vodou'' is a handmade flag, typically embroidered and decorated with beads and sequins.
Although flags may have been made in West Africa before the arrival of Europeans, the flags widely used there by 1600 were derived from European flags. 
They were used as symbols of ethnic, military or religious allegiance.
The ''drapo Vodou'' also drew on Yoruba beadwork, Catholic vestments and Masonic aprons.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
In the 19th century and early 20th century most ''drapo Vodou'' were made from one or two colored fabric pieces decorated with embroidery, metal bangles and glass beads, with an image of the ''lwa'' made of shiny fabrics [[appliqué]]d to the cloth using techniques still followed in West Africa.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
Flags and banners used in the 21st century in rural areas often still have stylistically simple designs, in part due to the high cost of decorative material.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=18}}

With the older flags the background field that frames the image was usually decorated with widely spaced sequins or beads. 
Modern flag makers often completely cover the fabric of the field with sparkling sequins of one color, or with intricate geometrical patterns. 
Borders, which were either simple or did not exist on early ''drapo Vodou'', have evolved into highly elaborate patterns.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=21}}
The use of sequins in modern ''drapos'' dates to 1940, when Joseph Fortine saw a troupe of Afro-Brazilian samba dancers wearing sequin costumes in a Carnival parade. Fortine began to decorate the costumes of [[Rara]] band players with sequins, and in 1943 made a ''drapo Vodou'' for [[Damballa]] from a burlap coffee sack which he stretched on a wooden frame.
He made the image from sequin lines on a satin background, and added random sequins surrounding the image. 
Fortine taught his techniques to sequin artists such as Edgard Jean Louis, Sylva Joseph, Clotaire Bazile, and Yves Telemak. 
The youngest of these, Telemak, was the first to sign his work.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

There are two kinds of ''drapo Vodou''. The ''drapo servis'' are made for ceremonial use, and art flags are made for sale.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

===Drapo servis===
[[File:Trop Pou Te Haitian Vodou banners.jpg|thumb|Haitian Vodou drapos. The front flag is for Trop Pou Te.]]
The ''drapo servis'' are important religious icons. 
They are kept in shrine rooms, and carried by flag bearers in elaborate ceremonies in the main chamber of the temple. A ''drapo servis'' will include an image of a Catholic saint or a ''vèvè'' (trace-work emblem) of an ''lwa''{{efn|The ''lwas'' serve as intermediaries between humans and the supreme god.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} }} (spirit) such as [[Papa Legba]] or [[Ogun]] of the [[Yoruba religion]].{{sfn|Cosentino|2013}}
There are many ''lwas'', including [[Erzulie]], [[Guédé]], Damballa and [[La Sirene]].{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
The purpose of a ceremonial ''drapo'' is to flatter the ''lwa'' in the hope of gaining favor in return.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
Usually ''drapo servis'' are made in pairs, for example representing Ogun and Damballa.
Ogun was the ''lwa'' who led the slaves to freedom, and Damballa is the snake, representing the life force.
Ogun may be paired with other ''lwas''.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

A ''drapo servis'' will have a central image surrounded by a diamond-shaped border, will often have a fringe, and will be {{convert|36|by|36|in}} in size. The image may depict a Catholic saint associated with an ''lwa'' or may be a ''veve'' that represents the ''lwa'' symbolically and provides a gateway for it to enter the world of humans.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
The image may be a [[Chromolithography|chromolithograph]], a vividly colored paper image from Italy, Mexico or Spain of a Catholic saint that has been syncretized with the corresponding African spirit of the drapo.  The image may be an outline of the saint traced from a chromolithograph, or may be a detailed and faithful copy of a chromolithograph in beads and sequins.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}

The most widely used images of saints are those of [[Isidore of Chios|Saint Isidore]], [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James Major]], [[Saint Patrick]] and the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Holy Virgin]].{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}
Veves include the ship of [[Agwé]], the cemetery cross of [[Baron Samedi]], the crossroads of Legba and so on.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=19}}
An image of a mermaid is used on flags for the water spirit [[LaSiren]]. 
This does not derive from ''veve'' or Catholic origins, but seems to have come from European nautical sources.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=20}}
The image of a fish is important in Vodou as in Christian art, but the Vodou symbol comes from [[Fon people|Fon]] mythology rather than Christianity.{{sfn|Desmangles|1992|p=151}}
It represents Agwé, who corresponds to the Fon sea deity Agbê.
Agbê took the shape of a fish when he was given responsibility for the sea.{{sfn|Desmangles|1992|p=152}}

===Art flags===
[[File:VoodooValris.jpg|thumb|Flag by George Valris]]
Art flags show much wider variation in size and theme than ''drapo servis'', and rarely have a fringe. Some flags are closer to tapestries.{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
In the 1950s collectors started to buy ''drapo Vodou'', and the ''oungan'' (priests) began to make them for sale as a source of income. 
The next generation of artists, active in the 1990s, included Eviland Lalanne, Joseph Oldof Pierre, Le Petit Frere Mogirus, Wagler Vital, Georges Valris, Roland Rockville, Ronald Gouin, and Antoine Oleyant. They introduced various innovations, in part driven by the shortage of materials for flagmaking. Antoine Oleyant has been called "the artist who really brought the flags into the realm of fine art."{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}

In [[Port-au-Prince]] the skilled ''drapo'' artists have ready access to beads and sequins brought in from Canada and the United States. 
These artists earn their living from sales to tourists and to art galleries.{{sfn|Polk|1997|p=18}}
In the 21st century there have been considerable changes to ''drapo Vodou'' as an art-form, in which artists such as Myrlande Constant{{efn|Myrlande Constant, born in 1970, was taught seamstress and beading techniques by her mother, and worked in a factory making wedding dresses. She taught herself flagmaking, using beads rather than sequins, and has since become internationally recognized.{{sfn|Ulysse|2011}} }} have introduced new themes and techniques.
Other contemporary ''drapo'' artists include Evelyne Alcide, Roudy Azor, Gabriel Chery, Lindor Chiler, Mireille Delice, Christian Dorleus and Josiane Joseph.
Their large and elaborate ''drapo'' represent in greater details the interactions with the ''lwas'' in events such as Vodou ceremonies and weddings.
They may also represent evangelical Christian themes, or have secular subjects.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}} 
Edgard Jean Louis, a well-known flagmaker, made a flag called "Diana Erzulie" that included a photograph of the English [[Princess Diana]].{{sfn|Sequin Flags of Haiti, Ridge Art}}
There is growing demand for such ''drapo'' by international art collectors.{{sfn|Drapo Vodou : Spirit Flags}}

==Other objects==
[[File:Haitian vodou altar to Petwo, Rada, and Gede spirits; November 5, 2010..jpg|thumb|Altar to Petwo, Rada, and Gede spirits; 2010]]
In the 1940s Haitian professional artists began to create imitations of images provided by foreign entrepreneurs. The images represented the foreigners' view of the essence of Vodou art. This interaction was later dismissed and the Haitian works were stated to be [[Authenticity in art|authentic]].{{sfn|Richman|2008|p=203}}
In 1949 fifteen artists decorated the Episcopal Saint Trinite Cathedral in Port-au-Prince with murals that contrast Vodou art and traditional scenes from the bible.
Thirteen of the artists were Catholics and/or Vodouists.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=190}}
In the 1950s the murals became world famous. African gods were found in the symbolism of Christian images. Thus the "Damballah Virgin" by Andre Dimanche was identified as [[Erzulie]], a lwa connected to Aphrodite, Mater Dolorosa, health and an angry Madonna.{{sfn|Thomas|2014|p=191}}

A doll incorporated in a work of Vodou art can be animated so it can perform supernatural work, protecting the home. The Haitian Vodou priest Georges René explains the process, saying "anything can do mystique if you believe in it... you have to turn it into mystic. You baptize it. You make a ceremony. You put the food the ''lwa'' eats... after that you can work with it. It gets a soul. You can put it on an altar."{{sfn|Apter|Derby|2009|p=357}}

[[Pierrot Barra]] (1942–99) and Marie Cassaise made sacred altar installations from everyday objects such as dolls, sunglasses, sequins, speedometers, rosaries, mirrors and tinsel.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=9}}
Barra said his work was inspired by the Vodou spirits, who sometimes demanded it. He said, "When I sleep, while I'm dreaming, I see the Mysteries. When I sleep I see the spirits...they show me a design, some face, some kind of thing. Then when I wake up I create it."{{sfn|Cosentino|1999|p=16}}
A visitor to Port-au-Prince in 1991 described an altar installation Barra made for the mother goddess [[Ezili Dantor]]. Her head came from a plaster doll, with rouge, lipstick and white synthetic hair. She held a cutout picture of the baby Jesus, which represented the goddess's daughter Anais.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=9}}
A red fabric snake was wrapped round the body of the goddess, and a small rubber baby doll was at the foot of the statue. The whole was decorated with sparkles and cheap jewelry. This was not a traditional design, but was immediately recognized by Vodouists as authentic Vodou art.{{sfn|Cosentino|1998|p=10}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39965">'''Immersion''' into [[virtual reality]] is a perception of being physically [[Presence (telepresence)|present]] in a non-physical world. The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other [[Stimulation|stimuli]] that provide an engrossing total environment.

The name is a metaphoric use of the experience of [[wikt:submerge|submersion]] applied to representation, fiction or simulation. Immersion can also be defined as the state of consciousness where a "visitor" ([[Maurice Benayoun]]) or "immersant" ([[Char Davies]])'s awareness of physical self is transformed by being surrounded in an artificial environment; used for describing partial or complete [[suspension of disbelief]], enabling action or reaction to stimulations encountered in a virtual or artistic environment. The degree to which the virtual or artistic environment faithfully reproduces reality determines the degree of suspension of disbelief. The greater the suspension of disbelief, the greater the degree of presence achieved.

According to [[Ernest W. Adams]], author and consultant on [[game design]],&lt;ref name=ernest&gt;{{cite web | last =Adams | first =Ernest | title =Postmodernism and the Three Types of Immersion | publisher =[[Gamasutra]] | date =July 9, 2004 | url =http://designersnotebook.com/Columns/063_Postmodernism/063_postmodernism.htm | accessdate =2007-12-26 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20071024225651/http://www.designersnotebook.com/Columns/063_Postmodernism/063_postmodernism.htm | archivedate =October 24, 2007 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; immersion can be separated into three main categories:

;Tactical immersion
:Tactical immersion is experienced when performing tactile operations that involve skill. Players feel "in the zone" while perfecting actions that result in success.

;Strategic immersion
:Strategic immersion is more cerebral, and is associated with mental challenge. Chess players experience strategic immersion when choosing a correct solution among a broad array of possibilities.

;Narrative immersion
:Narrative immersion occurs when players become invested in a story, and is similar to what is experienced while reading a book or watching a movie.

Staffan Björk and Jussi Holopainen, in ''Patterns In Game Design'',&lt;ref name=bjork&gt;{{cite book | last =Björk | first =Staffan |author2=Jussi Holopainen | title =Patterns In Game Design | publisher =Charles River Media | year =2004 | page =206 | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=IFQfyODK4wAC }} | isbn =1-58450-354-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; divide immersion into similar categories, but call them '''sensory-motoric immersion''', '''cognitive immersion''' and '''emotional immersion''', respectively. In addition to these, they add a new category:

;Spatial immersion
:Spatial immersion occurs when a player feels the simulated world is perceptually convincing. The player feels that he or she is really "there" and that a simulated world looks and feels "real".

== Presence ==

Presence, a term derived from the shortening of the original "[[telepresence]]", is a phenomenon enabling people to interact with and feel connected to the world outside their physical bodies via technology. It is defined as a person's '''subjective sensation''' of being there in a scene depicted by a medium, usually virtual in nature.&lt;ref name=barfield&gt;{{cite book | last=Barfield | first=Woodrow | last2=Zeltzer | first2=David | last3=Sheridan | first3=Thomas | last4=Slater | first4=Mel | editor1-last=Barfield | editor1-first=Woodrow | editor2-last = Furness, III | editor2-first=Thomas A. | title=Virtual Environments and Advanced Interface Design | chapter=Presence and Performance Within Virtual Environments | publisher = Oxford University Press | year=1995 | page=473 | url = {{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=OLE-4j3tHi0C}} | isbn=0195075552}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most designers focus on the technology used to create a high-fidelity virtual environment; however, the human factors involved in achieving a state of presence must be taken into account as well. It is the subjective perception, although generated by and/or filtered through human-made technology, that ultimately determines the successful attainment of presence.&lt;ref name=Thornson&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Thornson | first1=Carol | last2=Goldiez |first2=Brian | date=January 2009 | title=Predicting presence: Constructing the Tendency toward Presence Inventory | url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.08.006 |journal=International Journal of Human Computer Studies | volume=67 | issue=1 | pages=62-78 | doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2008.08.006 | access-date= 19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual reality glasses can produce a visceral feeling of being in a simulated world, a form of spatial immersion called Presence. According to [[Oculus VR]], the technology requirements to achieve this visceral reaction are low-latency and precise tracking of movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/oculus-rift-dev-kit-2-now-on-sale-for-350/|title=Oculus Rift Dev Kit 2 now on sale for $350|author=Seth Rosenblatt|date=19 March 2014|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=CNET|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328041627/http://www.cnet.com/news/oculus-rift-dev-kit-2-now-on-sale-for-350/|archivedate=28 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/oculus-rift-dk2-hands-on-and-first-impressions-19321282/|title=Oculus Rift DK2 hands-on and first-impressions|work=SlashGear}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/announcing-the-oculus-rift-development-kit-2-dk2/|title=Announcing the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 (DK2)|author=|date=|website=oculusvr.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913045405/http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/announcing-the-oculus-rift-development-kit-2-dk2/|archivedate=13 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Abrash]] gave a talk on VR at Steam Dev Days in 2014.&lt;ref name="Abrash"&gt;Abrash M. (2014). ''[http://media.steampowered.com/apps/abrashblog/Abrash%20Dev%20Days%202014.pdf What VR could, should, and almost certainly will be within two years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320175550/http://media.steampowered.com/apps/abrashblog/Abrash%20Dev%20Days%202014.pdf |date=2014-03-20 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; According to the VR research team at [[Valve Corporation|Valve]], all of the following are needed to establish presence.
* A wide field of view (80 degrees or better)
* Adequate resolution (1080p or better)
* Low pixel persistence (3 ms or less)
* A high enough refresh rate (&gt;60&amp;nbsp;Hz, 95&amp;nbsp;Hz is enough but less may be adequate)
* Global display where all pixels are illuminated simultaneously (rolling display may work with eye tracking.)
* Optics (at most two lenses per eye with trade-offs, ideal optics not practical using current technology)
* Optical calibration
* Rock-solid tracking – translation with millimeter accuracy or better, orientation with quarter degree accuracy or better, and volume of 1.5 meter or more on a side
* Low latency (20 ms motion to last photon, 25 ms may be good enough)

== Immersive virtual reality ==
[[File:CAVE Crayoland.jpg|thumb|The [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment]]]]
'''Immersive virtual reality''' is a hypothetical future technology that exists today as [[virtual reality]] art projects, for the most part.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of immersion in an [[Simulation|artificial]] environment where the user feels just as immersed as they usually feel in [[consensus reality]].

=== Direct interaction of the nervous system ===
The most considered method would be to induce the sensations that made up the [[virtual reality]] in the [[nervous system]] directly. In [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]/conventional [[biology]] we interact with [[consensus reality]] through the [[nervous system]]. Thus we receive all input from all the senses as nerve impulses.
It gives your neurons a feeling of heightened sensation. It would involve the user receiving inputs as artificially stimulated [[nerve]] impulses, the system would receive the CNS outputs (natural nerve impulses) and process them allowing the user to interact with the [[virtual reality]]. Natural impulses between the body and [[central nervous system]] would need to be prevented. This could be done by blocking out natural impulses using nanorobots which attach themselves to the brain wiring, whilst receiving the digital impulses of which describe the virtual world, which could then be sent into the wiring of the brain. A [[feedback]] system between the user and the computer which stores the information would also be needed. Considering how much information would be required for such a system, it is likely that it would be based on hypothetical forms of computer technology.

=== Requirements ===
;Understanding of the nervous system
A comprehensive understanding of which nerve impulses correspond to which sensations, and which motor impulses correspond to which muscle contractions will be required. This will allow the correct sensations in the user, and actions in the virtual reality to occur. The [[Blue Brain Project]] is the current, most promising research with the idea of understanding how the brain works by building very large scale computer models.

;Ability to manipulate [[Central nervous system|CNS]]
The [[nervous system]] would obviously need to be manipulated. Whilst non-invasive devices using radiation have been postulated, invasive cybernetic implants are likely to become available sooner and be more accurate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Manipulation could occur at any stage of the nervous system – the spinal cord is likely to be simplest; as all nerves pass through here, this could be the only site of manipulation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}
[[Molecular nanotechnology]] is likely to provide the degree of precision required and could allow the implant to be built inside the body rather than be inserted by an operation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

;Computer hardware/software to process inputs/outputs
A very powerful computer would be necessary for processing virtual reality complex enough to be nearly indistinguishable from consensus reality and interacting with central nervous system fast enough.

== Immersive digital environments ==

[[File:COSMOPOLIS.jpg|right|thumb|Cosmopolis (2005), [[Maurice Benayoun]]'s Giant Virtual Reality Interactive Installation]]
An '''immersive digital environment''' is an [[Simulation|artificial]], [[interactive]], computer-created [[cut scene|scene]] or "world" within which a user can immerse themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 48-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Immersive digital environments could be thought of as synonymous with [[virtual reality]], but without the implication that actual "reality" is being simulated. An immersive digital environment could be a model of [[reality]], but it could also be a complete fantasy [[user interface]] or [[abstraction]], as long as the user of the environment is immersed within it. The definition of immersion is wide and variable, but here it is assumed to mean simply that the user feels like they are part of the simulated "[[universe]]". The success with which an immersive digital environment can actually immerse the [[User (computing)|user]] is dependent on many factors such as believable [[3D computer graphics]], [[surround sound]], interactive user-input and other factors such as simplicity, functionality and potential for enjoyment. New technologies are currently under development which claim to bring realistic environmental effects to the players' environment – effects like wind, seat vibration and ambient lighting.

=== Perception ===
To create a sense of full immersion, the 5 senses (sight, sound, touch, smell, taste) must perceive the digital environment to be physically real.  [[Immersive technology]] can perceptually fool the senses through:
* Panoramic 3D displays (visual)
* Surround sound acoustics (auditory)
* Haptics and force feedback (tactile)
* Smell replication (olfactory)
* Taste replication (gustation)

=== Interaction ===
Once the senses reach a sufficient belief that the digital environment is real (it is interaction and involvement which can never be real), the user must then be able to interact with the environment in a natural, intuitive manner.  Various [[immersive technologies]] such as gestural controls, motion tracking, and computer vision respond to the user's actions and movements.  Brain control interfaces (BCI) respond to the user's brainwave activity.

=== Examples and applications ===
Training and rehearsal simulations run the gamut from part task procedural training (often buttonology, for example:  which button do you push to deploy a refueling boom) through situational simulation (such as crisis response or convoy driver training) to full motion simulations which train pilots or soldiers and law enforcement in scenarios that are too dangerous to train in actual equipment using live ordinance.

[[Computer games]] from simple arcade to [[massively multiplayer online game]] and training programs such as [[Flight simulator|flight]] and [[Driving simulator|driving]] simulators. Entertainment environments such as motion simulators that immerse the riders/players in a virtual digital environment enhanced by motion, visual and aural cues. Reality simulators, such as one of the [[Virunga Mountains]] in [[Rwanda]] that takes you on a trip through the jungle to meet a tribe of [[mountain gorilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pulseworks.com/Film_Library.html pulseworks.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505131611/http://pulseworks.com/Film_Library.html |date=2009-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Or training versions such as one which simulates taking a ride through human arteries and the [[heart]] to witness the buildup of [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]] and thus learn about [[cholesterol]] and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usagainstathero.com/arteryexplorer/index.aspx|title=Thank You|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with scientist, artists like [[Knowbotic Research]], [[Donna Cox]], [[Rebecca Allen (artist)|Rebecca Allen]], [[Robbie Cooper]], [[Maurice Benayoun]],
[[Char Davies]], and [[Jeffrey Shaw]] use the potential of immersive virtual reality to create physiologic or symbolic experiences and situations.

Other examples of immersion technology include physical environment / immersive space with surrounding digital projections and sound such as the [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|CAVE]], and the use of [[virtual reality headset]]s for viewing movies, with head-tracking and computer control of the image presented, so that the viewer appears to be inside the scene. The next generation is VIRTSIM, which achieves total immersion through motion capture and wireless head mounted displays for teams of up to thirteen immersants enabling natural movement through space and interaction in both the virtual and physical space simultaneously.

== Detrimental effects ==

[[Simulation sickness]], or simulator sickness, is a condition where a person exhibits symptoms similar to motion sickness caused by playing computer/simulation/video games (Oculus Rift is working to solve simulator sickness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/19/4636508/oculus-rift-is-working-to-solve-simulator-sickness|title=Oculus Rift is working to solve simulator sickness|publisher=Polygon|date=|accessdate=2015-05-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924142134/http://www.polygon.com/2013/8/19/4636508/oculus-rift-is-working-to-solve-simulator-sickness|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Motion sickness]] due to virtual reality is very similar to simulation sickness and motion sickness due to films. In virtual reality, however, the effect is made more acute as all external reference points are blocked from vision, the simulated images are three-dimensional and in some cases stereo sound that may also give a sense of motion. Studies have shown that exposure to rotational motions in a virtual environment can cause significant increases in nausea and other symptoms of motion sickness.&lt;ref&gt;So, R.H.Y. and Lo, W.T. (1999) "Cybersickness: An Experimental Study to Isolate the Effects of Rotational Scene Oscillations." Proceedings of IEEE Virtual Reality '99 Conference, March 13–17, 1999, Houston, Texas. Published by IEEE Computer Society, pp.&amp;nbsp;237–241&lt;/ref&gt;

Other behavioural changes such as stress, [[Virtual Reality Addiction|addiction]], isolation and mood changes are also discussed to be side-effects caused by immersive virtual reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agocg.ac.uk/reports/virtual/37/37.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218043150/http://www.agocg.ac.uk/reports/virtual/37/37.pdf |archivedate=2014-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This incomplete '''list of art critics''' enumerates persons who had or have a significant part of their known creative output in the form of [[art criticism]], which consists mostly of the written discussion and aesthetic evaluation of [[Work of art|works of art]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gemtou2010" /&gt;
{{Compact ToC|seealso=yes|q=}}

==Scope==
{{main|Art critic}}
There is no official list of [[art critic]]s, the compilation of which is compounded by problems in defining [[art criticism]] – not least of which is the overlap with [[art history]],&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; and [[Aesthetics|philosophy of art]]. Herein will be included those [[authors]] that are mentioned as being art critics or producing art criticism in works of reference, as are encyclopedias, dictionaries or scholarly reviews.

According to one authority, art criticism, in a close approximation to the current sociocultural framework of the activity, started in the [[18th century CE]] in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; However, many authors living before that time and outside that region of the world wrote on the subject of art and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic experience]], though using [[Philosophy of art|terms and concepts]] that may not have a direct translation into the lexicon of the [[Western culture|Western]] tradition.&lt;ref name="elkins1996" /&gt; These, when mentioned, will be included as well though pertinently noted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6684">The occult (from the [[Latin]] word ''occultus'' "clandestine, hidden, secret") is "knowledge of the hidden".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Crabb (writer)|Crabb, G.]] (1927). ''English synonyms explained, in alphabetical order, copious illustrations and examples drawn from the best writers''. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co.&lt;/ref&gt; In common [[English language|English]] usage, ''occult'' refers to "knowledge of the [[paranormal]]", as opposed to "knowledge of the [[measurable]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Underhill|Underhill, E.]] (1911). ''Mysticism'', Meridian, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; usually referred to as [[science]]. The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that "is meant only for certain people" or that "must be kept hidden", but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends beyond [[Speculative reason|pure reason]] and the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.P. Blavatsky|Blavatsky, H. P.]] (1888). ''The Secret Doctrine''. Whitefish, MT: [[Kessinger Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''[[esotericism|esoteric]]'' and ''arcane'' can also be used to describe the occult,&lt;ref&gt;Houghton Mifflin Company. (2004). ''The American Heritage College Thesaurus''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. Page 530.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, C. F. (1895). An outline of the principles of modern theosophy. Boston: New England Theosophical Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural.

It also describes a number of [[magical organization]]s or orders, the teachings and practices taught by them, and to a large body of current and historical literature and spiritual philosophy related to this subject.

This is a list of women who engaged in war, found throughout [[mythology]] and [[folklore]], studied in fields such as [[literature]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[film studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[women's studies]]. A ''mythological'' figure does not always mean a ''fictional'' one, but rather, someone of whom stories have been told that have entered the cultural heritage of a people. Some women warriors are documented in the written record and as such form part of [[history]] (e.g. the [[Ancient Briton]] queen [[Boudica]], who led the [[Iceni]] into battle against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]). However, to be considered a warrior, the woman in question must have belonged to some sort of [[military]], be it recognized, like an organized [[army]], or unrecognized, like [[revolutionaries]].

==Pirates and seafarers==
*[[Anne Bonny]] and [[Mary Read]] sailed alongside [[Calico Jack]], Mary dressing as a man. Anne eventually became Jack's lover, and they had a child. In October 1720, their ship was attacked by a royal fleet. All but one of the male crew members, drunk and afraid, hid below deck as the two women fought on with the help of the unknown man. While imprisoned, Bonny is reported to have said of her doomed lover: "Sorry to see him there, but if he had fought like a man, he need not have been hanged like a dog."&lt;ref&gt;^ Druett, Joan (2000). She Captains : Heroines and Hellions of the Sea. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Ching Shih]], legendary "Pirate Queen" of China, famous for commanding over 300 ships and an army of 20,000 to 40,000 pirates. She lived during the 18th and 19th centuries.
*[[Gráinne O'Malley]], legendary "Pirate Queen" of Ireland. She lived during the 16th century.
*[[Muirisc]], daughter of [[Úgaine Mór]] (Hugony the Great), the sixty-sixth high king of Ireland, c. 600 BC  to AD 500.

==Africa==

===Angola===
*[[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba]]  valiantly fought and held off [[Portugal|Portuguese]] control of present-day [[Angola]] for over thirty years during the early 17th century.

===Benin history===

* The [[Dahomey Amazons]] (or ''N'Nonmiton'', meaning ''our mothers'' in the [[Fon language]]), were a [[Fon people|Fon]] all-female military regiment in [[Dahomey]], an African kingdom (c. 1600–1894) located in the area of the present-day [[Republic of Benin]]. They were so named by Western observers and historians due to their similarity to the semi-mythical [[Amazons]] of ancient [[Anatolia]] and the [[Black Sea]].

===Berber history===
*[[Kahina]] or '''al-Kāhina''' ([[Classical Arabic]] for "female seer"; modern [[Maghreb Arabic]] '''l-Kahna''', commonly romanised as '''Kah(i)na''', also known as '''Dihya''' or '''Kahya''') was a 7th-century female [[Berber people|Berber]] religious and military leader, who led indigenous resistance to Arab expansion in [[Northwest Africa]], the region then known as [[Numidia]], known as the [[Maghreb]] today. She was born in the early 7th century and died around the end of the 7th century probably in modern-day [[Algeria]].

===Burkina Faso===
*[[Yennenga]] was a legendary warrior woman skilled in spear and bow, considered by the [[Mossi people]] as the mother of their empire.

===Ancient Egypt===
[[File:GD-EG-KomOmbo016.JPG|thumb|right|150px|The warrior goddess [[Sekhmet]], shown with her sun disk and cobra crown]]
*[[Ankt]] may have originated in [[Asia Minor]]. Within [[Egypt]] she was later syncretized as [[Neith]] (who by that time had developed aspects of a war goddess).
*[[Cleopatra VII]] was a [[Hellenistic]] co-ruler of Egypt with her father ([[Ptolemy XII of Egypt|Ptolemy XII Auletes]]) and later with her brothers/husbands [[Ptolemy XIII of Egypt|Ptolemy XIII]] and [[Ptolemy XIV of Egypt|Ptolemy XIV]]. Her patron goddess was [[Isis]], and thus during her reign, it was believed that she was the re-incarnation and embodiment of the goddess of wisdom.
*[[Sekhmet]] is a warrior goddess depicted as a [[lion]]ess, the fiercest hunter known to the Egyptians.
*Though her reign was primarily peaceful, the pharaoh [[Hatshepsut]] fought in several battles during her younger years.
*[[Nefertiti]], wife of the pharaoh [[Akhenaten]], has been at times depicted as smiting enemies in a manner similar to how a male ruler typically would.
*[[Ahhotep I|Ahhotep]], wife of [[Seqenenre Tao II]], was believed to have been in command of the army while her son Ahmose I was still young.

===Ethiopia===
*[[Gudit]] (Ge'ez: Yodit, Judith) is a semi-legendary, non-Christian, [[Beta Israel]], queen (flourished c.960) who laid waste to [[Aksum]] and its countryside, destroyed churches and monuments, and attempted to exterminate the members of the ruling Axumite dynasty. Her deeds are recorded in the oral tradition and mentioned incidentally in various historical accounts.

===Ghana (then [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]])===
*[[Yaa Asantewaa]] was the Queen Mother of Ejisu ([[Ashanti Empire|Asante]] Confederacy)—now part of modern-day [[Ghana]]. In 1900 she led the Ashanti rebellion known as the [[War of the Golden Stool]] against British colonialism.

===Hausa history===
*[[Amina Sukhera]] (also called Aminatu) was a Muslim princess of the royal family of the kingdom of [[Zazzau]], in what is now northeast [[Nigeria]], who lived c. 1533 - 1610. Her military achievements brought her great wealth and power; she was responsible for conquering many of the cities in the area surrounding her seat.
* [[Sarraounia | Sarraounia Mangou]], chief/priestess of the animist Azna subgroup of the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], who fought French colonial troops of the [[Voulet–Chanoine Mission]] at the [[Battle of Lougou]] (in present-day [[Niger]]) in 1899. She is the subject of the 1986 film ''[[Sarraounia (film)|Sarraounia]]'' based on the novel of the same name by Nigerien writer [[Abdoulaye Mamani]].&lt;ref name="alou2009"&gt;Alou, Antoinette Tidjani. (2009). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30131185 "Niger and Sarraounia: One Hundred Years of Forgetting Female Leadership."] ''Research in African Literatures'' 40(1): 42–56 (Spring 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoruba mythology and history===
*[[Oya]] is the [[Orisha]] of the [[Niger River]]. She is the [[warrior]]-[[spirit]] of the wind, lightning, fertility, fire, and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. It is believed that she creates hurricanes and tornadoes, and serves as guardian of the [[underworld]]. Prior to her post-mortem [[Apotheosis|deification]], the historical Oya was a princess of the [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] clan as the consort of [[Shango]], its reigning [[king]]. She is often depicted with leopard-like spots, these being either [[wikt:war paint|war paint]] or ritual [[scarification]]. This is done for propaganda purposes, as the [[Leopard]] is famous in Yoruba folklore for its cunning.
*[[Madam Tinubu]] was a powerful titled aristocrat in [[Colonial Nigeria]]. As the first [[Queen mothers  (Africa)#Yoruba tradition|Iyalode]] of [[Egbaland]], she and her private battalion fought against the  [[Dahomey]]ans when they invaded [[Abeokuta]] in the 1850s and the 1860s.

===Nubia/Kush (Sudanese) history===
*The legendary [[Candace of Meroe]] (a title, her real name never given) was a warrior queen in the [[Alexander Romance]] who caused [[Alexander The Great]] himself to retreat upon witnessing the army she'd gathered. This however may be classified a non-historical account because Alexander never reached Sudan.
*[[Amanirenas]], however, was a historical holder of the title of Candace who fought against the Romans after their conquest of Egypt.

===[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]===
[[Nonhelema]] was a [[Shawnee]] chieftess and sister of [[Cornstalk]]. She was known by white settlers as the Grenadier or Grenadier Squaw because of her height. She promoted an alliance with the Americans on the frontier in Ohio.

[[Woman Chief]] (c. 1806 – 1858) was a [[Crow Nation|Crow]] chief and war leader in the mid-19th century. Born to the [[Gros Ventre]] people, she was adopted into the Crow. She gained renown in battles and raids, and assumed leadership of her lodge when her father died, becoming a leading chief. She married four wives and later participated in peace negotiations after the 1851 [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Jenkins |first= Jennifer L. |editor1-first= Gretchen M.|editor1-last=Bataille|editor2-first=Laurie |editor2-last=Lisa |encyclopedia=Native American Women: A Biographical Dictionary |title=Woman Chief |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eaSAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA341&amp;dq=%22Woman+Chief%22+Crow&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J0m0VKyXHMT6ggS7_YGQBA&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Woman%20Chief%22%20Crow&amp;f=false |access-date= September 7, 2016|year= 2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn= 1135955875 |page= 342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fallen Leaf (often called Woman Chief by the Americans): She was born to the [[Gros Ventre]] nation and taken captive by the Crow when she was 12. After she had counted coup four times in the prescribed Crow tradition, she was considered a warrior and chief and sat in the council of chiefs.

[[Running Eagle]]: she became a Blackfoot (Piegan) warrior after her husband was killed by the Crow.

[[Colestah]]: In the 1858 battle of Spokane Plains in Washington, Yakama leader Kamiakin's wife Colestah was known as a medicine woman, psychic, and warrior. Armed with a stone war club, Colestah fought at her husband's side. When Kamiakin was wounded, she rescued him, and then used her healing skills to cure him.

[[Buffalo Calf Road Woman]]: In the 1876 battle of the Rosebud in Montana, Buffalo Calf Road (aka Calf Trail Woman), the sister of Comes in Sight, rode into the middle of the warriors and saved the life of her brother. Buffalo Calf Road had ridden into battle that day next to her husband Black Coyote. This was considered to be one of the greatest acts of valor in the battle.

[[Moving Robe Woman]]: One of the best-known battles in the annals of Indian-American warfare is the 1876 [[Battle of the Greasy Grass]] in Montana where Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer was defeated. One of those who led the counterattack against the cavalry was the woman Tashenamani (Moving Robe).

[[Lozen]] (c. 1840-June 17, 1889) was a female warrior and prophet of the Chihenne [[Chiricahua]] [[Apache]]. She spent most of her adult life fighting the [[Apache Wars]] alongside her brother [[Victorio]] and the legendary [[Geronimo]].

====Aztec mythology====
*[[Itzpapalotl]] is a fearsome skeletal warrior [[goddess]] who ruled over the paradise world of [[Tamoanchan]].

===American Civil War===
*[[Frances Clayton]] disguised herself as a man to serve in the [[Union Army]] in the [[American Civil War]].

While devotions to Marishi-ten predate [[Zen]], they appear to be geared towards a similar meditative mode in order to enable the warrior to achieve a more heightened spiritual level. He lost interest in the issues of victory or defeat (or life and death), thus transcending to a level where he became so empowered that he was freed from his own grasp on mortality. The end result was that he became a better warrior.
*[[Kaihime]] (presumably born 1572) was said to have fought during the Siege of Odawara and to have personally crushed a rebellion, earning her father the respect of [[Hideyoshi Toyotomi]]. However, historians aren't entirely sure if she truly did accomplish those events.

===Rashidun Caliphate===
[[Khawlah bint al-Azwar]] was the daughter of one of the chiefs of [[Bani Assad]] tribe, and her family embraced Islam in its first days. The recorded history of that era mentions repeatedly the feats of Khawla in battles that took place in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Palestine. In one instance, she fought in disguise as a man to rescue her brother Derar after the Romans captured him. The Romans eventually lost the battle and fled. When her identity was discovered, the commander of the Moslem army was very impressed with her courage, and he allowed her to lead the attack against the fleeing Romans; they were defeated and the prisoners were all released. In another battle in Ajnadin, Khawla's spear broke, and her mare was killed, and she found herself a prisoner. But she was astonished to find that the Romans attacked the women camp and captured several of them. Their leader gave the prisoners to his commanders, and ordered Khawla to be moved into his tent. She was furious, and decided that to die is more honorable than living in disgrace. She stood among the other women, and called them to fight for their freedom and honor or die. They took the tents' poles and pegs and attacked the Roman guards, keeping a formation of a tight circle, as she told them. Khawla led the attack, killed the first guard with her pole, with the other women following her. According to Al Wakidi, they managed to kill 30 Roman soldiers, five of whom were killed by Khawla herself, including the soldier who wanted to rape her. She was a brunette, tall, slim and of great beauty, and she was also a distinguished poet.

But after the Moslem archers disobeyed their orders and began deserting their high ground believing victory was at hand, the tide of the battle changed, and it appeared that defeat was imminent. When this occurred, Nusaybah entered the battle, carrying a sword and shield. She shielded Muhammad from the arrows of the enemy, and received several wounds while fighting. She was highly praised by Muhammad on her courage and heroism. During the battle her son was wounded and she cut off the leg of the aggressor.

*Tanit is a Phoenician lunar goddess, worshiped as the patron goddess at Carthage. Her shrine excavated at Sarepta in southern Phoenicia (Carthage) revealed an inscription that identified her for the first time in her homeland (Phoenicia of the Levant) and related her securely to the Phoenician goddess Astarte/Ashtart. In Egyptian, her name means Land of Neith, Neith being a war goddess. Long after the fall of Carthage, Tanit is still venerated in North Africa under the Latin name of Juno Caelestis, for her identification with the Roman goddess Juno. Hvidberg-Hansen (Danish professor of Semitic philology), notes that Tanit is sometimes depicted with a lion's head, showing her warrior quality. In modern times the name, with the spelling "Tanith", has been used as a female given name, both for real people and, more frequently, in occult fiction. From the 5th century BC  onwards, Tanit is associated with that of Ba`al Hammon. She is given the epithet pene baal ("face of Baal") and the title rabat, the female form of rab (chief).

They soon find that they have worsened the situation, for, with every drop of blood that is spilled from Raktabija, he reproduces a clone of himself.  The battlefield becomes increasingly filled with his duplicates.&lt;ref&gt;D. Kinsley p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  Durga, in need of help, summons Kāli to combat the demons.  It is said, in some versions, that the Goddess Durga actually assumes the form of Goddess Kāli at this time. Kali destroys Raktabija by sucking the blood from his body and putting the many Raktabija duplicates in her gaping mouth. Pleased with her victory, Kali then dances on the field of battle, stepping on the corpses of the slain. Her consort Shiva lies among the dead beneath her feet, a representation of Kali commonly seen in her iconography as ''Daksinakali''.
* Other warrior goddesses include [[Chamunda]] ("the killer of demon Chanda and Munda") and the goddess group [[Matrikas]] ("Mothers").
*[[Vishpala]] (in ''The [[Rigveda]]'') is a warrior queen who, after having lost a leg in battle had an iron prosthesis made. Afterwards, she returned to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acpoc.org/library/1976_05_015.asp|title=A Brief Review of the History of Amputations and Prostheses Earl E.

'''Los Angeles Pop Art''' (also known as LA Pop Art) is an American company, founded by Joseph Leibovic, headquartered in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. The company creates text based artwork, entirely drawn by hand, also known as [[Micrography]].
By using entire movie scripts, complete song lyrics and manuscripts, Los Angeles Pop Art creates images out of the text that tell the story of that specific image.

The portfolio of designs are used for the manufacture of a number of products, which include wall art, apparel, tote bags and aprons. These products are sold online in numerous stores as well as in traditional brick and mortar retailers. The portfolio is also licensed out to partner companies for the manufacture of a wide range of products that include everything from stickers to beach towels.&lt;ref name="lapa"&gt;[http://www.lapopart.com "Los Angeles Pop Art"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 founder Joseph Leibovic was living in [[Israel]] when he stumbled upon the [[Micrography]] style of art while watching street artists, in the mystical town of Tzvat. The idea of Americanizing this style of art, by creating posters of classic films out of entire scripts, and music icons out of their legendary lyrics, was matured over the following 9 years. It wasn’t until Joseph moved back to Los Angeles, in 2004, that the idea was finally brought to life and Los Angeles Pop Art was founded.&lt;ref name="lapa" /&gt;

Los Angeles Pop Art has worked with some of the biggest names in music and film creating pieces for The Bob Marley Estate, Godfather, Rocky, Nirvana and many more A+ properties.&lt;ref name="lapa" /&gt;

The work developed at Los Angeles Pop Art has been featured in top magazines such as Playboy, Rolling Stone, Maxim and Stuff, as well as in top rated TV and films like [https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-find-the-t-shirts-that-Jesse-Pinkman-wears-on-Breaking-Bad Breaking Bad], Weeds, The Sopranos, The Girls Next Door, Workaholics and Battle: Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="widget"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elec.widgetinlife.com/la-pop-art-made-its-way-into-the-maxim-magazine-list-of-100-ways-to-rock-the-holidays/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510093236/http://elec.widgetinlife.com/la-pop-art-made-its-way-into-the-maxim-magazine-list-of-100-ways-to-rock-the-holidays/ |archivedate=2014-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stuff, December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"List of 100 ways to Rock the Holidays", Maxim, December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="powells"&gt;http://www.powells.com/biblio?show=TRADE%20PAPER:USED:9780312330590:7.95&amp;page=excerpt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="electronspy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://android.electronspy.com/LA-Pop-Art-will-go-to-Maxim-Magazine-list-of-100-Ways-to-Rock-the-Holidays/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130123035403/http://android.electronspy.com/LA-Pop-Art-will-go-to-Maxim-Magazine-list-of-100-Ways-to-Rock-the-Holidays/ |archivedate=2013-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popartportfolio.com/maxim&lt;/ref&gt;

A Ronald Reagan design, recreating President [[Ronald Reagan]]’s face out of his famous "[[Tear down this wall!]]" speech, given at the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in [[Germany]], was created by Los Angeles Pop Art in 2005. This piece of art was accepted by the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] into the Official Presidential Art Collection. The artwork is currently on display in the Lobby of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in [[Simi Valley]], [[California]].&lt;ref name="ronald" /&gt;

A partnership with [[Vivendi Games]], in 2006, regarding the release of [[Scarface: The World Is Yours]] video game, led Los Angeles Pop Art to create an exclusive poster to be used as a pre-order gift by [[Vivendi Games]], in order to assist in the pre-ordering of the game. The poster consisted in depicting an iconic film scene, using [[micrography]], with the original film script.&lt;ref name="powells" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Frank.

[[Image:Ludic Interfaces Example.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Student experiment in Interface Design developed at UP Valencia]]
A '''ludic interface''' is a type of [[interface (computing)|computer interface]]. In the field of [[human–computer interaction]] (HCI), the term '''ludic Interfaces''' describes a discipline that focuses on [[user interface]]s that are inherently "playful". This field of interface research and design draws on concepts introduced by Dutch historian and cultural theorist [[Johan Huizinga]] in the book [[Homo Ludens (book)|Homo Ludens]] ("Man the Player" or "Playing Man").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Huizinga
  | first = Johan
  | title = Homo ludens. Vom Ursprung der Kultur im Spiel
  | publisher = Rowohlt Verlag
  | year = 1994 (orig. 1938)
  | isbn = 3-499-55435-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Huizinga's work is considered an important contribution to the development of [[game studies]].

The various tools and concepts associated with ludic interface development differ from mainstream technological systems that employ human computer interfacing and interaction. Ludic interfaces tend to be  more playful, are [[user-generated]] and user-driven, flexible, low-cost and [[cooperative]]. Such interfaces are often experimental and draw upon methods and knowledge from [[video game design]],  [[interactive media]], [[modding]] cultures, media conversion, and [[social networks|social networking]]. The goal of ludic interface design is to create interfacing technology that offers ease of use and is inherently playful.

==Core concept==
At its core, "ludic interfaces" is a subcategory of interfaces in general. The notion is not restricted to electronics or human–computer interaction, even if the terminology was developed in respect to digital technology. Various authors suggest to use the term "ludic interfaces" for non-digital phenomena, e.g. architectural facades, skins, wearable computers, media art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Sommerer, Christa/ King,  Dorothée/ Mignonneau
  | first = Laurent
  | title = Interface Cultures: Artistic Aspects of Interaction
  | publisher = Transcript Verlag
  | year = 2008
  | isbn = 3899428846}}
&lt;/ref&gt; "Ludic Interfaces" is also a Masters programme development on a European level. It is the title of a European collaboration in creating a network of academic institutions and of world leading media centres to investigate, design and test publicly shared digital content. The programme development is a joint project by the University of Potsdam, Universidad Politécnica de Valencia, Universität für künstlerische und industrielle Gestaltung in Linz, and by the [[University of Salford]] in Greater [[Manchester]].

==History==

Ludic interface design was first defined in 2002 by William Gaver, in "Designing for Homo Ludens",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  | last = Gaver
  | first = William
  | title = Designing for Homo Ludens
  | journal = I3 Magazine
  |date=June 2002}}
&lt;/ref&gt; expanded in a later article in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Gaver
 | first=William

 | editor2-last=Löwgren

 | publisher=Springer
 | year=2009
 | chapter=Designing for Homo Ludens, Still.
 | pages=163–178
 | location=London
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was revisited in 2008 by [[ISEA International|International Symposium on Electronic Art]]) curators Gunalan Nadarajan and Vladimir Todorović to describe a panel section of ISEA2008 in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Nadarajan
  | first = Gunalan
  | title = ISEA2008 Conference Proceedings
  | publisher = ISEA2008 Pte Ltd
  | year = 2008
  | isbn = 978-981-08-0768-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced with the aim of counterbalancing the tendency of "infantilization of play" and stressing the "complicities between technology and pleasure".

In the same year a group of game artists and scholars at Leuphana University in Lueneburg started lecturing and writing about the theory of Ludic Interfaces and applied for a European grant to develop a Masters programme in Ludic Interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;An interview about Ludic Interfaces by Digital Arts and Architecture Lab with Mathias Fuchs can be found on http://inm.de/index.cfm?siteid=190&amp;CFID=3969946&amp;CFTOKEN=5bbbde746c0b288f-653F9F40-A892-243B-D200A47407920729&amp;jsessionid=80308ba15754$1E$2F$3&lt;/ref&gt; The application was successful and the development has successfully been completed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://mt.sh.se/?p=576
 | title = Future Forms and Applications of Ludic Interfaces
 | author= Arina Stoenescu
 | date=August 19, 2009 &lt;!-- at 3:47 pm --&gt; 
 | accessdate = 2009-11-19}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "ludic interfaces" has also historical roots in artistic practice and analysis of interfaces (cf. Christa Sommerer, Laurent Mignonneau),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Sommerer, Christa/ Lakhmi, Jain/ Mignonneau
  | first = Laurent
  | title = The Art and Science of Interface and Interaction Design
  | publisher = Springer Verlag
  | year = 2008
  | isbn = 978-3-540-79869-9}}
&lt;/ref&gt; the notion of "playfulness" as a design and arts strategy, or the "Ludic Society" arts organisation.

==Examples==
{{original research|section|date=August 2014}}
[[Image:Ludic Interfaces Kilby Tarot 200.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Ludic interface experiment by student Jess Kilby from University of Salford, using RFID tag technology for a digital tarot reader.]][[Image:Mathias Fuchs postvinyl resfest live.jpg|right|200px|thumbnail|Ludic interface by Mathias Fuchs, using Djing tools in combination with a game engine: "postvinyl"]]

Jess Kilby’s RFID Tarot table consists of a hand-painted black table with letters and signs drawn upon it, and a white set of cards containing radio-frequency tags. The installation is an example for a ludic set-up where the interface contributes significantly to the magic of the game. Hidden information within the blank cards allows the RFID reader, a digital tarot reader automaton, to interpret information hidden from the human eye. Kilby’s system interprets the information contained within the cards and displays videos of a frightening future. The game could certainly be implemented as a Flash simulation or be built for a 2D monitor display system, but without the materiality of the ludic interface, without the special lighting, and without the artist dressed in a fortune teller’s dress the game would not work at all. The same holds true for [[Mary Flanagan]]’s “Giant Joystick”. It is the interface with all its materiality, erotic connotations and haptic features which makes the ludic installation work so well. Ludic interfaces can also facilitate play in a musical sense. The "postvinyl" performance, originally commissioned by futuresonic festival [[Manchester]] in 2004 recontextualizes a computer game in a performance environment.

'''Mezzotint''' is a [[printmaking]] process of the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] family, technically a [[drypoint]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mezzotint|title=Definition of MEZZOTINT|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[Grayscale|tonal method]] to be used, enabling half-tones to be produced without using line- or dot-based techniques like [[hatching]], cross-hatching or [[stipple]]. Mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening a metal plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth, called a "rocker".  In printing, the tiny pits in the plate hold the ink when the face of the plate is wiped clean. A high level of quality and richness in the print can be achieved.

==History==
[[Image:Ludwig von Siegen - Portrait of Amelie Elisabeth von Hessen.jpg|thumb|The first known mezzotint, by [[Ludwig von Siegen]], 1642]]
The mezzotint printmaking method was invented by the German amateur artist [[Ludwig von Siegen]] (1609–{{circa|1680}}). His earliest mezzotint print dates to 1642 and is a portrait of [[Countess Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau-Münzenberg]].  This was made by working from light to dark. The rocker seems to have been invented by [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], a famous cavalry commander in the [[English Civil War]], who was the next to use the process, and took it to England.  Sir [[Peter Lely]] saw the potential for using it to publicise his portraits, and encouraged a number of Dutch printmakers to come to England.  [[Godfrey Kneller]] worked closely with [[John Smith (engraver)|John Smith]], who is said to have lived in his house for a period; he created about 500 mezzotints, some 300 copies of portrait paintings.  

The process was especially widely used in England from the eighteenth century, to reproduce portraits and other paintings.  Since the mid-nineteenth century it has been relatively little used. [[Robert Kipniss]] and [[Peter Ilsted]] are two notable 20th-century exponents of the technique; [[M. C. Escher]] also made eight mezzotints.

British mezzotint collecting was a great craze from about 1760 to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Great Crash]] of 1929, also spreading to America.  The main area of collecting was British portraits; hit oil paintings from the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] were routinely, and profitably, reproduced in mezzotint throughout this period, and other mezzotinters reproduced older portraits of historical figures, or if necessary, made them up.  The favourite period to collect was roughly from 1750 to 1820, the great period of the British portrait.  There were two basic styles of collection: some concentrated on making a complete collection of material within a certain scope, while others aimed at perfect condition and quality (which declines in mezzotints after a relatively small number of impressions are taken from a plate), and in collecting the many "[[State (printmaking)|proof states]]" which artists and printers had obligingly provided for them from early on.  Leading collectors included [[William Eaton, 2nd Baron Cheylesmore]] and the Irishman [[John Chaloner Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, 134–137 and 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark to light method==
This became the most common method.  The whole surface (usually) of a [[metal]], usually copper, plate is roughened evenly, manually with a rocker, or mechanically.  If the plate were printed at this point it would show as solid black. The image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the burnishing tool. A burnisher has a smooth, round end, which flattens the minutely protruding points comprising the roughened surface of the metal printing plate.  Areas smoothed completely flat will not hold ink at all; such areas will print "white," that is, without ink.  By varying the degree of smoothing, mid-tones between black and white can be created, hence the name ''mezzo-tinto'' which is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "[[half-tone]]" or "half-painted".  This is called working from "dark to light", or the "subtractive" method.

==Light to dark method==
[[Image:6409 bassenge2vaillerant.jpg|thumb|left|Early mezzotint by Vaillerant, Siegen's assistant or tutor. Young man reading, with statue of Cupid. Probably made using light to dark technique. 27.5 &amp;times; 21.3 cm]]
Alternatively, it is possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively, where the darker parts of the image are to be.  This is called working from "light to dark", or the "additive" method.  The first mezzotints by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] were made in this way. Especially in this method, the mezzotint can be combined with other intaglio techniques, such as engraving, on areas of the plate not roughened, or even with the dark to light method.

==Printing==
Printing the finished plate is the same for either method, and follows the normal way for an intaglio plate; the whole surface is inked, the ink is then wiped off the surface to leave ink only in the pits of the still rough areas below the original surface of the plate. The plate is put through a high-pressure printing press next to a sheet of paper, and the process repeated.

Because the pits in the plate are not deep, only a small number of top-quality impressions (copies) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out.  Perhaps only one or two hundred really good impressions can be taken.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Detailed technique==
Plates can be mechanically roughened; one way is to rub fine metal filings over the surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller the grain of the surface. Special roughening tools called 'rockers' have been in use since at least the eighteenth century. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade in the shape of a shallow arc, with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the [[copper]]. The plate is then moved – either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference – and then rocked in another pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black.

==Tone==
Mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the plate with [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], ''burnisher'' and ''scraper'' allows fine gradations in tone to be developed. The scraper is a triangular ended tool, and the burnisher has a smooth round end – not unlike many spoon handles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22277">'''Modular art''' is art created by joining together standardized units ([[Modular design|module]]s) to form larger, more complex compositions. In some works the units can be subsequently moved, removed and added to – that is, ''modulated'' – to create a new work of art, different from the original or ensuing configurations.

== Origins ==
Historically, alterable objects of art have existed since the [[Renaissance]], for example, in the [[Triptych]] "[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]" by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] or in the so-called "alterable [[altarpiece]]s", such as the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] by [[Matthias Grünewald]], or [[Albrecht Dürer|Albrecht Dürer's]] [[Paumgartner altarpiece]], where changing motifs could be revised in accord with the changing themes of the ecclesiastical calendar.

== 20th century ==
Beginning in the first half of the 20th century, a number of contemporary artists sought to incorporate [[kinetic art|kinetic techniques]] into their work in an attempt to overcome what they saw as the predominantly static nature of art. [[Alexander Calder|Alexander Calder's]] mobiles are among the most widely known demonstrations of physical dynamism in the visual arts, in which form has the potential to continually vary through perpetual motion, sometimes even without the agency of the human hand. [[Jean Tinguely|Jean Tinguely's]] efforts to create a self-destructive art machine constitute perhaps the ultimate expression of art's mutability, in this case by taking the form of its total eradication. [[Victor Vasarely]] postulated in his ''Manifest Jaune'' in 1955 in Paris that works of art should feature the properties of being multiplicable and repeatable in series. More recently, the notion that visual art need not be conceived solely in terms of perpetually fixed objects is embodied in performance and installation art by virtue of their unfolding and temporary qualities.&lt;ref&gt;See "Modularity in the arts" in [[Modularity]].&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Industrial design and architecture ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Image:Pfarrkirche Liesing - Erwin Hauer Design 3.JPG|thumb|alt=An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.|An architectural screen by Erwin Hauer.]][[Modularity]] enters the modern artistic repertory largely through the disciplines of industrial design and architecture. Belgian architect [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] led a team of countrymen in creating one of the first modular product systems in their Cubex kitchen series of 1932. The series consisted of standardized and industrially produced components that could be combined and arrayed in limitless combinations to accommodate almost any size kitchen. New York designer [[Gilbert Rohde]] crafted several lines of modular casework for the [[Herman Miller (office equipment)|Herman Miller Corporation]] in the 1930s and 40s; like De Koninck, Rohde standardized the units in dimensions, materials and configurations to facilitate mass production and interchangeability. His Executive Office Group (EOG) line, launched in 1942, was a similarly ground-breaking systems approach to office furniture. Just a year before [[Eero Saarinen]] and [[Charles Eames]] had jointly produced a suite of modular domestic furniture for the Red Lion Company, a result of a competition held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. In 1950 Herman Miller brought out the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100526040623/http://www.hermanmiller.com/Products/Eames-Desk-and-Storage-Units EAS Storage Unit series] by Charles and Ray Eames, a very successful modular shelving and wall unit system that remains in production today.

The module enjoys a long history in the realm of architecture. In antiquity architects utilized the module primarily as a unit of measurement guiding the proportions of plan and elevation. The Roman author and architect Vitruvius deployed the modular method in his descriptions of the classical orders and the composition of buildings in his treatise ''Ten Books on Architecture'', the only complete text on architecture to survive from antiquity. Architects of the Renaissance perpetuated the Vitruvian system in their resurrection of the classical orders, a tradition which continues to the present day. Among modern architects, the module is frequently employed as a design and planning tool.

=== Modular constructivism ===
{{main|Modular Constructivism}}
Architecture and modular sculpture intersected starting in the 1950s in the work of [[Norman Carlberg]], [[Erwin Hauer]] and Malcolm Leland. All three received commissions to design perforated architectural screens built out of repetitive modular motives cast in concrete. Non-structural, the screens were used on building exteriors to divide space, filter light and create visual interest. Their work has come to be described as [[Modular Constructivism]], reflecting both its compositional methodology and its architectural context. Each created stand-alone modular-themed sculptures into the 1960s and after as well.

=== Modularity in the fine arts===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
[[Robert Rauschenberg]]'s [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ondahalfoster/2546134482/ "White Painting"] of 1951; consisting of just four equal white squares, with its geometry of interlocking forms, is among the earliest statements of modularity as an autonomous subject of art. Rauschenberg explored this theme that same year in a three- and seven-panel format; the linear array of rectangular panels in these versions suggests their potentially infinite replication.  The cool abstraction of these canvases presages the emergence of modularity as a full-fledged topic of [[Minimalist art]] in the 1960s. [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Dan Flavin]] and [[Donald Judd]] are among this school's most prolific exponents during the period. In particular, the work of Smith is key to understanding the transformation of modularity from a compositional and production tool into a broadly investigated artistic theme in its own right.

[[Image:Minneapolis14.jpg|thumb|alt=Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, Minnesota.|Tony Smith, sculpture. Minneapolis, MN.]]Smith began his career as an architectural designer. To further his education he apprenticed himself on some projects by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] for a couple of years starting in 1938. From Wright he learned to utilize modular systems in generating architectural designs in two-dimensional plans as well as in three-dimensional applications, such as the development of building sections and interior built-ins. As an architect, Wright himself was part of a centuries-old continuum stretching back through [[Vitruvius]] to Greco-Roman antiquity in which the module was utilized to proportion built and sculpted form. In the case of Wright, the interest in modular design also may have derived from his familiarity with [[tatami|modular practice in traditional Japanese architecture]].

Wright's Hanna House of 1937 is a clear example of the master's facility with modern modular design in multiple dimensions. Its striking angled forms are built up from the individual hexagonal modules that define the floor plan and various vertical elements. Wright's use of the hexagon here is by no means an arbitrary aesthetic choice, but an example of how he rooted his architecture in nature by drawing from its forms and principles – the interlocking hexagonal cells of the bee's honeycomb being nature's most perfect representation of modular design. Not surprisingly, this project is sometimes  referred to as the "Honeycomb House".

Smith would employ the hexagon and other elemental geometries in his own architectural practice and again in the sculpture he began to fabricate in the early 1960s. Freed from the programmatic and extensive structural requirements of his architectural work, Smith's sculptures are three-dimensional extrusions of modular form with no ostensible pragmatic purpose beyond aesthetic contemplation.

Significantly, Smith himself did not manually fabricate the final version of his sculptures. Instead, he outsourced their production to skilled ironworkers in foundries and industrial facilities, who worked off his drawings and models to manufacture the designs. In part this reflects Smith's training as an architect, who customarily designs and documents but does not construct his art. It further reinforces the idea of modular art as a [[generative art|generative system]] in which the arrangement of pre-determined formal units – rather than wholesale imaginative invention – defines the creative act. Finally, it is consistent with the notion implicit in modularity that the supply of modules in a modular system must be infinite, that is, that they be industrially rather than artisanally produced, for the system to be realized. (Bees in a honeycomb are essentially operating as an industrial enterprise insofar as the production of cells is without end.)

The work of Smith and the minimalist school constitute the most far-ranging exploration of modularity in art before the millennium. However, neither it nor the explorations of movable and alterable art in the preceding centuries synthesized the two central features of modular art. Mobiles and other kinetic pieces were not modular, and the modular work of the mid-century Minimalist artists was, with a few exceptions, not changeable.

== Theory in the 21st century ==
[[Image:The Couple 1.JPG|thumb|alt=The Impossibility to Make it|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple.]][[Image:The Couple 2.JPG|thumb|alt=The Possibility to Make it|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 1.]][[Image:The Couple 3.JPG|thumb|alt=A Never-ending Story|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 2.]][[Image:The Couple 4.JPG|thumb|alt=Inside-out and Upside-down|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 3.]][[Image:The Couple 5.JPG|thumb|alt=No Way to Return|Leda Luss Luyken :ModulArt, The Couple, modulation 4.]]

=== Co-creativity ===
A school of thought coming out of the United States emphasizes modular art's alignment with the [[post-industrial]] character of 21st century culture and its contrast with traditional notions of art.&lt;ref&gt;[Rattner, Donald]. "A Comparison of Conventional and Modular Art" in ''[http://issuu.com/art-rethought/docs/art_catalogue?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed A.R.T. Catalogue v2.0]''. New York: lulu.com, 2010. Pp. C-1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  Core characteristics of post-industrialism, as largely defined by the theorist [[Daniel Bell]] in his 1973 book ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society'', include the emergence of a service economy in place of a manufacturing one; the social and economic pre-eminence of the creative, professional and technical classes; the central place of theoretical knowledge as a font of innovation; the strong influence of technology on daily life; and high levels of urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Daniel. ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society''. New York: Harper Colophon Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modular art appears to synchronize perfectly with several of these criteria. For example, its manual changeability opens up the possibility of co-creative art, in which the collector or user collaborates with the originating modular artist to jointly determine the appearance of the work of art. This presupposes the existence of creative people capable of and interested in serving such a role – a demographic evolution that was already underway in Bell's time and that has since been studied in works like Richard Florida's ''Rise of the Creative Class'' (2002).&lt;ref&gt;Florida, Richard. ''The Rise of the Creative Class and How It's Transforming Work, Leisure and Everyday Life''. Basic Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Co-creation]] is closely associated with [[mass customization]], a production model that combines the opportunity for individual personalization with mass production. Modular art and mass customization share a commonality in their synthesis of two opposing qualities. On the one hand, as previously stated the very concept of modularity implies a limitless supply of identical modules such as only industrial production can provide; on the other hand, the ability of the individual to re-arrange these modules in the work of art based on aesthetic criteria re-injects a subjective and purely human dimension into the creative act.

Mass customization is itself only made possible with the advent of computers and a type of software known as a [[configurator]]. A configurator is a software tool used by the buyer to configure a product from the options made available by the vendor. Applied to the purpose of composing a work of modular art onscreen, it can greatly facilitate the design of a modular assembly by allowing the user to study multiple design options more quickly and in far greater depth than by using analog methods. Once the design is established a computer file is then sent over the air to a manufacturing facility where robotically controlled equipment produces the object according to its specifications. Not only does this computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) allow for the customization of mass-produced objects, it also enables a much higher level of precision and fit – qualities critical for modules to be physically joined together. Bell's identification of technology as a central axis of post-industrial life is underscored in the intertwining of the digital with the physical realization of modular art.

=== The de- and re-constructive approach in Europe ===
In Europe, where the 1960s Minimalist school of modular art was often seen as a principally American phenomenon, the discussion of modularity often focuses on its changeability. For example, the mutability of art is a core principle of [[Arte Povera]], a contemporaneous movement that emerged in Italy which holds that works of art "should not be seen as fixed entities", but as objects of change and movement to "include time and space in a new manner. At stake is the issue of transferring the phenomenology of human experience" into the arts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monopol-magazin.com/magazine/2009/09/interview-carolyn-christov-bakargiev Interview with Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev.] See also: Christov-Bakargiev, Carolyn. ''Arte Povera (Themes &amp; Movements)''. New York: Phaidon Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the artist [[Leda Luss Luyken]] has produced modular paintings, composed of movable painted panels set in steel frames. Luss Luyken has dubbed her work "ModulArt".&lt;ref&gt;The term "ModulArt" was first mentioned in 1975 in a German arts encyclopedia as "a form of art […] made by movable elements that […] transfer the object into a new state of being by moving their variable parts" in: Ludewig, Werner (Ed.). ''Kunst – Literatur – Musik, Daten und Fakten''. Lexikon-Institut Bertelsmann, 1975, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work, changing the configuration of a modular painting constitutes a form of motion, offering the spectator alternative views and alternative interpretations, and thus aligning the work more closely than a static object to the dynamism of physical human experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/ModulArt&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian and theorist [[Denys Zacharopoulos]] called this "a new way of motion in painting".&lt;ref&gt;von Kap-herr, Georg (Ed.). ''ModulArt''. Bobingen (Germany), 2008, pp. 6-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of modular art allows the user to de-compose and to re-compose a work of art that is already completed by re-arranging its parts, thus providing numerous possibilities for ever newer pictures not yet imagined. The original painting can be re-contextualized ad libitum and ad infinitum.

== Modular artists and their work ==

===Visual artists===
Working in the 1950-60s in Manchester (UK), American artist [[Mitzi Cunliffe]] developed sculptures consisting of multiple blocks about twelve inches square which she put together in a variety of combinations to give a sculptured effect on a large scale. She referred to them as ''modular sculptures''. The University of Manchester and the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST) acquired some of these works, although there are no references to them in published accounts of her work.&lt;ref&gt;Letter dated 19 December 08 by Prof. E.G. Wedell, Manchester (UK), friend and landlord of Mitzi Cunliffe in Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sculptor and ceramicist Malcolm Leland designed in 1954 a similar [http://www.mocad.org/store/Vessel_LS_Fountain.html modular sculpture system] based on a single 23-inch tall module that could be stacked vertically by means of a centering pin; the module has a generally biomorphic, curvilinear outline that yields an undulating silhouette when multiple modules are placed on top of each other. The technique of stacking repetitive elements in the round recalls [[Endless Column|Brancusi's "Endless Column"]] of 1938.

Starting in the 1970s, Leland's contemporary Norman Carlberg produced groups of [http://www.francisfrost.com/carlbergprint.html square framed prints] which he placed together on a wall in a tight grid, each print conceived as an independent module. The viewer is then invited to rotate or reposition them to generate new composite images. The abstract quality of the prints enhanced the creative possibilities of their re-orientation insofar as they are non-directional and geometrically inter-related.

Greek-born [[conceptual artist]] [[Leda Luss Luyken]], who was initially trained as an architect, has been exploring [[modularity]] in the medium of painting since the 1990s. In her work standardized canvas panels are mounted as modules onto a steel frame within which they can be moved and rotated.

In the U.S. Moshé Elimelech creates what he has called [https://web.archive.org/web/20100107101439/http://www.mosheart.com/cubes/index.html "Cubic Constructions"]. These are multiple groupings of approximately three-inch cubes set inside pockets in a framed shadow box. On each cube he applies paint in fields of bright color and abstract pattern with precise, controlled brush strokes. Like Carlsberg, Elimelech then invites the viewer to reposition any or all of the cubes to display one of their six sides, each of which is painted in a different pattern. Exhibiting since the 1980s, Elimelech shows primarily in California galleries, and has work represented in several museum design stores as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807164738/http://www.mosheart.com/bio/index.html# |archive-date=2003-08-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another portfolio of interactive modular art comes out of [http://www.s4aa.com Studio for A.R.T. and Architecture], a New York-based firm headed by Donald Rattner. Rattner has designed modular art in the media of wall sculpture, rotational paintings, tapestries, artist's wallpapers and artist's books. To bring his work and those of other "modulartists" to the marketplace, Rattner founded [http://www.art-rethought.com A.R.T. (art-rethought)], an art storefront focused on co-creative and modular work. In his writings Rattner has emphasized the post-industrial aspect of the most recent trends in modular art, coining the term "New Industrialism" to denote mass customization, production on demand, open innovation, co-creative design, tele-fabrication, robotics and other computer-driven technologies that are re-defining how things are made in the global marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/the_studio_portfolio/docs/studio_portfolio_-_art?viewMode=magazine&amp;mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true.

===Composers===
Modularity in music can be seen as bringing two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting:{{Clarify|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--Painting? What has this to do with music?--&gt; [[Variation (music)|variation]] of a theme and [[Moving image|movement]] of and within a picture. For this very reason the contemporary composer Minas Borboudakis has dedicated the third part of his trilogy ROAI III for piano and electronics to the modular methodology.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Italian composer and arts theoretician [[Stefano Vagnini]] has developed a theory of [[Open source|open-source composition]] based on modular aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;Vagnini, Stafano, ''The Modular Method in Music, Views of an Open Art'', English and Italian, 161 pp, Rome: Falcon Valley Music, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a musical work of art being something closed, limited and immobile disappears in favor of a process of numerous aggregations that allow a composition to become infinite in principle. Several such compositions were performed in Europe, South America, Asia and in North America and discussed through conferences in Europe. The approach is being academically discussed at the [[University of West Georgia]] and the Carrollton Cultural Arts Centre in the USA. Writer, painter, and art theorist Gian Ruggero Manzoni described the modularity of Vagnini's compositions  as “circular like the existence, his works are not finished, but merely stimulus for new voices”. &lt;ref&gt;Gian Ruggero Manzoni, in: Vagnini, Stefano:'' SalmodieSubliminali'', Campanotto Editions, Udine, 2007, pp 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49069">'''New Primitivism''' ([[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]: Novi primitivizam, Нови примитивизам) was a [[subculture|subcultural]] movement established in [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] in March 1983. It primarily used music, along with subversive comedy on radio and television as its form of expression. Its protagonists and followers called themselves the '''new primitives'''. 

Even though the movement initially encompassed several bands in the city of Sarajevo, including some such as [[Plavi orkestar]] that quickly distanced themselves from it, the movement predominantly functioned as a banner that summarizes and encompasses the work of two rock bands [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] and [[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] as well as ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'' radio segment that eventually grew into a television sketch show, the discourse of New Primitivism was seen as primarily irreverent and humorous.

The movement officially disbanded sometime in 1987, although the bands and television show continued up until the breakup of Yugoslavia.

==Characteristics==
Basing itself on the spirit of the Bosnian ordinary populace outside of the cultural mainstream, the movement was credited for introducing the jargon of Sarajevo [[mahala]]s (brimming with slang and Turkish [[loanword]]s) into the official Yugoslav public scene. Many of the New Primitivism songs and sketches involve stories of small people — coalminers, petty criminals, street hoodlums, provincial girls, etc. — being placed in unusual and absurd situations. There are comparisons between ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' and the New Primitives' methods, as they share the short sketch form and utilize [[Surreal humour|absurdity]] as means of eliciting laughs from an audience. The embodiment of New Primitivism is a youth who both reads challenging works such as [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', but also does not mind getting into fistfights. The movement got established as a Sarajevan reaction to the [[New wave music|New wave]] and [[Punk rock|Punk]] movements that were sweeping the alternative music scene in Yugoslavia. Some of the movement's most notable traits were promoting and popularizing Sarajevan street jargon and slang that was not well known outside of Sarajevo, extolling the mentality and culture of the Sarajevan [[Mahala]], depicting local fringe characters such as petty criminals, alcoholics, lesser-known pop cultural figures, blue-collar workers and local streets hoodlums. Because of this, the movement was concidered locally patriotic and an eclectic expression of Sarajevan urban culture.

The movement's protagonists had a specific view of New Primitivism. Perhaps the most prominent of them, [[Nele Karajlić]], explicated it as being "created within clearly defined historical coordinates, both spatially and temporally, at the precise midpoint between the spot where [[Gavrilo Princip]] [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] Archduke [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] in June 1914 and the spot where the Olympic flame was [[1984 Winter Olympics|lit]] in February 1984 while temporally, it took place sometime during the period between [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s death in May 1980 and the beginning of the [[Agrokomerc Affair]] in 1987" and seeing it as "resistance to any form of establishment - cultural, social, and political - not just the rock'n'roll one that dominated Sarajevo at the time with so-called 'dinosaur' bands like [[Bijelo Dugme]] and [[Indexi]], which the new primitives held in contempt to a certain extent".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s1B5rt_1CU Glavni tok];RTV Pink, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt; The movement's dominant method of social and cultural critique was to fully localize the narrative to Sarajevo, and use local urban legends, cultural and social phenomena and living fringe characters as catalysts for painting a wider political picture. In doing so, the movement became both a rigidly local expressional form that gave a platform to the language, culture and myths of the Sarajevan streets, while also breaking out into the wider Yugoslav arena. A major characteristic of the movement was the adoption of pseudonyms by all its leading figures, which tended to be either comical in nature or based on the semantics of nicknames that have always been very prevelent in Sarajevo. The main reason for this was so that none of the members could be ethnically identified. The second reason was to give a platform to the stylization of nicknames that was prominent in Sarajevo - a form of local patriotism and self-mockery. 

The movement's "chief ideologue" [[:sr:Goran Marić (menadžer)|Malkolm Muharem]] referred to New Primitivism simply as "the first Sarajevan bullet to hit its target since Princip assassinated Ferdinand in 1914".

==Origin of the term==
The movement's name — New Primitivism — got introduced as a mock reaction to two early 1980s pop-culture movements: [[New Romanticism]] in the West and [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]] in the Yugoslav constituent republic of [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]]. On one hand, the term New Primitivism was a clear anti-reference to New Romantic, as the Sarajevo lads sought to be anything but romantic and sugarsweet while on the other hand, they also wanted to emphasize the stereotypes encountered in many popular Yugoslav jokes about Bosnians and Slovenians — the former portrayed as raw, unsophisticated, dim-witted, and openhearted, and the latter presented as stiff, cold, serious, distant, and calculated. In the artistic and expressional sense, New Primitivism was a reaction to the [[New wave music|New wave]] and [[Punk rock|Punk]] movements.

==History==
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, a generation of kids from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of [[Koševo (Sarajevo)|Koševo]], all born in the early to mid-1960s, was coming up. Raised within upper-middle-class families inhabiting post-[[World War II]] apartment buildings typical of communist Yugoslavia, their interests included music, football, and movies. They soon converged on music as their main activity and simultaneous with entering high school started forming bands despite possessing very limited musical skills. Most of their musical influences were found in [[Western world|Western]] popular culture — from early ones such as [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], [[Lou Reed]], the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], etc. to those found later on the emerging punk scene.

By early 1980, the kids were able to adapt a cellar at the 19 Fuada Midžića Street low-rise apartment building into a makeshift rehearsal space where they held band practices, [[chamber play]]s, even an odd [[fashion show]]. Initially very informal with irregular rehearsals and frequently changing lineups (often through swapping band members), by 1981 the bands — named [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] and [[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] — took on a more serious note. Adopting garage/punk rock sensibility, they started devoting more attention to songwriting and began playing small clubs around town. In parallel, from May 1981, some of the kids from both bands got a chance to collaborate on ''[[Top lista nadrealista]]'', a comedy segment on ''Primus'' radio show that aired weekly, Saturday mornings, on [[Radio Sarajevo]]'s channel two.

===Forming a movement===
The idea to create a movement as an umbrella entity encompassing their entire activity had been tossed about for months during the second part of 1982 and early 1983 between the individuals in and around Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors — the band's manager [[Malkolm Muharem]], its main lyricist and mascot [[Elvis J. Kurtović]], and its singer [[Rizo Kurtović]].

Additional notable members of the movement included [[Nele Karajlić|dr. Nele Karajlić]], [[Sejo Sexon|mr. Sejo Sexon]], [[Dražen Ričl]], [[Boris Šiber]], [[Zenit Đozić]], and others from the Sarajevo neighbourhood of [[Koševo (Sarajevo)|Koševo]]. Along the way, individuals outside of the Koševo milieu, most notably [[Branko Đurić|Branko "Đuro" Đurić]], joined in and also became prominent. Despite being a bit older and not from the same neighbourhood, film director [[Emir Kusturica]] (who was already well-established with his award-winning movie ''[[Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?]]'') was an associate and friend of the crew; although his movies can not be directly associated with the movement, their spirit certainly shares some sentiment with New Primitivism. With the bands playing small demo gigs around the city, they encountered other up and coming rock bands such as [[Plavi orkestar]] and [[Crvena jabuka]] that also cultivated similar thematic narratives focused on stories of local small time characters, but would eventually move away from the aesthetic and turn towards the mainstream.  

The movement's wider unofficial unveiling was said have taken place at an Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors gig in Sarajevo's CEDUS club venue during early March 1983. Also playing the gig was Zabranjeno Pušenje. Influenced by movies like 1979's ''[[Quadrophenia (film)|Quadrophenia]]'' that portray the youth scene of London with subcultures like [[Mod (subculture)|mods]], [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]], and [[teddy boy]]s, the guys from Koševo tried to create their own local version of that.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iWhGnwGUT0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=121 Damar Show];Pink BH, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The formal introduction of the new entity changed nothing in the internal group dynamic as they all continued functioning like a neighbourhood gang of friends, but it gave the press something to latch onto and made it easier to market the bands outside of the city. By his own admission, Muharem used the movement "to create an impression to those in Belgrade and Zagreb that there's something more going on in Sarajevo than there actually is".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeGWqOo7uAI#t=484s Rockovnik - 24. episode Anarhija All over Bascarsija];RTS, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to music and comedy on radio, the lads decided to expand their modes of expression now that they functioned as a movement — attempting to come up with a clothing style to associate with New Primitivism. The movement's unofficial look was thus born with a démodé style consisting of waist tight [[bell-bottoms|bell-bottom pants]], plaid [[suit jacket]]s, thin golden necklace worn above the shirt, and pointy shoes (the so-called ''špicoke'') — similar to the 1970s [[leisure suit]] look — which the lads adopted from petty hoodlums and small-time smugglers and pickpockets seen around [[Baščaršija]] selling, though not wearing, clothing items such as [[Levi's]] 501 jeans that were either smuggled in from [[Italy]] or counterfeit locally in Yugoslavia. Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors especially embraced this throwback look, with young crowds soon showing up to their club gigs dressed this way. Meanwhile, Karajlić came up with the movement's unofficial creed: "Tuđe hoćemo, svoje nemamo" ("What's not ours, we want; because ours, we haven't got."), a parody on one of the often used political slogans of the communist period: "Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo." ("What's not ours, we don't want; ours, we won't give up on.").
{{quote box|quote=''During summer 1983, after getting back from an out-of-town gig somewhere, we went to our favourite [[kafana]] Dedan at [[Baščaršija]] where our friend [[Branko Đurić|Đuro]] told us about a journalist from [[:sh:Start (magazin)|Start]] looking for us to do an interview. We were convinced Đuro's fucking with us, but he insisted, telling us the guy had already looked for us at [[Televizija Sarajevo|TV Sarajevo]] (where of course no one ever heard of us), at [[Diskoton]] (where they were also clueless as to who we are), before finally resorting to asking about us from kafana to kafana and eventually ending up at Dedan, leaving a phone number with Đuro. This confirmed to us once more what we had already picked up on during our out-of-town gigs — that people outside of the city are taking our braggadocios and bombastic proclamations in the youth print about being the 'kings of Sarajevo' quite literally and quite seriously. In reality we were complete unknowns. Media outlets in Sarajevo didn't give two shits about us, but we noticed that our embellished stories found a receptive audience in youth print media from other Yugoslav cities. They especially lapped up our tales of this 'great new movement in Sarajevo called New Primitivism'.''&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/meteorski-uspon-elvisa-j-kurtovica/228133|title=Meteorski uspon Elvisa J.

One of the very first activities on the movement's behalf was writing an [[open letter]] to Sarajevo's own [[Goran Bregović]], the best known and the most established rock musician in Yugoslavia, who was at the moment going through a well-documented creative and commercial crisis with his band [[Bijelo Dugme]]'s [[Uspavanka za Radmilu M.|latest studio effort]] getting poor reviews and selling underwhelmingly, not to mention constant reports of infighting and vocalist [[Željko Bebek]]'s imminent departure. Dripping with jovial sarcasm and backhanded compliments, the new primitives' letter invited Bregović to join them, offering him a fresh start along with a creative reset.

===Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors get the ball rolling===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Elvis.j.kurtovic.jpg|335px|thumb|right|[[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] before a concert in [[Kulušić]], [[Zagreb]].]] --&gt;
[[Elvis J. Kurtović &amp; His Meteors]] were the first to establish a bit of a buzz on the scene. Promoted by Muharem, who in addition to the band's business side also handled many of its creative aspects, EJK&amp;HM were not only gigging in clubs around Sarajevo, but in 1983 also started playing clubs nationwide, in Belgrade ([[Studentski kulturni centar (Belgrade)|SKC]]), Zagreb ([[Kulušić]] and Lapidarij), Rijeka (Palah), Pula, etc., getting enthusiastic reactions from young club crowds everywhere. Though their sound was hardly original with straight covers of the [[Rolling Stones]], [[The Who]], etc. dominating the repertoire, EJK&amp;HM live shows were a unique mixture of rock'n'roll with elements of [[performance art]] and [[stand-up comedy]], full of youthful exuberance with Elvis J. Kurtović, the band's lyrics writer and mascot, constantly interacting with the crowd between songs. They mostly played student clubs with their promotional activities strictly limited to printed press.&lt;ref name="damar"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GnqP6kskh8 Elvis J. Kurtovic @ Damar]&lt;/ref&gt; Muharem would get them publicity by talking up New Primitivism and ensuring journalists from youth-oriented papers — ''[[Džuboks]]'' and ''Reporter'' from Belgrade, ''Polet'' from Zagreb, and ''[[Mladina]]'' from Ljubljana — have the 'right angle' for the story while the band members would contribute by providing colourful interviews and quotable sound bytes often delivered in form of a [[manifesto]].

In late July 1983, the fledgling band received a huge boost after ''[[:sh:Start (magazin)|Start]]'', a Yugoslavia-wide high-circulation weekly newsmagazine in the vein of ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Lui]]'', deployed its journalist [[Goran Gajić]] to Sarajevo for a story on the unconventional group.&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; Published as a two-page spread headlined "Meteorski uspon Elvisa J. Kurtovića" (Elvis J. Kurtović's Meteoric Rise) in a magazine that's circulated in 200,000 copies, the story was by far the biggest media exposure the band had gotten up to that point. Building upon talking points already well established and developed by Muharem and Kurtović through the country's youth print media, the ''Start'' piece was extremely affirmative and flattering for the EJK&amp;HM youngsters — proclaiming them to be "the next important thing in Yugoslav rock".&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; Along with a new batch of the band members' trademark off-the-wall soundbytes sprinkled throughout, the article also re-published — on Muharem's insistence despite Kurtović's apparent opposition&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; — their sarcastic open letter to Goran Bregović that thus got a much bigger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jergović|first=Miljenko|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/miljenko-jergovic/miljenko/255037|title=Iz vremena kada očevi nisu znali protiv koga to pjevaju njihova djeca|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=27 February 2017|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riding the wave of publicity generated by the ''Start'' piece, Muharem acted quickly in the fall of 1983 by ambitiously booking Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors for a double bill concert with [[D' Boys]] at Sarajevo's Đuro Đaković Hall, an all-seater venue holding almost a thousand people.&lt;ref name="jul1983-start"/&gt; The show sold out quickly and was a smashing success, a remarkable triumph for a band that at the time hadn't been on television yet and still had no studio recordings.&lt;ref name="damar"/&gt;

Muharem soon arranged for the band to get some time in Akvarijus studio in Belgrade during December 1983 in order to record material for their debut album whose production was originally supposed to be handled by Peđa Vranešević of [[Laboratorija Zvuka]], but was eventually done by [[Goran Vejvoda]] as well as Elvis J. Kurtović and Muharem themselves. [[Margita Stefanović]] from [[Katarina II]] made a guest appearance on the synthesizer during the album recording sessions as her band was recording its own [[Katarina II (album)|debut album]] in the same studio at the same time.

EJK&amp;HM and Muharem soon agreed a record contract with [[Založba kaset in plošč RTV Ljubljana|ZKP RTLj]] and their debut album ''[[Mitovi i legende o Kralju Elvisu]]'' came out in February 1984 right in the middle of the Winter Olympics being held in the city. Figuring that promoting the album during the Olympics would get them extra attention due to all the press and other visitors gathered in the city, EJK&amp;HM held a press junket that largely turned shambolic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/30-godina-mitova-i-legendi/175242|title=30 godina 'Mitova i legendi...'|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=23 December 2014|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a series of club gigs at the popular student club Trasa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/olimpijada-jurek-burek/74103|title=Olimpijada, Jurek, burek|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=14 February 2012|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also made one of their first proper TV appearances, lip-synching "Baščaršy Hanumen" on ''Hit meseca'' (Yugoslav counterpart to ''[[Top of the Pops]]'') while hamming it up for the cameras. The album release was followed by a promotional club tour of bigger Yugoslav cities, but since the record was selling poorly with less than 15,000 copies sold, the tour ended quickly and the deflated band members returned to Sarajevo.

Malkolm Muharem soon quit working with the band.

===''Das ist Walter'' released and ''Top lista nadrealista'' starts on television===

A few months later, in April 1984, Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' came out for [[Jugoton]] in limited issue of 3,000 copies, clearly indicative of the label's extremely low commercial expectations. Recorded in immensely modest circumstances and over an unreasonably long period of 7 months due to reasons beyond their control, the album features punk and garage rock sensibility with songs referencing local toponyms and social strata such as an obscure Sarajevo movie theater, Bosnian coal miners, local thugs from various city neighbourhoods, a local hoodlum being incarcerated in the [[Zenica prison]] etc. Its initial sales were nothing to speak of.

Simultaneously with the album release, ''Top lista nadrealista'' moved to television as a weekly sketch comedy programme. The shows started airing on 2 June 1984 on [[BHT 1|TV Sarajevo]]'s channel two as well as on [[Yugoslav Radio Television|JRT]] exchange for the rest of the country. Despite being placed in a milieu well removed from their natural setting — their comedy sketches were essentially fillers in-between [[Narodna muzika|folk music]] numbers — the show eventually proved a good vehicle for reaching a wider audience. After the opening few episodes that were largely met with indifference, the show started gaining a bit of an audience outside of its Sarajevo youth core with whom it had immediately struck a cord.

This gradually increased viewership of ''Top lista nadrealista'' had a positive effect on ''[[Das ist Walter]]'' sales. Riding the buzz created by the TV show as well as the growing popularity of the "Zenica Blues" track (cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s "San Quentin"), Karajlić's and Sexon's blend of punk and local storytelling began finding an increasingly receptive audience months after its initial release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.story.rs/intervju/3070-nele-karajlic-trudim-se-da-budem-dobar-tata-i-muz.html Karajlic interview];''Story'', 4 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; No one was more surprised at this turn of events than the label itself as it was forced to order multiple new batches of the album copies on records and cassettes.

New Primitivism as a term also started catching on as Yugoslav media began using it when referencing the band's style or when talking about the television show. Also, another of the more popular songs on the album, "Anarhija All Over Baščaršija" (Anarchy All Over [[Baščaršija]]), explicitly mentions New Primitives, bringing them up in the context of "violent locals from [[Vratnik, Sarajevo|Vratnik]] who listen to [[narodna muzika|Yugoslav folk music]], attack [[hippie]]s, and are repulsed by the [[Western world|West]]".

On 15 September 1984 as ''Top lista nadrealista'' episodes resumed broadcasting following the summer break, the band played Sarajevo's Dom mladih on a bill that also included [[Bajaga i Instruktori]] in front of a raucous crowd of 4,500. The band was officially out of the clubs and now playing larger halls. In October, Zabranjeno Pušenje went to Belgrade for a show at [[Studentski kulturni centar|SKC]] where they were surprised to discover their newly found popularity. In addition to having to add an extra show in the same venue the next day due to popular demand, they also started getting recognized by kids on the street. The two SKC shows launched the band on an extensive and successful Yugoslavia-wide tour; on 4 November 1984 they sold out [[Hala sportova]], a sports arena in Belgrade with 6,000 in attendance. They would end up playing over 60 concerts on that tour.

In parallel, the album sales ended up hitting the 100,000 mark while the term New Primitives also became well established in the process. However, the increased profile also meant increased scrutiny as Karajlić and the band were about to find out.

===The 'Marshall' affair...===
At a concert in [[Rijeka]]'s [[Dvorana Mladosti]] before a crowd of some two and a half thousand people on Tuesday, 27 November 1984, the band inadvertently set off a firestorm of controversy.
{{quote box|quote=''Following my lawyer's advice, the defense I presented at the 'Marshal has croaked' court hearings was continuously denying I ever said the remark they accused me of saying. My lawyer, being an intelligent man fully aware of the particular point in time, politically, in Yugoslavia, knew the extent to which this mad witch-hunt could've gone to had I admitted to actually uttering the remark. He also knew 'Marshal has croaked', which still sounded like blasphemy in 1984, would soon take on a whole different contextual meaning. And really, within a short few years, figuratively speaking, 'Marshal has croaked' became an official political programme for many of the newly founded political parties that were in the process of gaining strength and eventually winning power all over Yugoslavia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0qZHB6XIRs&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=50s |title=Glavni tok |agency=RTV Pink |date=1990s}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=Nele Karajlić on the 1985-86 verbal offence court case against him|width=20%|align=right}}
During [[soundcheck]] before the show, the band's amplifier went bust to which Karajlić jokingly exclaimed: "Crk'o maršal" (The "Marshall has croaked!"), followed by a pause before adding: "Mislim na pojačalo" ("The [[Marshall Amplification|amplifier]], that is") (a [[switcheroo]] remark about the 1980 death of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]), getting a chuckle from a small group of people within the earshot. Liking the reaction he got during soundcheck, he decided to start the actual concert by delivering the same joke as an explanation to why the show is starting late.

There was hardly any negative reactions during the concert or immediately after it, and the band continued its tour with a triumphant concert at Ledena dvorana in Zagreb in front of 12,000 fans on 10 December 1984. Though a few write-ups mentioning Karajlić's marshal quip appeared in neutral tone in Zagreb-based papers leading up to the concert, it would be the op-ed piece by journalist Veljko Vičević in Rijeka-based daily newspaper ''[[Novi list]]'' that started the avalanche with far-reaching consequences. Headlined "Opak dim Zabranjenog pušenja" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Sinister Smoke), Vičević strongly denounces the band for lack of morals and stepping over the line, and additionally reproaches the group members for things they said in the past such as "Tuđe hoćemo/nećemo, svoje nemamo".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSQXINde0GM#t=276s Opak dim Zabranjenog pusenja]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the initial stone and the signal for numerous bodies of the communist system to criticize the band (as well as, by proxy, new primitives and ''Top lista nadrealista'') on various grounds. The controversy also served to open another front in the row between two internal factions wrestling for the control of [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]]'s SSO, the provincial branch of the [[League of Socialist Youth of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Socialist Youth League]] (SSOJ), itself a youth wing of the [[one-party state|country's one and only political party]] — [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist League]] (SKJ). Since the Rijeka concert was organized by the local pro-[[Stipe Šuvar|Šuvar]] SSO in Rijeka, the rival pro-[[Vladimir Bakarić|Bakarić]] faction within the organization used Karajlić's Marshal quip to smear the organizing group.

By January 1985, news of the Rijeka flap made it back to Sarajevo where more journalists, most notably Pavle Pavlović in the ''As'' newspaper, were ready to condemn the band further. In his piece headlined "Otrovni dim Zabranjenog pušenja" (Zabranjeno Pušenje's Poisonous Smoke), Pavlović labels Karajlić's words "an insensitive association and piece of sarcasm that insults right to the heart". The columnist then trails off to even take ideological issue with the humorous sound bytes in radio jingles promoting the December 1984 release of the ''Top lista nadrealista'' radio material on audio cassette by [[Diskoton]]. He continues by predicting that "the young band's life span will be little longer than that of a [[butterfly]]" before adding that "sadly even such short time is enough to indoctrinate the impressionable kids with new thoughts, including continuous ridicule of everything that we've created so far as well as banal, low-brow tampering with the basic tenet of the [[Yugoslav People's Liberation War|People's Liberation War]] — Tuđe nećemo, svoje ne damo". Pavlović concludes by musing "whether the time has come to extinguish Zabranjeno Pušenje's poisonous smoke for good".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.ba/mcsonline/files/shared/Pavle_P.pdf Otrovni dim Zabranjenog Pusenja]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://protest.ba/v2/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Otrovni-dim-Zabranjenog-pu%C5%A1enja.jpg Otrovni dim...]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a communist country where verbal offence was defined as a crime and as such punishable by law, Karajlić and other band members were summoned for dozens of police questionings. Communist Yugoslavia had its [[sacred cow (idiom)|sacred cow]]s and public criticism or ridicule, either veiled or open, of Tito, the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|party]], or the People's Liberation War was grounds for severe punishment. Karajlić ended up being taken to court with a criminal charge that was eventually reduced to a misdemeanor one in a legal process that stretched on for years.

===...and its consequences===
However, an even bigger problem was that Zabranjeno Pušenje became blacklisted as a result of the Marshal episode. While not banned outright, their songs were taken off radio playlists, their access to television was restricted, and more than 30 of their already booked concerts in early 1985 ended up getting cancelled due to pressure from above that manifested itself through sudden introduction of administrative obstacles such as denying permits for the venues on the day of the show and so on.&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"/&gt;

Throughout January 1985, the new primitives experienced multiple bizarre manifestations of this sudden anti-Zabranjeno Pušenje hysteria in Sarajevo.

Each January, during winter school break, TV Sarajevo's daytime schedule consisted of various kids' shows reruns, and one such show happened to feature the band's hit song "Zenica Blues". Not being aware of that, the technician running the [[control room]] that day let the show air by mistake. Since Zabranjeno Pušenje were essentially banned from the station, TV Sarajevo executives found it sufficiently necessary to apologize for the oversight later that day in the station's central daily newscast ''Dnevnik 2'' and also to issue temporary suspensions both to the technician as well as to the executive in charge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reDtowLheLA#t=733s Glavni tok];RTV Pink, 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

By association, the hysteria also spread to ''Top lista nadrealista'' activities. While promoting the freshly released audio cassette in Sarajevo containing the best of compilation of 'Top lista nadrealista' radio segment, there was such a stigma attached to the group's activity in the city that not a single journalists was brave enough to show up at the promotional press event at Muzikalije record store in [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer|Štrosmajerova]] Street, fearing that being seen there would be interpreted as a public show of support for beleaguered Karajlić and the rest of his mates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media.ba/bs/magazin-etika/cenzura-na-radiju-80-ih Cenzura na radiju 80-ih], media.ba, 6 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Attempting to rectify and calm the situation, members of Zabranjeno Pušenje issued a letter to all socio-political organizations within Sarajevo and the Socialist Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the print media outlets that had been criticizing the band. The gist of the letter was the claim that they never insulted the image and legacy of Comrade Tito thus denying media reports claiming otherwise and labeling them "monstrous lies".&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"&gt;{{cite news|first=Slavoljub|last=Marković|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2016/02/zabranjeno-pusenje-afera-crko-marsal.html|title=O društveno-političkoj odgovornosti rock-zvezda: Filter ili muštikla|agency=''Reporter''|date=February 1985|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the letter was generally ignored within Sarajevo and SR Bosnia-Herzegovina as the only press outlets to publish it were Zagreb's youth paper ''Polet'' and later Belgrade's ''[[Politika]]''.&lt;ref name="SlavoljubMarkovic-feb1985"/&gt;

Due to all the problems and hassle suddenly associated with organizing a Zabranjeno Pušenje gig, local promoters began avoiding the band despite clear demand for their concerts. Finding itself increasingly isolated in addition to seeing its commercial momentum slip away, the band decided to invest all its energy into organizing a single high-profile gig that would hopefully as much as anything serve as a statement of encouragement for all potential promoters not to shy away from the band. Still, despite selling out [[Hala Pionir]] in Belgrade on Saturday, 16 February 1985 with more than 7,000 people in attendance, the concert didn't have the desired media effect and the band's downward slide continued with gigs now completely dried up.

Facing insurmountable obstacles, the group gave in temporarily, deciding to lay low for some time while some of the members went back to making ''Top lista nadrealista'' on Radio Sarajevo. However, in March 1985, the authorities put an end to that too, removing the segment for good from the radio schedule.

Just as the career of one New Primitivism band, Zabranjeno Pušenje, was suddenly spiraling downhill, another band from the same milieu, [[Plavi Orkestar]], was getting big.

Other bands that at one time or another identified with New Primitives include: [[Bombaj Štampa]], [[Plavi Orkestar]], [[Dinar (band)|Dinar]] and [[Crvena Jabuka]], although they quickly moved on to more commercial and communicative forms of expression.

===''Soldatski bal''  hits it big===
Though the torch of New Primitivsm had primarily been carried by Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Zabranjeno Pušenje, other bands were also associated with the movement.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:PlavOrkestar cover of Svijet June 1985.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Despite [[Plavi Orkestar]]'s fragmentary association with New Primitivism, the movement arguably got its biggest media promotion via the enormous commercial success of the band's debut album ''[[Soldatski bal]]'' in early 1985.]] --&gt;
After splitting with Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors following the lacklustre reception of their debut album, crafty manager Malkolm Muharem switched over to another local Sarajevo outfit — [[Plavi Orkestar]] — a band that had also been gigging on the city's student club scene for some time already and was now looking to take the next step by recording and releasing a studio album. Though also starting out as a garage/punk rock group that often crossed paths with Pušenje and EJK (Orkestar's bassist Ćera I even played on Pušenje's demo recordings before joining Orkestar while the bands also often held club gigs together), over time, especially after achieving stable lineup of Loša, Pava, Ćera I, and Ćera II in early summer 1983, Plavi Orkestar moved to more conventional forms of expression within Yugoslav general cultural context. In practice, that meant pretty much abandoning punk in favour of pop and openly flirting with Yugoslav commercial folk in their sound. Though opening doors for them commercially, this practice somewhat placed them on the fringes of New Primitivism. Compared to the two main new primitive outfits, their stage appearance was far more orderly and their lyrics were less cerebral.

Nevertheless, Muharem saw a new opportunity with the four fresh-faced lads each of whom just turned 20 having recently returned to the city from their respective year-long mandatory [[Yugoslav People's Army|army]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/o-marusi-razglednici-iz-nisa-i-prestanku-pusenja/100032|title=O Maruši, razglednici iz Niša i prestanku pušenja|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=15 January 2013|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 1984 when Muharem took the youngsters under his wing, the band barely existed as its main creative duo — frontman [[Saša Lošić]] and guitarist Mladen "Pava" Pavičić — were not on speaking terms and Pava left the band. Not deterred, Muharem took the remaining three members to Zagreb and through personal connections got [[Parni Valjak]]'s Husein "Hus" Hasanefendić to record a few more demos with them, while also managing to secure a pre-contract with Jugoton.

The news of the pre-contract signing brought Pavičić back into the fold and by January 1985 all four were off to Zagreb to record in [[SIM studio]]. The album named ''[[Soldatski bal]]'' came out in February 1985 and instantly created a sensation all over Yugoslavia, placing the young band among the most successful Yugoslav rock acts like Bijelo Dugme and [[Riblja Čorba]]. Muharem essentially stayed true to the promotional techniques he previously implemented with Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors — print media and soundbytes — though the sarcastic bravado of EJK&amp;HM was now replaced with Plavi Orkestar's dreamy boyish charm. However, this time it had a tremendous commercial effect as the band embarked on a Yugoslavia-wide tour in late summer 1985 with scenes of thousands of screaming and fainting teenage girls repeated in town after town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yugopapir.blogspot.ca/2012/11/pop-fenomeni-plavi-orkestar-djeca-su.html Pop fenomeni: Plavi orkestar - Djeca su čisto poludjela!];September 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Named 'Bolje biti pijan nego star' (Better Drunk than Old) after the band's hit track, the tour included 140 concerts in sports arenas and other large venues throughout the country. Muharem additionally hired journalist-turned-filmmaker Goran Gajić to shoot a tour documentary thus reuniting with him two years after Gajić wrote a glowing summer 1983 piece on Elvis J. Kurtović in ''Start''. Furthermore, Gajić directed a video for Plavi Orkestar's hit track "Kad mi kažeš, paša" featuring actresses [[Tanja Bošković]], [[Sonja Savić]], journalist Mirjana Bobić-Mojsilović, and TV personality [[Suzana Mančić]]. The album ended up selling 550,000 copies. Though with unexpected and sudden success the band's sensibility quickly transformed even more into folkish pop as they almost morphed into a sugary [[boy band]], many media outlets still presented them as a new primitive group, giving the movement unprecedented promotion in Yugoslavia during the first half of 1985.

==Reaction and reception==
Initial wider media reaction to the movement wasn't positive. During New Primitivism's nascent stage, following a summer 1983 double-bill concert by Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar at Belgrade's SKC, a [[blurb]] appeared in the high-circulation ''[[Politika]]'' daily reviewing the show, but also discussing the movement in general. In his negative review, rock critic Ljuba Trifunović placed New Primitivsm in the same context with commercial [[narodna muzika|folk]] singer [[Lepa Brena]]'s then current flirtation with rock sound ("[[naïve art|naïve]] rock"), expressing disappointment that "both appeared precisely when we began to think [[Yugoslav rock]] finally became immune to such diseases due to [[New wave music in Yugoslavia|new wave]] effectively washing away the so-called '[[Bijelo Dugme#.22Shepherd rock.22 years: rise to fame and .22Dugmemania.22 .281974.E2.80.9379.29|shepherd's rock]]' and all of its derivatives". Seeing New Primitivsm in continuity with several past offerings from the Sarajevo musical scene such as composer [[Nikola Borota Radovan]]'s opus, [[Jutro]], early [[Bijelo Dugme]], and [[Milić Vukašinović]]'s collaboration with [[Hanka Paldum]], Trifunović felt that adjective "new" was entirely superfluous in the movement's name: "Elvis J. Kurtovich &amp; His Meteors and Plavi Orkestar are representatives of this renewed and stripped-down [[primitive culture|primitivsm]], and even if some inconsequential differences do exist when comparing the two bands' interpretative [[wikt:dilettante|dilettantism]] (with EJK&amp;HM coming out on top), what's really depressing is their absolute creative [[pathos]] embodied in the creed 'let's be ourselves' - primitive Balkanoids".&lt;ref&gt;[http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190 In the Name of Love];''Politika'', summer 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

As the movement got more profiled in late 1983 and especially throughout 1984 with the emergence of Zabranjeno Pušenje's debut album and the start of ''Top lista nadrealista'' on television, it began getting better media notices.

In July 1984, rock critic Darko Glavan wrote a detailed opinion piece on New Primitivism in general as well as EJK&amp;HM and Zabranjeno Pušenje specifically. Expressing mild approval, he summarized his personal acceptance of the movement: "If someone likes them, I'm not going to dissuade them, however, if someone doesn't like them, I'm not going to attempt convincing them otherwise". Furthermore, while noting new primitives are deserving of the media attention they've been receiving, he wondered whether they're getting too much publicity because "they are terrific as an added flavourful spice to a developed and varied rock scene, but can hardly function as the dominant trend".&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glavan|first=Darko|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2016/06/muzicko-leto-1984-darko-glavan-o-novom.html|title=Muzicko leto 1984, Darko Glavan o novom primitivizmu: Imaju li Elvis i Nele pretjerani publicitet?|agency=''Studio''|date=July 1984|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on EJK&amp;HM, he labelled them "Bosnia's answer to [[Sha Na Na]]", before proclaiming them an acceptable form of entertainment for the general masses and a welcome break from incoherent [[art rock]] pretentiousness. Though further expressing skepticism whether this is still enough for a conventional rock career, citing EJK&amp;HM's unwillingness to freshen up their repetitive jokes and yucks as a concern for their long term career prospects.&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"/&gt; Glavan was more upbeat about Pušenje, finding them to be "more musical, more talented, and in the context of an [[LP record|LP]], simply stronger than EJK&amp;HM". Comparing Pušenje to [[The Clash]] in addition to extolling their artistic ambition that "saves them from becoming one-dimensional caricatures and additionally invokes locally flavoured stylized [[Italian neorealism|neorealism]] of [[Emir Kusturica]]'s ''[[Do You Remember Dolly Bell?|Sjećaš li se Doli Bel?]]''", Glavan felt that, despite occasionally failing to properly articulate their inventiveness, the band has a fresh voice and a couple of great tracks off their debut album.&lt;ref name="jul1984-studio"/&gt;

[[Goran Bregović]] once referred to New Primitivism as "''the only authentic Yugoslav answer to [[punk subculture|punk]]''".

Novelist [[Miljenko Jergović]] considered it "a general cultural emancipatory movement that was supposed to rid the Bosnians of their eternal [[inferiority complex]] towards Zagreb and Belgrade".&lt;ref&gt;[http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190 In the Name of Love];Ogledalo, early 1990s&lt;/ref&gt;

In his scathing 1993 rebuke of the movement, Muhidin Džanko, a professor at the [[University of Sarajevo]]'s Faculty of Philosophy, labeled New Primitivism an "exceptionally [[Islamophobia|anti-Islamic]] movement" that "thanks to the charisma of its protagonists, managed to directly obstruct and even eliminate the national feelings of the Bosnian Muslim youth, majority of whom are proud members of the 'new primitive nation'". He furthermore saw the [[poetics]] of New Primitivism to be rooted in its specific language containing "supposed speech patterns and parlance of the Sarajevo [[Baščaršija|čaršija]] and [[mahala]]s", before rejecting it as a "cheap trick meant to lampoon the traditional verbal expression of Sarajevo Muslims and degrade their [[Oriental]] [[lexicology]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Džanko|first=Muhidin|url=http://haler.blogger.ba/arhiva/2008/10/08/1831190|title=Sarajevski novi primitivizam - Pokret za destrukciju muslimanskog nacionalnog bića|agency=|date=1993|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zoran Kostić (musician)|Zoran "Cane" Kostić]], the [[Partibrejkers]] frontman, wasn't a fan of the movement; in 1997 he mentioned it in passing during an interview: "Bosnians ([[Plavi Orkestar]] and [[Crvena Jabuka]]) took over Belgrade sometime around 1986 and it was because of these raucous new primitive guys that they were able to pull that off. They were their [[Trojan Horse]]s. I never got into that new primitive thing precisely because I saw something else in it. I mean, in the end, their schtick enabled all these dumb bands such as [[Valentino (band)|Valentino]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2436/3.html Ispovest: Zoran Kostic Cane, partibrejker: BEZ TRIKA I FOLIRANJA];''NIN'', 5 September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Zabranjeno.pusenje1.jpg|335px|thumb|right|[[Zabranjeno Pušenje]] in 1987 during the ''[[Pozdrav iz zemlje Safari]]'' tour.]] --&gt;
New Primitivism as a sub-cultural movement retained prominence well after its demise.

To many it also gained added relevance in the context of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. Books like 2013's ''Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique'' written by Dalibor Mišina, assistant professor of sociology at [[Lakehead University]], devote a significant portion to the study of New Primitivism's overall significance in the last decade of SFR Yugoslavia's existence, arguing that the country could've survived had it adopted values propagated by New Primitivism and similar genres as its new cultural model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.ca/Shake-Rattle-Roll-Yugoslav-Critique/dp/1409445658/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1360563221&amp;sr=1-1 Shake, Rattle and Roll: Yugoslav Rock Music and the Poetics of Social Critique]&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked in 2012 whether New Primitivism was a political or a cultural movement, Nele Karajlić said: {{cquote|''It was a fuckabout that got taken a little too seriously in the end. It was created as our answer to global musical trends that the Western music industry had been manufacturing and launching in regular intervals in order to sell more records. Whenever there's a lull in sales, the industry comes up with something called, say, [[New Romanticism]], for example. And then, a band appears and it's called [[Ultravox]], for example, so we all cut our hair like Ultravox and we buy that thing for a year or year and a half. And then it's time for New Something Else, and the same cycle is repeated over again..... As sensitive and receptive consumers of pop-culture we quickly realized the whole thing is a sham so we decided to "join" the musical industry by coming up with our own movement. New Primitivism would've been genius had it been taken over and fostered by a serious conceptual artist willing to invest at least as much energy in it as those Slovenian dudes did in their [[Neue Slowenische Kunst]]. However, speaking objectively, that was impossible because the guys in NSK took their thing seriously while we never got past the fucking around stage..... I should also add that the biggest difference between New Primitivism and NSK was the fact that "old primitivism" tangibly existed while the "Altslowenische Kunst", strictly speaking, never did''.&lt;ref&gt;"Smisao nadrealizma dr. Neleta Karajlića", Nebojša Grujičić &amp; Jovana Gligorijević, ''Vreme'' issue #1144, Belgrade, 6 December 2012, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://postimage.org/image/69sdmb66p/full/]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Discussing the interest New Primitivism has been getting from social scientific circles, Elvis J. Kurtović wrote in his online column in 2013: {{cquote|''Once in a blue moon, I'll get a call from someone saying they're a researcher working at some university and they want to ask me questions about New Primitivism. My immediate reaction is to fuck with them. However, when they later send me a nicely bound hardcover book, I must say I'm filled with pride. Nothing gives me more satisfaction than seeing 30-year-old crap I wrote purely out of spite, indolence, or malevolence, now translated into English and dissected by serious people for deeper meaning''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtović|first=Elvis J.|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/kolumne/elvis-j-kurtovic/hoce-hoce-al/101470|title=Hoće, hoće, al'...|agency=radiosarajevo.ba|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''October''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] specializing in [[contemporary art]], [[art criticism|criticism]], and [[critical theory|theory]], published by [[MIT Press]].

==History==
''October'' was established in 1976 in New York by [[Rosalind E.

As well as in-depth articles and reviews of 20th century and contemporary art, the journal features critical interpretations of cinema and popular culture from a progressive viewpoint.

==Impact==
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', the journal was an "influential vehicle for the debate surrounding the emergence of postmodernism and New Historicism in 20th-century art-historical studies", and the journal "contributed greatly to Anglo-American academics’ adoption of French theoretical innovations, especially those pertaining to the analysis of cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Rosalind-E-Krauss#ref1041327 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |work=Rosalind E.

The Spanish Village era is said to have ended in the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK/1983/05/27&amp;id=Ar14500&amp;sk=65DC8D13|title=Paseo wiping out its hippy-era|last=|first=|date=5/27/1983|website=|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paseo has undergone transformations; currently, the Paseo is enjoying a renaissance since the 1980s. Today, a vibrant group of artists and other interested people are transforming this community through creative thinking and arts activities.

Located along Paseo Drive at roughly N. Walker Ave and NW 28th Street, the faux Spanish village with its stucco buildings and clay tile roofs is the home to many of [[Oklahoma City]]'s Artists.

The Paseo Arts district is home to a number of chic bars, restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, art galleries, and avant-garde businesses. Since 1975, Paseo hosts the annual Paseo Arts Festival each [[Memorial Day]] weekend, which showcases original works of visual and performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.newsok.com/olive/apa/oklahoman/SharedView.Article.aspx?href=DOK/1984/05/23&amp;id=Ar06900&amp;sk=C9D602AC|title=Paseo Festival's Foothold Solid After Nine Years|last=|first=|date=5/23/1984|website=The Daily Oklahoman|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other events within the Paseo Arts district include its annual Fairy Ball, as well as the First Friday Gallery Walk. The First Friday Gallery Walk  is an event in which Paseo art galleries and restaurants host Art Opening Receptions on the first Friday of every month in order to displaying new artist's work and invite people to visit the Paseo district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Friday|work=thepaseo.com/calendar/firstfriday.html|accessdate=9/11/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district is also home to the oldest church in Oklahoma, Old Trinity of Paseo.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oldtrinityofpaseo.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The former Anglican church was built in [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]] in 1842 and was closed in 1990. Oklahoma City photographer Tom Lee purchased the church in 2000 and had it dismantled and moved to Oklahoma City to serve as his studio. Lee sold the church in 2007 to be rented as a venue for weddings and other events.&lt;ref&gt;http://okc.net/2011/01/31/keeping-okc-weird-a-rough-guide-to-the-paseo/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paseo district is listed as a neighborhood ‘worthy of preservation’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places|work=nps.gov/nr/}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|National Register of Historic Places]] and in 2010, was named as one of the ’10 Great Neighborhoods for 2010’ by the American Planning Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NewsOK Article|work=newsok.com |url=http://newsok.com/okcs-paseo-named-as-one-of-americas-10-great-neighborhoods-for-2010/article/3504008|accessdate=9/11/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - Proserpine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Proserpine (Rossetti painting)|Proserpine]]'', 1874, by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], portrayed by [[Jane Morris]]]]
The '''Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood ''' (later known as the '''Pre-Raphaelites''') was a group of [[England|English]] [[Painting|painter]]s, [[poets]], and [[art critic]]s, founded in 1848 by [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Everett Millais]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The three founders were joined by [[William Michael Rossetti]], [[James Collinson]], [[Frederic George Stephens]] and [[Thomas Woolner]] to form the seven-member "brotherhood". Their principles were shared by other artists, including [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]] and [[Marie Spartali Stillman]].

A later, medievalising strain inspired by Rossetti included [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and extended into the twentieth century with artists such as [[John William Waterhouse]].

The group's intention was to reform art by rejecting what it considered the mechanistic approach first adopted by [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists who succeeded [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]]. Its members believed the [[Classicism|Classical]] poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the [[academic art|academic]] teaching of art, hence the name "Pre-Raphaelite". In particular, the group objected to the influence of [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], founder of the English [[Royal Academy of Arts]], whom they called "Sir Sloshua". To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, "sloshy" meant "anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind".&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Timothy (1970).  ''The Pre-Raphaelites'', p. 46.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The brotherhood sought a return to the abundant detail, intense colours and complex compositions of [[Quattrocento]] Italian art. The group associated their work with [[John Ruskin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landow|first1=George P.|title=Pre-Raphaelites: An Introduction|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/prb/1.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an English critic whose influences were driven by his religious background.

The group continued to accept the concepts of [[history painting]] and [[mimesis]], imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. The Pre-Raphaelites defined themselves as a reform movement, created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]'', to promote their ideas. The group's debates were recorded in the ''Pre-Raphaelite Journal''.

==Beginnings==
[[File:Germ.jpg|thumb|Illustration by Holman Hunt of Thomas Woolner's poem "My Beautiful Lady", published in ''The Germ'', 1850]]
The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in John Millais's parents' house on [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]], London in 1848. At the first meeting, the painters [[John Everett Millais]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[William Holman Hunt]] were present. Hunt and Millais were students at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and had met in another loose association, the Cyclographic Club, a sketching society. At his own request Rossetti became a pupil of [[Ford Madox Brown]] in 1848.&lt;ref name=McGann&gt;McGann, Jerome J. ''The Complete Writings and Pictures of Dante Gabriel Rossetti'', NINES consortium, Creative Commons License; http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/s40.rap.html retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At that date, Rossetti and Hunt shared lodgings in [[Cleveland Street, London|Cleveland Street]], [[Fitzrovia]], Central London. Hunt had started painting ''The Eve of St. Agnes'' based on [[The Eve of St. Agnes|Keats's poem of the same name]], but it was not completed until 1867.&lt;ref name=hilton28&gt;Hilton (1970), pp. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aspiring poet, Rossetti wished to develop the links between [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poetry and art. By autumn, four more members, painters [[James Collinson]] and [[Frederic George Stephens]], Rossetti's brother, poet and critic [[William Michael Rossetti]], and  sculptor [[Thomas Woolner]], had joined to form a seven-member-strong brotherhood.&lt;ref name=hilton28/&gt; Ford Madox Brown was invited to join, but the more senior artist remained independent but supported the group throughout the PRB period of Pre-Raphaelitism and contributed to ''The Germ''. Other young painters and sculptors became close associates, including [[Charles Allston Collins]], and [[Alexander Munro (sculptor)|Alexander Munro]]. The PRB intended to keep the existence of the brotherhood secret from members of the Royal Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hisour.com/art-movements/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood-1848-1855/|title=Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood 1848 - 1855 - HiSoUR Art Culture Exhibition|date=2017-02-22|work=HiSoUR Art Culture Exhibition|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early doctrines==
The brotherhood's early doctrines, as defined by William Michael Rossetti, were expressed in four declarations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# to have genuine ideas to express;
# to study Nature attentively, so as to know how to express them;
# to sympathise with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous art, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading&lt;!-- "parading" NOT "parodying" --&gt; and learned by rote; and
# most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Latham, pp. 11-12; see also his comments&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principles were deliberately non-dogmatic, since the brotherhood wished to emphasise the personal responsibility of individual artists to determine their own ideas and methods of depiction. Influenced by [[Romanticism]], the members thought freedom and responsibility were inseparable. Nevertheless, they were particularly fascinated by [[medieval]] culture, believing it to possess a [[spirituality|spiritual]] and creative integrity that had been lost in later eras. The emphasis on medieval culture clashed with principles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] which stress the independent observation of nature. In its early stages, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood believed its two interests were consistent with one another, but in later years the movement divided and moved in two directions. The realists were led by Hunt and Millais, while the medievalists were led by Rossetti and his followers, [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[William Morris]]. The split was never absolute, since both factions believed that art was essentially spiritual in character, opposing their [[idealism]] to the [[materialism|materialist]] realism associated with [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Impressionism]].

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was greatly influenced by nature and its members used great detail to show the natural world using bright and sharp focus techniques on a white canvas. In attempts to revive the brilliance of colour found in Quattrocento art, Hunt and Millais developed a technique of painting in thin [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]s of pigment over a wet white ground in the hope that the colours would retain jewel-like transparency and clarity. Their emphasis on brilliance of colour was a reaction to the excessive use of [[bitumen]] by earlier British artists, such as Reynolds, [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] and [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]]. Bitumen produces unstable areas of muddy darkness, an effect the Pre-Raphaelites despised.

In 1848, Rossetti and Hunt made a list of "Immortals", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, some of whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings, notably including [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-pre-raphaelites&lt;/ref&gt;

==First exhibitions and publications==
The first exhibitions of Pre-Raphaelite work occurred in 1849. Both Millais's ''[[Isabella (Millais painting)|Isabella]]'' (1848–1849) and Holman Hunt's ''[[Rienzi vowing to obtain justice for the death of his young brother, slain in a skirmish between the Colonna and the Orsini factions|Rienzi]]'' (1848–1849) were exhibited at the Royal Academy.  Rossetti's ''[[:File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 004.jpg|Girlhood of Mary Virgin]]'' was shown at a Free Exhibition on Hyde Park Corner. As agreed, all members of the brotherhood signed their work with their name and the initials "PRB". Between January and April 1850, the group published a literary magazine, ''The Germ'' edited by William Rossetti which published poetry by the Rossettis, Woolner, and Collinson and essays on art and literature by associates of the brotherhood, such as [[Coventry Patmore]]. As the short run-time implies, the magazine did not manage to achieve sustained momentum. (Daly 1989)

==Public controversy==
[[File:John Everett Millais - Christ in the House of His Parents (`The Carpenter's Shop') - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|320px|''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'', by John Everett Millais, 1850]]
In 1850, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood became the subject of controversy after the exhibition of Millais' painting ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' was considered to be [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] by many reviewers, notably [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Michael (2009). ''Charles Dickens'', p. 309. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens considered Millais' Mary to be ugly.&lt;ref&gt;Andres, Sophia (2005). ''The Pre-Raphaelite Art of the Victorian Novel: Narrative Challenges to Visual Gendered Boundaries'', p. 9. Ohio State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Millais had used his sister-in-law, Mary Hodgkinson, as the model for Mary in his painting. The brotherhood's  medievalism was attacked as backward-looking and its extreme devotion to detail was condemned as ugly and jarring to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, 3 May 1851; pg. 8; Issue 20792: Exhibition of the Royal Academy. (Private View.), First Notice: ''"We cannot censure at present, as amply or as strongly as we desire to do, that strange disorder of the mind or the eyes which continues to rage with unabated absurdity among a class of juvenile artists who style themselves "P.R.B.," which being interpreted means ''Pre-Raphael Brethren''. Their faith seems to consist in an absolute contempt for perspective and the known laws of light and shade, an aversion to beauty in every shape, and a singular devotion to the minute accidents of their subjects, including, or rather seeking out, every excess of sharpness and deformity."''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dickens, Millais made the Holy Family look like alcoholics and slum-dwellers, adopting contorted and absurd "medieval" poses. A rival group of older artists, [[The Clique]], used its influence against the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and its principles were publicly attacked by the President of the Academy, Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

After the controversy, Collinson left the brotherhood and the remaining members met to discuss whether he should be replaced by Charles Allston Collins or [[Walter Howell Deverell]], but were unable to make a decision. From that point the group disbanded, though its influence continued. Artists who had worked in the style initially continued but no longer signed works "PRB".{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'', by [[John Everett Millais]]]]
The brotherhood found support from the critic [[John Ruskin]], who praised its devotion to nature and rejection of conventional methods of composition. The Pre-Raphaelites were influenced by Ruskin's theories. He wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' defending their work and subsequently met them. Initially, he favoured Millais, who travelled to Scotland in the summer of 1853 with Ruskin and Ruskin's wife, Euphemia Chalmers Ruskin, née Gray (now best known as [[Effie Gray]]). The main object of the journey was to paint Ruskin's portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Dearden, James S. (1999). ''John Ruskin: A Life in Pictures'', pp. 36–37. Sheffield Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Effie became increasingly attached to Millais,&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, pp. 49–94.&lt;/ref&gt; creating a crisis. In subsequent annulment proceedings, Ruskin himself made a statement to his lawyer to the effect that his marriage had been unconsummated.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was annulled on grounds of non-[[consummation]], leaving Effie free to marry Millais,&lt;ref&gt;Dearden (1999), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; but causing a public scandal. Millais began to move away from the Pre-Raphaelite style after his marriage, and Ruskin ultimately attacked his later works. Ruskin continued to support Hunt and Rossetti and provided funds to encourage the art of Rossetti's wife [[Elizabeth Siddall]].

By 1853 the original PRB had virtually dissolved,&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Michael |title=The concise Oxford dictionary of art terms - Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford |isbn=9780199569922}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only Holman Hunt remaining true to its stated aims. But the term "Pre-Raphaelite" stuck to Rossetti and others, including [[William Morris]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], with whom he became involved in [[Oxford]] in 1857.&lt;ref name="Whiteley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whiteley |first=Jon |title=Oxford and the Pre-Raphaelites |year=1989 |publisher=Ashmolean Museum |location=Oxford |isbn=0907849946}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence the term Pre-Raphaelite is associated with the much wider and long-lived art movement, including the dreamy, yearning images of women produced by Rossetti and several of his followers.

==Later developments and influence==
[[File:De Morgan Medea.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Medea]]'' by Evelyn De Morgan, 1889, in [[quattrocento]] style]]
Artists influenced by the brotherhood include [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[Philip Calderon]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Evelyn De Morgan]],&lt;ref name=hilton202&gt;Hilton (1970), pp. 202–05&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Sandys]] (who entered the Pre-Raphaelite circle in 1857)&lt;ref name=hilton202/&gt; and [[John William Waterhouse]]. [[Ford Madox Brown]], who was associated with them from the beginning, is often seen as most closely adopting the Pre-Raphaelite principles. One follower who developed his own distinct style was [[Aubrey Beardsley]], who was pre-eminently influenced by Burne-Jones.&lt;ref name=hilton202/&gt;

After 1856, Dante Gabriel Rossetti became an inspiration for the medievalising strand of the movement. He was the link between the two types of Pre-Raphaelite painting (nature and Romance) after the PRB became lost in the later decades of the century. Rossetti, although the least committed to the brotherhood, continued the name and changed its style. He began painting versions of femme fatales using models like [[Jane Morris]], in paintings such as ''Proserpine'', ''The Blue Silk Dress'', and ''La Pia de' Tolomei''. His work influenced his friend [[William Morris]], in whose firm [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co.]] he became a partner, and with whose wife Jane he may have had an affair. Ford Madox Brown and Edward Burne-Jones also became partners in the firm. Through Morris's company, the ideals of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood influenced many interior designers and architects, arousing interest in [[medieval]] designs and other crafts leading to the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] headed by William Morris. Holman Hunt was involved with the movement to reform design through the [[Della Robbia Pottery]] company.

After 1850, Hunt and Millais moved away from direct imitation of medieval art. They stressed the realist and scientific aspects of the movement, though Hunt continued to emphasise the spiritual significance of art, seeking to reconcile religion and science by making accurate observations and studies of locations in [[Egypt]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] for his paintings on biblical subjects. In contrast, Millais abandoned Pre-Raphaelitism after 1860, adopting a much broader and looser style influenced by Reynolds. William Morris and others condemned his reversal of principles.

Pre-Raphaelitism had a significant impact in Scotland and on Scottish artists. The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460-1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His later work was Pre-Raphaelite in its spirituality, as can be seen in his ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860), which contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821-1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of Millais and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855). His later paintings, like those of Millais, have been criticised for descending into popular sentimentality.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460-1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millais was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823-1904) and whose work includes ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Barber, ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief'' (Harvard University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0674013905}}, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Raphaelism also inspired painters like [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fineartbookstore.com/s-120-Pre-Raphaelites|title=Fine Art Books Art Instruction {{!}} Photography Books {{!}} Visual Arts Periods, Groups &amp; Movements: Pre-Raphaelites|last=|first=|date=|website=fineartbookstore.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement influenced many later British artists into the 20th century. Rossetti came to be seen as a precursor of the wider European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement. In the late 20th century the [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]] based its aims on Pre-Raphaelitism, while the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] and the [[Birmingham Group (artists)|Birmingham Group]] have also derived inspiration from it.

[[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] has a world-renowned collection of works by Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites that, some claim, strongly influenced the young [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Bucher (2004) for a brief discussion on the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites on Tolkien.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', with influences taken from the same mythological scenes portrayed by the Pre-Raphaelites.
[[File:Arthur Hughes - Fair Rosamund - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|[[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], ''Fair Rosamund'', 1854]]
In the 20th century artistic ideals changed, and art moved away from representing reality. Since the Pre-Raphaelites were fixed on portraying things with near-photographic precision, though with a distinctive attention to detailed surface-patterns, their work was devalued by many painters and critics. After the [[First World War]], British [[Modernism|Modernists]] associated Pre-Raphaelite art with the repressive and backward times in which they grew up. In the 1960s there was a major revival of Pre-Raphaelitism. Exhibitions and catalogues of works, culminating in a 1984 exhibition in London's [[Tate Gallery]], re-established a canon of Pre-Raphaelite work.&lt;ref&gt;Barringer, Tim (1999). ''Reading the Pre-Raphaelites'', p. 17. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Among many other exhibitions, there was another large show at [[Tate Britain]] in 2012–13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pre-raphaelites-victorian-avant-garde ''Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde''], Tate Britain, accessed 27 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustration and poetry==
Many members of the ‘inner’ Pre-Raphaelite circle ([[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]], [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]]) and ‘outer’ circle ([[Frederick Sandys]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], [[Simeon Solomon]], [[Henry Hugh Armstead]], [[Joseph Noel Paton]], [[Frederic Shields]], [[Matthew James Lawless]]) were working concurrently in painting, illustration, and sometimes poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Illustration: The Pre-Raphaelites, the Idyllic School and the High Victorians|last=Goldman|first=Paul|publisher=Lund Humphries|year=2004|isbn=|location=Burlington, VT|pages=1–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian morality judged literature as superior to painting, because of its “noble grounds for noble emotion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Williams Buchanan|Robert Buchanan]] (a writer and opponent of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) felt so strongly about this artistic hierarchy that he wrote: “The truth is that literature, and more particularly poetry, is in a very bad way when one art gets hold of another, and imposes upon it its conditions and limitations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Robert W.|date=October 1871|title=The Fleshly School of Poetry: Mr. D.G. Rossetti|url=|journal=The Contemporary Review|volume=|pages=|via=}} as cited in Welland, D.S.R. The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art. London, UK: George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd., 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the hostile environment in which Pre-Raphaelites were defiantly working in various media. The Pre-Raphaelites attempted to revitalize [[subject painting]], which had been dismissed as artificial. Their belief that each picture should tell a story was an important step for the unification of painting and literature (eventually deemed the [[Sister Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/1.1.html|title=Chapter One: Ruskin's Theories of the Sister Arts — Ut Pictura Poesis|website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or at least a break in the rigid hierarchy promoted by writers like Robert Buchanan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letter from D.G. Rossetti to William Allingham|last=Rossetti|first=Dante Gabriel|work=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|publisher=|year=1855|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pre-Raphaelite desire for more extensive affiliation between painting and literature also manifested in illustration. Illustration is a more direct unification of these media and, like subject painting, can assert a narrative of its own. For the Pre-Raphaelites, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti specifically, there was anxiety about the constraints of illustration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1855, Rossetti wrote to [[William Allingham]] about the independence of illustration: “I have not begun even designing for them yet, but fancy I shall try the ‘Vision of Sin’ and ‘Palace of Art’ etc. – those where one can allegorize on one’s own hook, without killing for oneself and everyone a distinct idea of the poet’s."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This passage makes apparent Rossetti’s desire to not just support the poet’s narrative, but to create an allegorical illustration that functions separately from the text as well. In this respect, Pre-Raphaelite illustrations go beyond depicting an episode from a poem, but rather function like subject paintings within a text.

==Collections==
[[File:William Holman Hunt 001.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[William Holman Hunt]], ''[[The Hireling Shepherd]]'', 1851]]
There are major collections of Pre-Raphaelite work in United Kingdom museums such as the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]], the [[Tate Gallery]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Manchester Art Gallery]], [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]], and Liverpool's [[Walker Art Gallery]]. The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] and the [[Delaware Art Museum]] in the US have the most significant collections of Pre-Raphaelite art outside the UK. The [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]] in Puerto Rico also has a notable collection of Pre-Raphaelite works, including Sir Edward Burne-Jones' ''[[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon]]'', [[Frederic Lord Leighton]]'s ''[[Flaming June]]'', and works by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and [[Frederic Sandys]].

There is a set of Pre-Raphaelite murals in the Old Library at the [[Oxford Union]], depicting scenes from the [[Arthurian legend]]s, painted between 1857 and 1859 by a team of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris, and Edward Burne-Jones.  The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] houses at [[Wightwick Manor]], [[Wolverhampton]], and at [[Wallington Hall]], [[Northumberland]], both have significant and representative collections. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] is an avid collector of Pre-Raphaelite works, and a selection of 300 items from his collection were shown at an exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 2003.

[[Kelmscott Manor]], the country home of [[William Morris]] from 1871 until his death in 1896, is owned by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] and is open to the public. The Manor is featured in Morris' work ''[[News from Nowhere]]''. It also appears in the background of [[Water Willow (Rossetti)|''Water Willow'']], a portrait of his wife, [[Jane Morris]], painted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] in 1871.  There are exhibitions connected with Morris and Rossetti’s early experiments with photography.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
The story of the brotherhood, from its controversial first exhibition to being embraced by the art establishment, has been depicted in two [[BBC]] television series. The first, ''[[The Love School]]'', was broadcast in 1975; the second is the 2009 BBC television drama serial ''[[Desperate Romantics]]'' by [[Peter Bowker]]. Although much of the latter's material is derived from [[Franny Moyle]]'s factual book ''Desperate Romantics: The Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/25/romantics.shtml Desperate Romantics press pack: introduction] ''BBC Press Office''. Retrieved on 24 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the series occasionally departs from established facts in favour of dramatic licence and is prefaced by the disclaimer: "In the mid-19th century, a group of young men challenged the art establishment of the day. The pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood were inspired by the real world around them, yet took imaginative licence in their art. This story, based on their lives and loves, follows in that inventive spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC2 drama on icons among Pre-Raphaelites |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6626470.ece|author=Armstrong, Stephen|work=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken Russell]]'s television film ''[[Dante's Inferno (1967 TV film)|Dante's Inferno]]'' (1967) contains brief scenes on some of the leading Pre-Raphaelites but mainly concentrates on the life of Rossetti, played by [[Oliver Reed]].

'''Public folklore''' is the term for the work done by [[folkloristics|folklorists]] in public settings in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] outside of universities and colleges, such as arts councils, [[museums]], [[folklife festivals]], radio stations, etc.  The term is actually short for ''"public sector folklore"'' and was first used by members of the [[American Folklore Society]] in the early 1970s.  [[Archie Green]] is generally credited as the founder of the public folklore movement, although his work builds on that of [[Ben Botkin]] and [[Alan Lomax]], going back as far as the 1930s.  (They called their work "[[applied folklore]]," a related but distinct paradigm.)

The birth of public folklore can be traced back to the creation of the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]] in 1970, by an act of [[Congress of the United States|Congress]], sponsored by Sen. [[Ralph Yarborough]] (D-TX) and written by Green and then-Senate aide [[Jim Hightower]].  Other national programs were later established at the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] (NEA), where prominent folklorists such as [[Ralph Rinzler]], [[Alan Jabbour]], and [[Bess Lomax Hawes]] worked.  Funding programs were also established in the 1970s and 1980s in over 40 state arts councils, and these facilitated the eventual creation or funding of major non-profit centers for [[folklife]] documentation and presentation, such as [[City Lore]] and the [[Center for Traditional Music and Dance]] in New York, [[Texas Folklife Resources]], [[Northwest Folklife]], the [[Western Folklife Center]], and the [[Philadelphia Folklore Project]].

Public folklorists are engaged with the documentation, preservation, and presentation of traditional forms of [[folk art]]s, [[craft]], [[folk music]], and other genres of traditional [[folklife]].  In later years, public folklorists have also become involved in economic and community development projects.

Each year, some 15 outstanding American folk artists and performers are awarded [[National Heritage Fellowship]]s from the NEA for their lifetime achievement.  Some more widely known awardees over the years have included [[John Lee Hooker]], [[B.B. King]], [[Clifton Chenier]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Michael Flatley]], [[Shirley Caesar]], [[Albertina Walker]], [[Carter Family|Janette Carter]], [[Koko Taylor]], [[Brownie McGhee]], [[Sonny Terry]], [[Jean Ritchie]], [[Sunnyland Slim]], [[Lydia Mendoza]], [[Boozoo Chavis]], [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]], [[Helen Cordero]], [[Margaret Tafoya]], [[Santiago Jiménez, Jr.]], [[John Cephas]], [[Bois Sec Ardoin]], [[Mick Moloney]], [[Clarence Fountain]] [[Five Blind Boys of Alabama|&amp; the Blind Boys]], [[Esther Martinez]], and the [[Dixie Hummingbirds]].

The Smithsonian Institution features the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] every June and July which attracts upwards of two million people to hear live performances and view demonstrations of traditional crafts.

Public folklorists also work in "folk arts in the schools" programs, presenting master traditional artists to primary and secondary schools in demonstrations and residencies.  They develop apprenticeship programs to foster the teaching of traditional arts by recognized masters.  They also present traditional music on radio programs such as ''[[American Routes]]'' on [[Public Radio International]].  Occasionally they produce [[documentary film]]s on aspects of traditional arts; Smithsonian folklorist [[Marjorie Hunt]] won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for her 1984 [[Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject|short documentary]] film ''[[The Stone Carvers (film)|The Stone Carvers]]'' about the carvers at the [[National Cathedral]] in Washington, D.C.

{{Fantasy}}
{{Speculative fiction|cTopic=Fantasy fiction}}

A '''quest''' is a journey toward a specific mission or a goal. The word serves as a [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] device in [[mythology]] and [[fiction]]: a difficult [[Travel|journey]] towards a goal, often [[symbol]]ic or [[Allegory|allegorical]].  Tales of quests figure prominently in the [[folklore]] of every nation&lt;ref&gt;Josepha Sherman, ''Once upon a Galaxy'' p 142 {{ISBN|0-87483-387-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethnic nationalism|ethnic culture]].  In [[literature]], the object of a quest requires great exertion on the part of the [[hero]], who must overcome many obstacles, typically including much travel.  The aspect of travel allows the storyteller to showcase exotic locations and cultures (an objective of the narrative, not of the character).&lt;ref&gt;Michael O. Riley, Oz and Beyond: The Fantasy World of L. Frank Baum, p 178-9, {{ISBN|0-7006-0832-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The object of a quest may also have [[supernatural]] properties, often leading the protagonist into other worlds and dimensions. The [[moral]] of a quest tale often centers on the changed [[Moral character|character]] of the hero.

==Quest objects==

[[Image:TheKnightAtTheCrossroads.jpg|left|thumb|''A Knight at the Crossroads'' by [[Viktor Vasnetsov]]]]

The hero normally aims to obtain something or someone by the quest, and with this object to return home.&lt;ref&gt;
[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings: The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p35 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object can be something new, that fulfills a lack in his life, or something that was stolen away from him or someone with authority to dispatch him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale, p 36, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the hero has no desire to return; Sir [[Galahad]]'s quest for the [[Holy Grail]] is to find it, not return with it. A return may, indeed, be impossible: [[Aeneas]] quests for a homeland, having lost Troy at the beginning of [[Virgil]]'s ''Aeneid,'' and he does not return to Troy to re-found it but settles in Italy (to become an ancestor of the Romans).

If the hero does return after the culmination of the quest, he may face [[false hero]]es who attempt to pass themselves off as him,&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p60, {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or his initial response may be a rejection of that return, as [[Joseph Campbell]] describes in his critical analysis of quest literature, ''[[The Hero With a Thousand Faces]]''.

If someone dispatches the hero on a quest, the overt reason may be false, with the dispatcher actually sending him on the difficult quest in hopes of his death in the attempt, or in order to remove him from the scene for a time, just as if the claim were sincere, except that the tale usually ends with the dispatcher being unmasked and punished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Propp]], ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', p77 {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stories with such false quest-objects include the legends of [[Jason]] and [[Perseus]], the fairy tales ''[[The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird]]'', ''[[Go I Know Not Whither and Fetch I Know Not What]]'', and the story of [[Beren and Lúthien]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]''.

The quest object may, indeed, function only as a convenient reason for the hero's journey. Such objects are termed [[MacGuffin]]s. When a hero is on a quest for several objects that are only a convenient reason for his journey, they are termed plot coupons.

==Literary analysis==
The quest, in the form of the [[Monomyth#The Hero's Journey|Hero's Journey]], plays a central role in the [[Monomyth]] described by [[Joseph Campbell]]; the hero sets forth from the world of common day into a land of adventures, tests, and magical rewards.  Most times in a quest, the knight in shining armor wins the heart of a beautiful maiden/ princess.

==Historical examples==
An early quest story tells the tale of [[Gilgamesh]], who seeks a secret to eternal life after the death of [[Enkidu]], including the search for an [[emerald]].

Another ancient quest tale, [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', tells of [[Odysseus]], whom the gods have cursed to wander and suffer for many years before [[Athena]] persuades the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]] to allow him to return home.  Recovering the [[Golden Fleece]] is the object of the travels of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]] in the ''[[Argonautica]]''. [[Cupid and Psyche|Psyche]], having lost Cupid, hunted through the world for him, and was set tasks by [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], including a descent into the [[underworld]].

Many [[fairy tale]]s depict the hero or heroine setting out on a quest, such as:

* ''[[East of the Sun and West of the Moon]]'' where the heroine seeks her husband
* ''[[The Seven Ravens]]'' where the heroine seeks her transformed brothers
* ''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]''
* ''[[The Golden Bird]]'' where the prince sets out to find the golden bird for his father

Other characters may set out with no more definite aim than to "seek their fortune", or even be cast out instead of voluntarily leaving, but learn of something that could aid them along the way and so have their journey transformed from aimless wandering into a quest.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales'', p63, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other characters can also set forth on quests — the hero's older brothers commonly do — but the hero is distinguished by his success.

[[Image:Galahad grail.jpg|left|360px|thumb|"Vision of the Holy Grail" (1890) by [[William Morris]]]]

Many medieval [[Romance (heroic literature)|romances]] sent knights out on quests. The term "[[Knight-errant]]" sprang from this, as ''errant'' meant "roving" or "wandering".  Sir [[Thomas Malory]] included many in ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''.  The most famous—perhaps in all of western literature—centers on the [[Holy Grail]] in [[Arthurian legend]].  This [[monomyth|story cycle]] recounts multiple quests, in multiple variants, telling stories both of the heroes who succeed, like [[Percival]] (in [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]'s [[Parzival]]) or Sir [[Galahad]] (in the [[Queste del Saint Graal]]), and also the heroes who fail, like Sir [[Lancelot]].  This often sent them into a bewildering [[enchanted forest|forest]].  Despite many references to its pathlessness, the forest repeatedly confronts knights with forks and crossroads, of a labyrinthine complexity.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 177, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of their encounters is often explained to the knights—particularly those searching for the [[Holy Grail]]—by [[hermit]]s acting as [[wise old man|wise old men -- or women]].&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 179-81, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Still, despite their perils and chances of error, such forests, being the location where the knight can obtain the end of his quest, are places where the knights may become worthy; one romance has a maiden urging Sir Lancelot on his quest for the Holy Grail, "which quickens with life and greenness like the forest."&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: from Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', p 181, {{ISBN|0-8014-8000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So consistently did knights quest that [[Miguel de Cervantes]] set his [[Don Quixote]] on mock quests in a parody of chivalric tales. Nevertheless, while Don Quixote was a fool, he was and remains a hero of chivalry.

==Modern literature==
Quests continued in modern literature.  Analysis can interpret many (perhaps most) stories as a quest in which the main character is seeking something that he desires,&lt;ref&gt;Robert McKee, ''Story:  Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting'', p 196-7 {{ISBN|0-06-039168-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the literal structure of a journey seeking something is, itself, still common.  Quests often appear in [[fantasy]] literature,&lt;ref&gt;John Grant and John Clute, ''The Encyclopedia of Fantasy'', "Quest ", p 796 {{ISBN|0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Rasselas]] by [[Samuel Johnson]], or ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', where Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion go on a quest for the way back to Kansas, brains, a heart, and courage respectively.&lt;ref&gt;L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, ''The Annotated Wizard of Oz'', p 126-7, {{ISBN|0-517-50086-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quests, also, play a major role in [[Rick Riordan]]'s fantasy books, among them ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'', ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'', and ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]''.

A familiar modern literary quest is [[Frodo Baggins]]'s quest to destroy the [[One Ring]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. H. Auden]], "The Quest Hero", ''Understanding the Lord of the Rings:  The Best of Tolkien Criticism'', p45 {{ISBN|0-618-42253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The One Ring, its baleful power, the difficult method which is the only way to destroy it, and the spiritual and psychological torture it wreaks on its Bearer; [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] uses all these elements to tell a meaningful tale of [[friendship]] and the inner struggle with [[temptation]], against a background of [[epic poetry|epic]] and supernatural warfare.

''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' is often thought of as a quest plot, detailing Holden's search not for a tangible object but for a sense of purpose or reason.

Some writers, however, may devise arbitrary quests for items without any importance beyond being the object of the quest.  These items are known as [[MacGuffin]]s, which is sometimes merely used to compare quests and is not always a derogatory term.  Writers may also motivate characters to pursue these objects by meanings of a [[Self-fulfilling prophecy#Literature, media, and the arts|prophecy]] that decrees it, rather than have them discover that it could assist them, for reasons that are given.

A '''rasika''' is a term for an [[aesthete]] of [[Hindustani classical music]].&lt;ref name="Martínez2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=José Luiz Martínez|title=Semiosis in Hindustani Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OwJRnFIcM4cC&amp;pg=PA166|accessdate=14 July 2013|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-1801-9|pages=166–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is derived from [[Sanskrit]] meaning full of Passion, elegant; with discrimination.

[[File:Percival David Collection DSCF3122 17.jpg|thumb|[[Longquan celadon]] vase, 14th century; the unglazed medallions were coated with a resist before the vase was coated with liquid glaze.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3179870&amp;partId=1 British Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''resist''', used in many areas of manufacturing and art, is something that is added to parts of an object to create a pattern by protecting these parts from being affected by a subsequent stage in the process.&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Resist", 3. "Any composition applied to a surface to protect it in part from the effects of an agent employed on it for some purpose".&lt;/ref&gt; Often the resist is then removed.  For example in the [[resist dyeing]] of textiles, wax or a similar substance is added to places where the dye is not wanted. The wax will "resist" the dye, and after it is removed there will be a pattern in two colours.  [[Batik]], ''[[shibori]]''  and [[tie-dye]] are among many styles of resist dyeing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/r/resist-dyed-textiles/ Resist-dyed textiles], Victoria and Albert Museum, London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoshiko Iwamoto Wada]], Mary Kellogg Rice, Jane Barton, ''Shibori: The Inventive Art of Japanese Shaped Resist Dyeing : Tradition, Techniques, Innovation'', 1999, Kodansha International, {{ISBN|4770023995}}, 9784770023995&lt;/ref&gt;  

Wax or grease can also be used as a resist in pottery, to keep some areas free from a [[ceramic glaze]]; the wax burns away when the piece is fired.&lt;ref&gt;Medley, Margaret, ''The Chinese Potter: A Practical History of Chinese Ceramics'', pp. 151–152, 3rd edition, 1989, Phaidon, {{ISBN|071482593X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Song dynasty]] [[Jizhou ware]] used paper cut-outs and leaves as resists or stencils under glaze to create patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Medley, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt;  Other uses of resists in pottery work with [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]] or paints, and a whole range of modern materials used as resists.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Peter, ''Resist and Masking Techniques'' (Ceramics Handbooks), 1996, University of Pennsylvania Press, 
{{ISBN|0812216113}}, 9780812216110&lt;/ref&gt;  A range of similar techniques can be used in [[watercolour]] and other forms of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Reyner, Nancy, ''Acrylic Revolution: New Tricks and Techniques for Working with the World's Most Versatile Medium'', pp. 40–42, 2007, North Light Books, {{ISBN|1581808046}}, 9781581808049, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w0N_wjD3TBMC&amp;pg=PA40 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Crabtree, Peter Beudert, ''Scenic Art for the Theatre: History, Tools and Techniques'', p. 391, 2012, CRC Press, {{ISBN|1136084304}}, 9781136084300&lt;/ref&gt;  While these artistic techniques stretch back centuries, a range of new applications of the resist principle have recently developed in [[microelectronics]] and [[nanotechnology]]. An example is [[Resist (semiconductor fabrication)|resists in semiconductor fabrication]], using [[photoresist]]s (often just referred to as "resists") in [[photolithography]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Widmann, H. Mader, H. Friedrich, ''Technology of Integrated Circuits'', pp. 92–115, 2013, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, {{ISBN|366204160X}}, 9783662041604, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=nC7wCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Etching]] processes use a resist, though in these typically the whole object is covered in the resist (called the "ground" in some contexts), which is then selectively removed from some parts. This is the case when a resist is used to prepare the copper substrate for [[champlevé]] [[vitreous enamel|enamel]]s, where parts of the field are etched (with [[acid]] or electrically) into hollows to be filled with powdered glass, which is then melted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=R. L. |title=Relief Electro-Etching for Champlevé Enamelling |url=http://www.guildofenamellers.org/index.php/component/phocadownload/category/1-technical-documents?download=4:relief-electro-etching |publisher=Guild of Enamellers |accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[chemical milling]], as many forms of industrial etching are called, the resist may be referred to as the "maskant",&lt;ref&gt;[http://osp.mans.edu.eg/s-hazem/NTM/NTCM.html Nontraditional Chemical Processes]&lt;/ref&gt; and in many contexts the process may be known as [[Masking (in art)|masking]].  A fixed resist pre-shaped with the pattern is often called a [[stencil]], or in some contexts a [[frisket]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Guild Handbook of Scientific Illustration'', ed. Elaine R. S. Hodges, 2003, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0471360112}}, 9780471360117, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gD8pWkA6TcwC&amp;pg=PA194 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] does not record the word "resist" in this sense before the 1830s, when it was used in relation to both "[[calico]]-printing" (1836) and metalwork with copper (1839).&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Resist", 2. and 3. (original edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Resists were also used to etch steel from the mid 19th-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael R.

{{Refimprove|date=June 2008}}
The '''seventh son of a seventh son''' is a concept from [[folklore]] regarding special powers given to, or held by, such a son. The seventh son must come from an unbroken line with no female siblings born between and, in turn, be born to such a seventh son.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Thousand Wonderful Things, Edmund Fillingham King, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; The number {{num|seven}} has a long history of [[7 (number)#In mythology|mystical]] and [[7 (number)#relious|biblical]] significance: [[seven virtues]], [[seven deadly sins]], [[Seven Sleepers]], [[Genesis creation narrative|seven days of creation]], etc. In this case, it refers to a man who is the seventh son of a man who is himself a seventh son.

In some beliefs, the special powers are inborn, inherited simply by virtue of his birth order; in others the powers are granted to him by God or the gods because of his birth order.

==Regional variations==

===Ireland===
The seventh son of a seventh son is gifted as a healer. The seventh son of a seventh son is part of a more general phenomenon known as the "cure" (sometimes also called the "charm").&lt;ref&gt;See A D Buckley 1980 'Unofficial healing in Ulster.' ''Ulster Folklife'' 26, 15–34&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S.===
According to [[Edward Augustus Kendall|Kendall's]] ''Travels through the Northern Parts of the United States, in the year 1807–1808'' while visiting the [[Old Newgate Prison|Newgate copper mine and prison]], the author met an innkeep who told him that "there was to be found in [[Talcott Mountain|the surrounding hills]], a black stone, of a certain species, through which a seventh son of a seventh son, born in the month of February, with a [[Caul#Types|caul]] on his head, can discern everything that lies in the depths and interior of the globe." The author speculates that the importance of mining to the community gave rise to this localized belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holcombegenealogy.com/data/p877.htm |title=Thomas Holcombe of Connecticut - Person Page 877 |publisher=Holcombegenealogy.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Denis Larionov &amp; Alexander Zhulin |url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/edward-augustus-kendall/travels-through-the-northern-parts-of-the-united-states-in-the-year-1807-and-18-ala/page-12-travels-through-the-northern-parts-of-the-united-states-in-the-year-1807-and-18-ala.shtml |title=Travels through the northern parts of the United States, in the year 1807 and 1808 (Volume 2) by Edward Augustus Kendall |page=12 |publisher=Ebooksread.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American author [[Jackson Pearce]] uses the folklore around seventh sons in her novel ''Sisters Red'', in which potential werewolves are seventh sons of seventh sons.&lt;ref&gt;''Werewolves and Other Shapeshifters in Popular Culture'' by Kimberley McMahon-Coleman and Roslyn Weaver, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
It is believed that he will be a [[werewolf]], ''lobizón'' or ''lobisomem'' (the word in Portuguese language that means "werewolf"). To stop the curse the newborn should be baptized in seven different churches, or be baptized by the name of ''Benito'' while the eldest son is his godfather. It is important to note that the local myth of the ''lobizón'' is not connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/29/argentina-kirchner-adopt-child-werewolf |title=No, Argentina's president did not adopt a Jewish child to stop him turning into a werewolf |date= |accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ciarallo" was the seventh son who had the power to enchant and recall snakes, and who was immune to snake venom. It wasn't enough to be a seventh son but was needed a special initiation rite called "inciaramazione". Recourse was made to Ciarallo when a snake sneaked into the house and it is said that the reptile was promptly attracted by the sound of his whistle. Another social task of Ciarallo was "inciaramare" other people by spreading a special oil, complete with a special recipe, on the arm of those who requested the treatment to ensure protection from snakes bites. Children were led to Ciarallo by their mothers to get protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monteneronline.it/arte/tradizioni.htm |title=TRADIZIONI E MITI POPOLARI |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MarquetryOriental.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Oriental marquetry motif]]
'''Straw marquetry''' is a craft very similar to that of wood [[marquetry]], except that straw replaces the [[wood veneer]]. It is thought to have first been practised in the East; examples were brought to England in the 17th century.

To mimic the varying shades of wood veneer, [[wheat]] or [[oat]] straw has to be split, then soaked in cold, warm, or hot water. The strips are then ironed, and there will be a variety of tones from pale gold to deepest dark brown. 

There are accounts of nuns in France and Switzerland making a variety of items using straw marquetry.

The most famous straw marquetry was practised by prisoners of war from the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Dartmoor and other prisons had been built for them; the prison most famous for straw marquetry was Norman Cross, [[Huntingdon]]. 

[[Easter eggs]] are decorated with [[straw]] [[applique]], especially in Eastern European countries. Geometric shapes, stars and flower motifs are the most common themes. There is a slight difference in the way the straw is prepared, however; for marquetry, the straws are soaked, split and ironed; for [[Egg (biology)|egg]] decoration the straw is not ironed.

'''Street poster art''' is a kind of [[graffiti]], more specifically categorized as "street art". Posters are usually handmade or printed graphics on thin paper. It can be understood as an art piece that is installed on the streets as opposed to in a gallery or museum, but by some it is not comprehended as a form of [[contemporary art]].

'''Subtext''' or '''undertone''' is any content of a creative work which is not announced explicitly by the characters or author, but is implicit or becomes something understood by the observer of the work as the production unfolds. Subtext can also refer to the thoughts and motives of the characters which are only covered in an aside. Subtext can also be used to imply controversial subjects without specifically alienating people from the fiction, often through use of [[metaphor]]. Especially in light of their inherently ambiguous and self-referential character, many authors have explicitly used subtexts (or subtexts about subtexts) in humor. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Subtext is content underneath the [[spoken dialogue|dialogue]]. Under dialogue, there can be conflict, [[anger]], [[competition]], [[pride]], showing off, or other implicit ideas and emotions. Subtext is the unspoken thoughts and [[Base motive|motives]] of characters — what they really think and believe. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Subtext is also a frequently used method of subtly inserting social or political commentary into fiction. Subtext is often also inserted in narratives where explicit themes are unable to be shown or expressed due to [[censorship]] or simply interest in appealing to a general audience. Frequently, these subtexts may include a sexual nature or possible references to sexual orientation. {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Their inclusion is such so that they are easily overlooked by younger viewers but may be caught by more mature viewers. Subtext also serves to add complexity to a premise that may superficially appeal to younger viewers but may also attract older fans, as is often the case with cartoons, science fiction and fantasy. It also may serve to aid in [[suspension of disbelief]].

Subtext includes information about the period and culture in which the author of a book is writing that may not be deliberately articulated but is conveyed through the text in speech, social customs or historical details. 

A more recently coined term, '''metamessage''' is considered by some authors to be synonymous with subtext.&lt;ref name="Ballon2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rachel Ballon|title=Breathing Life Into Your Characters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2sSIF2PMmEC&amp;pg=PT240|year=2009|publisher=Writer's Digest Books|isbn=1-59963-342-6|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stevenson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Stevenson|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1112|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-957112-3|page=1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Metamessage'' is a term more commonly used in the analysis of [[business communication]] rather than of literary works.&lt;ref name="LohmannLohmann2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger A. Lohmann|author2=Nancy Lohmann|title=Social Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1JpY07RJXqkC&amp;pg=PT225|year=2013|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50261-0|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=June 2015}}

==Definition==
The author [[David Baboulene]], in his practical academic work on story theory, ''The Story Book'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Baboulene| first = David| title = ''The Story Book - Guidance for writers on story creation, optimisation and problem resolution''| edition = 1st| year = 2010| publisher = DreamEngine Media Ltd| isbn = 978-0-9557089-2-3| pages = 256 pp}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines subtext as "the result of any form of gap in knowledge between any of the participants in a story; for example, between the author and a character, between two characters or between the audience and at least one character."

An example occurs in the 1978 movie [[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]. Lois Lane has just met Clark Kent. The subtext is that she has taken an instant dislike to him. At the surface, however, their conversation seems only to solicit and supply information about the existence of others of Clark Kent's type.  "Any more at home like you?" she inquires. "Uh, not really, no", Clark replies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = ''[http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/superman_I_shoot.txt] http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/superman_I_shoot.txt, View source lines 1718-1722''}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Examples ==
In the play ''[[Ghosts (play)|Ghosts]]'' by [[Henrik Ibsen]], subtext is important in gaining a greater understanding of the characters, as they cannot always speak freely due to the constrictions of social conventions at the time.

A scene in [[Woody Allen]]'s movie ''[[Annie Hall]]'', in which [[subtitles]] explain the characters' inner thoughts during an apparently innocent conversation, is an example of the subtext of a scene being made explicit.

Victorian novels may feature confining social norms such as strict marriage conventions, taboos against births out of wedlock, inheritance to first born sons, etc., that form the subtext of plot and character. These issues can be deployed unconsciously, as in [[Wilkie Collins]]' "The Woman in White" or as part of a concealed critique of gender politics, as in [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s "Jane Eyre".

In the episode "My Best Friend's Bottom" of the British comedy TV series ''[[Coupling (UK TV series)|Coupling]]'', "Captain Subtext" is a tool used in the narrative to explicitly make the viewers aware of the subtextual message in the dialogue. In it, the dialogue and the subtext have been deliberately made humorous.

Television sci-fi such as the original ''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (both of which implicitly avoided onscreen sexual situations) have often been discussed with respect to certain scenes or lines of dialogue.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Cues for the subtext are sometimes given in the main text in the form of ''intertexts'', which are [[allusion]]s to the themes of other texts. An example is ''[[Blade Runner]]'', which can be interpreted as containing numerous biblical (intertextual) allusions, framing the subtext as a religiously inspired theme—the search for the [[Creator deity|Creator]] and the meaning of life beyond physical existence.&lt;ref name="Danesi2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel Danesi|title=Messages, Signs, and Meanings: A Basic Textbook in Semiotics and Communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lDI4mBnS8OoC&amp;pg=PA142|year=2004|publisher=Canadian Scholars’ Press|isbn=978-1-55130-250-8|page=142|edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political use==
Historians have often identified an anticipated future revolution, often without the ruling party's understanding.

Such an example of the power and controversy of subtexts might include the deliverance theme pervasive in the songs, stories, and symbols of the slaves in the United States up through the [[Civil Rights]] era and, perhaps, still today. The slave prayers, with their theme of deliverance, may have seemed subversive, as striking at planter ideology and control &lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DhlT0z9DX3cC&amp;pg=PA111&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;dq=slavery+deliverance+subtext&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sR3Zu9t2Pq&amp;sig=DPczMb3EAQxtXp21ktJfQ0X1lC0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ogy4Us7CEoqihgf86oD4AQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=slavery%20deliverance%20subtext&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtext messages have seen fairly widespread use as a way to combat [[censorship]] in literary works, for example in the former [[Communist bloc]].&lt;ref name="Vianu1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lidia Vianu|title=Censorship in Romania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9eDddelzL0oC&amp;pg=PA25|year=1998|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9116-09-2|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is of course much older; e.g. one find works from the [[middle ages]] criticizing the church establishment. Some of these works use a formal technique called ''double structure'' in which the same text can have different (usually antithetical) meanings by reading sentences or verses in two different orders.&lt;ref name="Shuger2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Debora Shuger|title=Censorship and Cultural Sensibility: The Regulation of Language in Tudor-Stuart England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=66zotoM7eMsC&amp;pg=PA205|year=2006|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0334-8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metamessage ==
{{see also|meta-communication}}
According to a 2008 [[organizational communication]] textbook, ''meta message'' is a term coined by lawyer [[Gerard Nierenberg]] in his 1995 book ''The Art of Negotiating'' to denote (in the words of the textbook) "those messages that are conveyed between the lines of what we explicitly say or write, possibly due to the purpose, context, or timing of the message and/or the relationship between the people communicating".&lt;ref name="BlundelIppolito2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Blundel|author2=Kate Ippolito|title=Effective Organisational Communication: Perspectives, Principles and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jxrepUBc5wC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2008|publisher=FT Prentice Hall|isbn=978-0-273-71375-3|page=10|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also appears in a 1972 book of [[Gregory Bateson]], who suggested a somewhat similar distinction, although in the form of a potentially infinite hierarchy of messages, metamessages, meta-metamessages and so on.&lt;ref name="Bateson1972"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gregory Bateson|title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HewJbnQmn1gC&amp;pg=PA247|year=1972|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-03905-3|pages=247–248 and 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateson argued that any message needs to be interpreted in the [[Linguistic frame of reference|frame of reference]] established by a superordinate message cueing how the textual message is intended.&lt;ref name="Tannen2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Deborah Tannen]]|title=Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk among Friends|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-988515-2|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Wolfe]] points out that Bateson's concepts and terminlogy are rather technical, and are thus commonly misinterpreted. In particular, in Bateson's work the metamessage is the framing message, not the actual (subtext) meaning assigned to the subordinate message in the context of the framing message.&lt;ref name="Wolfe1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Wolfe|title=Marginalized in the Middle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vdSwzN74qgC&amp;pg=PT204|date=January 1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-90517-4|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two decades before introducing the metamessage terminology into his works, Bateson studied by what "mood sign[al]" (his earlier term for metamessage) subordinated messages are interpreted "seriously, jokingly, sarcastically, as gestures of friendliness, as acts of aggression" etc. Invoking [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Theory of Logical Types]], Bateson proposed that for every signal, there is always signal level above it which precisely determines its interpretation. Bateson's theory was however criticized as too rigid and lacking explanatory power for real-world communication phenomena in which signals of any kind (at any level) can be deceitful.&lt;ref name="Jones1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.J. Jones|title=Communication and Meaning: An Essay in Applied Modal Logic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WGYoAAAAMAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-277-1543-2|pages=132–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metamessages can be delivered by a wide variety of means, including [[verbal modifier]]s (like "certainly", "only", "just", etc.),&lt;ref name="McKayDavis2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthew McKay|author2=Martha Davis|author3=Patrick Fanning|title=Messages: The Communication Skills Book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XsPAEpOiUgC&amp;pg=PA75|year=2009|publisher=New Harbinger Publications|isbn=978-1-57224-853-3|pages=75–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and—in spoken communication—by [[paralanguage]],&lt;ref name="Lefevre2010"/&gt; e.g. by [[Rhythm#Linguistics|rhythm]] and [[Pitch accent|pitch]].&lt;ref name="McKayDavis2009"/&gt; Metamessages can also be conveyed by [[body language]].&lt;ref name="Lefevre2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michelle Lefevre|title=Communicating with Children and Young People: Making a Difference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bNv6zH437C0C&amp;pg=PA46|year=2010|publisher=The Policy Press|isbn=978-1-84742-282-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous pipe image from ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'' with the subtitle "ceci n'est pas une pipe" (meaning "this is not a pipe") is sometimes given as an example of metamessage conveyed by paralanguage.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Language, Volume 28, Issues 1-2, J.

'''''The Aesthetic Dimension: Toward a Critique of Marxist Aesthetics''''' ({{lang-de|Die Permanenz der Kunst: Wider eine bestimmte marxistische Ästhetik}}) is a 1977 book on [[aesthetics]] by the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], in which the author provides an account of [[modern art]]'s political implications and relationship with society at large.

It is the final major work by Marcuse, a founding member of the [[Frankfurt School]]. The book is also noteworthy as a demarcation of Marcuse's split with [[Marxism]] via his rejection of [[Marxist aesthetics]].

==Summary==
''The Aesthetic Dimension'' (not to be confused with a chapter from Marcuse's ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' of the same name) is a response to previous writings within [[critical theory]] on the subject of art, notably those of [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Theodor Adorno]]. Marcuse rejected Benjamin's call in "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" for the politicization (i.e., a literal reflection of perceived political realities) of modern, reproducible art both to reflect the state of a society and to incite change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC15folder/WalterBenjamin.html|title=Benjamin's '...Age of Mechanical Reproduction'|author=Richard Kazis|publisher=''Jump Cut''|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like both Benjamin and Adorno, Marcuse believed that art promises resistance to societal repression, and that a cultural revolution is necessarily connected to a political or social revolution. Adorno (as represented mainly by his posthumous ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'') and Marcuse agreed that this possibility must be realized through artistic detachment and symbolism.  Marcuse however offered a more inclusive and less radical suggestion for modern art's source of power than did Adorno, who believed that the works of [[high culture]] were the sole artistic source of potential emancipation.

Marcuse instead pointed to what he perceived to be the successes of high culture and translated these to all areas of art. For Marcuse, art's promise of transcendence could only be fulfilled via a conceptual independence from society, but this independence is accessible through a host of media. The successful artist will attain ''truth'' in his work through ''detachment'' that results in ''symbolic representation.'' This successful art must necessarily invoke a longing for something utopian and the promise of ultimate happiness represented by beauty. This symbolic longing for fulfillment will awaken us from complacency.&lt;ref name="questiaschool.com"&gt;http://www.questiaschool.com/read/82289404  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712013858/http://www.questiaschool.com/read/82289404 |date=July 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcuse stated in the book's introduction that he considered [[literature]] the primary source of his influence for this system, but feels that the ideas would apply to [[music]] and [[plastic arts]] as well.&lt;ref name="questiaschool.com"/&gt;

'''Top-left lighting''' is an artistic convention in which illustrations are produced so that the light appears to come from the top left of the picture.

Most people prefer lighting from the left when resolving a convex-concave ambiguity, and this preference may be stronger for [[right-handedness|right-handed]] people.  This is reflected in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[mosaic]]s and in [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance]], [[baroque painting|baroque]] and [[Impressionism|impressionist]] art.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sun and P. Perona, "Where is the sun?", ''Nature Neuroscience'', 1(3), 183-184, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McManus|first=I Christopher|author2=Joseph Buckman |author3=Euan Woolley |title=Is light in pictures presumed to come from the left side?|journal=Perception|date=2004|volume=33|page=1422|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ian_Mcmanus/publication/8003531_Is_light_in_pictures_presumed_to_come_from_the_left_side/file/79e4151052666c381c.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2014|doi=10.1068/p5289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cartography, the predominant custom of placing the shadow on the right-hand side of [[cartographic relief depiction#Hill profiles|hill profiles]] was established during the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;E. Imhof, ''Cartographic Relief Presentation'', Walter de Gruyter, 1982, reissued by ESRI Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-58948-026-1}}, pp. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Computer interfaces tend to use top left lighting as well, although this trend has gradually shifted more towards light coming straight from the top.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

There are notable exceptions to this convention, such as Sandro Botticelli's [[The_Birth_of_Venus_(Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]] due to the point of view which may represent geographical perspective and location.

The '''Warlis''' or ''Varli''s are an [[indigenous people|indigenous]] [[tribe]] or [[Adivasi]]s, living in mountainous as well as coastal areas of [[Maharashtra]]-[[Gujarat]] border and surrounding areas. They have their own [[animistic]] beliefs, life, customs and traditions, as a result of [[acculturation]] they have adopted many [[Hindu belief]]s. The Warlis speak an unwritten Varli language which belong to the southern zone of the [[Indo-Aryan languages]].

[[File:Warli painting in Warli.JPG|thumb|right|300 px|A painting on a wall of a Warli house, depicting a ''Devchauk'' at the centre and two ''Lagnachauk''s on both the sides]]

==Demographics==
Warlis are found in [[Jawhar]], Mokhada, [[Dahanu]] and [[Talasari]] talukas of the northern [[Thane district]], parts of [[Nashik district|Nashik]] and [[Dhule district|Dhule]] districts of [[Maharashtra]], [[Valsad]], [[Dang District, India|Dangs]], [[Navsari]] and [[Surat]] districts  of [[Gujarat]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_gujarat.pdf Census of India 2001, The Scheduled Tribes of Gujarat]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[union territory|union territories]] of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]] and [[Daman and Diu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Tables_Published/SCST/dh_st_dnh.pdf Census of India 2001, The Scheduled Tribes of Dadra and Nagar Haveli]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Warli speak in [[Varli language]],  classified as [[Marathi–Konkani languages|Konkani]], with some degree
of influence from [[Gujrati language|Gujarati]].

Warli language is classified under Marathi by Grierson (Grierson's Linguistic Survey of India) as well as A.M. Ghatage (Warli of Thana, vol.VII of A Survey of Marathi dialects)

==Warli painting==
{{Main article|Warli painting}}
[[File:Painted prayers, Warli paintings, at Sanskriti Kendra, Anandagram, New Delhi.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Warli paintings, at [[Sanskriti Kendra Museum]], Anandagram, New Delhi.]] 
In the book ''The Painted World of the Warlis'' [[Yashodhara Dalmia]] claimed that the Warlis carry on a tradition stretching back to 2500 or 3000 BCE. Their mural paintings are similar to those done between 500 and 10,000 BCE in the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], in [[Madhya Pradesh]].

Everything about Warli is earthy and soothing. It takes you back to the painting’s provenance where you could almost smell the wet soil, feel the touch of the calloused hand that painted the background and admire meticulous brush stroke of the rural artist who created the master piece. Warli paintings succeed in adding elegance to a rural hut or a five star hotel lobby with the same charm.

No wonder, designers were so enthralled by this art form, that they decided to create an entire line of dresses based on Warli paintings. Designers have used very traditional patterns, rich and folksy colours to recreate the magic of Warli  paintings in her dresses.

Their extremely rudimentary wall paintings use a very basic graphic vocabulary: a circle, a triangle and a square.Their paintings were monosyllabic. The circle and triangle come from their observation of nature, the circle representing the sun and the moon, the triangle derived from mountains and pointed trees. Only the square seems to obey a different logic and seems to be a human invention, indicating a sacred enclosure or a piece of land. So the central motive in each ritual painting is the square, known as the "chauk" or "chaukat", mostly of two types: ''Devchauk'' and ''Lagnachauk''. Inside a ''Devchauk'', we find [[Palaghata]], the mother goddess, symbolizing fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tribhuwan |first1=Robin D.|last2=Finkenauer|first2=Maike|title=Threads Together: A Comparative Study of Tribal and Pre-historic Rock Paintings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBXdIQVeIS0C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=Dev+Chowk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9f3CTKHMAou4vgO_ncDOCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Dev%20Chowk&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|location=Delhi|isbn=81-7141-644-6|pages=13-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significantly, male gods are unusual among the Warli and are frequently related to spirits which have taken human shape. The central motive in these ritual paintings is surrounded by scenes portraying hunting, fishing and farming, festivals and dances, trees and animals. Human and animal bodies are represented by two triangles joined at the tip; the upper triangle depicts the trunk and the lower triangle the pelvis. Their precarious equilibrium symbolizes the balance of the universe, and of the couple, and has the practical and amusing advantage of animating the bodies.

The pared down pictorial language is matched by a rudimentary technique. The ritual paintings are usually done inside the huts. The walls are made of a mixture of branches, earth and cow dung, making a [[Red Ochre]] background for the wall paintings. The Warli use only white for their paintings. Their white pigment is a mixture of rice paste and water with gum as a binding. They use a bamboo stick chewed at the end to make it as supple as a paintbrush. The wall paintings are done only for special occasions such as weddings or harvests. The lack of regular artistic activity explains the very crude style of their paintings, which were the preserve of the womenfolk until the late 1970s. But in the 1970s this ritual art took a radical turn, when [[Jivya Soma Mashe]] and his son [[Balu Mashe]] started to paint, not for any special ritual, but because of his artistic pursuits. Warli painting also featured in Coca-Cola's 'Come home on Diwali' ad campaign in 2010 was a tribute to the spirit of India’s youth and a recognition of the distinct lifestyle of the Warli tribe of Western India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.business-standard.com/article/press-releases/coca-cola-india-celebrates-ancient-warli-folk-art-form-launches-110101200123_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tribal Cultural Intellectual Property==
[[Warli Painting]] is cultural intellectual property of the tribal community. Today, there is an urgent need for preserving this traditional knowledge in tribal communities across the globe. Understanding the need for intellectual property rights, tribal non-profit Organisation "Adivasi Yuva Seva Sangh" initiated efforts to start a registration process in 2011. Now, Warli Painting is registered with a [[Geographical Indication]] under the intellectual property rights act. With the use of technology and the concept of social entrepreneurship, Tribals established the Warli Art Foundation, a non-profit company dedicated to Warli art and related activities.
