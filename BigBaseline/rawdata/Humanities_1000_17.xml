'''Anacoenosis''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|ə|s|iː|ˈ|n|oʊ|s|ᵻ|s}} is a [[figure of speech]] in which the speaker poses a question to an audience in a way that demonstrates a common interest.&lt;ref name="Pogue2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kate Emery Pogue|title=Shakespeare's Figures of Speech: A Reader's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PBXW_wTwBIC&amp;pg=PA80|accessdate=1 June 2013|date=25 June 2009|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-1-4401-5192-7|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==

The term comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀνακοινοῦν}} (''anakoinoûn''), meaning "to communicate, impart".

Anacoenosis typically uses a rhetorical question, where no reply is really sought or required, thus softening what is really a statement or command. 

Asking a question that implies one clear answer is to put others in a difficult position. If they disagree with you, then they risk conflict or derision. In particular if you state the question with certainty, then it makes disagreement seem rude.

Particularly when used in a group, this uses social conformance. If there is an implied agreement by all and one person openly disagrees, then they risk isolating themselves from the group, which is a very scary prospect.

If I am in an audience and the speaker uses anacoenosis and I do not agree yet do not speak up, then I may suffer cognitive dissonance between my thoughts and actions. As a result, I am likely to shift my thinking toward the speaker's views in order to reduce this tension.

==Examples==
*Do you not think we can do this now?
*Now tell me, given the evidence before us, could you have decided any differently?
*What do you think? Are we a bit weary? Shall we stay here for a while?
*"And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard. What could I have done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it?" Isaiah 5:3-4
*The entire speech of Marc Anthony in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s Julius Caesar forms an extended example of anacoenosis. Marc Anthony begins by building common cause with the audience on stage, addressing them as "Friends, Romans, countrymen..." His speech then poses a number of rhetorical questions to them as part of his refutation of Brutus' words: "Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? / When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept: / Ambition should be made of sterner stuff: / Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;/ And Brutus is an honourable man. / You all did see that on the Lupercal / I thrice presented him a kingly crown, / Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?" (Act 3, Scene 2)

'''Anthropogeny''' is the '''study of human origins'''. It is not simply a synonym for [[human evolution]] by [[natural selection]], which is only a part of the processes involved in human origins. Many other factors besides biological [[evolution]] were involved, ranging over climatic, geographic, ecological, social, and cultural ones. Anthropogenesis, meaning the process or point of becoming human, is also called [[hominization]].

==History of usage==
{{Life timeline}}
The term ''anthropogeny'' was used in the 1839 edition of [[Robert Hooper (physician)|Hooper]]'s  ''Medical Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hooper (physician)|Robert Hooper]], M.D. (1839) ''A New Medical Dictionary Containing the Explanation of the Terms in Anatomy, Chemistry, Physiology, Pharmacy, Practice of Physic, Surgery, Materia Medica, Midwifery, and the Various Branches of Natural Philosophy Connected with Medicine''. Philadelphia: M. Carey &amp; Son, Benjamin Warner, and Edward Parker. Griggs &amp; Company Printers.&lt;/ref&gt; and was defined as "the study of the generation of man". The term was popularized by [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel]] (1834–1919), a German [[naturalist]] and [[zoologist]], in his groundbreaking books, ''Natural History of Creation''&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haeckel (1868) ''The History of Creation''. New York: D. Appleton and Company&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Natürliche Schöpfungsgeschicht'') (1868) and ''The Evolution of Man''&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Haeckel (1897) ''The Evolution of Man: A Popular Exposition of the Principal Points of Human Ontogeny and Phylogeny'', Volumes 1 and 2. English Translation. New York: D. Appleton and Company&lt;/ref&gt; (German: ''Anthropogenie'') (1874). Haeckel was one of the first biologists to publish on [[evolution]]. Haeckel used the term Anthropogeny to refer to the study of comparative embryology and defined it as "the history of the evolution of man". The term changed over time, however, and came to refer to the study of human origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mason |first1=Otis T.|authorlink=Otis T. Mason|year=1880|title=Sketch of North American Anthropology in 1879|url=|journal=[[The American Naturalist]]|volume=14|issue=5|pages=348–356|doi=10.1086/272557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last use of the word ''anthropogeny'' in English literature was in 1933 by [[William K. Gregory]].&lt;ref name="gregory" /&gt; There was a gap in the usage of the term from 1933 to 2008. Anthropogeny was reintroduced in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Varki|first1=Ajit|authorlink=Ajit Varki|authorlink2=Daniel Geschwind|authorlink3=Evan Eichler|last2=Geschwind|first2=Daniel|last3=Eichler|first3=Evan|year=2008|title = Explaining human uniqueness: genome interactions with environment, behaviour and culture|url=|journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]]|volume=9|issue=10|pages=749–763|doi=10.1038/nrg2428|pmc=2756412}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now back in academic use at the [[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA) at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

==Anthropogeny vs. anthropology==
{{disputed section|date=June 2018|reason=Seems to be using words incorrectly and making incorrect intepretations from the evidence.}} 
The root in ancient Greek ''[[Adam Kadmon#Gnosticism|anthropos]]'' means human and ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'' means discourse or study, and ''[[wiktionary:-genesis]]'' means the process of creation or origin.
''Anthropology'', therefore, is quite literally the study of humans, whereas ''anthropogeny'' is the breakdown of the word anthropos agai but with the link word -geny (γένη, γένος) which again literally means the study of the birth and gender of humans.

According to the ancient Greeks who came up with the terms, anthropology is the sum of many sciences relating to the human study. There is social, economic, civil and comparative anthropology.

Anthropogony derives from the word 'anthropo' again and -gony (γόνοι), meaning 'the causing of, the birth of', both in a literal and metaphorical sense, referring to what caused by human born or/and conceived/created.

Anthropogeny on the other, is whatever derives from humans. -geny ('γένης᾽), meaning 'the born' or who is born of, but also the gender.

According to Gregory (1933), anthropologists are interested in measuring and quantifying aspects of being human, whereas anthropogenists are interested in "piecing together the broken story of the 'big parade' that nature has staged across the ages".&lt;ref name="gregory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=William K.|year=1985|title=The New Anthropogeny: Twenty-Five Stages of Vertebrate Evolution From Silurian Chordate to Man|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=77|pages=29–40|doi=10.1126/science.77.1985.29|pmid=17792389}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the definition of the words, Gregory's statement is wrong.

So anthropology is the study of humans and anthropogeny, is the study of what humans 'gave birth to', to its core definition, although there have been many confusions by those who do not really have an understanding of the word's origins.

Modern anthropology is typically divided into four sub-fields: [[social anthropology]] or [[cultural anthropology]], [[biological anthropology]], [[linguistic anthropology]], and [[archaeology]]. The field of anthropology has origins in the [[natural sciences]], [[humanities]], and [[social sciences]].

The field of anthropogeny is also influenced by the natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences, however, given that it is the study of the origin of humans, it is also influenced by fields ranging from [[anatomy]] and [[biomechanics]] to [[neurology]] and [[genetics]].

A comprehensive list of Domains of Scientific Discipline relevant to anthropogeny can be found in the [http://carta.anthropogeny.org/content/about-moca/ Matrix of Comparative Anthropogeny (MOCA)], associated with the [[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]] (CARTA), at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

'''Archeogeography''' is an academic discipline that deals with the dynamics of [[space]] over time and helps to explore other dimensions of [[Historical geography|geohistorical]] objects that have been made so far by the disciplines of historical geography, the geo-history and [[archaeology]] of the landscape or the environment.

'''Arts and letters''' is a traditional term for the [[fine arts]] and [[literature]] considered together. The category defined as "arts and letters" may also include the [[performing arts]], [[visual arts]], or [[liberal arts]].

==History==
By the late 19th century the term was used to name a few arts-related institutions in the [[United States]]. A [[subscription]]-based Theatre of Arts and Letters opened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1892, but closed within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| jstor=3204417
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] was founded in 1904.

The term has also figured in [[higher education]]. For example, by 1889 students at [[Swarthmore College]] were sorted into two categories of study: "Arts and Letters" or "Science and Engineering."&lt;ref&gt;''Twenty-first Annual Catalogue of Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa., 1889-90''. Philadelphia: Press of Friends' Book Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, course requirements at the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences have included a "sector" (category) called "Arts and Letters." The college defines the sector as including "visual arts, literature and music, together with the criticism surrounding them."&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences, ''The College Curriculum''  http://www.college.upenn.edu/curriculum/2010/sectors.php, accessed 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert-subject|literature|date=February 2012}}
'''Chiastic structure''', or '''chiastic pattern''', is a [[literary technique]] in [[motif (narrative)|narrative motif]]s and other textual passages.  An example of chiastic structure would be two ideas, A and B, together with variants A' and B', being presented as A,B,B',A'.  Alternative names{{cn|date=August 2015}} include '''ring structure''', because the opening and closing 'A' can be viewed as completing a circle, '''palistrophe''',&lt;ref&gt;The term "palistrophe" was coined in:  {{citation |first= Sean E. |last= McEvenue |title= The Narrative Style of the Priestly Writer |publisher= Biblical Institute Press |place= Rome |year= 1971 |oclc= 292126 }}.{{page needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or symmetric structure. It may be regarded as [[chiasmus]] scaled up from clauses to larger units of text.

These often [[symmetric]]al patterns are commonly found in ancient literature such as the [[epic poetry]] of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Classicist Bruno Gentili describes this technique as "the cyclical, circular, or 'ring' pattern (''ring composition''). Here the idea that introduced a compositional section is repeated at its conclusion, so that the whole passage is framed by material of identical content"&lt;ref&gt;Gentili, Bruno, ''Poetry and Its Public in Ancient Greece: From Homer to the Fifth Century'', trans. A. Thomas Cole (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1988), 48&lt;/ref&gt;. Meanwhile in classical prose, scholars often find chiastic narrative techniques in the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Herodotus frequently uses ring composition or ‘epic regression’ as a way of supplying background information for something discussed in the narrative. First an event is mentioned briefly, then its precedents are reviewed in reverse chronological order as far back as necessary; at that point the narrative reverses itself and moves forward in chronological order until the event in the main narrative line is reached again."&lt;ref&gt;Boedeker, Deborah. "Epic Heritage and Mythical Patterns in Herodotus." Published in ''Companion to Herodotus'', ed. Egbert J. Bakker, Irene J. F. de Jong, and Hans van Wees (Brill, 2002), 104–05.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Various chiastic structures are also seen in the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[New Testament]], and the [[Quran]]. 

Chiastic structures also appear in [[Ancient Greek sculpture]]. The [[contrapposto]] technique of sculpture in Ancient Greek sculpture often lead to this chiastic structure, such as in the [[Diadumenos]] of [[Polykleitos]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Chiastic.svg|thumb|120px|When read left to right, up to down, the first topic (A) is reiterated as the last, and the middle concept (B) appears twice in succession. (Also, the middle concept could appear just once.)]]
The term ''chiastic'' derives from the mid-17th century term [[chiasmus]], which refers to a ''crosswise arrangement'' of concepts or words that are repeated in reverse order. ''Chiasmus'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''khiasmos'', a word that is ''khiazein'', marked with the letter ''[[Chi (letter)|khi]]''. From ''khi'' comes ''chi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Chiasmus |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/chiasmus |work=Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2014-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chi'' is made up of two lines crossing each other as in the shape of an ''X''. The line that starts leftmost on top, comes down, and  is rightmost on the bottom, and vice versa. If one thinks of the lines as concepts, one sees that concept A, which comes first, is also last, and concept B, which comes after A, comes before A. If one adds in more lines representing other concepts, one gets a chiastic structure with more concepts.
See Proverbs 1:20-33; vs 20-21=A, v 22=B, v 23=C, vs 24-25=D, vs 26-28=E, vs 29-30=D', v 31=C', v 32=B', v 33=A'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Garrett|1993|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mnemonic device==
[[Oral literature]] is especially rich in chiastic structure, possibly as an aid to memorization. In his study of the [[Iliad]] and the [[Odyssey]], Cedric Whitman, for instance, finds a chiastic structure "of the most amazing virtuosity" that simultaneously performed both aesthetic and mnemonic functions, permitting the oral poet to easily recall the basic formulae of the composition during performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Cedric M. |last= Whitman |title= Homer and the Heroic Tradition |place= Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |year= 1958 |oclc= 310021 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Hebrew Bible==

{{main|Book of Daniel#Chiasm in the Aramaic section}}

In 1986, [[William H. Shea]] proposed that the [[Book of Daniel]] is composed of a ''double-chiasm''. He argued that the chiastic structure is emphasized by the two languages that the book is written in: [[Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew]]. The first chiasm is written in ''Aramaic'' from chapters 2-7 following an ABC...CBA pattern. The second chiasm is in ''Hebrew'' from chapters 8-12, also using the ABC...CBA pattern. However, Shea represents Daniel 9:26 as "D", a break in the center of the pattern.&lt;ref name="Shea"&gt;{{harvnb|Shea|1986|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Wenham]] has analyzed the [[Genesis flood narrative|Genesis Flood narrative]] and has shown that it is essentially an elaborate chiasm.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon J. Wenham, "The Coherence of the Flood Narrative" ''Vetus Testamentum'' 28 (1978) 336–348.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the earlier study of grammatical structure by F. I.  Andersen,&lt;ref&gt;F. I. Andersen, ''The Sentence in Biblical Hebrew'' (The Hague, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt; Wenham illustrated a chiastic structure as displayed in the following two tables.

::::::G: Food (6:21)
:::::::H: Animals in man’s hands (7:2–3)
::::::::I: Entering the Ark (7:13–16)

|}

Within this overall structure, there is a numerical mini-chiasm of 7s, 40s, and 150s:
{| class="wikitable" 
|-
|+ Chiasm of the numbers 7, 40, and 150
|-
|α: Seven days waiting to enter Ark (7:4)
:β: Second mention of seven days waiting (7:10)
::γ: 40 days (7:17)
:::δ: 150 days (7:24)
::::χ: God remembers Noah (8:1)
:::δ': 150 days (8:3)
::γ': 40 days (8:6)
:β': Seven days waiting for dove (8:10)
α': Second seven days waiting for dove (8:12)
|}

The two mentions of the 150 days refer to the same period, and the first 40 days (7:13,17) are part of the 150 days. All this is consistent with the date in 8:4. There was no compelling reason to repeat the first 7-day figure of waiting to enter the Ark except for the corresponding two 7-day figures for the dove. The second mention of the 150 days was also because of the chiasmus. The chiastic structure explains the repetition of these figures. Before these ancient literary conventions were recognized, followers of the [[Documentary Hypothesis]] explained the repetition by hypothesizing two different authors or redactors (J or Jahwist and P or Priestly sources). The repetition may also show the literary artistry of a single author or editor, either working from one tradition or weaving together the J and P sources in chiastic fashion.

==Use in the Quran==

While there are many examples of chiastic structure in the Quran, perhaps the most well known is in the 'Verse of the Throne' or 'Ayat al-Kursi'. The verse contains 9 sentences which exhibit chiasmus, but perhaps more interesting is that it is found in the longest chapter of the Quran, [[Al-Baqara]], which itself contains a fractal chiastic structure in its 286 verses, i.e. where each (outer) chiasm is composed of (inner) chiastic structures reflected in some sense in the analogue outer chiasm. One such analysis of the chapter is shown below (from &lt;ref&gt;Abu Zakariya, "Ring Theory: the Quran’s Structural Coherence", September 21 2015, https://www.islam21c.com/islamic-thought/ring-theory-the-qurans-structural-coherence/ &lt;/ref&gt;; alternate and/or more detail analyses can be found in &lt;ref&gt;Raymond K. Farrin, "Surat al‐Baqara: A Structural Analysis", January 19 2010, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1478-1913.2009.01299.x&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Hassan uz Zaman Shamol, http://understandquran.com/coherence-evidence-of-the-qurans-literary-depth.html&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt; Muhammad Rizvi , " Symmetry in Sura al-Baqara", June 01 2018, https://tgminitiative.blogspot.com/2018/06/symmetry-in-sura-al-baqara.html &lt;/ref&gt;).

==ABC…CBA pattern==

===''Beowulf''===
In literary texts with a possible [[Oral literature|oral]] origin, such as ''[[Beowulf]]'', chiastic or ring structures are often found on an intermediate level, that is, between the (verbal and/or grammatical) level of [[chiasmus]] and the higher level of chiastic structure such as noted in the Torah. John D. Niles provides examples of chiastic figures on all three levels.&lt;ref name="Niles"&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=924–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that for the instances of ll. 12–19, the announcement of the birth of (Danish) Beowulf, are chiastic, more or less on the verbal level, that of chiasmus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=924–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, each of the three main fights are organized chiastically, a chiastic structure on the level of verse paragraphs and shorter passages. For instance, the simplest of these three, the fight with [[Grendel]], is schematized as follows:

A: Preliminaries
*Grendel approaching
*Grendel rejoicing
*Grendel devouring Handscioh
:B: Grendel's wish to flee ("fingers cracked")
::C: Uproar in hall; Danes stricken with terror
:::HEOROT IN DANGER OF FALLING
::C': Uproar in hall; Danes stricken with terror
:B': "Joints burst"; Grendel forced to flee
A': Aftermath
*Grendel slinking back toward fens
*Beowulf rejoicing
*Beowulf left with Grendel's arm&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|pp=925–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, Niles provides a diagram of the highest level of chiastic structure, the organization of the poem as a whole, in an introduction, three major fights with interludes before and after the second fight (with Grendel's mother), and an epilogue. To illustrate, he analyzes Prologue and Epilogue as follows:

'''Prologue'''&lt;br&gt;
A: Panegyric for [[Scyld]]&lt;br&gt;
:B: Scyld's funeral
::C: History of Danes before [[Hroðgar|Hrothgar]]
:::D: Hrothgar's order to build [[Heorot]]

'''Epilogue'''&lt;br&gt;
:::D': Beowulf's order to build his barrow
::C': History of [[Geats]] after Beowulf ("messenger's prophecy")
:B': Beowulf's funeral
A': Eulogy for Beowulf&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niles|1979|p=930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Paradise Lost''===
The overall chiastic structure of  [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' is also of the ABC…CBA type:

A: Satan's sinful actions (Books 1–3)&lt;br&gt;
:B: Entry into Paradise (Book 4)
::C: War in heaven (destruction) (Books 5–6)
::C': Creation of the world (Books 7–8)
:B': Loss of paradise (Book 9)
A': Humankind's sinful actions (Books 10–12)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first= Leland |last= Ryken |chapter= Paradise Lost by John Milton (1608–1674) |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HsZuZPCPlhUC&amp;pg=PA138 |editor1-last= Kapic |editor1-first= Kelly M. |editor2-last= Gleason |editor2-first= Randall C. |year= 2004 |title= The Devoted Life: An Invitation to the Puritan Classics |location= Downers Grove, Illinois |publisher= [[Inter-Varsity Press]] |pages= 138–151 |isbn= 978-0-8308-2794-7 |oclc= 55495010 |url= http://www.ivpress.com/cgi-ivpress/book.pl/code=2794 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|141}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4512">'''Cluster criticism''' is a method of [[rhetorical criticism]] in which a critic examines the structural relations and associative meanings between certain main ideas, concepts, or subjects present in a text. 

==Method== 
There are three steps in performing a cluster criticism: identifying key terms, creating clusters from associated elements, and examining and comparing clusters.&lt;ref name="isbn1-57766-318-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Foss, Sonja K. |title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice |publisher=Waveland Pr Inc |location= |year=1996 |chapter=Cluster Criticism |pages=367–70 |isbn=1-57766-318-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Identify Key Terms===
First, key terms are identified.  These are generally the ideas, subjects, topics, or arguments that work discusses.  They usually (but not always) occur more often than any other element in the work; they can also be identified in a work's introduction.  
===Create Clusters from Associated Elements===
Next, the critic identifies surrounding elements in the text that refer to or are associated with each of the key terms.  Each collection of associated elements which refer to the same key term is called a cluster.  
===Examine and Compare Clusters===
In the final step of the criticism, the critic examines how each specific cluster represents its referring key term.  This process typically includes directly contrasting one cluster with another.  By doing this, a critic can determine how a text privileges one key term over others.

This stage of cluster criticism can incorporate other methods in [[rhetorical criticism]].  For example, if different types of [[metaphor]]s are found in different clusters, a critic can perform multiple [[metaphoric criticism]]s in order to show how each key term characterizes a particular position or entity.

==Example==
The following is an excerpt from a speech titled [[s:Americanism (Harding)|"Americanism"]] given by [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1920 regarding aid to European nations devastated by World War I.  Terms '''bolded''' are those a critic might associate with the key term "Old World stabilization" and terms &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; are those a critic might associate with the key term "stabilize America."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It's time to '''idealize''', but it's very &lt;u&gt;practical&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;make sure&lt;/u&gt; our own &lt;u&gt;house&lt;/u&gt; is in perfect &lt;u&gt;order&lt;/u&gt; before we '''attempt''' the '''miracle''' of '''Old World stabilization'''. Call it the &lt;u&gt;selfishness of nationality&lt;/u&gt; if you will. I think it's an &lt;u&gt;inspiration&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;patriotic devotion&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;safeguard&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;stabilize America&lt;/u&gt; first, to &lt;u&gt;prosper&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;think&lt;/u&gt; of &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;exalt&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;live&lt;/u&gt; for and &lt;u&gt;revere&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;. Let the '''internationalist''' '''dream''' and the '''Bolshevist''' '''destroy'''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this example, the critic would examine the cluster of words and phrases around the key term "Old world stabilization" in order to find certain patterns.  Terms like idealize, miracle, dream, and attempt depict reconstruction through aid as an unproven strategy; internationalist and Bolshevist characterize supporters of aid as foreign and Communist; and the ending word 'destroy' implies a disastrous consequence for the proposal.  In all, a critic can assume that these clusters work together to present aid for European reconstruction as an irresponsible and un-American plan. 

In stark contrast, the terms in the cluster around "stabilize America" construct a rejection of the proposal as the only responsible and American choice.  Terms like make sure, think, practical, order, safeguard, live, and prosper construct a refusal of European reconstruction as safe and sensible.  The words inspiration, exalt, and revere function with the phrases "patriotic devotion" and "selfishness of nationality" to characterize a refusal of aid as a positive, patriotic act.  Finally, the repeated phrase "America first" dichotomizes the issue into a choice between placing America or Europe first, with no middle ground.

The conclusion of this cluster criticism would therefore be that Harding advances his argument by constructing European aid as an irresponsible and un-American policy and a rejection of aid as a responsible, pro-American policy as well as framing the issue as an irreconcilable choice between the interests of America and Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2047">The '''Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art''' (CIHA) is an international committee that endeavors to improve [[art history|art historical]] research.

It was created in 1930 in order to develop the historical and methodological study of artistic activities and productions; to ensure permanent links between [[art historian]]s of all countries; to improve methods of art historical teaching and research; and to increase the research resources available to art historians, i.e. data bases, bibliographies, photographic and [[Iconography|iconographical]] documentation. It stimulates international meetings of art historians and co-ordinates the dissemination of information about research undertaken under the aegis of the committee. Its conferences, publications and research projects disseminate information and publicity about art historical activities world-wide.

The CIHA is currently directed by Professor LaoZhu from Peking University in China. Former director is Georg Ulrich Großmann, director of the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]]. Former members of the board included [[Millard Meiss]], [[Herbert von Einem]], [[Jan Gerrit Van Gelder]], [[Mario Salmi]], [[André Chastel]], [[Jacques Thuillier]], [[Jan Białostocki]] and many other well-known art historians.

Every four years, the Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art holds a major Congress. The thirty-fourth Congress in the History of Art, organized by CIHA members, took place in Beijing, China, in September 2016. 

The [[National Committee for the History of Art]] (NCHA) is the U.S. affiliate of the Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art.

'''Corpus Córporum''' (Lat. "the collection of collections") or in full, ''Corpus Córporum: repositorium operum latinorum apud universitatem Turicensem'', is a digital [[Medieval Latin]] library developed by the [[University of Zurich]], Institute for Greek and Latin Philology. As of May 2016, the repository contains a total of 137,982,350 words, including the entire [[Patrologia Latina]], the [[Vulgate]], Corpus Thomisticum and numerous other medieval and [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] collections of religious, literary and scientific texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/index.php?lang=0 Link to home page] of the project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The non-commercial site, still under development (''in statu nascendi'') at mlat.uzh.ch, is conceived as a text (meta-)repository with a set of research tools. It is being developed under the direction of Phillip Roelli, and it uses only free and open software.

The project aims to provide a platform for standardised (TEI) xml-files of copyright-free Latin texts; to make the texts searchable in complex manners; and to function as an online platform for the publication of Latin texts (e.g. the [[Richard Rufus of Cornwall|Richard Rufus]] Project's corpus at Stanford University).

Texts are divided into searchable corpora on specific topics, e.g. one corpus consists of ten Latin translations of Aristotle's ''Physica''.&lt;ref&gt;Project's [http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/index.php?lang=0 About page].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology |theories}}

'''Cross-cultural studies''', sometimes called '''holocultural studies''' or '''comparative studies''', is a specialization in [[anthropology]] and sister sciences ([[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[economics]], [[political science]]) that uses field data from many [[Society|societies]] to examine the scope of [[human behavior]] and test hypotheses about human behavior and culture. Cross-cultural studies is the third form of cross-cultural comparisons. The first is comparison of case studies, the second is controlled comparison among variants of a common derivation,{{Clarify|date=January 2010}} and the third is comparison within a sample of cases. Unlike comparative studies, which examines similar characteristics of a few societies, cross-cultural studies uses a sufficiently large sample so that statistical analysis can be made to show relationships or lack of relationships between the traits in question. These studies are surveys of [[ethnography|ethnographic]] data.

Cross-cultural studies are applied widely in the [[social science]]s, particularly in [[cultural anthropology]] and [[psychology]].

==History==
The first cross-cultural studies were carried out by 19th-century anthropologists such as [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] and [[Lewis H. Morgan]]. One of Edward Tylor's first studies gave rise to the central statistical issue of cross-cultural studies: [[Galton's problem]]. In the recent decades historians and particularly historians of science started looking at the mechanism and networks by which knowledge, ideas, skills, instruments and books moved across cultures, generating new and fresh concepts concerning the order of things in nature. In ''Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges in the Eastern Mediterranean 1560–1660'' Avner Ben-Zaken has argued that cross-cultural exchanges take place at a cultural hazy locus where the margins of one culture overlaps the other, creating a "mutually embraced zone" where exchanges take place on mundane ways. From such a stimulating zone, ideas, styles, instruments and practices move onward to the cultural centers, urging them to renew and update cultural notions.&lt;ref&gt;Avner Ben-Zaken, "From "Incommensurability of Cultures" to Mutually Embraced Zones" in ''Cross-Cultural Scientific Exchanges In the Eastern Mediterranean 1560-1660'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010)], pp. 163-167. {{ISBN|9780801894763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern era of cross-cultural studies==

The modern era of cross-cultural studies began with [[George Murdock]] (1949).&lt;ref&gt;Whiting (1986:305)&lt;/ref&gt; Murdock set up a number of foundational data sets, including the [[Human Relations Area Files]], and the ''Ethnographic Atlas.'' Together with [[Douglas R. White]], he developed the widely used [[Standard Cross-Cultural Sample]], currently maintained by the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] electronic journal [[World Cultures]].

'''Cultural identity''' is the [[Identity (social science)|identity]] or feeling of belonging to a group. It is part of a person's self-conception and [[self-perception]] and is related to [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], [[social class]], [[generation]], [[locality (settlement)|locality]] or any kind of social group that has its own distinct [[culture]]. In this way, cultural identity is both characteristic of the [[individual]] but also of the culturally identical group of members sharing the same cultural identity or upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;Moha Ennaji, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DXsF7fT318QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22cultural%20identity%22&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Multilingualism, Cultural Identity, and Education in Morocco]'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2005, pp.19-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Child With Flag.jpg|thumb|Child with flag and a gun]]
Various modern [[cultural studies]] and [[social theories]] have investigated cultural identity and understanding . In recent decades, a new form of identification has emerged which breaks down the understanding of the individual as a coherent whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers. These cultural identifiers may be the result of various conditions including: [[Location (geography)|location]], [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[history]], [[nationality]], [[language]], [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[religious beliefs]], [[ethnicity]], [[aesthetics]], and even [[food]].&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturing Taste: TheWalrus.ca&lt;/ref&gt; As one author writes, recognizing both coherence and fragmentation:

{{cquote|categorizations about identity, even when codified and hardened into clear typologies by processes of colonization, state formation or general modernizing processes, are always full of tensions and contradictions. Sometimes these contradictions are destructive, but they can also be creative and positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2015 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Despite the Terrors of Typologies: The Importance of Understanding Categories of Difference and Identity | url=https://www.academia.edu/11768378 | journal= Interventions: International Journal of Postcolonial Studies | volume=  17 | issue=  2 | pages= 174–195 | doi=10.1080/1369801x.2014.993332}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The divisions between cultures can be very fine in some parts of the world, especially in rapidly changing cities where the population is ethnically diverse and social unity is based primarily on locational contiguity.

As a "historical reservoir," culture is an important factor in shaping identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Nicola |last=Pratt |title=Identity, Culture and Democratization: The Case of Egypt |journal=New Political Science |volume=27 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=69–86 |doi=10.1080/07393140500030832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since one of the main characteristics of a culture is its "historical reservoir," many if not all groups entertain revisions, either consciously or unconsciously, in their historical record in order to either bolster the strength of their cultural identity or to forge one which gives them precedent for actual reform or change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=A Discussion On The Purpose of Cultural Identity|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|publisher=The Apollonian Revolt|accessdate=10 April 2015|date=2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419090905/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some critics of cultural identity argue that the preservation of cultural identity, being based upon difference, is a divisive force in society, and that [[cosmopolitanism]] gives individuals a greater sense of shared citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_A6qIkbYB_kC ''The Limits of Nationalism''] by Chaim Gans. {{ISBN|978-0-521-00467-1}} {{ISBN|0521004675}}&lt;/ref&gt; When considering practical association in international society, states may share an inherent part of their 'make up' that gives common ground and an alternative means of identifying with each other.&lt;ref&gt;C Brown (2001) ''Understanding International Relations''. Hampshire, Palgrave&lt;/ref&gt; Nations provide the framework for culture identities called external cultural reality, which influences the unique internal cultural realities of the individuals within the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Terrence N TiceTHE EDUCATION DIGEST, V. 64 (9), 05/1999, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of interest is the interplay between cultural identity and [[new media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = C. L. | year = 2010 | title = New media and cultural identity | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/New+media+and+cultural+identity.-a0219656567 | journal = China Media Research | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | page = 86 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than necessarily representing an individual's interaction within a certain group, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the [[agenda setting|social norms as presented by the media]]. Accordingly, instead of learning [[behaviour]] and knowledge from cultural/religious groups, individuals may be learning these social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insanbilimleri.com/ojs/index.php/uib/article/view/406|title=Media and cultural identity - Mora - International Journal of Human Sciences|website=insanbilimleri.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A range of cultural complexities structure the way individuals operate with the cultural realities in their lives. [[Nation]] is a large factor of the cultural complexity, as it constructs the foundation for individual's identity but it may contrast with ones cultural reality. Cultural identities are influenced by several different factors such as ones [[religion]], ancestry, skin colour, language, [[Class (social)|class]], education, profession, skill, family and political [[Propositional attitude|attitudes]]. These factors contribute to the development of one's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Adrian|title=Complexity in cultural identity|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|date=May 2010|volume=10|issue=2|page=177|doi=10.1080/14708470903267384-2196217058202341170.pdf|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural identity is essentially how we as individuals cater to all positions of our lives. We may be teachers, students, friends, bosses, employees, etc. How we act and how our schemas contribute to our positions are the building blocks of your overall cultural identity.

==Cultural arena==
It is also noted that an individual's "[[Social environment|cultural arena]]", or place where one lives, impacts the culture that that person chooses to abide by. The surroundings, the environment, the people in these places play a factor in how one feels about the culture they wish to adopt. Many immigrants find the need to change their culture in order to [[Acculturation|fit into the culture]] of most citizens in the country. This can conflict with an immigrant's current [[World view|belief in their culture]] and might pose a problem, as the immigrant feels compelled to choose between the two presenting cultures.

Some might be able to adjust to the various cultures in the world by [[Biculturalism|committing to two or more cultures]]. It is not required to stick to one culture. Many people socialize and interact with people in one culture in addition to another group of people in another culture. Thus cultural identity is able to take many forms and can change depending on the cultural area. The nature of the impact of cultural arena has changed with the advent of the Internet, bringing together groups of people with shared cultural interests who before would have been more likely to integrate into their real world cultural arena. This plasticity is what allows people to feel like part of society wherever they go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holliday | first1 = A | year = 2010 | title = Complexity in cultural identity | url = | journal = Language and Intercultural Communication | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 165–177 | doi = 10.1080/14708470903267384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Language develops from the wants of the people who tend to disperse themselves in a common given location over a particular period of time. This tends to allow people to share a way of life that generally links individuals in a certain culture that is identified by the people of that group. The affluence of communication that comes along with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Language can function as a fluid and ever changing identifier, and can be developed in response or rebellion of another cultural code, such as creole languages in the US &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Stuart|last2=Ghazoul|first2=Ferial|date=2012-01-01|title=Cultural identity and diaspora|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA302403835&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=fulltext&amp;issn=11108673&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1&amp;isAnonymousEntry=true|journal=Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics|language=English|issue=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Language also includes the way people speak with peers, family members, authority figures, and strangers, including the tone and familiarity that is included in the language.

Language learning process can also be affected by cultural identity via the understanding of specific words, and the preference for specific words when learning and using a [[Multilingualism|second language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Bok-Myung|title=Cultural Identity in Korean English|journal=Journal of Pan-Pacific Association of Applied Linguistics|year=2010|volume=14|issue=1|pages=131–145|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=EJ920507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since many aspects of a person's cultural identity can be changed, such as citizenship or influence from outside cultures can change cultural traditions, language is a main component of cultural identity.

==Education==
Kevin McDonough pointed out, in his article, several factors concerning support or rejection of the government for different cultural identity education systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McDonough | first1 = Kevin | year = 1998 | title = Can the Liberal State Support Cultural Identity Schools? | url = | journal = American Journal of Education | volume = 106 | issue = 4| pages = 463–499 | doi=10.1086/444195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have also shown concern for the state support regarding equity for children, school transitions and multicultural education. During March 1998, the two authors, Linda D. Labbo and Sherry L. Field collected several useful books and resources to promote multicultural education in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Tice, Terrence N. [http://bf4dv7zn3u.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Cultural+identity&amp;rft.jtitle=The+Education+Digest&amp;rft.au=Terrence+N+Tice&amp;rft.date=1999-05-31&amp;rft.issn=0013-127X&amp;rft.eissn=1949-0275&amp;rft.volume=64&amp;rft.issue=9&amp;rft.spage=43&amp;rft.externalDBID=GTED&amp;rft.externalDocID=40876855 "Cultural Identity"], ''The Education Digest'', May 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immigrant identity development ==
Identity development among immigrant groups has been studied across a multi-dimensional view of [[acculturation]].  Dina Birman and Edison Trickett (2001) conducted a [[qualitative study]] through informal interviews with first-generation Soviet Jewish Refugee adolescents looking at the process of acculturation through three different dimensions: language competence, behavioral acculturation, and cultural identity.  The results indicated that, “…[[acculturation]] appears to occur in a linear pattern over time for most dimensions of acculturation, with acculturation to the American culture increasing and acculturation to the Russian culture decreasing.  However, Russian language competence for the parents did not diminish with length of residence in the country” (Birman &amp; Trickett, 2001).

In a similar study, Phinney, Horencyzk, Liebkind, and Vedder (2001) focused on a model, which concentrates on the interaction between immigrant characteristics and the responses of the majority society in order to understand the psychological effects of immigration. The researchers concluded that most studies find that being bicultural, having a combination of having a strong ethnic and national identity, yields the best adaptation in the new country of residence.  An article by LaFromboise, L. K. Colemna, and Gerton, reviews the literature on the impact of being bicultural.  It is shown that it is possible to have the ability to obtain competence within two cultures without losing one’s sense of identity or having to identity with one culture over the other. (LaFromboise Et Al. 1993) The importance of ethnic and national identity in the educational adaptation of immigrants indicates that a bicultural orientation is advantageous for school performance (Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 1990).  Educators can assume their positions of power in beneficially impactful ways for immigrant students, by providing them with access to their native cultural support groups, classes, after–school activities, and clubs in order to help them feel more connected to both native and national cultures.  It is clear that the new country of residence can impact immigrants’ identity development across multiple dimensions. Biculturalism can allow for a healthy adaptation to life and school. With many new immigrant youth, a school district in Alberta, Canada has gone as far as to partner with various agencies and professionals in an effort to aid the cultural adjustment of new Filipino immigrant youths &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web| url=http://bild-lida.ca/journal/volume_2_2_2018/supporting-reconnecting-immigrant-families-with-english-language-learners-in-rural-schools-an-exploratory-study-of-filipino-arrivals-to-alberta/|title=Supporting Reconnecting Immigrant Families with English Language Learners in Rural Schools: An Exploratory Study of Filipino Arrivals to Alberta |first1=Gregory|last1=Tweedie|first2=Anja|last2=Dressler|first3=Cora-Leah|last3=Schmidt|| accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==School transitions==
How great is "Achievement Loss Associated with the Transition to Middle School and High School"? John W. Alspaugh's research is in the September/October 1998 ''Journal of Educational Research'' (vol. 92, no. 1), 2026. Comparing three groups of 16 school districts, the loss was greater where the transition was from sixth grade than from a K-8 system. It was also greater when students from multiple elementary schools merged into a single middle school. Students from both K-8 and middle schools lost achievement in transition to high school, though this was greater for middle school students, and high school dropout rates were higher for districts with grades 6-8 middle schools than for those with K-8 elementary schools.&lt;ref name="Copyright Prakken Publications, Inc. May 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Terrence N|first=Tice|title=Cultural Identity|year=1999|publisher=Prakken Publications, Inc.|pages=43–44|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218180019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jean S. Phinney Three-Stage Model of Ethnic Identity Development is a widely accepted view of the formation of cultural identity. In this model cultural Identity is often developed through a three-stage process: unexamined cultural identity, cultural identity search, and cultural identity achievement.

Unexamined cultural identity: "a stage where one's cultural characteristics are taken for granted, and consequently there is little interest in exploring cultural issues." This for example is the stage one is in throughout their childhood when one doesn't distinguish between cultural characteristics of their household and others. Usually a person in this stage accepts the ideas they find on culture from their parents, the media, community, and others.

An example of thought in this stage: "I don't have a culture I'm just an American." "My parents tell me about where they lived, but what do I care? I've never lived there."

Cultural identity search: "is the process of exploration and questioning about one's culture in order to learn more about it and to understand the implications of membership in that culture." During this stage a person will begin to question why they hold their beliefs and compare it to the beliefs of other cultures. For some this stage may arise from a turning point in their life or from a growing awareness of other cultures. This stage is characterized by growing awareness in social and political forums and a desire to learn more about culture. This can be expressed by asking family members questions about heritage, visiting museums, reading of relevant cultural sources, enrolling in school courses, or attendance at cultural events. This stage might have an emotional component as well.

An example of thought in this stage: "I want to know what we do and how our culture is different from others." "There are a lot of non-Japanese people around me, and it gets pretty confusing to try and decide who I am."

Cultural identity achievement: "is characterized by a clear, confident acceptance of oneself and an internalization of one's cultural identity." In this stage people often allow the acceptance of their cultural identity play a role in their future choices such as how to raise children, how to deal with stereotypes and any discrimination, and approach negative perceptions. This usually leads to an increase in self-confidence and positive psychological adjustment

== The role of the internet ==
There is a set of phenomena that occur in conjunction between [[Cyberculture|virtual culture]] – understood as the modes and norms of behaviour associated with the [[internet]] and the [[online world]] – and [[youth culture]]. While we can speak of a duality between the virtual (online) and [[Reality|real]] sphere (face-to-face relations), for youth, this frontier is implicit and permeable. On occasions – to the annoyance of parents and teachers – these spheres are even superposed, meaning that young people may be in the real world without ceasing to be connected.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf|title=Youth and changing realities: Rethinking secondary education in Latin America|last=López|first=Néstor|last2=Opertti|first2=Renato|last3=Vargas Tamez|first3=Carlos|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-31 00204-5|location=|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present techno-cultural context, the relationship between the real world and the virtual world cannot be understood as a link between two independent and separate worlds, possibly coinciding at a point, but as a [[Moebius Strip|Moebius strip]] where there exists no inside and outside and where it is impossible to identify limits between both. For new generations, to an ever-greater extent, digital life merges with their home life as yet another element of nature. In this naturalizing of digital life, the learning processes from that environment are frequently mentioned not just since they are explicitly asked but because the subject of the internet comes up spontaneously among those polled. The ideas of [[active learning]], of [[googling]] 'when you don’t know', of recourse to tutorials for 'learning' a programme or a game, or the expression 'I learnt English better and in a more entertaining way by playing' are examples often cited as to why the internet is the place most frequented by the young people polled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Políticas TIC en los Sistemas Educativos de América Latina. Informe sobre tendencias sociales y educativas en América Latina|last=SITEAL, IIPE-UNESCO y OEI|first=|publisher=Buenos Aires, IIEP-UNESCO Regional Office in Buenos Aires.|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The internet is becoming an extension of the expressive dimension of the youth condition. There, youth talk about their lives and concerns, design the content that they make available to others and assess others reactions to it in the form of optimized and electronically mediated social approval. Many of today's youth go through processes of affirmation procedures and is often the case for how youth today grow dependency for peer approval. When connected, youth speak of their daily routines and lives. With each post, [[image]] or [[video]] they [[upload]], they have the possibility of asking themselves who they are and to try out profiles differing from those they assume in the ‘real’ world. The connections they feel in more recent times have become much less interactive through personal means compared to past generations. The influx of new technology and access has created new fields of research on effects on teens and young adults. They thus negotiate their identity and create senses of belonging, putting the acceptance and censure of others to the test, an essential mark of the process of [[Identity formation|identity construction]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Youth ask themselves about what they think of themselves, how they see themselves personally and, especially, how others see them. On the basis of these questions, youth make decisions which, through a long process of trial and error, shape their identity. This experimentation is also a form through which they can think about their insertion, membership and sociability in the ‘real’ world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Los adolescentes y las redes sociales|last=Morduchowicz|first=R.|last2=Marcon|first2=A.|last3=Sylvestre|first3=A.|last4=Ballestrini|first4=F.|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

From other perspectives, the question arises on what impact the internet has had on youth through accessing this sort of ‘identity laboratory’ and what role it plays in the shaping of youth identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life on the screen: Identity in the age of the Internet|last=Turkle|first=S.|publisher=New York, Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The psychology of the Internet|last=Wallace|first=P.|publisher=Cambridge, Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, the internet enables young people to explore and perform various roles and personifications while on the other, the virtual forums – some of them highly attractive, vivid and absorbing (e.g. [[video game]]s or virtual games of personification) – could present a risk to the construction of a stable and viable personal identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zegers|first=B.|last2=Larraín|first2=M.E.|year=2011|title=El impacto de la Internet en la definición de la identidad juvenil: una revisión|url=http://www.psykhe.cl/index.php/psykhe/article/view/469/448|journal=Psykhe|volume= 11| issue =  1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

==Origins==
[[Vitruvius]] records how in [[Sparta]], in 59 BC, "paintings have been taken out of certain walls by cutting through the bricks, enclosed in wooden frames, and brought to the [[Comitium]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0072%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D8%3Asection%3D9 |title=Vitruvius, ''De Architectura'' II.8.9 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, apprised of paintings of [[Atalanta]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] without drapery and "enflamed with lust", [[Caligula]] attempted to carry them off, but was prevented by the makeup of the [[Plaster#In art|plaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D35%3Achapter%3D6 |title=Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' XXXV.6.17-18 |publisher=[[Perseus Project]] |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amedeo Maiuri|Maiuri]] cites examples of wall paintings in wooden frames excavated at [[Pompeii]], a precursor to [[Pompeii#Rediscovery|what was to follow]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Motivation==
In their study, Mora, Mora, and Philippot cite four reasons for the "over-use" of detachment: the 19th-century division of [[the arts]] that privileged a "painting" divorced from its architectural and historical context; insensitivity to the [[aesthetic]] consequences, often partially concealed by [[Conservation-restoration|restorers]]; the curiosity of [[Art history|art historians]] looking for ''[[Sinopia|sinopie]]''; or perceived savings relating to the initial cost of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Conservation of Wall Paintings |author1=Mora, Paolo |author2=Mora, Laura |author3=Philippot, Paul |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann|Butterworths]] |year=1984 |pages=245f |ISBN=0-408-10812-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial gain and exploitation as consumer goods by collectors, dealers and restorers provides another possible incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Reversibility - Does it Exist? |editor1=Oddy, Andrew |editor1-link=William Andrew Oddy |editor2=Carroll, Sara |publisher=[[British Museum Press#British Museum Press|British Museum Press]] |year=1999 |ISBN=0-86159-135-6 |chapter=Aspects of reversibility in transferred paintings |pages=64f |author=Brajer, Isabelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dog poop girl''' refers to a [[2005 in South Korea|2005]] incident in [[South Korea]] which was one of the [[history of the internet|first]] internationally reported occurrences of [[doxing]]. In a [[Seoul]] [[Seoul_Subway_Line_2|subway car]],  a young woman's lap dog defecated inside the train,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archives.cjr.org/behind_the_news/the_tale_of_dog_poop_girl_is_n.php The Tale of Dog Poop Girl Is Not So Funny After All] Samantha Henig, ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' JULY 7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  and the woman was photographed on another passenger's mobile  phone camera after  she did not  clean up the mess despite numerous requests.&lt;ref name="Subway Fracas"&gt;{{cite news

==Incident==

In early June 2005, the woman, who appears to be in her 20s, took her [[lap dog]] on [[Seoul Subway Line 2]]. Her dog [[defecation|defecated]] on the floor of the subway car and, when other riders requested that she clean up after it, she declined to do so. Another subway rider offered the woman a tissue, which she used to clean the dog but not its waste. Other passengers suggested she clean up the mess, she ignored the second group of requests and departed the subway at the next stop. Another female commuter, using a [[camera phone]], took several photographs of the woman and dog, and posted them on a popular Korean website.&lt;ref name="Netizens Need"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Puppy poo girl"/&gt;

== Reaction  ==
Soon after the unaltered photos were published, Internet vigilante groups closely examined the picture and within days she had been identified and her [[personally identifiable information|personal information]] released on the Internet. The photo quickly became one of the most popular image searches on popular Korean [[web portal]]s and a source of [[parody]] and derisive [[satire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman quit her university in [[shame]] and published a photo of her dog with a [[public apology]].&lt;ref name="Internet's Best Friend"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boom.naver.com/1/20050619170920827 The woman's apology], in Korean, with a picture of the dog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dkbnews.com/bbs/zboard.php?id=pogpungnews&amp;no=418 Article about 'The woman's apology'], in Korean&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The reaction by Korean Internet users to the incident prompted several Korean newspapers to run editorials voicing concern over [[Internet vigilantism]], suggesting that the effect of world-wide crowds do not result in wise, uniform judgments and appropriate punishments via [[social stigma]]. The implications for personal [[privacy]] were raised.  Some said that posting the woman's picture was acceptable, but that posting her personal information was inappropriate.  Others said that her face should have been obscured in the widely circulated picture, in order to protect her identity.&lt;ref name="trial by internet"/&gt;

According to [[Daniel J. Solove]], a professor who specializes in privacy issues at [[George Washington University Law School]], the case:

{{cquote|...involves a [[social norm|norm]] that most people would seemingly agree to -- clean up after your dog...But having a permanent record of one's norm violations is upping the sanction to a whole new level . . . allowing bloggers to act as a cyber-[[wikt:posse#Noun|posse]], tracking down norm violators and branding them with digital [[scarlet letter]]s.&lt;ref name="krim"/&gt;}}

A '''dominant culture''' is a cultural practice that is [[Dominance hierarchy|dominant]]  within a particular political, social or economic entity, in which multiple cultures are present. It may refer to a [[language]], [[religion]]/[[ritual]], [[value (ethics)|social value]]  and/or [[social custom]]. These features are often a [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] for an entire [[society]]. It achieves dominance by being perceived as pertaining to a majority of the population and having a significant presence in institutions relating to communication, education, artistic expression, law, government and business. The concept of "dominant culture" is generally used in academic discourse in fields such as [[sociology]], [[anthropology]] and [[cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-dominantculture.html|title= A Dictionary of Sociology | year=1998|author=Gordon Marshall|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture that is dominant within a particular [[geopolitical entity]] can change over time in response to internal or external factors, but one is usually very resilient and able to reproduce itself effectively from generation to generation.  In a [[multicultural]] society, various cultures are celebrated and respected equally. A dominant culture can be promoted deliberately and by the suppression of [[minority culture]]s or [[subculture]]s.

==Examples and applications==

===Native American studies===
In the [[United States]], a distinction is often made between the [[indigenous culture]] of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and a dominant culture that may be described as "Anglo", "white", "middle class", and so on.  Some Native Americans are seen as being part of the culture of their own [[Native American tribe|tribe]], community, or family, while simultaneously participating in the dominant culture of America as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first= |date=May 1974 |title=The Native American in Juvenile Fiction: Teacher Perception  of Stereotypes |url=http://jaie.asu.edu/v13/V13S2tea.html |journal=Journal of American Indian Education |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages= |author=Maria Falkenhagen and Inga K.

===Other American groups===
Ethnic groups are said to exist in the United States in relation to a dominant culture, generally seen as English-speaking, of European ancestry, and Protestant Christian faith.

It can be a special repetition, arrangement or omission of words with literal meaning, or a phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words.{{dubious|date=July 2016}} Figures of speech often provide emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use, as figures of speech can introduce an ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretation.{{dubious|date=July 2016}}

== Four rhetorical operations ==
{{Main|Rhetorical operations}}

[[Classical rhetoric]]ians classified figures of speech into [[rhetorical operations|four categories]] or ''[[quadripartita]] ratio'':&lt;ref name="Jansen"&gt;Jansen, Jeroen (2008) ''[http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio Imitatio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714140654/http://www.verloren.nl/boeken/2086/263/2126/renaissance/imitatio |date=2015-07-14 }}'' {{ISBN|978-90-8704-027-7}} [http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205211147/http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.jansen/page1.html |date=2008-12-05 }} translated to English by Kristine Steenbergh. Quote from the summary: &lt;blockquote&gt;Using these formulas, a pupil could render the same subject or theme in a myriad of ways. For the mature author, this principle offered a set of tools to rework source texts into a new creation. In short, the quadripartita ratio offered the student or author a ready-made framework, whether for changing words or the transformation of entire texts. Since it concerned relatively mechanical procedures of adaptation that for the most part could be learned, the techniques concerned could be taught at school at a relatively early age, for example in the improvement of pupils’ own writing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* addition (''adiectio''), also called repetition/expansion/superabundance
* omission (''detractio''), also called subtraction/abridgement/lack
* transposition (''transmutatio''), also called transferring
* permutation (''immutatio''), also called switching/interchange/substitution/transmutation

These categories are often still used. The earliest known text listing them, though not explicitly as a system, is the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', of unknown authorship, where they are called πλεονασμός (addition), ἔνδεια (omission), μετάθεσις (transposition) and ἐναλλαγή (permutation).&lt;ref&gt;Book V, 21.29, pp.303–5&lt;/ref&gt; Quintillian then mentioned them in ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Institutio Oratoria, Vol. I, Book I, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/1B*.html Chapter 5], paragraphs 6 and 38–41. And also in Book VI [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/6C*.html Chapter 3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philo of Alexandria]] also listed them as addition (πρόσθεσις), subtraction (ἀφαίρεσις), transposition (μετάθεσις), and transmutation (ἀλλοίωσις).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Rhetorica_ad_Herennium/4B*.html Rhetorica ad Herennium]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Figures of speech come in many varieties. The aim is to use the language inventively to accentuate the effect of what is being said. A few examples follow:

* "Around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran" is an example of [[alliteration]], where the consonant ''r'' is used repeatedly.
:Whereas, "Sister Suzy sewing socks for soldiers" is a particular form of alliteration called [[sibilance]], because it repeats the letter ''s''.
:Both are commonly used in poetry.
* "She would run up the stairs and then a new set of curtains" is a variety of [[zeugma]] called a [[syllepsis]]. ''Run up'' refers to ascending and also to manufacturing. The effect is enhanced by the momentary suggestion, through a [[pun]], that she might be climbing up the curtains. The [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] or omission of the second use of the verb makes the reader think harder about what is being said.
* "Painful pride" is an [[oxymoron]] where two contradictory ideas are placed in the same sentence.
*"An Einstein" is an example of [[synecdoche]], as it uses a particular name to represent a class of people: geniuses.
* "I had butterflies in my stomach" is a [[metaphor]], referring to a nervous feeling as if there were flying insects in one's stomach.
:To say "it was like having some butterflies in my stomach" would be a [[simile]], because it uses the word ''like'' which is missing in the metaphor.
:To say "It was like having a butterfly farm in my stomach", "It felt like a butterfly farm in my stomach", or "I was so nervous that I had a butterfly farm in my stomach" could be a [[hyperbole]], because it is exaggerated.
*"That filthy place was really dirty" is an example of [[Tautology (grammar)|tautology]], as there are the two words ('filthy' and 'dirty') having almost the same meaning and are repeated so as to make the text more emphatic.

Scholars of classical Western rhetoric have divided figures of speech into two main categories: schemes and tropes. ''[[Scheme (linguistics)|Schemes]]'' (from the Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|schēma}}, 'form or shape') are figures of speech that change the ordinary or expected pattern of words. For example, the phrase, "John, my best friend" uses the scheme known as [[apposition]]. ''[[Trope (linguistics)|Tropes]]'' (from Greek {{lang|grc-Latn|trepein}}, 'to turn') change the general meaning of words. An example of a trope is irony, which is the use of words to convey the opposite of their usual meaning ("For Brutus is an honorable man; / So are they all, all honorable men").

During the [[Renaissance]], scholars meticulously enumerated and classified figures of speech. [[Henry Peacham (born 1546)|Henry Peacham]], for example, in his ''The Garden of Eloquence'' (1577), enumerated 184 different figures of speech. Professor Robert DiYanni, in his book "Literature – Reading Fiction, Poetry, Drama and the Essay"&lt;ref&gt;Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-557112-9}}, pp.451&lt;/ref&gt; wrote: "Rhetoricians have catalogued more than 250 different ''figures of speech'', expressions or ways of using words in a nonliteral sense."

For simplicity, this article divides the figures between schemes and tropes, but does not further sub-classify them (e.g., "Figures of Disorder"). Within each category, words are listed alphabetically. Most entries link to a page that provides greater detail and relevant examples, but a short definition is placed here for convenience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Gender empowerment''' is the [[empowerment]] of people of any [[gender]]. While conventionally being reduced to its aspect of [[Women empowerment|empowerment of women]], the concept stresses [[Sex and gender distinction|the distinction]] between biological [[sex]] and [[Gender role|gender as a role]], also referring to other marginalized [[genders]] in a particular political or social context.

Gender empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in regard to development and economics. Entire nations, businesses, communities, and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;Deneulin, Séverine, with Lila Shahani.  2009.  An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency.  Sterling, VA: Earthscan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empowerment]] is one of the main procedural concerns when addressing [[human rights and development]]. [[Capability Approach|The Human Development and Capabilities Approach]], [[The Millennium Development Goals]], and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.&lt;ref&gt;U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. “United Nations Millennium Declaration.” (A/55/L.2).  8 September 2000. (Online) Available: www.un.org/millennium/declaration/ares552e.pdf (accessed January 2, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measuring ==
Gender empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]], or the GEM. The GEM shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. Gem is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence."&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2941">A '''gender expression''' is a person's behavior, mannerisms, interests, and appearance that are associated with [[gender]] in a particular cultural context, specifically with the categories of [[femininity]] or [[masculinity]]. This also includes [[gender role]]s. These categories rely on [[stereotype]]s about gender.
==Defining gender expression==

Gender expression typically reflects a person's [[gender identity]] (their internal sense of their own gender), but this is not always the case.&lt;ref name="Summers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Summers|first1=Randal W.|title=Social Psychology: How Other People Influence Our Thoughts and Actions [2 volumes]|date=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610695923|page=232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nF1DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA232|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="APA2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=American Psychological Association|title=Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Transgender and Gender Nonconforming People|journal=American Psychologist|date=December 2015|volume=70|issue=9|page=861|url=http://www.apa.org/practice/guidelines/transgender.pdf|doi=10.1037/a0039906}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender expression is separate and independent both from [[sexual orientation]] and [[Sex assignment|gender assigned at birth]]. A type of gender expression that is considered atypical for a person's externally perceived gender may be described as [[Gender variance|gender non-conforming]].

In men and boys, typical gender expression is often described as ''manly'', while atypical expression is known as [[Effeminacy|effeminate]]. In girls, atypical expression is called [[tomboy]]ish. In (especially queer) women, atypical and typical expression are known as [[butch and femme]] respectively. A mixture of typical and atypical expression may be described as [[Androgyny|androgynous]]. A type of expression that is perceived as neither typically feminine or masculine can be described as gender-neutral or undifferentiated.

The term ''gender expression'' is used in the [[Yogyakarta Principles]], which concern the application of international [[human rights law]] in relation to sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and [[Sex characteristics (legal term)|sex characteristics]].&lt;ref name="ypplus10"&gt;[http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/principles-en/yp10/ Yogyakarta Principles plus 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluating gender expression==

The [[Bem Sex-Role Inventory]] was designed to evaluate gender expression objectively (within a White American cultural context).

[[File:Heckler2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A heckler in Washington, D.C. leans across a police line toward a demonstration of [[Iran]]ians during the [[Iran hostage crisis]], August 1980]]

A '''heckler''' is a person who harasses and tries to disconcert others with questions, challenges, or gibes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Heckler |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heckler |publisher=Merriam-Webster |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hecklers are often known to shout disparaging comments at a performance or event, or to interrupt set-piece speeches, with the intent of disturbing performers and/or participants.

==Origin==
Although the word ''heckler'', which originated from the textile trade, was first attested in the mid-15th century, the sense "person who harasses" was from 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heckler|title=heckler {{!}} Origin and history of heckler by Online Etymology Dictionary|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ''heckle'' was to tease or comb out [[flax]] or [[hemp]] fibres. The additional meaning, to interrupt speakers with awkward or embarrassing questions, was added in [[Scotland]], and specifically perhaps in early nineteenth century [[Dundee]], a famously radical town where the hecklers who combed the flax had established a reputation as the most radical and belligerent element in the workforce. In the heckling factory, one heckler would read out the day's news while the others worked, to the accompaniment of interruptions and furious debate.&lt;ref name=McKie&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/apr/28/broadcasting.comment |title=Unplotted ripostes |last1=McKie |first1=David |date=28 April 2005 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heckling was a major part of the [[vaudeville]] theater. Sometimes it was incorporated into the play. [[Milton Berle]]'s weekly TV variety series in the 1960s featured a heckler named Sidney Spritzer ([[German language|German]]/[[Yiddish]] for 'squirter') played by [[Borscht Belt]] comic [[Irving Benson]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, ''[[Muppet Show|The Muppet Show]]'', which was also built around a vaudeville theme, featured two hecklers, [[Statler &amp; Waldorf]] (two old men named after famous hotels). Heckles are now particularly likely to be heard at comedy performances, to unsettle or compete with the performer.

==Politics==

&lt;!-- 
NOTE: these sections could stand to be organized a bit more (by year, era, whatever)
with sub-headers (or at least date or year) for each "incident" so as to put them all in context.
--&gt;
Politicians speaking before live audiences have less latitude to deal with hecklers. Legally, such conduct may constitute protected [[free speech]]. Strategically, coarse or belittling retorts to hecklers entail personal risk disproportionate to any gain. Some politicians, however, have been known to improvise a relevant and witty response despite these pitfalls. One acknowledged expert at this was [[Harold Wilson]], British Prime Minister in the 1960s:

:'''Heckler''': (''interrupting a passage in a Wilson speech about Labour's spending plans'') What about [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]?
:'''Wilson''': The government has no plans to increase public expenditure in Vietnam.
:'''Heckler''': Rubbish!
:'''Wilson''': I'll come to your special interest in a minute, sir.&lt;ref name=McKie/&gt;

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]]'s [[I Have a Dream]] speech was largely a response to supporter [[Mahalia Jackson]] interrupting his prepared speech to shout "Tell them about the dream, Martin". &lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, Hayden of heckla.com (16th April 2018) : Former Martin Luther King, Jr. adviser and speechwriter Clarence B. Jones talks to WSJ's Monika Vosough about how Martin Luther King's favorite gospel singer Mahalia Jackson helped create the "I Have a Dream" speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxlOlynG6FY&amp;ab_channel=WallStreetJournal&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, King stopped reading from his previously prepared speech and improvised the remainder of the speech - this improvised portion of the speech is the best-known part of the speech and frequently rated as one of the best of all time.

During a campaign stop just before winning the Presidency in 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] was heckled by an audience member who kept interrupting him during a speech. Reagan tried to go on with his speech three times, but after being interrupted yet again glared at the heckler and snapped "Aw, shut up!" The audience immediately gave him a standing ovation.

In 1992, then-Presidential candidate [[Bill Clinton]] was interrupted by Bob Rafsky, a member of the AIDS activism group [[ACT UP]], who accused him of "dying of ambition to be president"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toner |first=Robin |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/27/us/the-1992-campaign-aids-protester-provokes-clinton-s-anger.html |title=NY Times |work=New York Times |date=27 March 1992 |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; during a rally. After becoming visibly agitated, Clinton took the microphone off the stand, pointed to the heckler and directly responded to him by saying, "[...] I have treated you and all of the other people who have interrupted my rallies with a hell of a lot more respect than you treated me. And it's time to start thinking about that!" Clinton was then met with raucous applause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=30 maart 2006 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGTQZnC-6a4 |title=Clinton's Angry Response to Heckler |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Audience control ===
&lt;!-- 
NOTE: possible use for subheader here, distinguishing the use of "audience screening" as a means of discouraging political heckling.
NOTE: 'astroturfing' and 'audience screening' are arguably distinct, changed to a 'see also'
--&gt;
&lt;!-- What? --&gt;
One modern political approach to discourage heckling is to ensure that major events are given before a "tame" audience of sympathizers, or conducted to allow restrictions on who may remain on the premises (see also, ''[[astroturfing]]''). The downside is this may make heckling incidents even more newsworthy. This happened to [[Tony Blair]] during a [[photo op]] visit to a hospital during the 2001 general election campaign, and again in 2003 during a speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2690549.stm "Blair's heckler states his case"], BBC, 24 January 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, American Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was interrupted mid-speech by Perry Patterson, a middle-aged mother in a pre-screened rally audience. After various supportive outbursts that were permitted ("Four more years", "Go Bush!"), Patterson uttered  "No, no, no, no" and was removed from the speech area and told to leave. She refused, and was arrested for criminal [[trespass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eugeneweekly.com/2006/02/09/coverstory.html |title=Woman utters No |publisher=Eugeneweekly.com |accessdate=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in 2005, Cheney received some heckling that was broadcast during his trip to New Orleans, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] ravaged the area. The heckling occurred during a press conference in [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], Mississippi, in an area that was cordoned off for public safety reasons, and then further secured for the press conference. Nevertheless, emergency room physician Ben Marble got close enough to the proceedings and could be heard yelling, "Go fuck yourself, Mr. Cheney." Cheney laughed it off and continued speaking.&lt;ref&gt;June Deery: ''Consuming Reality: The Commercialization of Factual Entertainment''.  MacMillan, 2012.  Page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  The heckle was a reference to Cheney's use of the phrase the previous year, when during a heated exchange with Senator [[Patrick Leahy|Patrick Joseph Leahy]], Vermont, he said "fuck yourself" on the floor of the senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cheney Dismisses Critic With Obscenity|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3699-2004Jun24.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 October 2005, ''[[The Scotsman]]'' reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |title=Iran denies troop attack links |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513220441/http://news.scotsman.com/latest.cfm?id=2094782005 |archivedate=13 May 2007 |work=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Iranian ambassador Dr Seyed Mohammed Hossein Adeli... speaking at the annual Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament conference...  During his speech to the CND several people were told to leave the room following protests at Iran's human rights record. Several protesters shouted "Fascists" at the ambassador and the organisers of the conference. Walter Wolfgang, the 82-year-old peace campaigner who was forced out of the Labour Party conference last month, was in the audience."

Since 2005 heckling of performing artists has become more commonplace in [[Switzerland]].  Musicians of [[Basel]] and [[Zurich]] have become an increasing focus of hecklers.  This shift is primarily perpetrated by foreigners and is often met with a positive response by the non-Swiss performers who welcome the audience interaction. 

On Thursday, 20 April 2006, a heckler from the [[Falun Gong]] spiritual movement entered the US [[White House]] grounds as a reporter and interrupted a formal arrival ceremony for [[President of the People's Republic of China|Chinese President]] [[Hu Jintao]].  Moments into Mr Hu's speech at the event, [[Wang Wenyi]], perched on the top tier of the stands reserved for the press, began screaming in English and Chinese: "President [[George W. Bush|Bush]] stop him. Stop this visit. Stop the killing and torture."&lt;!--  The heckler was allowed to continue for several minutes despite the heavy presence of security personnel typical of such high level meeting of officials, prompting speculation that the incident was planned with the tacit cooperation of the White House in order to embarrass the Chinese president, hence possibly making this heckling incident one which was found justified by its audience. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html "No breakthrough in US, China talks"]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011756/http://cbs13.com/topstories/topstories_story_110093156.html |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; President Bush later apologised to his guest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/frontpage/story/0,,1758305,00.html |title=Protester gatecrashes Hu visit as China and US fail to make progress |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 21 April 2006|accessdate=12 March 2009  | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2009, Representative [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] (R-SC) shouted "You lie!" at President [[Barack Obama]] after President Obama stated that his health care plan would not subsidize coverage for illegal immigrants during a [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|speech]] he was making to a joint session of Congress.  Wilson later apologized for his outburst.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/09/09/wilson-apologizes-i-let-my-emotions-get-the-best-of-me/ "Wilson apologizes: 'I let my emotions get the best of me'"]. Retrieved September 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2013, Ju Hong, a 24-year-old South Korean immigrant without legal documentation, shouted at Obama to use his executive power to stop deportation of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203164254/http://inagist.com/all/405077610499022849/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama said "If, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so." "But we're also a nation of laws, that's part of our tradition," he continued. "And so the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. And what I'm proposing is the harder path, which is to use our democratic processes to achieve the same goal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/immigrationdebate/ci_24598028/obama-san-francisco-calls-immigration-reform|title=Obama’s immigration speech in deep-blue San Francisco interrupted by anti-deportation hecklers|author=|date=25 November 2013|website=mercurynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/heckler-obama-steals-attention-presidents-speech-21008837|title=Video: Heckler Disrupts Obama's Speech With Minute-Long Rant|first=ABC|last=News|date=|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126145922/http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb4qQ/ |archivedate=26 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/|title=Obama addresses heckler during speech on immigration|author=|date=|website=daytondailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402144614/http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/national/obama-addresses-heckler-during-speech-immigration/nb494/ |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport==
Hecklers can also appear at sporting events, and usually (but not always) direct their taunts at a visiting team. Fans of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[American football]] team are notorious for heckling; among the most infamous incidents were [[booing]] and subsequently throwing snowballs at a performer dressed as [[Santa Claus]] in a halftime show in 1968, and cheering at the career-ending injury of visiting team player [[Michael Irvin]] in 1999.  Often, sports heckling will also involve throwing objects onto the field; this has led most sports stadiums to ban glass containers and bottlecaps. Another famous heckler is [[Robert Szasz]], who regularly attends [[Tampa Bay Rays]] baseball games and is known for loudly heckling one opposing player per game or series. Former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[association football|football]] star [[Dejan Savićević]] is involved in an infamous incident with a heckler in which during an interview, a man on the street is heard shouting off-camera: "You're a piece of shit!"  Dejan berated the man, and went on to finish the interview, without missing a beat.

In English and Scottish [[association football|football]], heckling and swearing from the stands, and [[football chant]]s such as [[who ate all the pies?]] are common.

Australian sporting audiences are known for creative heckling. Perhaps the most famous is [[Yabba]] who had a grandstand at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] named after him, and now a statue.

The sport of [[cricket]] is particularly notorious for heckling between the teams themselves, which is known as [[sledging (cricket)|sledging]].

At the NBA Drafts of recent years, many fans have gone with heckling [[ESPN]] [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] analyst and host of, [[Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith]], [[Stephen A. Smith]]. Most notably, The Stephen A. Smith Heckling Society of Gentlemen heckles him with a sock puppet dubbed as Stephen A. himself.

Tennis fans are also fairly noted for heckling. Some may call out during a service point to distract either player. Another common heckle from tennis fans is cheering after a service fault, which is considered to be rude and unsporting.

In 2009, then [[Toronto Blue Jays]] outfielder [[Alex Ríos]] was a victim of a heckling incident outside after a fund-raising event. The incident occurred after Rios declined to sign an autograph for a young fan, the same day he went 0 for 5 with 5 [[strikeouts]] in a game against the [[Los Angeles Angels]]. An older man yelled "The way you played today Alex, you should be lucky someone wants your autograph." Rios then replied with "Who gives a fuck", repeating it until being ushered into a vehicle. Rios did apologize the next day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/baseball/story/2009/06/05/sp-rios-youtube.html | work=CBC News | title=Rios apologizes for YouTube tirade at abusive fan | date=5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually placed on waivers and claimed by the [[Chicago White Sox]] later that year.

==Music==
{{Further|Electric Dylan controversy}}
One of the most famous heckles in music history occurred at a [[Bob Dylan]] concert at the [[Manchester Free Trade Hall]] in 1966. During a quiet moment in between songs, an audience member shouts very loudly and clearly, "Judas!" referencing Dylan's so-called betrayal of folk music by "going electric". Dylan replied: "I don't believe you, you're a liar!" before telling his band to "Play it fucking loud!" They play an acidic version of "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glover|first=Tony|title=Bob Dylan Live 1966 Liner Notes|publisher=Columbia Records|year=1998|location=New York|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was captured on tape and the full concert was released as volume four of Dylan's ''Live Bootleg Series''.

==Comedy==
Heckling often occurs during [[stand up comedy]] performances, particularly at [[Renegade_show|open stage]] performances, and/or where alcoholic beverages are being consumed. It is regarded as a sign of audience members becoming impatient with what they regard as a low quality performance. Some comedians ignore the heckling and dislike the practice. In an interview for a 2011 BBC documentary, [[Billy Connolly]] said that "I loathe hecklers. I haven't one good syllable to say about hecklers. When you've come out of the club circuit and all that and you're in the concert hall...they should be gone."&lt;ref&gt;BBC Imagine: The Art of Stand Up, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other stand-up comedians devise a strategy for quashing such outbursts, usually by having a store of retorts (known as "squelches") on hand. The idea is to get the audience laughing at the heckler for being outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, Andrew. [http://www.juggling.org/~conway/juggler/MAL.TXT "You're Ugly, Your Dick Is Small, and Everybody Fucks Your Mother—The Stand-Up Comedian's Response to the Heckler"]. ''[[Maledicta]]'' Vol. 11, December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, live comedy venues tend to discourage heckling via signage and admissions policy, but tend to tolerate it as it creates customer loyalty. The etiquette of exactly how much heckling is tolerated differs immensely from venue to venue, however, but is generally more likely to be tolerated in blue collar or working class venues. Some cities feature 'heckle nights' where heckling is actively encouraged.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The comedy TV series ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' featured a pair of hecklers named [[Statler and Waldorf]]. These characters created a kind of meta-comedy act in which the show's official comedian, [[Fozzie Bear]], acted as their usual [[Double act|foil]], although they occasionally made jokes at other characters as well.

Another notable use of heckling in comedy is in the cult favorite series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The series involves a man (either Joel Robinson or Mike Nelson) and two robots (Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot) sitting in a theater mocking bad B-movies. This style of comedy, coined as riffing, is continued with commentary-based series such as [[Rifftrax]] and [[Cinematic Titanic]].

In one of [[Rowan Atkinson]]'s plays "The School Master", a heckler interrupted his play by shouting "Here!" after Atkinson had read out an amusing name on his register. Atkinson incorporated it into his act by saying "I have a detention book..."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

'''Heritage science''' is cross-disciplinary scientific research of [[cultural heritage]]. It encompasses research enabling access to [[cultural heritage]], its [[Art conservation|conservation]], [[Interpretation (aesthetics)|interpretation]] and [[management]].

The term has become widely used after 2006 when it became increasingly evident that the more traditional terms [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]] or preservation science inadequately reflected the breadth of research into [[cultural heritage]]. Heritage scientists in museums, galleries, libraries, archives, universities and research institutions support conservation (often called [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]]), access (e.g. development of new [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] tools), interpretation, including [[archaeometry]] and [[archaeological science]] (e.g. dating, [[Provenance|provenancing]], attribution), heritage management (e.g. development of tools and knowledge supporting strategic or environmental management decisions) and wider societal engagement with heritage (e.g. heritage [[Value (ethics)|values and ethics]]). Heritage science is also an excellent vehicle for public engagement with science as well as heritage.

Heritage science is seen as "key to the long-term sustainability of heritage: it is about managing change and risk and maximising social, cultural and economic benefit not just today, but in such a way that we can pass on to future generations that which we have inherited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldsctech/256/256.pdf |format=PDF |title=Science and Technology Committee : Science and Heritage |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domains of research, where heritage science makes a particular input were recognised to be museums, galleries, libraries and archives; the built historic environment and archaeology, by the United Kingdom National Heritage Science Strategy documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/strategy.php | title=UK National Heritage Science Strategy | accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
[[File:Red Rot Leather.jpg|right|thumbnail|Red rot on leather bindings was one of the first conservation issues to excite scientists.]]
The field still requires its literature canon and opinions on whether heritage science is a domain in its own right or a field of research diverge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5SpIq80XpU | title=Round Table discussion on the Future of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this appears a matter of academic recognition, rather than a matter of research practice.

Heritage science is an old field of research: in his [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] in 1843, [[Michael Faraday]] already pointed out how pollution importantly contributes to book degradation. The following premises appear to be of defining importance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heritagescienceresearch.wordpress.com/2015/11/17/theory_heritagescience/ | title=A Brief Theory of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Heritage science is inherently biased, as scientists, by doing research on heritage, contribute to its value: they create and popularize heritage through their research. 
# Heritage science is neither fundamental nor experimental: work with actual heritage objects, building or sites cannot be repeatable because heritage is not an experiment. On the other hand, the [[scientific method]] and deductive reasoning is easily applied when working with models and model objects, which heritage scientists often do due to the high value of actual historic objects and consequentially, sampling restrictions.

Since the context of heritage is often unknown, there can be any number of variables affecting the heritage system under observation – inductive reasoning is therefore often applied in heritage science. In this aspect, the premise of heritage science comes close to social science.
Heritage that is accessible, in its preserved authentic form or as a (digital) reproduction, is a "resource for economic growth, employment and social cohesion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/library/publications/2014-heritage-communication_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe |publisher=EU |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through improved access, heritage science therefore contributes to well-being. Heritage science is proof that there is no world of [[The Two Cultures|'Two Cultures']]. A scientist, researching heritage defies the existence of the divide: there can be no scientific research of heritage without a contribution by humanities research. Heritage science also successfully bridges science and culture, because it provides an attractive vehicle to convey ideas and concepts related to technology and engineering, as well as culture and society. Heritage science can be considered an anthropogenic analog to environmental geography, which was defined by [[Halford Mackinder]] in 1887 as a discipline that aims to "bridge one of the greatest of all gaps" between "the natural sciences and the study of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacKinder|first=H. J.|date=1887|title=On the Scope and Methods of Geography|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1801248|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography|volume=9|issue=3|pages=141–174|doi=10.2307/1801248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research==
[[Image:WoS publications 2015.png|right|thumbnail|Publication trends in the heritage science field, 2005-2014.]]

Heritage science is an increasingly lively science domain. Materials and techniques of the past are often very difficult to study and state-of-the-art techniques and methods need to be employed. Discoveries new to science are often the result of such endeavours, e.g. new antibiotics from bacteria discovered in the [[Cave of Altamira]], in Spain. With its wide definition, heritage science spans a significant variety of scientific activities. In order to support conservation, access, interpretation and management, heritage science must be based on an [[interdisciplinary]] palette of knowledge, from fundamental sciences ([[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]]) to [[arts]] and [[humanities]] (conservation, [[archaeology]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[history]], [[art history]] etc.), including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[computer science]]s and [[engineering]].

In academia, heritage science is often performed by scientists spending a proportion of their time on heritage-related research. The academic field, judged by the number of academic outputs published annually, is steadily increasing. This could be taken to estimate the domain size – with the number of outputs in 2014 being 6,800 (Source: Web of Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ |title=ISI Web of Knowledge |publisher=Images.isiknowledge.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it could be assumed that there are about 3,000 heritage scientists active in the field (publishing on average 2 academic publications per year). This goes against the generally held view that the field is small.

The proportion per country varies greatly, about 20% of researchers being active in the US, 15% in the UK, 10% in Italy, 5% France, and 5% in China (with a strong increase in the last decade).

Since 2013, the scientific domain has its own flagship journal, ''Heritage Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/ |title=Heritage Science |publisher=Heritagesciencejournal.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Mind the Gap project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/our-role/collection-care/heritage-science-research-and-development/collaborative-working-practices-mind-the-gap/ |title= Mind the gap project |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the UK EPSRC/AHRC Science and Heritage Programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescience.ac.uk/ |title= UK AHRC/EPSRC Science and Heritage Programme |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on the drivers and impediments in cross-disciplinary research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mind-the-gap-report-jan-2014.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mind the Gap Report |publisher=AHRC |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project found that there is no gap between rigour and relevance in heritage science research but rather that there is a continuum of activity. However, there was less satisfaction with heritage science research in relation to its impact on practice, in comparison to its academic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/content/2/1/11 |title= Mind the gap: rigour and relevance in collaborative heritage science research |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:SEAHA Mobile Heritage Lab.jpg|thumbnail|The SEAHA Mobile Heritage Laboratory for field research and public engagement with science and heritage.]]
The heritage science career paths are various. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of heritage science, any academic background is suitable, from [[formal sciences]], [[natural sciences]] to [[social sciences]]. 
Most researchers have entered the field by carrying out doctoral research in the field, which is due to the fact that there is currently no undergraduate course in this domain. Since 2010, Master's degree courses in heritage science have become available at [[University College London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/heritage/programmes/mres-msc/mres-seaha |title=Heritage Science Masters at UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/gap/ProspectiveStudents/PostgraduateStudies/GraduateStudiesTaught/HeritageScience/ |title=Heritage Science Masters at Queens University, Belfast |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, students can obtain undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in conservation science at the [[University of Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unifi.it/p-cor2-2016-101227-B194-GEN-1-1.html|title=Offerta formativa - Università degli Studi di Firenze - UniFI|website=www.unifi.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corsi.unibo.it/SCIENCEFORCONSERVATION/Pages/default.aspx|title=Two year master in Science for the conservation-restoration of cultural heritage - Ravenna - Università di Bologna|website=corsi.unibo.it|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recently created programme at the [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice|University of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unive.it/pag/20740/|title=Summary: Master's Degree Programme in Conservation Science and Technology for Cultural Heritage - Ca' Foscari|website=www.unive.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other universities in Italy have faculty members whose primary research focus is in heritage science; these groups often accept international students who would like to obtain a PhD in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scich.it/index.html|title=COLOMBINI GROUP - Chemical Science for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage|website=www.scich.it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?oscar.chiantore#profilo|title=Prof. Oscar Chiantore - Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Scienza dei Materiali - Università degli Studi di Torino|last=Torino|first=Università degli Studi di|website=scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught courses in heritage science programmes include elements of heritage science, e.g. technical art history is often part of [[art history]] courses, and [[natural sciences]] are often taught in conservation courses. [[Brandenburg University of Technology]] in Germany offers the international Master's programme World Heritage Studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/en/heritage-studies-phd/|title=World Heritage Studies, Master of Arts|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PhD programme Heritage Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/worldheritage-ma/|title=PhD Programme Heritage Studies|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[University College London|UCL]], [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Brighton]], the Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology ([http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ SEAHA]) was established in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ |title=Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key aspect of the SEAHA scheme is the collaborative nature of projects, enabling partnerships between academic institutions, industry and national heritage agencies and giving an applied focus to the research training.

Since the field requires significant cross-disciplinary and transferrable skills, graduates may be able to take jobs in industry and academia. To work within the field of heritage science (e.g. in a museum laboratory), a PhD in the physical sciences and significant experience in a museum or conservation studio is typically required.

The '''history of erotic depictions''' includes [[painting]]s, [[sculpture]], [[photograph]]s, [[drama|dramatic arts]], [[music]] and [[writing]]s that show scenes of a [[human sexuality|sexual]] nature throughout time. They have been created by nearly every civilization, ancient and modern. Early cultures often associated the sexual act with supernatural forces and thus their religion is intertwined with such depictions. In Asian countries such as India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Japan and China, representations of sex and [[erotic art]] have specific spiritual meanings within native religions. The ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] produced much art and decoration of an erotic nature, much of it integrated with their religious beliefs and cultural practices.&lt;ref name = east&gt;{{cite book| last = Rawson| first = Phillip S.| title = Erotic art of the east; the sexual theme in oriental painting and sculpture| publisher = Putnam| year = 1968| location = New York| id = {{LCC|N7260.R35}}| page = 380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = romans&gt;{{cite book| last = Clarke| first = John R.| title = Roman Sex: 100 B.C. to A.D. 250| publisher = Harry N.

In more recent times, as communication technologies evolved, each new technique, such as [[printing]], [[photography]], [[film|motion pictures]] and [[computer]]s, has been adapted to display and disseminate these depictions.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite video|people=Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors) Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, [[Dean Kuipers]] (Cast) |date=2006-03-07 |title=Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization |url=http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |medium=DVD |publisher=Koch Vision |location=Port Washington, NY |accessdate=2006-10-21 |isbn=1-4172-2885-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822002054/http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |archivedate=2010-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes through history==
In early times, erotic depictions were often a subset of the indigenous or religious art of cultures and as such were not set aside or treated differently than any other type. The modern concept of [[pornography]] did not exist until the [[Victorian era]]. Its current definition was added in the 1860s, replacing the older one meaning writings about [[prostitution|prostitutes]].&lt;ref name = pleasures&gt;{{cite book| last = Sigel| first = Lisa| title = Governing Pleasures. Pornography and Social Change in England, 1815-1914| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2002| isbn = 0-8135-3001-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared in an English medical dictionary in 1857 defined as "a description of prostitutes or of prostitution, as a matter of public hygiene."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robley Dunglison|Dunglison, Robley]] (1857). ''Medical lexicon. A dictionary of medical science'', 1857 edition, s.v. [http://dictionary.oed.com/help/bib/oed2-d2.html#dunglison "Pornography"]. From the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition (1989), Oxford University Press, Retrieved on November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1864, the first version of the modern definition had appeared in [[Webster's Dictionary]]: "licentious painting employed to decorate the walls of rooms sacred to [[bacchanalia]]n orgies, examples of which exist in Pompeii."&lt;ref&gt;''An American dictionary of the English language'', new and revised edition (1864), s.v. [http://dictionary.oed.com/help/bib/oed2-w.html#webster "Pornography"]. From the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition (1989), Oxford University Press, Retrieved on November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of what today refers to explicit pictures in general. Though some specific sex acts were regulated or prohibited by earlier laws, merely looking at objects or images depicting them was not outlawed in any country until 1857. In some cases, the possession of certain books, engravings or image collections was outlawed, but the trend to compose laws that actually restricted viewing sexually explicit things in general was a Victorian construct.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;

When large-scale [[excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] of [[Pompeii]] were undertaken in the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the [[Roman Empire]]. They did not know what to do with the frank depictions of sexuality, and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper-class scholars. The movable objects were locked away in the [[Secret Museum, Naples|Secret Museum]] in [[Naples]], and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off so as to not corrupt the sensibilities of women, children and the working class. England's (and the world's) first laws criminalising pornography were enacted with the passage of the [[Obscene Publications Act]] of 1857.&lt;ref name = history /&gt; Despite their occasional repression, depictions of erotic themes have been common for millennia.&lt;ref name = libido7&gt;{{cite web| last = Beck| first = Marianna| title = The Roots of Western Pornography: Victorian Obsessions and Fin-de-Siècle Predilections| work = Libido, The Journal of Sex and Sensibility| publisher = Libido Inc |date = May 2003| url = http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/europorn07.html| accessdate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography has existed throughout recorded history and has adapted to each new medium, including photography, cinema, video, and computers and the internet.

The first instances of modern pornography date back to the sixteenth century when sexually explicit images differentiated itself from traditional sexual representations in European art by combining the traditionally explicit representation of sex and the moral norms of those times.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s in the United States, attempts were made to shut down the pornography industry by prosecuting individuals on prostitution charges. In the case of ''[[People v. Freeman]]'', the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] ruled to distinguish prostitution as an individual taking part in sexual activities in exchange for money versus an individual who is portraying a sexual act on-screen as part of their acting performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|url = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/488/1311.html|website = Findlaw|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was not appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, thus it is only binding in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Porn In The U.S.A.|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/porn-in-the-usa-21-11-2003|website = www.cbsnews.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palaeolithic and mesolithic===
Among the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s and carvings. Some of the more common images are of animals, hunting scenes and depictions of human [[genitalia]]. Nude human beings with exaggerated sexual characteristics are depicted in some Paleolithic paintings and artifacts (e.g. [[Venus figurines]]). Recently discovered cave art at [[Creswell Crags]] in England, thought to be more than 12,000 years old, includes some symbols that may be stylized versions of female genitalia. As there is no direct evidence of the use of these objects, it is speculated that they may have been used in religious rituals,&lt;ref name = ng&gt;{{cite web| last = Pickrell| first = John| title = Unprecedented Ice Age Cave Art Discovered in U.K.| work =National Geographic News |publisher = Nationalgeographic.com| date = August 18, 2004| url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/08/0818_040818_ice_age_caveart.html| accessdate = 2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for a more directly sexual purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vhSHn-B89A0C&amp;pg=PA195 | title = The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age | isbn = 9780684862705 | author1 = Rudgley | first1 = Richard | date = 2000-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists in Germany reported in April 2005 that they had found what they believe is a 7,200-year-old scene depicting a male figurine bending over a female figurine in a manner suggestive of sexual intercourse.

===Greek and Roman===
The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] often painted sexual scenes on their [[ceramic art|ceramics]], many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of [[homosexuality|same-sex relations]] and [[pederasty]]. Greek art often portrays sexual activity, but it is impossible to distinguish between what to them was illegal or immoral since the ancient Greeks did not have a concept of pornography. Their art simply reflects scenes from daily life, some more sexual than others. Carved [[phallus|phalli]] can be seen in places of worship such as the temple of [[Dionysus]] on [[Delos]], while a common household item and protective charm was the [[herma|herm]], a statue consisting of a head on a square plinth with a prominent phallus on the front. The Greek male ideal had a small penis, an aesthetic the Romans later adopted.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Herm of Dionysos| publisher = The Getty Museum, J.Paul Getty Trust| url = http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=9917| accessdate = 2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Adams | first = Cecil| title = Why does so much ancient Greek art feature males with small genitalia?| work = The Straight Dope| publisher = Chicago Reader| date = 9 December 2005| url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/051209.html| accessdate = 2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks also created the first well-known instance of [[lesbianism in erotica|lesbian eroticism]] in the West, with [[Sappho]]'s ''Hymn to Aphrodite'' and other [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Williamson | first =Margaret| title =Sappho's Immortal Daughters| publisher =Harvard University Press| year =1995| location = Cambridge, MA| isbn =  0-674-78912-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercury god.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Priapus]] figure from Pompeii. Large phalli were considered undesirable for men to possess and often depicted for comic effect in ancient Rome.&lt;ref name = romans /&gt;&lt;ref name = history/&gt;]]

There are numerous sexually explicit paintings and sculptures from the ruined Roman buildings in [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|Pompeii and Herculaneum]] but the original purposes of the depictions can vary. On one hand, in the [[Villa of the Mysteries]], there is a ritual flagellation scene that is clearly associated with a religious cult and this image can be seen as having religious significance rather than sexual. On the other hand, graphic paintings in a brothel advertise sexual services in murals above each door. In Pompeii, phalli and testicles engraved in the sidewalks were created to aid visitors in finding their way by pointing to the prostitution and entertainment district as well as general decoration. The Romans considered depictions of sex to be decoration in good taste, and indeed the pictures reflect the sexual mores and practices of their culture, as on the [[Warren Cup]]. Sex acts that were considered [[taboo]] (such as those that defiled the purity of the mouth) were depicted in [[thermae|baths]] for comic effect. Large phalli were often used near entryways, for the phallus was a good-luck charm, and the carvings were common in homes. One of the first objects excavated when the complex was discovered was a [[marble]] statue showing the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] having sex with a [[goat]], a detailed depiction of [[bestiality]] considered so obscene that it was not on public display until the year 2000 and remains in the [[Secret Museum, Naples]].&lt;ref name = romans /&gt;&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hemingway | first = Seán| title = Roman Erotic Art| journal = Sculpture Review| volume = 53| issue = 4| pages = 10–15| publisher = National Sculpture Society| date = Winter 2004| url = http://www.sculpturereview.com/| accessdate = 2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peruvian===
The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] of [[Peru]] are another ancient people that sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their [[pottery]]. At least 500 Moche ceramics have sexual themes. The most frequently depicted act is [[anal sex]], with scenes of vaginal penetration being very rare.  Most pairs are heterosexual, with carefully carved genitalia to show that the anus, rather than the vagina, is being penetrated. Often, an infant is depicted [[breastfeeding]] while the couple has sex. [[Fellatio]] is sometimes represented, but [[cunnilingus]] is absent. Some depict male skeletons masturbating, or being masturbated by living women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weismantel, M. | year = 2004 | title = Moche sex pots: Reproduction and temporality in ancient South America | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–496 | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/moche/moche-sex-pots.pdf | doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.3.495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rafael Larco Hoyle]] speculates that their purpose was much different than that of other early cultures. He states that the Moche believed that the world of the dead was the exact opposite of the world of the living. Therefore, for [[funeral]] offerings, they made [[wiktionary:vessel|vessels]] showing sex acts such as [[masturbation]], [[fellatio]] and [[anal sex]] that would not result in offspring. The hope was that in the world of the dead, they would take on their opposite meaning and result in fertility. The erotic pottery of the Moche is depicted in Hoyle's book ''Checan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/6/4/399 book-review (In ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', Vol. 6, 1966) of ''Checan'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indiaerotic1.jpg|right|thumb|Prince and his lady on a terrace at night (India)]]

There has been a long tradition of erotic painting in the East. [[History of India|India]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and other lands produced copious quantities of art celebrating the human faculty of love. The works depict love between men and women as well as same-sex love. One of the most famous ancient [[sex manual]]s was the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', written by [[Vātsyāyana]] in India during the first few centuries [[Common Era|CE]]. Another notable treatise on human sexuality is [[The Perfumed Garden]] by the Tunisian Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Nafzawi, dating to the fifteenth century.

In Japan, the erotic art found its greatest flowering in the medium of the [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]]. The style is known as {{nihongo|''[[Shunga (art)|shunga]]''|春画|spring pictures}} and some of its classic practitioners (e.g. [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]], [[Utamaro]]) produced a large number of works. Painted hand scrolls were also very popular. Shunga appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity despite occasional attempts to suppress them, the first of which was a ban on erotic books known as {{nihongo|''kōshokubon''| 好色本}} issued by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in [[Kyōhō]] 7 (1722).  Shunga only ceased to be produced in the 19th century when photography was invented.&lt;ref name = east/&gt;&lt;ref name = shunga&gt;{{cite web| last = Parent| first = Mary N, PhD| title = Shunga| publisher = Japanese Architecture and Art net users system| year = 2001| url = http://www.aisf.or.jp/%7Ejaanus/deta/s/shunga.htm| accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese tradition of the erotic was also extensive, with examples of the art dating back as far as the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368). The erotic art of China reached its peak during the latter part of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644).&lt;ref name = east/&gt;&lt;ref name = dreams&gt;{{cite book| last = Bertholet| first = L.C.P.| title = Dreams of Spring: Erotic Art in China: From the Bertholet Collection| publisher = Pepin Press| date = October 1997| isbn = 90-5496-039-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both China and Japan, eroticism played a prominent role in the development of the novel. ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', the work by an [[Heian period|11th-century Japanese]] noblewoman that is often called "the world's first novel," traces the many affairs of its hero in discreet but carnal language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Puette | first =William J.| title =The Tale of Genji: A Reader's Guide | publisher =Tuttle Publishing| year =2004| isbn =  0-8048-3331-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Ming Dynasty|16th-century China]], the still more explicit novel ''[[The Plum in the Golden Vase]]'' has been called one of the [[Four Great Classical Novels|four great classical novels]] of Chinese literature. ''The Tale of Genji'' has been celebrated in Japan since it was written, but  ''The Plum in the Golden Vase'' was suppressed as pornography for much of its history, and replaced on the list of four classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Roy | first =David Tod| title = The Plum in the Golden Vase or, Chin P'ing Mei : The Gathering, Volume I | publisher = Princeton University Press | year =1993| isbn =  0-691-06932-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European===
Erotic scenes in [[medieval]] [[illuminated manuscript]]s also appeared, but were seen only by those who could afford the extremely expensive hand-made books. Most of these drawings occur in the [[wiktionary:margin|margins]] of [[book of hours|books of hours]]. Many medieval scholars think that the pictures satisfied the medieval cravings for both erotic pictures and religion in one book, especially since it was often the only book someone owned. Other scholars think the drawings in the margins were a kind of moral caution, but the depiction of priests and other ranking officials engaged in sex acts suggests political origins as well.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

It was not until the invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] that sexually explicit images entered into any type of mass circulation in the western world. Before that time, erotic images, being hand made and expensive, were limited to upper class males. Even the [[British Museum]] had a [[Secretum (room)|Secretum]] filled with a collection of ancient [[erotica]] donated by the upper class doctor, [[George Witt (collector)|George Witt]] in 1865. The remains of the collection, including his scrapbooks, still reside in Cupboard 55, though the majority of it has recently been integrated with the museum's other collections.&lt;ref name = rude&gt;{{cite journal| last = Giamster| first = David| title = Sex and Sensibility at the British Museum| journal = History Today| volume = 50| issue = 9| pages = 10–15| publisher = History Today| date = September 2000| url = http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=10989&amp;amid=10989| accessdate = 2006-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old master print|Prints]] became very popular in Europe from the middle of the fifteenth century, and because of their compact nature, were very suitable for erotic depictions that did not need to be permanently on display.  Nudity and the revival of classical subjects were associated from very early on in history of the print, and many prints of subjects from mythological subjects were clearly in part an excuse for erotic material; the [[engraving]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Palumba]] in particular.  An earthier eroticism is seen in a printing plate of 1475-1500 for an ''Allegory of Copulation'' where a young couple are having sex, with the woman's legs high in the air, at one end of a bench, while at the other end a huge penis, with legs and wings and a bell tied around the bottom of the glans, is climbing onto the bench.  Although the plate has been used until worn out, then re-engraved and heavily used again, none of the contemporary impressions printed, which probably ran into the hundreds, have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Levinson| first = Jay A.

The loves of classical gods, especially those of [[Jupiter]] detailed in [[Ovid]] provided many subjects where actual sex was the key moment in the story, and its depiction was felt to be justified.  In particular [[Leda and the Swan]], where the god appeared as a [[swan]] and seduced the woman, was depicted very explicitly; it seems that this—rather strangely—was considered more acceptable because he appeared as a bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bull |first = Malcolm | title = The Mirror of the Gods, How Renaissance Artists Rediscovered the Pagan Gods| publisher = Oxford University Press| date = February 21, 2005| location = USA |isbn = 978-0-19-521923-4 |page = 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- (Commented out until referenced) Nonetheless, the most famous painted depictions of the subject, by [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] were apparently later destroyed by the French royal family, and a further version by [[Correggio]] was attacked by a cousin of the King in a fit of depression.--&gt; For a period ending in the early 16th century the boundaries of what could be depicted in for display in the semi-privacy of a Renaissance palace seemed uncertain.

The hard to imagine statement is OR) It is hard to imagine equivalently prominent works outside the specialized genre of erotica from about 1530 until the 19th century.  After the early fifteenth century both large paintings for palaces, and small prints for collectors, cease to show either actual sex or explicit female pudenda.  The pattern for female nudes was set by the [[Dresden Venus]] of [[Giorgione]] (ca. 1510), where a reclining female nude is shown frontally, but not explicitly, and by herself.  [[Titian]] and others largely continued this pattern, and the [[Rokeby Venus]] by [[Velázquez]] (1640s) provides a rear-view version.  The [[Little Masters]] in Germany produced many very small prints - often just two inches tall - of erotic subjects, for middle-class collectors, but were not as explicit as the artists of thirty years before.--&gt;

In the 16th century an attempt to print erotic material caused a scandal when the well-known Italian artist [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] published ''[[I Modi]]'' in 1524, an illustrated book of 16 "postures" or sexual positions. Raimondi was subsequently imprisoned by the [[Pope Clement VII]] and all copies of the illustrations were destroyed. Raimondi based the [[engraving]]s on a series of erotic paintings that [[Giulio Romano]] was doing as a commission for the [[Palazzo del Te]] in [[Mantua]]. Though the two depictions were very similar, only Raimondi was prosecuted because his engravings were capable of being seen by the public. Romano did not know of the engravings until [[Pietro Aretino]] came to see the original paintings while Romano was still working on them. Aretino then composed sixteen explicit [[sonnet]]s ("both in your cunt and your behind, my prick will make me happy, and you happy and blissful")&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = Imodi&gt;{{cite book| last = Lawner| first = Lynne, ed.| title = I Modi; the sixteen pleasures: an erotic album of the Italian Renaissance| publisher = Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston| year = 1989| isbn = 0-8101-0803-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to go with the paintings and secured Raimondi's release from prison.  ''I Modi'' was then published a second time in 1527, with the poems and the pictures, making this the first time erotic text and images were combined, though the papacy once more seized all the copies it could find. Raimondi escaped prison that time, but the censorship was so strict that no complete editions of the original printings have ever been found. The text in existence is only a copy of a copy that was discovered 400 years later.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name="Imodi"/&gt;

In the 17th century, numerous examples of pornographic or erotic literature began to circulate. These included ''L'Ecole des Filles'', a French work printed in 1655 that is considered to be the beginning of pornography in [[France]]. It consists of an illustrated dialogue between two women, a 16-year-old and her more worldly cousin, and their explicit discussions about sex.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], many of the French free-thinkers began to exploit pornography as a medium of social criticism and [[satire]]. [[Libertine]] pornography was a subversive social commentary and often targeted the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] and general attitudes of [[sexual repression]]. The market for the mass-produced, inexpensive pamphlets soon became the bourgeoisie, making the upper class worry, as in England, that the morals of the lower class and weak-minded would be corrupted since women, slaves and the uneducated were seen as especially vulnerable during that time. The stories and illustrations (sold in the galleries of the [[Palais Royal]], along with the services of prostitutes) were often [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] and full of misbehaving priests, monks and nuns, a tradition that in French pornography continued into the 20th century. In the period leading up to the [[French Revolution]], pornography was also used as political commentary; [[Marie Antoinette]] was often targeted with fantasies involving orgies, lesbian activities and the paternity of her children, and rumours circulated about the supposed sexual inadequacies of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]].&lt;ref name = libido2 /&gt;&lt;ref name = libido4&gt;{{cite web| last = Beck| first = Marianna| title = The Roots of Western Pornography: the French Revolution and the spread of {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated pornography| work = Libido, the Journal of Sex and Sensibility| publisher = Libido Inc |date=February 2003 |url=http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/europorn04.html| accessdate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the Revolution, the famous works of the [[Marquis de Sade]] were printed.

The English answer to this was ''Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure'' (later abridged and renamed ''[[Fanny Hill]]'') written in 1748 by [[John Cleland]]. While the text satirised the literary conventions and fashionable manners of 18th century England, it was more scandalous for depicting a woman, the narrator, enjoying and even reveling in sexual acts with no dire moral or physical consequences. The text is hardly explicit as Cleland wrote the entire book using euphemisms for sex acts and body parts, employing 50 different ones just for the term [[penis]]. Two small earthquakes were credited to the book by the [[Bishop of London]] and Cleland was arrested and briefly imprisoned, but ''Fanny Hill'' continued to be published and is one of the most reprinted books in the English language. However, it was not legal to own this book in the United States until 1963 and in the United Kingdom until 1970.&lt;ref name = libido3&gt;{{cite web| last = Beck| first = Marianna| title = The Roots of Western Pornography: England bites back with Fanny Hill| work = Libido, the Journal of Sex and Sensibility| publisher = Libido Inc| date = January 2003| url = http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/europorn03.html| accessdate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
{{details|Erotic photography}}
[[File:Vintage nude bust photograph of a young denuded lady.jpg|right|thumb|19th-century nude photograph]]

In 1839, [[Louis Daguerre]] presented the first practical process of [[photography]] to the [[French Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name = timeline&gt;{{cite web| last = Cross| first = J.M., PhD| title = Nineteenth-Century Photography: A Timeline| work = the Victorian Web| publisher = The University Scholars Programme, National University of Singapore| date = 2001-02-04| url = http://victorianweb.org/photos/chron.html | accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier photographic methods, his [[daguerreotype]]s had stunning quality and detail and did not fade with time. Artists adopted the new technology as a new way to depict the nude form, which in practice was the feminine form. In so doing, at least initially, they tried to follow the styles and traditions of the art form. Traditionally, an académie was a [[depictions of nudity|nude]] study done by a painter to master the female (or male) form. Each had to be registered with the French government and approved or they could not be sold. Soon, nude photographs were being registered as académie and marketed as aids to painters. However, the realism of a photograph as opposed to the idealism of a painting made many of these intrinsically erotic.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

The daguerreotypes were not without drawbacks, however. The main difficulty was that they could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use [[negative (photography)|negatives]]. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for [[portrait photography|portraiture]]. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one of two or more people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her [[genitals]]. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for these nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society. It was cheaper to hire a prostitute and experience the sex acts than it was to own a picture of them in the 1840s.&lt;ref name = history /&gt; [[Stereoscope|Stereoscopy]] was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Wheatstone| first = Charles| title = Contributions to the Physiology of Vision.—Part the First.

This technology produced a type of [[three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than 10,000 GBP.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

In 1841, [[William Fox Talbot]] patented the [[calotype]] process, the first negative-positive process, making possible multiple copies.&lt;ref name = glasgow&gt;{{cite web| last = Schaaf| first = Larry| title = The Calotype Process| publisher = Glasgow University Library| year = 1999| url = http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html| accessdate = 2006-08-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060619221733/http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This invention permitted an almost limitless number of prints to be produced from a glass negative. Also, the reduction in exposure time made a true mass market for pornographic pictures possible. The technology was immediately employed to reproduce nude portraits. Paris soon became the centre of this trade. In 1848 only thirteen photography studios existed in Paris; by 1860, there were over 400. Most of them profited by selling illicit pornography to the masses who could now afford it. The pictures were also sold near [[train station]]s, by traveling salesmen and women in the streets who hid them under their dresses. They were often produced in sets (of four, eight or twelve), and exported internationally, mainly to England and the United States. Both the models and the photographers were commonly from the working class, and the artistic model excuse was increasingly hard to use. By 1855, no more photographic nudes were being registered as académie, and the business had gone underground to escape prosecution.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

[[File:Female nude motion study by Eadweard Muybridge.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]]: Woman walking with fishing pole (detail)]]

The Victorian pornographic tradition in Britain had three main elements: French photographs, erotic prints (sold in shops in Holywell Street, a long vanished London thoroughfare, swept away by the [[Aldwych]]), and printed literature. The ability to reproduce photographs in bulk assisted the rise of a new business individual, the porn dealer. Many of these dealers took advantage of the [[postal system]] to send out photographic cards in plain wrappings to their subscribers. Therefore, the development of a reliable international postal system facilitated the beginnings of the pornography trade. Victorian pornography had several defining characteristics. It reflected a very mechanistic view of the [[human anatomy]] and its functions. Science, the new obsession, was used to ostensibly study the human body. Consequently, the sexuality of the subject is often depersonalised, and is without any passion or tenderness. At this time, it also became popular to depict nude photographs of women of exotic ethnicities, under the umbrella of science. Studies of this type can be found in the work of [[Eadweard Muybridge]]. Although he photographed both men and women, the women were often given [[theatrical property|props]] like market baskets and fishing poles, making the images of women thinly disguised erotica.&lt;ref name = history /&gt; Parallel to the British printing history, photographers and printers in France frequently turned to the medium of [[postcard]]s, producing great numbers of them. Such cards came to be known in the US as "[[French postcard]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hZHAAAAMAAJ|first=Philip|last=Herbst|publisher=Intercultural Press|year=1997|isbn=9781877864971|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazines==
{{details|Pornographic magazine}}

During the Victorian period, illegal pornographic periodicals such as ''[[The Pearl (magazine)|The Pearl]]'', which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880, circulated clandestinely among circles of elite urban gentlemen.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Joudrey, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/652322 "Against Communal Nostalgia: Reconstructing Sociality in the Pornographic Ballad,"] ''Victorian Poetry'' 54.4 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, [[halftone]] printing was used to reproduce photographs inexpensively for the first time.&lt;ref name = timeline /&gt; The invention of halftone printing took pornography and erotica in new directions at the beginning of the 20th century. The new printing processes allowed photographic images to be reproduced easily in black and white, whereas printers were previously limited to engravings, [[woodcut]]s and line cuts for illustrations.&lt;ref name = halftone&gt;{{cite web| last = St. John| first = Kristen|author2=Linda Zimmerman| title = Guided Tour of Print Processes: Black and White Reproduction| publisher = Stanford library| date = June 1997| url = http://library.stanford.edu/depts/dp/pennies/print.html| accessdate = 2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first format that allowed pornography to become a mass market phenomena, it now being more affordable and more easily acquired than any previous form.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

First appearing in France, the new magazines featured nude (often, [[burlesque]] actresses were hired as models) and semi-nude photographs on the cover and throughout; while these would now be termed [[softcore pornography|softcore]], they were quite shocking for the time. The publications soon either masqueraded as "art magazines" or publications celebrating the new cult of [[naturism]], with titles such as ''[[Photo Bits]]'', ''Body in Art'', ''Figure Photography'', ''Nude Living'' and ''Modern Art for Men.''&lt;ref name = history /&gt; ''Health and Efficiency'', started in 1900, was a typical naturist magazine in Britain.&lt;ref name = H&amp;E&gt;{{cite web| title = About H&amp;E Naturist |publisher = ''Health and Efficiency Naturist'' |url = http://www.healthandefficiency.co.uk/aboutframe.htm | accessdate = 2006-10-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061014062706/http://www.healthandefficiency.co.uk/aboutframe.htm |archivedate = 2006-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early form of pornography were [[comic book]]s known as [[Tijuana bible]]s that began appearing in the U.S. in the 1920s and lasted until the publishing of glossy colour men's magazines commenced. These were crude hand drawn scenes often using popular characters from [[cartoon]]s and culture.&lt;ref name = tijuana&gt;{{cite book| last = Adelman| first = Bob|author2=Richard Merkin| title = Tijuana Bibles: Art and Wit in America's Forbidden Funnies, 1930s-1950s| publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster| date = September 1, 1997| location = New York| isbn = 0-684-83461-8| page = 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, the word "[[pinup]]" was coined to describe pictures torn from men's magazines and calendars and "pinned up" on the wall by U.S. soldiers in [[World War II]]. While the '40s images focused mostly on legs, by the '50s, the emphasis shifted to [[breast]]s. [[Betty Grable]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] were two of the most popular pinup [[model (person)|models]]. In the second half of the 20th century, pornography evolved into the men's magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''Modern Man'' of the 1950s. In fact, the beginning of the modern men's glossy magazine (or girlie magazine) can be traced to the 1953 purchase by [[Hugh Hefner]] of a photograph of Marilyn Monroe to use as the centerfold of his new magazine ''Playboy''. Soon, this type of magazine was the primary medium in which pornography was consumed.&lt;ref name = girlie&gt;{{cite book| last = Gabor| first = Mark| title = The Illustrated History of Girlie Magazines| publisher = Random House Value Publishing| date = February 27, 1984| location = New York| isbn = 0-517-54997-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In postwar Britain digest magazines such as ''Beautiful Britons'', ''Spick'' and ''Span'', with their interest in nylons and underwear
and the racier ''Kamera'' published by [[Harrison Marks]] were incredibly popular. The creative force behind ''Kamera'' was Harrison Marks' partner [[Pamela Green]]. These magazines featured nude or semi-nude women in extremely coy or flirtatious poses with no hint of pubic hair.

''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', started by [[Bob Guccione]] in England in 1965, took a different approach. Women looked indirectly at the camera, as if they were going about their private idylls. This change of emphasis was influential in erotic depictions of women. ''Penthouse'' was also the first magazine to publish pictures that included pubic hair and [[wiktionary:full frontal nudity|full frontal nudity]], both of which were considered beyond the bounds of the erotic and in the realm of pornography at the time. In the late 1960s, magazines began to move into more explicit displays often focusing on the [[buttocks]] as standards of what could be legally depicted and what readers wanted to see changed. By the 1970s, they were focusing on the pubic area and eventually, by the 1990s, featured [[sexual penetration]], [[lesbian]]ism and homosexuality, [[group sex]], masturbation, and [[sexual fetishism|fetishes]] in the more hard-core magazines such as ''[[Hustler]]''.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = girlie /&gt;

Magazines for every taste and fetish were soon created due to the low cost of producing them. Magazines for the gay community flourished, the most notable and one of the first being ''Physique Pictorial'', started in 1951 by Bob Mizer when his attempt to sell the services of male models; however, [[Athletic Model Guild]] photographs of them failed. It was published in black and white, in a very clear yet photographic manner celebrating the male form and was published for nearly 50 years.&lt;!--awkward statement--&gt; The magazine was innovative in its use of props and [[costume]]s to depict the now standard gay icons like [[cowboy]]s, [[gladiator]]s and [[sailor]]s.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = out&gt;{{cite web| last = Bianco| first = David| title = Physique Magazines| work = Planet Out History |publisher = PlanetOut Inc| url = http://www.planetout.com/news/history/archive/09271999.html| accessdate = 2006-10-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060830161616/http://www.planetout.com/news/history/archive/09271999.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moving pictures==
{{details|Pornographic film}}
[[File:Johann Schwarzer movies about 1906.jpg|right|thumb|Images from early Austrian erotic films by Johann Schwarzer.]]
Production of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. Two of the earliest pioneers were Frenchmen [[Eugène Pirou]] and [[Albert Kirchner]]. Kirchner (under the name "Léar") directed the earliest surviving erotic film for Pirou. The 7-minute 1896 film ''[[Le Coucher de la Mariee]]'' had Louise Willy performing a bathroom [[striptease]].&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;Richard Abel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9cc71Uekc_EC&amp;pg=PA518&amp;dq=%22Louise+Willy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LDEqT9y5HsbWrQeoqLDADA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Louise%20Willy%22&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of early cinema''], Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-415-23440-5}}, p.518&lt;/ref&gt; Other French filmmakers also considered that profits could be made from this type of risqué films, showing women disrobing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bottomore |first=Stephen |editor=Stephen Herbert |editor2=Luke McKernan |year=1996 |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/lear.htm |title=Léar (Albert Kirchner) |work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bottomore |first=Stephen |editor=Stephen Herbert |editor2=Luke McKernan |year=1996 |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/pirou.htm |title=Eugène Pirou |work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1896 ''Fatima's Coochie-Coochie Dance''&lt;ref&gt;Produced by James A. White and shot by William Heise for the Edison Manufacturing Co. in 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; was released as a short [[kinetoscope]] film featuring a gyrating [[belly dancer]] named Fatima. Her gyrating and moving pelvis was censored, one of the earliest films to be censored. At the time, there were numerous risqué films that featured exotic dancers.&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms1.html Sex in Cinema: Pre-1920s]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, ''The May Irwin Kiss'' contained the very first kiss on film. It was a 20-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips ("the mysteries of the kiss revealed"). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and pornographic to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution.&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1 /&gt; A [[tableau vivant]] style is used in short film ''The Birth of the Pearl'' (1901)&lt;ref&gt;Produced by [[Frederick S. Armitage]] for the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]].&lt;/ref&gt; featuring an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-colored [[body stocking]] in a direct frontal pose&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1 /&gt; that provides a provocative view of the female body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awmi10/d21.html|title=The Birth of the Pearl|website=Library of Congress|year=1901|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pose is in the style of [[Botticelli]]'s [[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]].

Because Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In ''Black and White and Blue'' (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of Buenos Aires and other South American cities by around the start of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years; however, none of these earliest pornographic films is known to survive. According to Patrick Robertson's ''Film Facts'', "the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is ''A L'Ecu d'Or ou la bonne auberge''" made in France in 1908; the plot depicts a weary soldier who has a [[wiktionary:tryst|tryst]] with a servant girl at an inn. The Argentinian ''El Satario'' might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912. He also notes that "the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film ''[[Am Abend]]'' (1910) is "a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and [[anal penetration]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Robertson| first = Patrick| title = Film Facts| publisher = Billboard Books| date = December 2001| isbn = 0-8230-7943-0| page = 256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Austria]], [[Johann Schwarzer]] formed his Saturn-Film production company which was able to produce 52 erotic productions between 1906 and 1911, when the company was dissolved by the censorship authorities and the films destroyed.

Soon illegal stag films or blue films, as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their [[bathtub]]s to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesman but being caught viewing or possessing them put one at the risk of prison.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web| last = Corliss| first = Richard| title = That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic| work = Time Magazine| publisher = Time inc| date = March 29, 2005| url = http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,1043267,00.html| accessdate = 2006-10-16| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120524121526/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html| archivedate = May 24, 2012| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-war era saw developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market. Technological developments, particularly the introduction of the [[8 mm film|8mm]] and [[super 8 mm film|super-8]] film gauges, resulted in the widespread use of amateur [[cinematography]]. Entrepreneurs emerged to supply this market. In Britain, the productions of [[Harrison Marks]] were "soft core", but considered risqué in the 1950s. On the continent, such films were more explicit. [[Lasse Braun]] was as a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Pornography was first legalized in Denmark July 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/ccies/dk.php Denmark in the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality] - "...Denmark was the first country in the world to legitimize written pornography in 1967 (followed by pictorial pornography in 1969)."&lt;/ref&gt; soon followed by the Netherlands the same year and Sweden in 1971, and this led to an explosion of commercially produced pornography in those countries, with the [[Color Climax Corporation]] quickly becoming the leading pornographic producer for the next couple of decades. Now that being a pornographer was a legitimate occupation, there was no shortage of businessmen to invest in proper plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, were smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold "under the counter" or (sometimes) shown in "members only" cinema clubs.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;

The first explicitly pornographic film with a plot that received a general theatrical release in the U.S. is generally considered to be ''[[Mona the Virgin Nymph]]'' (also known as ''Mona''), a 59-minute 1970 feature by Bill Osco and Howard Ziehm, who went on to create the relatively high-budget hardcore/softcore (depending on the release) cult film ''[[Flesh Gordon]]''.&lt;ref name = time /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mehendale| first = Rachel| title = Is porn a problem?| work = Sex | pages = 17, 22| publisher = The Daily Texan| date = February 9, 2006| url = http://www.tsp.utexas.edu/FrontPage/TSMweb/advertising%20supplements/Valentines%20Day/valentines.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate = 2006-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1971 film ''[[Boys in the Sand]]'' represented a number of pornographic firsts. As the first generally available gay pornographic film, the film was the first to include on-screen credits for its cast and crew (albeit largely under pseudonyms), to parody the title of a mainstream film (in this case, ''[[The Boys in the Band]]''), and to be reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Edmonson| first = Roger|author2=Cal Culver |author3=Casey Donovan | title = Boy in the Sand: Casey Donovan, All-American Sex Star| publisher = Alyson Books| date = October 1998| isbn = 1-55583-457-4| page = 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, pornographic films hit their public peak in the United States with both ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' being met with public approval and becoming social phenomena.

''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' followed in 1973 and many predicted that frank depictions of sex onscreen would soon become commonplace, with [[William Rotsler]] saying in 1973, "Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled sub-division.

==Video and digital depictions==
{{details|Internet pornography}}

[[File:Cinta ligas 009.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Digitally altered erotic photograph]]

By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of [[videotape]]. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because of the different image quality that video tape produced; however, those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realised that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's private homes. This was the end of the age of big budget productions and the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover every fetish possible since filming was now so inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands now were, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = time /&gt;

Erotic [[CD-ROM]]s were popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s because they brought an unprecedented element of interactiveness and fantasy. However, their poor quality was a drawback and when the [[Internet]] became common in households their sales declined. About the same time as the video revolution, the Internet became the preferred source of pornography for many people, offering both privacy in viewing and the chance to interact with people. The recent influx of widely available technology such as [[digital camera]]s, both moving and still, has blurred the lines between erotic films, photographs and amateur and professional productions.
It allows easy access to both formats, making the production of them easily achieved by anyone with access to the equipment. Much of the pornography available today is produced by amateurs.

[[File:Humanzoogermany.jpg|upright|thumb|400px|An ad for a "Peoples Show" (''Völkerschau'') in [[Stuttgart]] (Germany), 1928]]
'''Human zoos''', also called '''ethnological expositions''', were 19th-, 20th-, and 21st-century public exhibitions of humans, usually in a so-called natural or primitive state. The displays often emphasized the cultural differences between Europeans of [[Western world|Western civilization]] and non-European peoples or with other Europeans who practiced a lifestyle deemed more primitive. Some of them placed [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] populations in a continuum somewhere between the [[great ape]]s and Europeans. Ethnological expositions have been extensively criticized and ascertained as highly degrading and [[Racism|racist]], depending on the show and individuals involved.

== Human zoos in Germany ==

{{refimprove section|date=June 2018}}
In the late 19th century German ethnographic museums&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Objects of Culture Ethnology and Ethnographic Museums in Imperial Germany|last=H. Glenn|first=Penny|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; were an attempt at empirical study of human culture. They contained artifacts from cultures around the world organized by continent allowing visitors to see the similarities and differences between the groups and form their own ideas. The ethnographic museums of Germany were explicitly designed to steer away from projecting certain principles or instructing its viewers to interpret the material in a particular manner. They were instead left open for museum guests to form their own opinions.

The directors of Germany's ethnographic museums intended to create a unifying history of mankind,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to show how humans had progressed to the cosmopolitan creatures that walked the halls of these museums. Imperialism influenced the supporters, visitors, and collectors of these museums, the displays, directions, and political rhetoric.

Ethnology studies in Germany took a new approach in the 1870s as human displays were incorporated into zoos. These exhibits were lauded as educational to the general population by the scientific community of the time, because they were informing of the way people lived across the world. Very quickly the exhibits were used as a way to show that Europeans had evolved into a superior cosmopolitan life.

As Ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around 1931,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/human-zoos-when-people-were-the-exhibits/a-37748193 Ethnogenic expositions were discontinued in Germany around 1931]&lt;/ref&gt; there were many repercussions for the performers. Many of the people brought from their homelands to work in the exhibits had created families in Germany, and there were many children that had been born in Germany. Once they no longer worked in the zoos or for performance acts these people were stuck living in Germany where they had no rights and were harshly discriminated against. During the rise of the Nazi party the foreign actors in these stage shows were typically able to stay out of concentration camps because there were so few of them that the Nazis did not see them as a real threat.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;“‘You Better Go Back to Africa’| Interview.” ''"You Better Go Back to Africa"| Interview'', DW English, 18 June 2017, www.youtube.com/watch?v=baGXUsOKBcU.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were able to avoid concentration camps, they were not able to participate in German life as citizens of ethnically German origin could. The [[Hitler Youth]] did not allow children of foreign parents to participate, and adults were rejected as German soldiers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many ended up working in war industry factories or foreign laborer camps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After [[World War II|WWII]] ended, racism in Germany became more concealed or invisible but did not go away. Many people of foreign descent intended to leave after the war, but because of their German nationality, it was difficult for them to emigrate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Key influences ===
[[Carl Hagenbeck]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Savages and Beasts: The Birth of the Modern Zoo|last=Rothfels|first=Nigel|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a German exotic animal businessman, who became famous for his conquering of the animal trade market during the mid to late 1800’s. Due to the costs of acquiring and keeping animals, the financial implications started to worry Hagenbeck, and he began looking for other ways to alleviate the company’s monetary strains. [[Heinrich Leutemann]], an old friend of Hagenbeck suggested bringing along the people from the foreign lands to accompany the animals. The idea struck Hagenbeck as brilliant and he had a group of [[Sami people|Laplander]]s accompany his next shipment of Reindeer. They set up traditional houses and went about their business as usual on the Hagenbeck property. The display was so successful that Carl was organizing his second show before the first was over. Although the concept of parading peoples captured from conquered lands goes back to the Romans, Hagenbeck claimed to have the first show’s displaying “cultures” from foreign lands. Carl Hagenbeck continued to bring indigenous people along with the animals he was importing from across the globe. The people would come with their hunting equipment, homes, and other facets of their daily life. Hagenbeck’s displays evolved in complexity as the years went by. In 1876 Hagenbeck had a group of 6 [[Sami people|Sami]] accompany a herd of reindeer, and by 1874 his acts included close to 67 men, women, and children in his ''Ceylon'' show performing with 25 elephants. The performances also expanded from showing every day activities such as milking reindeer and building huts, to displaying some of the more extravagant parts of the cultures such as magicians, jugglers, and devil dancers.

The notion of the human curiosity has a history at least as long as [[History of colonialism|colonialism]]. For instance, in the [[Western Hemisphere]], one of the earliest-known [[zoo]]s, that of [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] in Mexico, consisted not only of a vast collection of animals, but also exhibited humans, for example, dwarves, albinos and hunchbacks.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, ''Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals'', [[University of Illinois Press]], [[Urbana, Illinois]], Second edition, 1998, p.32. {{ISBN|0-252-06762-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], the [[Medici]] developed a large [[menagerie]] in the Vatican.
In the 16th century, Cardinal [[Ippolito de' Medici|Hippolytus Medici]] had a collection of people of different races as well as exotic animals.
He is reported as having a troupe of so-called Savages, speaking over twenty languages; there were also Moors, Tartars, Indians, Turks and Africans.&lt;ref&gt;Mullan, Bob and Marvin Garry, ''Zoo culture: The book about watching people watch animals'', [[University of Illinois Press]], [[Urbana, Illinois]], Second edition, 1998, p.98. {{ISBN|0-252-06762-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maximo and Bartola CDV by Edmonds of Southampton, c1867.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Maximo and Bartola, c. 1867]] One of the first modern public human exhibitions was [[P. T. Barnum|P.T. Barnum]]'s exhibition of [[Joice Heth]] on February 25, 1835&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/joiceheth.html|title=The Museum of Hoaxes|work=Museum of Hoaxes|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, subsequently, the [[Conjoined twins|Siamese twins]] [[Chang and Eng Bunker]]. These exhibitions were common in [[freak show]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://migs.concordia.ca/occpapers/zoo.htm "On A Neglected Aspect Of Western Racism"] by Kurt Jonassohn, December 2000, Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies&lt;/ref&gt; Another famous example was that of [[Saartjie Baartman]] of the [[Nama people|Namaqua]], often referred to as the Hottentot Venus, who was displayed in London and France until her death in 1815.

During the 1850s, [[Maximo and Bartola]], two [[microcephalic]] children from El Salvador, were exhibited in the US and Europe under the names Aztec Children and Aztec Lilliputians.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Aguirre]], ''Informal Empire: Mexico And Central America In Victorian Culture'', Univ. of Minnesota Press, 2004, ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  However, human zoos would become common only in the 1870s in the midst of the [[New Imperialism]] period.

== 1870s to the 1930s ==

In the 1870s, exhibitions of exotic populations became popular in various countries. Human zoos could be found in [[Paris]], [[Hamburg]], [[Antwerp]], [[Barcelona]], [[London]], [[Milan]], and [[New York City]]. [[Carl Hagenbeck]], a merchant in wild animals and future entrepreneur of many zoos in Europe, decided in 1874 to exhibit [[Samoans|Samoan]] and [[Sami people]] as "purely natural" populations. In 1876, he sent a collaborator to the Egyptian [[Sudan]] to bring back some wild beasts and [[Nubians]]. The Nubian exhibit was very successful in Europe and toured Paris, London, and [[Berlin]]. In 1880, Hagenbeck dispatched an agent to Labrador to secure a number of Esquimaux (Eskimo / [[Inuit]]) from the moravian mission of Hebron; these Inuit were exhibited in his [[Hamburg Tierpark]]. Other ethnological expositions included Egyptian and Bedouin mock settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Belvedere: Zeitschrift für bildende Kunst, Volume 12|date=2006|publisher=Österreichische Galerie Belvedere|page=102|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=nChMAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagenbeck would also employ agents to take part in his ethnological exhibits, with the aim of exposing his audience to various different subsistence modes and lifestyles. Among these hired workers were Hersi Egeh and his lineage from Berbera in present-day northwestern Somalia, who in the process accumulated much wealth, which they later reinvested in real estate in their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Africana Publishing Company|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|date=1985|page=20|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=NXgMAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The viceroy of India likewise gave Hagenbeck permission to hire local inhabitants for an exhibit, on the condition that Hagenbeck would first have to deposit funds into the royal treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Janet M.|title=The Circus Age: Culture and Society under the American Big Top|date=2003|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0807861499|page=198|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=FDzqCQAAQBAJ|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Geoffroy de Saint-Hilaire]], director of the [[Jardin d'acclimatation]], decided in 1877 to organize two ethnological spectacles that presented Nubians and [[Inuit]]. That year, the audience of the Jardin d'acclimatation' doubled to one million. Between 1877 and 1912, approximately thirty ethnological exhibitions were presented at the ''Jardin zoologique d'acclimatation''.

Both the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878]] and the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|1889 Parisian World's Fair]] presented a Negro Village (''village nègre''). Visited by 28 million people, the 1889 World's Fair displayed 400 indigenous people as the major attraction. The 1900 World's Fair presented the famous [[diorama]] living in [[Madagascar]], while the [[Colonial exhibition|Colonial Exhibitions]] in [[Marseille]]s (1906 and 1922) and in Paris (1907 and 1931) also displayed humans in cages, often nude or semi-nude. The [[Paris Colonial Exposition|1931 exhibition in Paris]] was so successful that 34 million people attended it in six months, while a smaller counter-exhibition entitled ''The Truth on the Colonies'', organized by the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]], attracted very few visitors—in the first room, it recalled [[Albert Londres]] and [[André Gide]]'s critiques of [[unfree labour|forced labour]] in the colonies. Nomadic [[Senegal|Senegalese Villages]] were also presented.

In 1883, native people of [[Suriname]] were displayed in the [[Internationale Koloniale en Uitvoerhandel Tentoonstelling|International Colonial and Export Exhibition]] in Amsterdam, held behind the [[Rijksmuseum]].

In the late 1800s, Hagenbeck organized exhibitions of indigenous populations from various parts of the globe. He staged a public display in 1886 of [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] autochthones from the [[Sri Lanka]]. In 1893/1894, he also put together an exhibition of [[Sami people|Sami]]/Lapps in [[Hamburg]]-Saint Paul.

In 1896, to increase the number of visitors, the [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden|Cincinnati Zoo]] invited one hundred Sioux Native Americans to establish a village at the site. The Sioux lived at the zoo for three months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=685 Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden], Ohio Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, [[Apache]]s and [[Igorot]]s (from the Philippines) were displayed at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|Saint Louis World Fair]] in association with the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]. The US had just acquired, following the [[Spanish–American War]], new territories such as [[Guam]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Puerto Rico]], allowing them to "display" some of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering St. Louis, 1904: A World on Display and Bontoc Eulogy|publisher=[[Syracuse University]]|author=Jim Zwick|date=March 4, 1996|accessdate=2007-05-25|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/Bontoc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Rev. [[Sequoyah Ade]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To further illustrate the indignities heaped upon the [[Philippines|Philippine]] people following their eventual loss to the Americans, the United States made the Philippine campaign the centrepoint of the 1904 World's Fair held that year in St. Louis, MI [sic]. In what was enthusiastically termed a "parade of evolutionary progress," visitors could inspect the "primitives" that represented the counterbalance to "Civilisation" justifying [[Rudyard Kipling|Kipling]]'s poem "[[The White Man's Burden]]". [[Pygmy|Pygmies]] from New Guinea and Africa, who were later displayed in the Primate section of the [[Bronx Zoo]], were paraded next to American Indians such as Apache warrior [[Geronimo]], who sold his autograph. But the main draw was the Philippine exhibition complete with full size replicas of Indigenous living quarters erected to exhibit the inherent backwardness of the Philippine people. The purpose was to highlight both the "civilising" influence of American rule and the economic potential of the island chains' natural resources on the heels of the [[Philippine–American War]]. It was, reportedly, the largest specific Aboriginal exhibition displayed in the exposition. As one pleased visitor commented, the human zoo exhibition displayed "the race narrative of odd peoples who mark time while the world advances, and of savages made, by American methods, into civilized workers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Passions of Suzie Wong Revisited, by Rev. Sequoyah Ade|publisher=[[Aboriginal Intelligence]]|date=January 4, 2004|url=http://www.modelminority.com/article750.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928140712/http://www.modelminority.com/article750.html|archivedate=September 28, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1906, [[Madison Grant]]—socialite, [[eugenics|eugenicist]], amateur [[anthropology|anthropologist]], and head of the [[New York Zoological Society]]—had [[Congo Pygmies|Congolese pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] put on display at the Bronx Zoo in New York City alongside [[ape]]s and other animals. At the behest of Grant, the zoo director [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]] placed Benga displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, and a parrot, and labeled him ''The Missing Link'', suggesting that in [[evolution]]ary terms Africans like Benga were closer to apes than were Europeans. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see it.&lt;ref name=NYTBenga/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Phillips Verner and Blume, Harvey. ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo''. St. Martins Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Friedländer.plakat.8.jpg|thumb|upright|Ad for a [[Carl Hagenbeck]] show (1886)]]

Benga shot targets with a bow and arrow, wove twine, and wrestled with an orangutan. Although, according to ''The New York Times'', "few expressed audible objection to the sight of a human being in a cage with monkeys as companions", controversy erupted as black clergymen in the city took great offense. "Our race, we think, is depressed enough, without exhibiting one of us with the apes", said the Reverend James H. Gordon, superintendent of the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum in Brooklyn. "We think we are worthy of being considered human beings, with souls."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/nyregion/thecity/06zoo.html?ex=1155009600&amp;en=c2cc9b84edc068cd&amp;ei=5087%0A|title=The Scandal at the Zoo|last=Keller|first=Mitch|date=2006-08-06|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mayor of New York City|New York City Mayor]] [[George B. McClellan Jr.]] refused to meet with the clergymen, drawing the praise of Hornaday, who wrote to him: "When the history of the Zoological Park is written, this incident will form its most amusing passage."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

As the controversy continued, Hornaday remained unapologetic, insisting that his only intention was to put on an ethnological exhibition. In another letter, he said that he and Grant—who ten years later would publish the racist tract ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]''—considered it "imperative that the society should not even seem to be dictated to" by the black clergymen.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

On Monday, September 8, 1906, after just two days, Hornaday decided to close the exhibition, and Benga could be found walking the zoo grounds, often followed by a crowd "howling, jeering and yelling."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

In 1925, a display at [[Belle Vue Zoo]] in [[Manchester]], England, was entitled "Cannibals" and featured black Africans depicted as savages.&lt;ref&gt;Paul A. Rees, ''An Introduction to Zoo Biology and Management'', [[Wiley-Blackwell]], John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd., [[Chichester]] ([[West Sussex]]), 2011, p.44. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9349-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, a new kind of human zoo appeared in America, nude shows masquerading as education. These included the [[Zoro Garden Nudist Colony]] at the Pacific International Exposition in San Diego, California (1935-6) and the Sally Rand Nude Ranch at the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]] in San Francisco (1939). The former was supposedly a real [[nudist colony]], which used hired performers instead of actual nudists. The latter featured nude women performing in western attire. The Golden Gate fair also featured a "Greenwich Village" show, described in the Official Guide Book as “Model artists’ colony and revue theatre.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfmuseum.org/bio/rand.html "Sally Rand and The Music Box", Virtual Museum of San Francisco]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Adelaide Zoo]] ran a Human Zoo exhibition which consisted of a group of people who, as part of a study exercise, had applied to be housed in the former ape enclosure by day, but then returned home by night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Humans on display at Adelaide Zoo |publisher=[[tvnz]] |date=January 12, 2007 |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/957918/3362663.xhtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222070938/http://tvnz.co.nz/content/957918/3362663.xhtml |archivedate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants took part in several exercises, and spectators were asked for donations towards a new ape enclosure.

Also in 2007, pygmy performers at the Festival of Pan-African Music (Fespam) were housed at a zoo in [[Brazzaville]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].  Although members of the group of twenty people - among them an infant, age three-months - were not officially on display, it was necessary for them to "collect firewood in the zoo to cook their food, and [they] were being stared at and filmed by tourists and passers-by".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6898241.stm|title=Pygmy artists housed in Congo zoo|author=[[BBC News]]|date=2007-07-13|accessdate=2008-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This collection of '''[[lists of law topics]]''' collects the names of topics related to [[law]]. Everything related to law, even quite remotely, should be included on the alphabetical list, and on the appropriate topic lists.  All links on topical lists should also appear in the main alphabetical listing. The process of creating lists is ongoing&amp;nbsp;– these lists are neither complete nor up-to-date&amp;nbsp;– if you see an article that should be listed but is not (or one that shouldn't be listed as legal but is), please update the lists accordingly. You may also want to include [[Wikipedia:Wikiproject Law|Wikiproject Law]] talk page banners on the relevant pages.

There has been a long-standing '''influence of [[French language|French]] on [[English language|English]],''' in terms of [[syntax]], [[grammar]], [[lexicon]], spelling and pronunciation.

Most French vocabulary that entered English occurred after the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066 and the establishment of a French-speaking administration. French became the language of the court, the administration and the elites for several centuries, until after the [[Hundred Years War]]. English has been constantly influenced by French from that time till present day.
According to Laura K. Lawless, more than a third of the current [[English vocabulary]] is of French origin.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm |website=french.about.com |title=Terms of Enrichment: How French Has Influenced English |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216063051/http://french.about.com/od/vocabulary/a/frenchinenglish.htm# |archive-date=2016-12-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguist [[Henriette Walter]], words of French origin represent more than two thirds of the English vocabulary. It is estimated by linguist Anthony Lacoudre that over 40 000 English words are directly French and may be understood without [[orthographical]] change by French speakers.&lt;ref name="dailymotion"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5vbb1z |title=L&amp;#039;incroyable histoire des mots français dans la langue anglaise – Vidéo dailymotion |website=dailymotion.com |accessdate=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of French in England ==

=== Before 1066 ===
At the beginning of XIth century, the English language did not have a well-defined status. Indeed, the inhabitants of what would become [[Great Britain]] did not have a language that allowed them to communicate with each other. There were many different [[dialect]]al forms. Great Britain, in which various [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] idioms had coexisted since the IVth century, had experienced partial [[Roman Empire|Roman occupation]] since the 1st century A.D., and this for four centuries.

From 450 onwards, the [[Saxons]], the [[Angles (people)|Angles]] and the [[Jutes]], who came from the continent, settled in the south and east. Germanic dialects would prevail in these regions, supplanting Celtic dialects, which would remain in the west and north of the island ([[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], [[Scotland]]) and [[Ireland]]. In the VIIIth century, [[Vikings]] from [[Scandinavia]] settled on the island. Their languages, also Germanic, in turn influence the languages already present on the island. Thus, at the dawn of XIth century, the country was made up of a series of peoples with significantly different speeches, most of them Germanic, with multiple influences.

=== Norman conquest of England and its consequences ===
It is therefore a linguistically disunited people that the Normans will get massively in contact with, from 1066. [[William II of Normandy]], supported by his King, [[Philip I of France]], and his blood legitimacy to the throne of England, landed at [[Hastings]], in [[Sussex]], on 29 September 1066. His men are deployed around the city waiting for the king [[Harold II]]'s troops. On October 14, exhausted by the long journey to Hastings, Harold II's troops lost the battle after a day. Following the defeat of the English, Duke William II of Normandy became King of England on December 25, 1066, crowned under the name of William I of England, also known as William the Conqueror. This date marks the beginning of a long period of ties between the peoples and languages.

In fact, these links already existed before the Battle of Hastings. Indeed, the geographical location of Normandy, facing the English Channel, favoured commercial contacts with England. These ties will be further strengthened at the beginning of the XIth century when the daughter of the Duke [[Richard II of Normandy]], Emma, marries King [[Æthelred II of England]]. But it is really from the 1066 conquest that [[proto-English]] becomes massively impregnated with [[Old French]], then modern French. It should be noted, however, that only French will influence English in the centuries following the conquest. The reverse contribution of English to French will only be real from the XVIIIth century.

The arrival of William the Conqueror and his barons significantly changed the linguistic situation in England. [[Norman language|Norman]] is essentially imposed in the upper layers of society. The Anglo-Saxon dialects were supplanted by Norman in the circles of the court and aristocracy, justice and the Church. The influential circles, who came from Normandy and settled in England, kept their Norman mother tongue, while the more modest rural and urban strata continued to speak English.

Norman is a particular variety of the [[Gallo-Roman]] language, spoken in Normandy. It is one of the [[Oil languages]] alongside, among others, the [[Picard language|Picard]] and the [[Walloon language|Walloon]]. The Norman language is modified in contact with the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language. It then integrates words and phrases from English and will give birth to a dialect, [[Anglo-Norman (language)|Anglo-Norman]], still spoken on the [[Anglo-Norman isles]]. Anglo-Norman can be described as a [[vernacular language]], on English soil in the XIth century, in the field of literature, culture, court and among the clergy. French was therefore, at first, spoken in England under the form of this Anglo-Norman dialect.

During the XIIth century, continental French has a greater influence on Old English. It acquires great prestige in England, especially within the aristocracy and the clergy. It becomes the language of law and justice nationwide. Rich and noble families, most of them of Norman origin, teach their children French or send them to study in France. The expansion of the French language in England was also encouraged by royal marriages. From [[Henry II Plantagenet]] and [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] at the beginning of the century, to [[Henri VI]] and [[Marguerite of Anjou|Marguerite]] in the XVth century, all kings of England married French princesses. These marriages made French the language of the English court for several centuries and were decisive in strengthening the use of French in England. This period (XIIth-XVth centuries) is characterized by a massive influx of French words into Old English vocabulary.&lt;ref name="le-mot-juste-en-anglais"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html |title=Comment le français a influencé la langue anglaise |website=Le mot juste en anglais |accessdate=2018-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120221242/https://www.le-mot-juste-en-anglais.com/2013/09/linfluence-du-francais-sur-la-langue-anglaise.html# |archive-date=2018-11-20 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1204, [[Philippe Auguste]] Normandy is officially annexed to the kingdom of France, politically isolating England from the continent. Normans who choose to stay in England move further away from France and, therefore, from the French language. Keeping its status as the language of justice and the language of power, England saw the first teaching manuals for teaching French to the English. These manuals were intended for English nobles who wish to perfect their knowledge of French and teach it to their children. Two types of French spoken in the higher spheres of English society can be distinguished during the XIIIth century : the Anglo-Norman dialect, which was the aristocrats' mother tongue, and a more prestigious type of French as a second language. Knowing "parisian" French was a mark of social distinction. As a language of culture, French supplanted Latin from the XIIth century onward as the language of diplomacy and worldly relations throughout Europe. The mass and influence of French literature reinforced its reputation and appeal.

=== The developing use of French ===
The [[XVIth century]], that of the [[Renaissance]], is a decisive century for French since king [[François I of France]], through the [[Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts]] ([[1539]]), makes French the official language of administration in the whole kingdom.
Although troubled by the [[European wars of religion]], the [[Italian Wars]], the language is marked by intellectual, technical and scientific effervescence. It ushered in an era of prosperity that would also spread to England through French.

The XVIIth century announces the apogee of the Kingdom of France. This period was characterized by the political, literary and artistic prestige of France and the French language. Peace restored and unity ensured in the country, economy grew considerably. Personalities such as the King [[Henri IV of France|Henri IV]], the [[Cardinal of Richelieu]] or the [[Sun King]] contribute to fixing and enhancing the French language in Europe, the Americas, India and Oceania.

The creation of the [[Académie française]] by Richelieu in 1635, under [[Louis XIII]], was a step that led to the standardization of French in continental Europe and abroad, including England. French is then the second language of all the elites in Europe, from Turkey to Ireland and from Moscow to Lisbon. The greatest scholars and intellectuals, writers and scientists, express themselves and correspond in this new standardised French. French is considered a perfect language, whose beauty and elegance are determined by the development of scientific logic, aided by dictionaries and grammars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/caief_0571-5865_1992_num_44_1_1775|title=Le Français face à l'anglais : aspects linguistiques|first=Michael D.|last=Picone|date=22 November 1992|publisher=|journal=Cahiers de l'Association internationale des études francaises|volume=44|issue=1|pages=9–23|doi=10.3406/caief.1992.1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the XXIst Century ==
The geographical use of French has continuously and greatly diversified in the last five hundred years, with countries and states like [[New-Brunswick]], [[Quebec]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Benin]], [[Togo]], [[Guinea]], [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], [[Tchad]], [[Djibouti]], [[Senegal]], [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Lebanon]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[Aosta Valley]], [[French Polynesia]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]] adopting it as their official language. This geographical diversity has led to many different contacts with [[vernacular]] dialects, regional and international languages, from which French has often been enriched locally.
In a number of countries and regions where French shares co-officiality with English (Cameroon, [[Canada]], [[Jersey]], [[Mauritius]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311113430/http://andre.thibault.pagesperso-orange.fr/IleMaurice.pdf# |archive-date=2016-03-11 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rwanda]], Vanuatu), particular lexical regionalisms are observed where French and English terms are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr/articles.php?pg=850|title=Avenir de la Langue Française (ALF) - Ile Maurice|first=|last=MAR|website=www.avenir-langue-francaise.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The contribution of the French lexicon to English ==
Several elements must be observed.

* Sometimes, the English words' form has kept traces of Old French, written or oral, such as certain consonants (''forest'' / forest) or certain vowels or diphthongs (''veil'' / voil; ''leisure'' / leisure), the current French sometimes deviating more from its old form than the English (i.e. Old French ''ante'' gives "tante" in modern French and is written 'aunt' in modern English).
* Many English nouns, verbs and adjectives borrowed from Old French have not always kept the meaning they had in Old French. Sometimes, they have developed a different meaning from French. In both cases, these words are [[false friend]]s (''egre'' giving 'sour' (''aigre'') in French while mutating into 'eager' in English).
* Other English words are composed of both words of French and Germanic origins (''handkerchief'': ''hand'' is from the proto-Germanic ''k'''hand'''uz'' and ''kerchief'' is a mutation on the old French ''core chief'')
* Some forms of Old French did not survive in modern French, while they still exist in English (''soulace'',''conceler'',''estriver'',''gone'').
* It is not uncommon either for an English concept to have two or even three vocabulary words to describe it, one of French origin, a part from proto-Germanic and another of Latin origin (''royal'', ''kingly'', and ''regal'' all mean the same thing, 'royal').
* Most of the English words ending in ''-ous'', ''-ty'' (on the model of ''-té''),''-tion'', ''-ture'', ''-ture'', ''-ent'' are of French origin.
* Uses in social and intellectual life, but also certain domestic and food uses, demonstrate the omnipresence of French in English society in many fields, for example the names of meat: "beef" comes from the French ''buef'' (beef), "mutton" from ''moton'' (sheep), "pork" from ''pork'', "veal" from ''vel'' (calf).
* Some words borrowed in the XIXth and XXth centuries are still considered foreign words, French words (such as ''chic''). They are generally used by educated English people or by the press and other media and are seen as part of a distinguished language.
* Some [[Anglicisms]] are actually words that were borrowed from French a long time ago and have recently been borrowed back from English (such as ''bacon'').

The following French glossary in English is in no way exhaustive. These words come as examples to illustrate the countless French words that are part of the English language.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

In this section, examples of French-to-English lexical contributions are classified by field and in chronological order. The periods during which these words were used in the English language are specified as much as possible. It is not always possible to state with certainty the precise period from which a word was borrowed or integrated.

The English word is on the left, with its current French equivalent in brackets, then comes its Old French origin in bold and the century of its introduction on the right.

[[File:Stop Defacing Signs.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[stop sign]] ironically defaced with a plea ''not'' to deface stop signs.]]

'''Irony''' ({{ety|grc|''εἰρωνεία'' eirōneía|dissimulation, feigned ignorance}}&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp; Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'', v. sub {{lang|grc|εἰρωνεία}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), in its broadest sense, is a [[rhetorical device]], [[literary technique]], or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. 

Irony can be categorized into different types, including: ''verbal irony'', ''dramatic irony'', and ''situational irony''. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of [[simile]], used in [[sarcasm]], and some forms of [[litotes]] can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Compass_of_Irony.html?id=7PsNAAAAQAAJ Muecke, DC., ''The Compass of Irony'', Routledge, 1969. p. 80]&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms, as identified by historian [[Connop Thirlwall]], include dialectic and practical irony.&lt;ref name="NPE" /&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Henry Watson Fowler]], in ''[[The King's English]]'', says, "any definition of irony—though hundreds might be given, and very few of them would be accepted—must include this, that the surface meaning and the underlying meaning of what is said are not the same." Also, Eric Partridge, in ''[[Eric Partridge|Usage and Abusage]]'', writes that "Irony consists in stating the contrary of what is meant."

The use of irony may require the concept of a ''double audience''. Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Irony is a form of utterance that postulates a double audience, consisting of one party that hearing shall hear &amp; shall not understand, &amp; another party that, when more is meant than meets the ear, is aware both of that more &amp; of the outsiders' incomprehension.&lt;ref name="Fowler, HW 1926"&gt;Fowler, H. W., ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage'', 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term is sometimes used as a synonym for ''incongruous'' and applied to "every trivial oddity" in situations where there is no double audience.&lt;ref name="Fowler, HW 1926"/&gt; An example of such usage is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]], whose real interest was, ironically, serious music, which he composed with varying degrees of success, achieved fame for his comic opera scores rather than for his more earnest efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Gassner, J., Quinn, E., ''The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]''{{'s}} secondary meaning for ''irony'': "incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony |title="irony" at dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218045412/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony |archivedate=2010-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense, however, is not synonymous with "incongruous" but merely a definition of dramatic or situational irony. {{Anchor|Incongruity_plus_human_folly}} It is often included in definitions of irony ''not only'' that incongruity is present ''but also'' that the incongruity must reveal some aspect of human vanity or folly. Thus the majority of ''American Heritage Dictionary'''s usage panel found it unacceptable to use the word ''ironic'' to describe mere unfortunate coincidences or surprising disappointments that "suggest no particular lessons about human vanity or folly."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Free Dictionary'' under ''ironic'': http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ironic&lt;/ref&gt;

On this aspect, ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') has also:&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "irony" entry, second definition.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|1=A condition of affairs or events of a character opposite to what was, or might naturally be, expected; a contradictory outcome of events as if in mockery of the promise and fitness of things. (In French, ''ironie du sort'').}}

==Origin of the term==
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=irony |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294609/irony |accessdate=18 September 2014 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150212010710/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294609/irony |archive-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Quote|1=The term irony has its roots in the Greek comic character [[Eiron]], a clever underdog who by his wit repeatedly triumphs over the boastful character [[Alazon]]. The Socratic irony of the [[Platonic dialogues]] derives from this comic origin.}}

According to Richard Whately:&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; "Rhetoric", ''Encyclopedia Metropolitan'', I. 265/1; 1845 (cited in the ''OED'' entry)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=[[Aristotle]] mentions ''Eironeia'', which in his time was commonly employed to signify, not according to the modern use of 'Irony, saying the contrary to what is meant', but, what later writers usually express by [[Litotes]], i.e. 'saying less than is meant'.}}

The word came into English as a [[figure of speech]] in the 16th century as similar to the French ''ironie''. It derives from the Latin ''ironia'' and ultimately from the Greek ''εἰρωνεία'' eirōneía, meaning ''dissimulation, ignorance purposely affected''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "irony" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Situational irony - Baker Street tube station.jpg|thumb|A "No smoking" sign surrounded by images of a smoking [[Sherlock Holmes]] at [[Baker Street tube station]]]]

''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' distinguishes between the following types of irony:&lt;ref name="NPE"&gt;Preminger, A. &amp; Brogan, T. V. F. Brogan, 
''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', MJF Books, 1993, {{ISBN|9780691032719}},  pp. 633–635.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Classical''' irony: Referring to the origins of irony in Ancient Greek comedy, and the way classical and medieval rhetoricians delineated the term.
*'''Romantic''' irony: A self-aware and self-critical form of fiction.
*'''Cosmic''' irony: A contrast between the absolute and the relative, the general and the individual, which Hegel expressed by the phrase, "general [irony] of the world."&lt;ref name="NPE" /&gt;
*'''Verbal''' irony: A contradiction between a statement's stated and intended meaning
*'''Situational''' irony: The disparity of intention and result; when the result of an action is contrary to the desired or expected effect.
*'''Dramatic''' irony and '''tragic''' irony: A disparity of awareness between an actor and an observer: when words and actions possess significance that the listener or audience understands, but the speaker or character does not; for example when a character says to another "I'll see you tomorrow!" when the audience (but not the character) knows that the character will die before morning. It is most often used when the author causes a character to speak or act erroneously, out of ignorance of some portion of the truth of which the audience is aware. In tragic irony, the audience knows the character is making a mistake, even as the character is making it.

===Verbal irony===
According to ''A glossary of literary terms'' by Abrams and Hartman,&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Verbal irony''' is a statement in which the meaning that a speaker employs is sharply different from the meaning that is ostensibly expressed. An ironic statement usually involves the explicit expression of one attitude or evaluation, but with indications in the overall speech-situation that the speaker intends a very different, and often opposite, attitude or evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, M. H., &amp; Harpham, G. G., ''A glossary of literary terms'', 9th Ed., Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Verbal irony is distinguished from situational irony and dramatic irony in that it is produced ''intentionally'' by speakers. For instance, if a man exclaims, "I'm not upset!" but reveals an upset [[emotional]] state through his voice while truly trying to claim he's not upset, it would not be verbal irony by virtue of its verbal manifestation (it would, however, be situational irony). But if the same speaker said the same words and intended to communicate that he was upset by claiming he was not, the utterance would be verbal irony. This distinction illustrates an important aspect of verbal irony—speakers communicate implied propositions that are intentionally contradictory to the propositions contained in the words themselves. There are, however, examples of verbal irony that do not rely on saying the opposite of what one means, and there are cases where all the traditional criteria of irony exist and the utterance is not ironic.

In a clear example from literature, in Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar'', Mark Antony's speech after the assassination of Caesar appears to praise the assassins, particularly Brutus ("But Brutus says he was ambitious; / And Brutus is an honourable man"), while actually condemning them. "We're left in no doubt as to who's ambitious and who's honourable. The literal truth of what's written clashes with the perceived truth of what's meant to revealing effect, which is irony in a nutshell".
&lt;ref&gt;
Horberry, R., ''Sounds Good on Paper: How to Bring Business Language to Life'', A&amp;amp;C Black, 2010. p. 135. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sounds_Good_on_Paper.html?id=rlBIvHRkExsC] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironic [[simile#irony|similes]] are a form of verbal irony where a speaker intends to communicate the opposite of what they mean. For instance, the following explicit similes begin with the deceptive formation of a statement that means ''A'' but that eventually conveys the meaning ''not A'':
* as soft as concrete
* as clear as mud
* as pleasant as a [[Endodontic therapy|root canal]]
* "as pleasant and relaxed as a coiled rattlesnake" (Kurt Vonnegut from ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'')

The irony is recognizable in each case only by using knowledge of the source concepts (e.g., that mud is opaque, that root canal surgery is painful) to detect an incongruity.

====Verbal irony and sarcasm====
A fair amount of confusion has surrounded the issue of the relationship between verbal irony and [[sarcasm]].

Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' states: &lt;blockquote&gt;Sarcasm does not necessarily involve irony and irony has often no touch of sarcasm. &lt;/blockquote&gt;This suggests that the two concepts are linked but may be considered separately. ''The Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s entry for [[sarcasm]] does not mention irony, but the irony entry includes:
{{Quote|1=A figure of speech in which the intended meaning is the opposite of that expressed by the words used; usually taking the form of sarcasm or ridicule in which laudatory expressions are used to imply condemnation or contempt.}}

The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' has "Non-literary irony is often called sarcasm"; while the ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' entry is:
{{Quote|1=Sarcasm: 1&amp;thinsp;: a sharp and often satirical or ironic utterance designed to cut or give pain. 2 a&amp;thinsp;: a mode of satirical wit depending for its effect on bitter, caustic, and often ironic language that is usually directed against an individual.}}

Partridge in ''[[Usage and Abusage]]'' would separate the two forms of speech completely: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Irony must not be confused with sarcasm, which is direct: sarcasm means precisely what it says, but in a sharp, caustic, ... manner. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The psychologist Martin, in ''The Psychology of Humour'', is quite clear that irony is where "the literal meaning is opposite to the intended" and sarcasm is "aggressive humor that pokes fun".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R. A., ''The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach'', Elsevier Academic Press, 2007. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He has the following examples: for irony he uses the statement "What a nice day" when it is raining. For sarcasm, he cites [[Winston Churchill]], who is supposed to have said, when told by [[Bessie Braddock]] that he was drunk, "But I shall be sober in the morning, and you will still be ugly", as being sarcastic, while not saying the opposite of what is intended.

Psychology researchers Lee and Katz (1998) have addressed the issue directly. They found that ridicule is an important aspect of sarcasm, but not of verbal irony in general. By this account, sarcasm is a particular kind of personal criticism levelled against a person or group of persons that incorporates verbal irony. For example, a woman reports to her friend that rather than going to a medical doctor to treat her cancer, she has decided to see a spiritual healer instead. In response her friend says sarcastically, "Oh, brilliant, what an ingenious idea, that's really going to cure you." The friend could have also replied with any number of ironic expressions that should not be labeled as sarcasm exactly, but still have many shared elements with sarcasm.

Most instances of verbal irony are labeled by research subjects as sarcastic, suggesting that the term ''sarcasm'' is more widely used than its technical definition suggests it should be (Bryant &amp; Fox Tree, 2002; Gibbs, 2000). Some [[psycholinguistic]] theorists (e.g., Gibbs, 2000) suggest that [[sarcasm]] ("Great idea!", "I hear they do fine work."), [[hyperbole]] ("That's the best idea I have heard in years!"), [[understatement]] ("Sure, what the hell, it's only cancer..."), [[rhetorical question]]s ("What, does your spirit have cancer?"), [[double entendre]] ("I'll bet if you do that, you'll be communing with spirits in no time...") and [[jocularity]] ("Get them to fix your bad back while you're at it.") should all be considered forms of verbal irony. The differences between these rhetorical devices ([[trope (literature)|tropes]]) can be quite subtle and relate to typical emotional reactions of listeners, and the rhetorical goals of the speakers. Regardless of the various ways theorists categorize figurative language types, people in conversation who are attempting to interpret speaker intentions and discourse goals do not generally identify, by name, the kinds of tropes used (Leggitt &amp; Gibbs, 2000).

====Verbal irony and echoic allusion====
Echoic allusion is the main component involved in conveying verbally ironic meaning. It is best described as a [[speech act]] by which the speaker simultaneously represents a thought, belief or idea, and implicitly attributes this idea to someone else who is wrong or deluded. In this way, the speaker intentionally dissociates themselves from the idea and conveys their tacit dissent, thereby providing a different meaning to their utterance. In some cases, the speaker can provide stronger dissociation from the represented thought by also implying derision toward the idea or outwardly making fun of the person or people they attribute it to.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Deirdre. "The Pragmatics Of Verbal Irony: Echo Or Pretence?." Lingua 116.10 (2006): 1722-1743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoic allusion, like other forms of verbal irony, relies on semantically disambiguating cues to be interpreted correctly. These cues often come in the form of [[paralanguage|paralinguistic markers]] such as prosody, tone, or pitch,&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Gregory A., and Jean E. Fox Tree. "Recognizing Verbal Irony in Spontaneous Speech." Metaphor and Symbol 17.2 (2002): 99-119. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal cues]] like hand gesture, facial expression and eye gaze.&lt;ref&gt;González-Fuente, Santiago, Victoria Escandell-Vidal, and Pilar Prieto. "Gestural Codas Pave The Way To The Understanding Of Verbal Irony." Journal of Pragmatics 90.(2015): 26-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of echoic allusion and its disambiguating paralinguistic markers is as follows:
* Person 1: I wasn't going to eat the cake, you know.
* Person 2: Interesting, that's what it looked like you were doing, but I just must have been mistaken.
From simple semantic analysis, Person 2 appears to believe Person 1. However, if this conversation is given the context of Person 2 walking in on Person 1 about to eat some cake, and Person 2 speaking their sentence in a significantly decreased rate of speech and lowered tone, the interpretation of "I just must have been mistaken" changes. Instead of being taken as Person 2 believing Person 1, the utterance calls to mind someone who would believe Person 1, while also conveying Person 2's implication that said individual would be considered gullible. From this, Person 2 negates the possible interpretation that they believe Person 1.

===Dramatic irony===
Dramatic irony exploits the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously), thus placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters. [[Connop Thirlwall]] in his 1833 article ''On the Irony of [[Sophocles]]'' originally highlighted the role of irony in drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/irony.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604184251/http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/irony.htm |archivedate=2016-06-04 |df= }}; cf. G.M. Kirkwood, ''A Study of Sophoclean Drama'', p. 258: "The now familiar concept of 'dramatic irony' was originally developed in an early nineteenth century article, "On the Irony of Sophocles," by the English scholar Connop Thirlwall, who explains that in a play the sequence of events can lead to two different interpretations of the action so far: the situation as it appears to the characters in the play, and to the situation as it really is."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thirlwall's original article appears in ''Philological Museum'' (edited by J.C. Hare), vol. 2, pp. 483-537, available at https://archive.org/details/philologicalmus01haregoog&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' defines dramatic irony as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
{{Quote|1=the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned; the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.}}

According to Stanton,&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, R., "Dramatic Irony in Hawthorne's Romances", ''Modern Language Notes'', Vol. 71, No. 6 (Jun., 1956), pp. 420–426, The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; dramatic irony has three stages—installation, exploitation, and resolution (often also called preparation, suspension, and resolution)
—producing dramatic conflict in what one character relies or appears to rely upon, the ''contrary'' of which is known by observers (especially the audience; sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true. In summary, it means that the reader/watcher/listener knows something that one or more of the characters in the piece is not aware of.

For example:
* In ''[[City Lights]]'', the audience knows that [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s character is not a millionaire, but the blind flower girl ([[Virginia Cherrill]]) believes him to be rich.&lt;ref&gt;
Clausius, C., ''The Gentleman Is a Tramp: Charlie Chaplin's Comedy'', P. Lang, 1989, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[North by Northwest]]'', the audience knows that Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is not Kaplan; Vandamm ([[James Mason]]) and his accomplices do not. The audience also knows that Kaplan is a fictitious agent invented by the CIA; Roger (initially) and Vandamm (throughout) do not.&lt;ref&gt;Gulino, P., ''Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach'', Continuum, 2004, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Othello]]'', the audience knows that Desdemona has remained faithful to Othello, but Othello does not. The audience also knows that Iago is scheming to bring about Othello's downfall, a fact hidden from Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Roderigo.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, W. C., ''A Rhetoric of Irony'', University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 63. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Rhetoric_of_Irony.html?id=jbgufPEUD6QC]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]", the reader knows that Montresor is planning on murdering Fortunato, while Fortunato believes they are friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe, Edgar Allan]], ''[[The Cask of Amontillado]]'', The Creative Company, 2008, pp. 22–23.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Cask_of_Amontillado.html?id=4b6PnHfQ1y8C]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Truman Show]]'', the viewer realizes that Truman is on a television show, but Truman himself only gradually learns this.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, A., ''Parallel Lives of Jesus: A Guide to the Four Gospels'', Presbyterian Publishing Corp, 2011, p. 30.

====Tragic irony====
Tragic irony is a special category of dramatic irony. In tragic irony, the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation, which the spectators fully realize. ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' defines this as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
{{Quote|the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned, the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.}}

[[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek drama]] was especially characterized by tragic irony because the audiences were so familiar with the [[legend]]s that most of the plays dramatized. [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' provides a classic example of tragic irony at its fullest. Colebrook writes:&lt;ref&gt;Colebrook, Claire. ''Irony''. London and New York: Routledge, 2004, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|1=Tragic irony is exemplified in ancient drama.... The audience watched a drama unfold, already knowing its destined outcome.... In Sophocles' ''Oedipus the King'', for example, 'we' (the audience) can see what Oedipus is blind to. The man he murders is his father, but he does not know it.}}

Further, Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for the plague that he has caused, not knowing that the murderer he has cursed and vowed to find is himself. The audience knows that Oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking; Oedipus, Creon, and Jocasta do not.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, I. C.; Allan, A.; ''A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 125. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Guide_to_Ancient_Greek_Drama.html?id=z2t1cIVk-A8C]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irony has some of its foundation in the onlooker's perception of [[paradox]] that arises from insoluble problems. For example, in the [[William Shakespeare]] play ''Romeo and Juliet'', when Romeo finds Juliet in a drugged, deathlike sleep, he assumes her to be dead. The audience knows that Juliet has faked her death, yet Romeo believes she is truly dead, and commits suicide. Upon awakening to find her dead lover beside her, Juliet stabs herself with a dagger thus killing herself, too.&lt;ref&gt;William, J., ''Cliffs Complete Romeo and Juliet'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009, pp. 135, 169, 181. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/CliffsComplete_Romeo_and_Juliet.html?id=c7MyAImulJ0C]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situational irony===
Situational irony is a relatively modern use of the term, and describes a sharp discrepancy between the expected result and actual results in a certain situation.
Lars Elleström writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Situational irony'' ... is most broadly defined as a situation where the outcome is incongruous with what was expected, but it is also more generally understood as a situation that includes contradictions or sharp contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;Elleström, L., ''Divine Madness: On Interpreting Literature, Music and the Visual Arts'', Bucknell University Press, 2002, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For example:
*When [[Reagan assassination attempt|John Hinckley attempted to assassinate]] [[Ronald Reagan]], all of his shots initially missed the President; however, a bullet ricocheted off the bullet-proof Presidential limousine and struck Reagan in the chest. Thus, a vehicle made to protect the President from gunfire instead directed gunfire to the president.&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/hinckleyaccount.html The Trial of John W.

[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sounds_Good_on_Paper.html?id=rlBIvHRkExsC]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is a story whose plot revolves around situational irony. Dorothy travels to a wizard and fulfills his challenging demands in order to go home, before discovering she'd had the ability to go back home all along. The Scarecrow longs for [[intelligence]], only to discover he is already a [[genius]], and the [[Tin Woodman]] longs to have a heart, only to discover he is already capable of [[love]]. The Lion, who at first appears to be a whimpering [[coward]], turns out to be bold and fearless. The people in [[Emerald City]] believed the Wizard to be a powerful [[deity]], only to discover that he is a bumbling, eccentric old man with no special powers at all.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

*In [[O. Henry]]'s story "[[The Gift of the Magi]]", a young couple are too poor to buy each other Christmas gifts.  The wife cuts off her treasured hair to sell it to a wig-maker for money to buy her husband a chain for his heirloom pocket watch. She's shocked when she learns he had pawned his watch to buy her a set of combs for her long, beautiful, prized hair. "The double irony lies in the particular way their expectations were foiled." &lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, W. G.; Colston, H. L.; ''Irony in Language and Thought: A Cognitive Science Reader'', Routledge, 2007, p. 59.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Cosmic irony}}Cosmic irony (irony of fate)====
The expression cosmic irony or "irony of fate" stems from the notion that the gods (or the [[Moirai|Fates]]) are amusing themselves by toying with the minds of mortals with deliberate ironic intent. Closely connected with situational irony, it arises from sharp contrasts between reality and human ideals, or between human intentions and actual results. The resulting situation is poignantly contrary to what was expected or intended.

According to Sudhir Dixit, "Cosmic irony is a term that is usually associated with [Thomas] [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]]. ... There is a strong feeling of a hostile [[deus ex machina]] in Hardy's novels." In ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' "there are several instances of this type of irony."&lt;ref&gt;Dixit, S., ''Hardy's Tess Of The D'urbervilles'', Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, 2001, p. 182.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Hardys_Tess_Of_The_Durbervilles.html?id=n45KUGyNsYQC]&lt;/ref&gt; One example follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Hardy|Hardy, Thomas]], ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', Oxford World's Classics, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Justice" was done, and the President of the Immortals (in Æschylean phrase) had ended his sport with Tess.

====Historical irony====
When history is seen through modern eyes, there often appear sharp contrasts between the way historical figures see their world's future and what actually transpires. For example, during the 1920s ''The New York Times'' repeatedly scorned [[crossword|crossword puzzles]]. In 1924, it lamented "the sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern." In 1925 it said "the question of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast." Today, no U.S. newspaper is more closely identified with the crossword than ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puzzles.about.com/library/weekly/blwordplaydoc.htm|title=Puzzles|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318011533/http://puzzles.about.com/library/weekly/blwordplaydoc.htm|archivedate=18 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more tragic example of historical irony, what people now refer to as the "[[First World War]]" was  called by [[H. G. Wells]] "the war that will end war",&lt;ref&gt;[[H. G. Wells|Wells, H. G.]], ''The War That Will End War'', 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; which soon became "[[the war to end war]]" and "the war to end all wars", and this became a widespread truism, almost a [[cliché]]. Historical irony is therefore a subset of cosmic irony, but one in which the element of time is bound to play a role. Another example could be that of the [[Vietnam War]], where in the 1960s the US attempted to stop the [[Viet Cong]] (Viet Minh) taking over South Vietnam. However, it is an often ignored fact that, in 1941, the US originally supported the [[Viet Minh]] in its fight against Japanese occupation.&lt;ref name="Neale, Jonathan page 17"&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', p. 17, {{ISBN|1-898876-67-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introduction to ''The Irony of American History'', [[Andrew Bacevich]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;Bacevich, A., in Niebuhr, R., ''The Irony of American History'', University of Chicago Press, 2010, p. xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=After 9/11, the Bush administration announced its intention of bringing freedom and democracy to the people of the Middle East. Ideologues within the Bush administration persuaded themselves that American power, adroitly employed, could transform that region ... The results speak for themselves.}}

Gunpowder was, according to prevailing academic consensus, discovered in the 9th century by [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese alchemists]] searching for an [[Elixir of life|elixir of immortality]].&lt;ref name="Jack Kelly 2005"&gt;Jack Kelly ''Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World'', Perseus Books Group, 2005, {{ISBN|0465037224}}, 9780465037223: pp. 2–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical irony also includes [[List of inventors killed by their own inventions|inventors killed by their own creations]], such as [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]] – unless, due to the nature of the invention, the risk of death was always known and accepted, as in the case of [[Otto Lilienthal]], who was killed by flying a glider of his own devising.

In certain kinds of situational or historical irony, a factual truth is highlighted by some person's complete ignorance of it or his belief in its opposite. However, this state of affairs does not occur by human design. In some religious contexts, such situations have been seen as the deliberate work of [[divine providence]] to emphasize truths and to taunt humans for not being aware of them when they could easily have been enlightened (this is similar to human use of irony). Such ironies are often more evident, or more striking, when viewed retrospectively in the light of later developments which make the truth of past situations obvious to all.

Other prominent examples of outcomes now seen as poignantly contrary to expectation include:

*In the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruling in 1856, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] barred any law that would deprive a slaveholder of his property, such as his slaves, upon the incidence of migration into free territory. So, in a sense, the Supreme Court used the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to deny rights to slaves. Also, Chief Justice Taney hoped that the decision would resolve the slavery issue, but instead it helped cause the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Fehrenbacher, D. E., ''Slavery, Law, and Politics: The Dred Scott Case in Historical Perspective'', Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 90.

*In the [[Kalgoorlie]] (Australia) gold rush of the 1890s, large amounts of the little-known mineral [[calaverite]] (gold telluride) were ironically identified as [[fool's gold]]. These mineral deposits were used as a cheap building material, and for the filling of potholes and ruts. When several years later the mineral was identified, there was a minor gold rush to excavate the streets.&lt;ref&gt;Kean, S., ''The Disappearing Spoon: And Other True Tales of Madness, Love and the History of the World from the Periodic Table of the Elements'', Random House, 2011, pp. 226–228.

Immediately after, he was mortally wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diplom.org/manus/Presidents/faq/last.html Last words of presidents] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120731092431/http://www.diplom.org/manus/Presidents/faq/last.html |date=2012-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==

===Comic irony===
Irony is often used in literature to produce a comic effect.  This may also be combined with [[satire]].  For instance, an author may facetiously state something as a well-known fact and then demonstrate through the narrative that the fact is untrue.

Jane Austen's ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' begins with the proposition "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." In fact, it soon becomes clear that Austen means the opposite: women (or their mothers) are always in search of, and desperately on the lookout for, a rich single man to make a husband. The irony deepens as the story promotes this romance and ends in a double marriage proposal. "Austen's comic irony emerges out of the disjunction between Elizabeth's overconfidence (or pride) in her perceptions of Darcy and the narrator's indications that her views are in fact partial and prejudicial."&lt;ref&gt;Ferriss, S.; Young, M.; ''Chick Lit: The New Woman's Fiction'', Routledge, 2006, p. 77. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Chick_Lit.html?id=lMjey3Bese0C]&lt;/ref&gt;

"''[[The Third Man]]'' is a film that features any number of eccentricities, each of which contributes to the film's perspective of comic irony as well as its overall cinematic self-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. E.; Vice, S.; ''Ethics at the Cinema'', Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 295.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Ethics_at_the_Cinema.html?id=QdP_xLImIugC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about performances of Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' in apartheid South Africa, Robert Gordon suggests: "Could it be that black people in the audience ... may have viewed as a comic irony his audacity and naïvety in thinking he could pass for white."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, R., in ''The Shakespearean  International Yearbook: Special Section, South African Shakespeare in the Twentieth Century'', Volume 9, Ashgate Publishing, 2009. p. 147. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Shakespearean_International_Yearbook.html?id=ZQ3LrE-Iy-kC]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romantic irony and metafiction===
Romantic irony is "an attitude of detached scepticism adopted by an author towards his or her work, typically manifesting in literary self-consciousness and self-reflection". This conception of irony originated with the German Romantic writer and critic [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "romantic irony" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Dane writes "From a twentieth-century perspective, the most crucial area in the history of irony is that described by the term romantic irony." He discusses the difficulty of defining romantic irony: "But what is romantic irony? A universal type of irony? The irony used by romantics? or an irony envisioned by the romantics and romanticists?" He also describes the arguments for and against its use.&lt;ref&gt;Dane, J. A., ''The Critical Mythology of Irony'', University of Georgia Press, 2011, Ch. 5 [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Critical_Mythology_of_Irony.html?id=6EAw-H8zvDkC]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to earlier self-conscious works such as [[Don Quixote]] and [[Tristram Shandy]], Douglas Muecke points particularly to [[Peter Weiss]]'s 1964 play, ''[[Marat/Sade]]''. This work is a play within a play set in a lunatic asylum, in which it is difficult to tell whether the players are speaking only to other players or also directly to the audience. When The Herald says, "The regrettable incident you've just seen was unavoidable indeed foreseen by our playwright", there is confusion as to who is being addressed, the "audience" on the stage or the audience in the theatre. Also, since the play within the play is performed by the inmates of a lunatic asylum, the theatre audience cannot tell whether the paranoia displayed before them is that of the players, or the people they are portraying. Muecke notes that, "in America, Romantic irony has had a bad press", while "in England ... [it] is almost unknown."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Compass_of_Irony.html?id=7PsNAAAAQAAJ Muecke, DC., ''The Compass of Irony'', Routledge, 1969. pp. 178–180]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a book entitled ''English Romantic Irony'', Anne Mellor writes, referring to Byron, Keats, Carlyle, Coleridge, and Lewis Carroll:&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, Anne K., ''English Romantic Irony'', Harvard University Press, 1980, pp. 4, 187.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/English_romantic_irony.html?id=M_C1AAAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|1=Romantic irony is both a philosophical conception of the universe and an artistic program. Ontologically, it sees the world as fundamentally chaotic. No order, no far goal of time, ordained by God or right reason, determines the progression of human or natural events.... Of course, romantic irony itself has more than one mode. The style of romantic irony varies from writer to writer.... But however distinctive the voice, a writer is a romantic ironist if and when his or her work commits itself enthusiastically both in content and form to a hovering or unresolved debate between a world of merely man-made being and a world of ontological becoming.}}

Similarly, [[metafiction]] is: "Fiction in which the author self-consciously alludes to the artificiality or literariness of a work by parodying or departing from novelistic conventions (esp. naturalism) and narrative techniques."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "metafiction" entry.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of fiction that self-consciously addresses the devices of fiction, thereby exposing the fictional illusion.

Gesa Giesing writes that "the most common form of metafiction is particularly frequent in Romantic literature. The phenomenon is then referred to as Romantic Irony." Giesing notes that "There has obviously been an increased interest in metafiction again after World War II."&lt;ref&gt;Giesing, G., ''Metafictional Aspects in Novels by Muriel Spark'', GRIN Verlag, 2004, p. 6.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Metafictional_Aspects_in_Novels_by_Murie.html?id=4gRwgvoY_ysC]&lt;/ref&gt;

For examples, Patricia Waugh quotes from several works at the top of her chapter headed "What is metafiction?". These include:

"The thing is this./ That of all the several ways of beginning a book ... I am confident my own way of doing it is best" - ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''

"Since I've started this story, I've gotten boils ..." - ''The death of the novel and other stories'' by [[Ronald Sukenick]]&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, P., ''Metafiction: The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction'', Routledge, 2002, p. 1.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Metafiction.html?id=O2MkrWv6RIUC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction'' refers to [[John Fowles]]'s ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, B., ''The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction'', Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp. 108–109.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Cambridge_Introduction_to_Postmodern.html?id=PoKi_TnntzcC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the first twelve chapters ... the reader has been able to immerse him or herself in the story, enjoying the kind of 'suspension of disbelief ' required of realist novels ... what follows is a remarkable act of metafictional 'frame-breaking'. Chapter 13 notoriously begins:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do not know. This story I am telling is all imagination. These characters I create never existed outside my own mind. ... if this is a novel, it cannot be a novel in the modern sense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Socratic irony===&lt;!--'Socratic irony' redirects here--&gt;
{{Main article|Socratic method}}
'''Socratic irony'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is "the dissimulation of ignorance practised by [[Socrates]] as a means of confuting an adversary".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Socrates would pretend to be ignorant of the topic under discussion, to draw out the inherent nonsense in the arguments of his interlocutors. ''[[The Chambers Dictionary]]'' defines it as "a means by which a questioner pretends to know less than a respondent, when actually he knows more".

Zoe Williams of ''The Guardian'' wrote: "The technique [of Socratic irony], demonstrated in the Platonic dialogues, was to pretend ignorance and, more sneakily, to feign credence in your opponent's power of thought, in order to tie him in knots."&lt;ref name="Guardian Online: The Final Irony"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2 |title=Online: The Final Irony |publisher=Guardian |date=28 June 2003 |access-date=12 December 2010 |location=London |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131104230808/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2 |archive-date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more modern example of Socratic irony can be seen on the American crime fiction television series, ''[[Columbo]]''.  The character Lt. Columbo is seemingly naïve and incompetent.  His untidy appearance adds to this fumbling illusion.  As a result, he is underestimated by the suspects in murder cases he is investigating.  With their guard down and their false sense of confidence, Lt. Columbo is able to solve the cases, leaving the murderers feeling duped and outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, G. ''How to Be a Philosopher: Or How to Be Almost Certain That Almost Nothing Is Certain,'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irony as infinite, absolute negativity===
Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and others, see irony, such as that used by Socrates, as a disruptive force with the power to undo texts and readers alike.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, S, ''The concept of irony with continuous reference to Socrates'' (1841), Harper &amp; Row, 1966, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase itself is taken from [[Hegel]]'s ''[[Lectures on Aesthetics]]'', and is applied by Kierkegaard to the irony of Socrates. This tradition includes 19th-century German critic and novelist [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] ("On Incomprehensibility"), [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stendhal]], and the 20th century [[deconstruction]]ist [[Paul de Man]] ("The Concept of Irony"). In Kierkegaard's words, from [[On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Socratic] irony [is] the infinite absolute negativity. It is negativity, because it only negates; it is infinite, because it does not negate this or that phenomenon; it is absolute, because that by virtue of which it negates is a higher something that still is not. The irony established nothing, because that which is to be established lies behind it...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sorenkierkegaard.org/concept-of-irony.html|title=Kierkegaard, D. Anthony Storm's Commentary on - The Concept of Irony|author=|date=|website=sorenkierkegaard.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009222139/http://sorenkierkegaard.org/concept-of-irony.html|archivedate=9 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where much of philosophy attempts to reconcile opposites into a larger positive project, Kierkegaard and others insist that irony—whether expressed in complex games of authorship or simple [[litotes]]—must, in Kierkegaard's words, "swallow its own stomach". Irony entails endless reflection and violent reversals, and ensures incomprehensibility at the moment it compels speech. Similarly, among other literary critics, writer [[David Foster Wallace]] viewed the pervasiveness of ironic and other [[postmodern]] tropes as the cause of "great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that for aspiring fictionists [ironies] pose terrifically vexing problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=David Foster|title=E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction|journal=Review of Contemporary Fiction|volume=13|issue=2|pages=151–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irony and awkwardness===

The '90s saw an expansion of the definition of irony from "saying what one doesn't mean" into a "general stance of&amp;nbsp;detachment&amp;nbsp;from life in general",&lt;ref&gt;Kotsko, Adam, ''Awkwardness.'', O-Books, 2010, pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt; this detachment serving as a shield against the awkwardness of everyday life. Humor from that era (most notably, ''[[Seinfeld]]'') relies on the audience watching the show with some detachment from the show's typical signature awkward situations.

The generation of people in the United States who grew up in the 90s, [[Millennials]], are seen as having this same sort of detachment from serious or awkward situations in life, as well. [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipsters]] are thought to use irony as a shield against those same serious or genuine confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/|title=How to Live Without Irony|first=Christy|last=Wampole|date=17 November 2012|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325230612/https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/|archivedate=25 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dan Shaughnessy]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;
We were always kidding about the use of irony. I maintained that it was best never to use the word because it was too often substituted for coincidence. (Alanis Morissette's song [[Ironic (song)|"Isn't it Ironic?"]] cites multiple examples of things that are patently not ironic.)&lt;ref&gt;Shaughnessy, D., ''Senior Year: A Father, A Son, and High School Baseball'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008, pp. 91-92.

Tim Conley cites the following:
"Philip Howard assembled a list of seven implied meanings for the word "ironically", as it opens a sentence:
# By a tragic coincidence
# By an exceptional coincidence
# By a curious coincidence
# By a coincidence of no importance
# You and I know, of course, though other less intelligent mortals walk benighted under the midday sun
# Oddly enough, or it's a rum thing that
# Oh hell! I've run out of words to start a sentence with."&lt;ref&gt;Conley, T., ''Joyces Mistakes: Problems of Intention, Irony, and Interpretation'', University of Toronto Press, 2011, p. 81.

==Punctuation==
{{main article|Irony punctuation}}
No agreed-upon method for indicating irony in written text exists, though many ideas have been suggested. For instance, an [[Irony punctuation|irony punctuation mark]] was proposed in the 1580s, when Henry Denham introduced a rhetorical question mark or [[percontation point]], which resembles a reversed question mark. This mark was also advocated by the French poet Marcel Bernhardt at the end of the 19th century, to indicate irony or [[sarcasm]]. French writer [[Hervé Bazin]] suggested another ''pointe d'ironie'': the Greek letter ''[[Psi (letter)|psi]]'' {{lang|el|Ψ}} with a dot below it, while [[Tom Driberg]] recommended that ironic statements should be printed in italics that lean the other way from conventional italics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3fbWAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Houston, K., ''Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks'', W.

[[File:It1927clarabow.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for the film [[It (1927 film)|''It'']] (1927)]]

An '''it girl''' is an attractive young woman, generally a celebrity, who is perceived to have both [[sex appeal]] and a personality that is especially engaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary | title=It girl | dictionary=Dictionary.com unabridged | url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/it-girl?s=t | accessdate=June 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression ''it girl'' originated in British upper-class society around the turn of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meredith Etherington-Smith|Etherington-Smith, Meredith]] &amp; Pilcher, Jeremy. (1986). ''The 'It' Girls'', 241.&lt;/ref&gt; It reached global attention in 1927, with the popularity of the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount Studios]] film ''[[It (1927 film)|It]]'', starring [[Clara Bow]]. In the earlier usage, a woman was especially perceived as an ''it girl'' if she had achieved a high level of popularity without flaunting her sexuality. Today the term is used more to apply simply to fame and beauty.

==Early use==
An early literary usage of ''it'' in this sense may be traced to a 1904 short story by [[Rudyard Kipling]]: ''It isn’t beauty, so to speak, nor good talk necessarily. It’s just ‘It’.''
&lt;ref name=KiplingSociety&gt;{{cite web|quote=... she had that indefinable quality which Kipling was the first to call ‘It’ &amp;ndash; sex-appeal without flaunting her sexuality.|last1=Wilson|first1=Alastair|title=Mrs Bathurst|url=http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/rg_bathurst1.htm |publisher=KiplingSociety.co.uk|accessdate=5 March 2014|last2=Wilson|first2=Commander Alastair|date=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elinor Glyn]], the notorious British novelist who wrote the book titled ''It'' and the subsequent screenplay, lectured {{quote|With ''It'', you win all men if you are a woman and all women if you are a man. ''It'' can be a quality of the mind as well as a physical attraction.|source=Elinor Glyn (1927)&lt;ref name="movie"&gt;Introduction in the film script for ''[[It (1927 film)|It]]'' (USA, 1927)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Glyn first rose to fame as the author of the scandalous 1907 bestseller ''Three Weeks''. She is usually credited with the invention of the ‘It Girl’ concept: although the slang predates her book and film, she is definitely responsible for the impact the term had on the culture of the 1920s. 
Bow later said she wasn’t sure what “It” meant,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Waterloo Daily Courier'', 21&amp;nbsp;September 1950&lt;/ref&gt; although she identified [[Lana Turner]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and later [[Marilyn Monroe]]&lt;ref name="Stenn8"&gt;{{cite book|title= Clara Bow: Runnin’ Wild| first=David| last=Stenn| authorlink=David Stenn| publisher=Doubleday| year=1988| ISBN= 0-385-24125-9| page= 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; as “It Girls”, and [[Robert Mitchum]] as an “It Man”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The fashion component of the ''It Girl'', originated with the celebrated [[couturier]] [[Lucy, Lady Duff-Gordon]], known professionally as “Lucile”, the name under which she directed exclusive salons in London, Paris and New York; she was [[Elinor Glyn]]’s elder sister. As Lucile, Lucy Duff-Gordon was the first designer to present her collections on a stage complete with the theatrical accoutrements of lights and music, inspiring the modern runway or catwalk show, and she was famous for making sexuality an aspect of fashion through her provocative [[lingerie]] and lingerie-inspired clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Caroline. (2013). ''The Mechanical Smile'', pp&amp;nbsp;34–36, 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, Randy Bryan. (2012). ''Lucile - Her Life by Design'' pp&amp;nbsp;23–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucile also specialised in dressing trendsetting stage and film performers, ranging from the stars of the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' on Broadway to silent screen icons such as [[Mary Pickford]] and [[Irene Castle]].

As early as 1917, Lucile herself used the term ''It'' in relation to style in her fashion column for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'': "...&amp;nbsp;I saw a very ladylike and well-bred friend of mine in her newest Parisian frock ... she felt she was 'it' and perfectly happy."&lt;ref&gt;Duff-Gordon, Lady (Lucile). (1917). The Last Word in Fashions. ''Harper's Bazaar'', ''63'', October&amp;nbsp;1917&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, Randy Bryan. (2012). ''Lucile - Her Life by Design'', 31, 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''It'' (1927 film)==
The [[It (1927 film)|Paramount Studios' film]] was planned as a special showcase for its popular star [[Clara Bow]], and her spectacular performance&lt;ref&gt;private showing. (1927-01-01) ''Variety''&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the term ‘It’ to the cultural lexicon.
The film plays with the notion that "It" is a quality which eschews definitions and categories; consequently, the girl portrayed by Bow is an amalgam of an [[ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] and a [[femme fatale]], with a touch of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s latter day "[[Material Girl]]" incarnation. By contrast, Bow's rival in the script is equally young and comely (and rich and well-bred to boot), yet she doesn't have "It".

==Modern "It Girls"==
Since the 1990s, ''It Girl'' or ''It-Girl'' has been used slightly differently, referring to a wealthy, normally unemployed, young woman who is pictured in [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]] going to many parties often in the company of other celebrities, receiving media coverage in spite of no real personal achievements or TV hosting / presenting. The writer [[William Donaldson]] observed that, having initially been coined in the 1920s, the term was applied in the 1990s to describe "a young woman of noticeable 'sex appeal' who occupied herself by shoe shopping and party-going".&lt;ref name=donaldson&gt;[[William Donaldson|Donaldson, W]]. (2002) ''Brewer's Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prominence of an "It Girl" is often temporary; some of the rising It Girls will either become fully-fledged celebrities, commonly initially via engineering appearances on reality TV shows or series; lacking such an accelerant, their popularity will normally fade. Reflection on the celebrity-focused and celebrity-promoting nature of news media &amp;ndash; particularly [[tabloid journalism|tabloid newspaper]]s &amp;ndash; may be helpful.

===Film and theater===
* Glyn's 1927 film script was adapted into a musical called ''The It Girl'', which opened off-Broadway in 2001 at the York Theatre Company, starring [[Jean Louisa Kelly]].&lt;ref name="musical"&gt;[http://www.ItGirlMusical.com  It Girl Musical] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051014205406/http://www.itgirlmusical.com/ |date=2005-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''khanate''' or '''khaganate''' is a political entity ruled by a [[Khan (title)|khan]] or [[Khagan|khagan]]. This political entity is typical for people from the [[Eurasian Steppe]] and it can be equivalent to [[tribe|tribal]] [[chiefdom]], [[principality]], [[monarchy|kingdom]] or [[empire]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3014">'''Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web''' is an international [[database]] of [[online exhibition]]s which is a service of the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]].
==Overview==
Two categories of online exhibitions are included in the database: exhibitions created by [[libraries]], [[archives]], [[historical societies]], and other scholarly institutions; and [[museum]] exhibitions with major emphasis on library and archival materials.

Several of these online exhibitions were originally created to accompany exhibitions physically situated at their respective institutions, but a growing percentage exist solely in [[Digital library|remotely accessible]] format. The database is searchable by title, subject, and sponsoring institution.

==History==
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2011}}
The website is based on an online guide to library exhibits on the web, created by Andrea Bean Hough in 1995. The guide was maintained by the [[University of Houston]] Libraries until it had grown to some 350 links in 1998–99 and staffing considerations made it necessary for the University to discontinue participation in the project. Since then, the guide has been curated by Diane Shaw, Special Collections Librarian at the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]]. As of 2011, it has grown to include over 6,000 links to online exhibitions.

==Recognition==
[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries]], a publication of the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]], awarded ''Editor's Pick'' to the database in August 2010, saying it was "the most comprehensive source for existing digital exhibitions."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://library.utpb.edu/Choice-HiRecom.html Choice Highly Recommended Academic Web Sites]'', [[University of Texas of the Permian Basin]], The J. Conrad Dunagan Library Online. Retrieved September 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also listed under ''Best of the Web'' by [[New York Public Library]] and had previously been rewarded ''Site of the Month'' by ''LibrarySpot''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.nypl.org/weblinks/2166 Best of the Web]'', [[New York Public Library]], USA. Retrieved August 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.libraryspot.com/lsom/1999/libsiteofmonth0799.htm Congratulations to Library and Archival Exhibitions on the Web]'', [http://www.libraryspot.com/ Library Spot].

'''Mario Mieli''' (21 May 1952, [[Milan]] – 12 March 1983) was a leading figure in the Italian [[gay]] movement of the 1970s. He combined a radical theoretical perspective with a provocative public persona. His sometimes outrageous public behavior made him a controversial figure, but he was nonetheless respected as one of the movement's most important intellectuals. He’s best known among English speakers for ''Towards a Gay Communism'', a political pamphlet excerpted from his major theoretical work ''Homosexuality and Liberation: Elements of a Gay Critique''.

== Life ==
Mieli was born in [[Milan]] on May 21, 1952 into a large and prosperous family. He lived for the first sixteen years of his life on his family's estate near [[Como]]. He moved back to Milan with his family in 1968. Politically precocious, he threw himself into the student uprising of that year, beginning a long commitment to revolutionary causes.

In 1971 he moved to London as a student, where he took an active part in the London Gay Liberation Front. Though he spent intermittent time in London until 1975, in 1972 based himself in Milan where he studied at university. In April 1972, he, along with [[Massimo Consoli]] (1945–2007), Nicolino Tosoni (b. 1943), Angelo Pezzana (b. 1940) and the French writer [[Françoise d'Eaubonne]] (1920–2005) held the first homosexual demonstration in Italy at a Congress of Sexology in [[Sanremo|San Remo]]. They protested against psychiatric condemnation of homosexual conduct and the use of aversion therapy to "convert" homosexuals.

In 1972, Mieli helped found the collective Fronte Unitario Omosessuale Rivoluzionario Italiano (Italian revolutionary homosexual united front). Better known by its acronym F.U.O.R.I! (Come out!), it was Italy's first major gay-rights group. Started in Turin in 1971, F.U.O.R.I! appeared almost simultaneously in Rome, Padua, Venice and in Milan, where Mieli was an organizer. After the collective united with the Italian Radical Party, Mieli criticized the move as "counter-revolutionary," since he thought the gay movement should remain independent of political parties. He left the organization over political differences in 1974–75.

After 1974 Mieli continued his activism by organizing the Collettivi Omosessuali Milanesi (Homosexual collectives of Milan). In 1976 the group’s gay theatrical group, Nostra Signora dei Fiori, staged his play ''La Traviata Norma. Ovvero: Vaffanculo... ebbene sì!'' (the title’s numerous puns defy translation). This outrageous production was successfully staged in Milan, Florence, and Rome. An in-your-face spectacle, it deliberately presented behavior designed to flout conventional, heterosexual norms.

A controversial personality, Mieli sometimes made a spectacle of himself. Once in Rome he publicly ate his own excrement and that of a dog.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} While some may have found this behavior outrageous or frightening, others knew him as a gentle person who enjoyed [[cross-dressing]], capable of being very charming in private.

By 1976, Mieli had graduated and began revising for publication his doctoral thesis in Moral Philosophy. The revision was published as ''Elementi di critica omosessuale''. An English translation of the book was made by [[David Fernbach]] as ''Homosexuality and Liberation: Elements of a Gay Critique''. The translation’s last chapter – "Towards a Gay Communism"—was excerpted as a political pamphlet and became Mieli’s most widely known work among English speakers.

This major theoretical work is widely considered the most important text from the Italian gay community. With rich humor and a cosmopolitan gay sensibility, Mieli contends that homosexual liberation is an integral and indispensable part of a much wider emancipation. Mieli cites "educastration" at the core of a repressive set of norms intended to stifle the full expression of a natural human [[transsexuality]]. He combines [[Freud]]'s ideas on "polymorphous perversion" (see [[Polymorphous perverse]]) with [[Marxist economics]] to argue that human liberation is possible only through a revolution allowing uninhibited [[pansexuality]].

By 1981, Mieli became increasingly pessimistic about his cause. In 1983, he told friends about a forthcoming book titled ''Il risveglio dei Faraoni'' (''The Awakening of the Pharaohs''). It was to be an autobiographical novel, set in Egypt featuring a resurrected Jesus. However, in early March, he decided to stop publication of the book, writing in a letter to a friend that the book might inspire someone to "have his hide". In another letter dated March 11, he wrote, "My book will not be published by my free choice".

Mario Mieli killed himself the following day, on March 12, 1983. He died at age 30 from asphyxiation by inhaling gas in his Milan apartment.

It seems that Mieli's suicide stemmed from adverse reaction he expected from the book’s publication. Although a pirated edition was later published, his family brought legal action and had all copies destroyed. Only in 1994 was ''Il risveglio dei Faraoni'' published legally.

'''"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt"''' (English: '''"People Life Dance World"''') is a [[song]] by the German [[satirist]] [[Jan Böhmermann]]. It was presented as part of the TV show ''[[Neo Magazin Royale]]'' on 6 April 2017 and released on the same day.

==Background==
On 6 April 2017, Böhmermann criticised the German [[pop music|pop industry]] and the [[Echo Music Prize|Echo Award]] ceremony, which was planned for the next day, on his show ''Neo Magazin Royale''. The 20-minute long [[monologue]] had already been released on [[YouTube]] the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Böhmermann über Max Giesinger und die neuen deutschen "Songpoeten"|trans-title=|periodical=[[Tonspion]]|publisher=|url=http://www.tonspion.de/news/jan-boehmermann-ueber-max-giesinger-und-die-neuen-deutschen-songpoeten|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Udo Raaf|date=2017-04-06|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among other things, he criticized [[Max Giesinger]], [[Tim Bendzko]] and [[Matthias Schweighöfer]] who, according to Böhmermann, did not write their own lyrics and focused more on the revenue their songs could earn rather than meaningful content. He refers to them as the "new German pop poets" and claims that their songs have "trivial lyrics," sounding like "advertising messages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Böhmermann lässt Affen Song schreiben|trans-title=|periodical=[[Stuttgarter Nachrichten]]|publisher=|url=http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.klingt-wie-max-giesinger-jan-boehmermann-laesst-affen-song-schreiben.fac275bd-5359-4739-a493-30397eeecf30.html|deadurl=no|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406213726/http://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.klingt-wie-max-giesinger-jan-boehmermann-laesst-affen-song-schreiben.fac275bd-5359-4739-a493-30397eeecf30.html|archivedate=2017-04-06|last=|date=2017-04-06|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their [[music video]]s contain numerous [[product placement]]s. To prove how standardised and replaceable German pop songs are, Böhmermann and his production team collected [[advertising slogan]]s, phrases from current pop songs and [[Twitter|tweets]] of the German [[YouTuber]]s [[Bianca Heinicke]] and [[Sami Slimani]]. These text fragments were then randomly put together at [[ZOOM Erlebniswelt Gelsenkirchen]] by five [[chimpanzee]]s, creating the finished song lyrics.&lt;ref name="augsburger"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Böhmermann landet Charthit. Den Song haben Schimpansen geschrieben|trans-title=|periodical=[[Augsburger Allgemeine]]|publisher=|url=http://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/panorama/Jan-Boehmermann-landet-Charthit-Den-Song-haben-Schimpansen-geschrieben-id41126026.html|deadurl=|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=Sandra Liermann|date=2017-04-07|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[pseudonym]] "Jim Pandzko," a [[pun]] made up of "[[Tim Bendzko]]" and "[[chimpanzee]]," was used to identify the song's singer.
The songwriters registered with [[GEMA (German organization)|GEMA]], ''Bono Beau'' and ''Olaf Utan'', are also word plays made up of "[[Bonobo]]" and "[[Orangutan]]", too.&lt;ref name="GEMA" /&gt;

"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt" was recorded at Studio Debussy in [[Essen]]. Audio mixing was done at Klangwelt Studio, also in Essen.&lt;ref name="discogs"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Pandzko Feat.

==Music and Content==
"Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt" is composed in [[verse–chorus form]] with content from different, randomly combined text fragments. Böhmermann says that the words in the title ''Menschen'' (English: people), ''Leben'' (life), ''Tanzen'' (dance) and ''Welt'' (world) describe the four most-used themes in German pop music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Songtext Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt – Jim Pandzko|trans-title=|periodical=[[Genius (website)|Genius]]|publisher=|url=https://genius.com/11627584|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Böhmermann gibt Deutschpop eine saftige Nackenschelle und schreibt mit Schimpansen eigenen Radiohit|trans-title=|periodical=[[Vice (Magazin)|Noisey]]|publisher=|url=https://noisey.vice.com/de/article/jan-bohmermann-gibt-deutschpop-eine-saftige-nackenschelle-und-schreibt-mit-schimpansen-eigenen-radiohit|deadurl=no|format=|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408081727/https://noisey.vice.com/de/article/jan-bohmermann-gibt-deutschpop-eine-saftige-nackenschelle-und-schreibt-mit-schimpansen-eigenen-radiohit|archivedate=2017-04-08|last=|date=2017-04-06|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Refrain|chorus]] uses the lyrics "Oh oh eh oh oh" to make remembering and singing along to the song easier.&lt;ref name="Express" /&gt;

== Reception and Reactions ==
The media responded positively to "Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt". ''[[Stern (Zeitschrift)|Stern]]'' wrote: "you cannot illustrate the state of German pop music in 2017 any better than with a song that was written in such a short time and composed by apes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jan Böhmermann lässt Schimpansen texten – heraus kommt ein Popsong|trans-title=|periodical=[[Stern (Zeitschrift)|Stern]]|publisher=|url=http://www.stern.de/kultur/musik/jan-boehmermann-laesst-schimpansen-texten---heraus-kommt-ein-popsong-7401078.html|deadurl=no|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406194707/http://www.stern.de/kultur/musik/jan-boehmermann-laesst-schimpansen-texten---heraus-kommt-ein-popsong-7401078.html|archivedate=2017-04-06|last=|date=|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review which discusses the [[satire|satirical]] vein of the song, ''[[Musikexpress]]'' claims that the song is the most emotional one you can listen to today and is unusually catchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Menschen Leben Tanzen Welt" ist der gefühlvollste Song, den du heute hören wirst|trans-title=|periodical=[[Musikexpress]]|publisher=|url=https://www.musikexpress.de/menschen-leben-tanzen-welt-ist-der-gefuehlvollste-song-den-du-heute-hoeren-wirst-781553/|deadurl=no|format=|accessdate=2017-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119141448/https://www.musikexpress.de/menschen-leben-tanzen-welt-ist-der-gefuehlvollste-song-den-du-heute-hoeren-wirst-781553/|archivedate=2018-01-19|last=Andreas Meixensperger|date=2017-04-06|year=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The singer of the German band [[Die Toten Hosen]], [[Campino (singer)|Campino]], said during the 2017 Echo Award Ceremony in a reference to the video: "It's better to be uncool than a cool asshole, who cannot be constructive in any way." He also talked about the "Böhmermann [[Zeitgeist]]&lt;nowiki /&gt; [[banter]]".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.skandal-beim-echo-campino-zu-boehmermann-lieber-uncool-als-ein-cooles-arschloch.51d45012-33cd-444b-998e-f887c6514e0b.html Campino über Böhmermann: „Lieber uncool, als ein cooles Arschloch"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410220014/http://www.abendzeitung-muenchen.de/inhalt.skandal-beim-echo-campino-zu-boehmermann-lieber-uncool-als-ein-cooles-arschloch.51d45012-33cd-444b-998e-f887c6514e0b.html |date=2017-04-10 }}''.

[[File:Christopher Walken - 1984.jpg|thumb|Actor [[Christopher Walken]] performing a monologue in the 1984 stage play ''[[Hurlyburly]]'']]
In [[theatre]], a '''monologue''' (from {{lang-el|μονόλογος}}, from μόνος ''mónos'', "alone, solitary" and λόγος ''lógos'', "speech") is a speech presented by a single [[character (arts)|character]], most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the [[audience]]. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media ([[Play (theatre)|play]]s, [[film]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|title=The Greatest Movie Speeches/Monologues of all time!|author=|date=|website=IMDb|accessdate=29 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401000758/http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000000354/|archivedate=1 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as [[poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |title=Dramatic Monologue: An Introduction |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2003-03-10 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807215608/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/rb/dm1.html |archivedate=7 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophes]], and [[asides|asides]]. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.

==Similar literary devices==
Monologues are similar to [[Poetry|poems]], epiphanies, and others, in that, they involve one 'voice' speaking but there are differences between them. For example, a soliloquy involves a character relating his or her thoughts and feelings to him/herself and to the audience without addressing any of the other characters. A monologue is the thoughts of a person spoken out loud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |title=Soliloquy – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706041614/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soliloquy |archivedate=6 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues are also distinct from apostrophes, in which the speaker or writer addresses an imaginary person, inanimate object, or idea.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |title=The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare |publisher=Pleasanton.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902062728/http://www.pleasanton.k12.ca.us/fhsweb/thoeb/RomeoandJuliet.htm |archivedate=2 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asides differ from each of these not only in length (asides are shorter) but also in that asides are not heard by other characters even in situations where they logically should be (e.g. two characters engaging in a [[dialogue]] interrupted by one of them delivering an aside).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==History==
In ancient Greek theatre, the origin of western drama,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} the conventional three actor rule was preceded by a two actor rule, which was itself preceded by a convention in which only a single actor would appear on stage, along with the chorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuritz|first=Paul|title=The Making of Theatre History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cS6JV4Z27DoC|accessdate=27 May 2014|year=1988|isbn=978-0-13-547861-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the monologue as a dramatic device, therefore, is not rooted in dialogue. It is, instead, the other way around; dialogue evolved from monologue.

Ancient Roman theatre featured monologues extensively, more commonly than either Ancient Greek theatre or modern theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=1 |date=January 1939 |pages=1–23|jstor=264065}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key purposes of these monologues was to indicate the passage of significant amounts of time (that would be tedious to actually play out in real time) within scenes. This type of monologue is referred to as a linking monologue.&lt;ref name="jstor1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Link Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=April 1939 |pages=116–126|jstor=264823}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other monologue types included "entrance monologues"&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt; and exit monologues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Exit Monologues in Roman Comedy |author=Henry W. Prescott |journal=Classical Philology|volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 1942 |pages=1–21 |jstor=264367}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these cases a primary function is indicating the passage of time.&lt;ref name="jstor1"/&gt;

From Renaissance theatre onward, monologues generally focused on characters using the extended speech to pursue their dramatic need. Postmodern theatre, on the other hand, often embraces the performative aspects of the monologue, even to the point of challenging the boundary between character portrayal (e.g. acting) and autobiographical speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geis|first=Deborah R.|title=Postmodern theatric(k)s: monologue in contemporary American drama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AiJaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 May 2014|date=December 1993|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn=978-0-472-10467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Interior monologues involve a character externalizing their thoughts so that the audience can witness experiences that would otherwise be mostly internal. In contrast, a dramatic monologue involves one character speaking to another character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |title=monologue (drama and literature) - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812133304/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389899/monologue |archivedate=12 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monologues can also be divided along the lines of active and narrative monologues. In an active monologue a character is using their speech to achieve a clear goal. Narrative monologues simply involve a character telling a story and can often be identified by the fact that they are in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |title=Monologue Information |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028033907/http://www.angelfire.com/ego/westmontdrama/MonologueInfo.html |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auditions==
Actors in theatre, and sometimes in film and television, may be asked to deliver monologues in auditions. Audition monologues demonstrate an actor's ability to prepare a piece and deliver a performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audition Monologues|url=http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|website=Ace Your Audition|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714084548/http://www.ace-your-audition.com/free-monologues.html|archivedate=14 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces are usually limited to two minutes or less and are often paired with a contrasting monologue: comic and dramatic; classical and contemporary. The choice of monologues for an audition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyactor.com/contemporary-monologues/|title=Monologues from Movies &amp; Plays|last=|first=|date=October 4, 2018|website=Daily Actor|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; often depends on the play or role. The audition monologue is a rite of passage with theatre actors.

'''New media studies''' is a relatively young academic discipline that explores the intersections of computing, science, the humanities, and the visual and performing arts. [[Janet Murray]], a prominent researcher in the discipline, describes this intersection as "a single new medium of representation, the digital medium, formed by the braided interplay of technical invention and cultural expression at the end of the 20th century". The main factor in defining [[new media]] is the role the Internet plays; new media is effortlessly spread instantly. The category of new media is occupied by devices connected to the Internet, an example being a smartphone or tablet. Television and cinemas are commonly thought of as new media but are ruled out since the invention was before the time of the internet.

New media studies examines ideas and insights on media from communication theorists, programmers, educators, and technologists. Among others, the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]] is viewed as one of the cornerstones of the study of media theory. McLuhan’s slogan, "[[the medium is the message]]" (elaborated in his 1964 book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in 1964 by Mentor, New York; reissued 1994, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts with an introduction by [[Lewis H. Lapham|Lewis Lapham]]&lt;/ref&gt; calls attention to the intrinsic effect of communications media.

A program in new media studies may incorporate lessons, classes, and topics within [[communication]], [[journalism]], [[computer science]], [[Computer programming|programming]], [[graphic design]], [[web design]], [[human-computer interaction]], [[media theory]], [[linguistics]], [[information science]], and other related fields. 

New media studies is the academic discipline which examines how our relationship with media has changed with the onset of global connectivity and the popularity of digital and user generated content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manovich|first1=Lev|title=The Practice of Everyday (Media) Life|jstor=10.1086/596645|website=Chicago Journals|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|ref=The Practice of Everyday (Media) Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media studies seeks to connect [[computer sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manovich|first1=Lev|title=Culture Software|url=http://manovich.net/content/04-projects/070-cultural-software/67-article-2011.pdf|website=manovich.net|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and innovations in [[new media]] with [[social sciences]] and the [[philosophy of technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Janet H.|title=Toward a Cultural Theory of Gaming|url=http://homes.lmc.gatech.edu/~murray/PC0403_Murray.pdf|website=Georgia Tech|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|accessdate=9 October 2015|ref=Toward a Cultural Theory of Gaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Major figures ===
[[Marshall McLuhan]] is known in the study of media theory for coining the phrase, "[[the medium is the message]]" in its effect in communication in media. The medium affects how the media is delivered by the person and how the other person is receiving that media, while the characteristics of the medium effects the content in its delivery. McLuhan’s work challenged how media changed in the post-modern era which can also relate to present day use of media and its medium. Interface is defined as the common boundary of 2 bodies, spaces, or phases. Other Major works that also invoke his standpoint in the study of New Media including:

* ''[[The Mechanical Bride]]'' (1951) - Which includes many short essays that analyze forms of media such as advertising, or newspaper in relation to society.
* ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' (1962) - In this book, McLuhan Writes about technology like the printing press or electronic media changing how people share stories in their day-to-day lives.

[[Lev Manovich]] has written books on the topic of new media, and according to his personal page "has appeared on the top 25 people shaping the Future of Design,"  He has published nine different books regarding the topic of new media. Manovich believes in the five general principles of new media, as he discusses in his 2001 book, ''The Language of New Media'' they are:

* Numerical Representation: essentially means that "all new media objects can be described mathematically and can be manipulated via algorithms."&lt;ref name = "Sorapure"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five Priniciples of New Media: Or, Playing Lev Manovich|url = http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/8.2/coverweb/sorapure/|website = Kairos|accessdate = 2016-01-05|last = Sorapure|first = Madeleine|issn = 1521-2300}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modularity: are "elements can that be independently modified and reused in other works".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
* Automation: "Automation is seen in computer programs that allow users to create or modify media objects using templates or algorithms".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
* Variability:  is "a new media object is not something fixed once and for all, but something that can exist in different, potentially infinite versions".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
* Transcoding: Designates the blend of computer and culture, of "traditional ways in which human culture modeled the world and the computer's own means of representing it".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
[[Henry Jenkins]] came up with the convergence culture in the field on new media studies: "By convergence, I mean the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted."

[[Janet Murray]] is a professor at the School of Literature, Media, and Communications at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Murray is also a part of several design projects such as; a digital edition of the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] classic, [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]. Janet works exclusively as a member of Georgia Tech's experimental game lab. Janet is also the author of the book ''Hamlet on the Holodeck; The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace''. Along with this book, she is also a guest writer in ''The New Media Reader,'' where she is credited for writing one of the two introductions in the book called, ''Inventing the Medium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inventing the Medium|url = https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/inventing-medium|website = MIT Press|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hamlet on the Holodeck; The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inventing the Digital Medium: An Interview with Janet Murray (Part One)|url = http://henryjenkins.org/2012/02/an_interview_with_janet_murray.html|website = henryjenkins.org|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray asks whether the computer can provide the basis for an expressive narrative form. The book acts as a textbook. It is designed to help designers in training develop a greater sense of understanding towards digital media. This book is also a theory of media change over the years. It really goes into depth on the relationship between technology and culture. Murray has ideas with a unique spin on them. She offers new thoughts and theories on new media studies, and this is what led to her being such a successful author.&lt;ref&gt;http://henryjenkins.org/2006/06/welcome_to_convergence_culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of technology ==
In an article from the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI), there was a study involving a virtual reality environment that simulated ATM training for persons with acquired brain injury. Their conclusion of this study proves that virtual reality can be a useful tool in which it could easily be accessed online. Basically this helped conveniently providing training opportunities almost anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Usability of a virtual reality environment simulating an automated teller machine for assessing and training persons with acquired brain injury|journal = Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation|date = 2010-04-30|issn = 1743-0003|pmc = 2881048|pmid = 20429955|pages = 19|volume = 7|doi = 10.1186/1743-0003-7-19|first = Kenneth NK|last = Fong|first2 = Kathy YY|last2 = Chow|first3 = Bianca CH|last3 = Chan|first4 = Kino CK|last4 = Lam|first5 = Jeff CK|last5 = Lee|first6 = Teresa HY|last6 = Li|first7 = Elaine WH|last7 = Yan|first8 = Asta TY|last8 = Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book called ''Critical Terms for Media Studies'', the author illustrates his take on new media in technology: "technology---a focus on the mechanical aspects of media and the way that innovations and inventions transform the condition of both individual and social experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Critical Terms for Media Studies, the introduction|url = http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/532554.html|website = www.press.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
* Strategies vs Tactics - The term strategies refers to the methods a producer intended for their creation to be used. The term tactics is referring to the ways individuals actually utilize a creation, regardless of the creators intentions, in order to make it more useful to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Practice of Everyday (Media) Life: From Mass Consumption to Mass Cultural Production?|jstor = 10.1086/596645|journal = Critical Inquiry|date = 2009-01-01|pages = 319–331|volume = 35|issue = 2|doi = 10.1086/596645|first = By|last = Lev Manovich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wiktionary:hypermediated|Hypermediated]] - Hypermediation is a concept in new media studies that refers to a form of [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mediate mediation] in which media is connected in a very close way.  Mediation, in this sense, deals with using indirect sources to create a direct connection between different types of media.  This process is often done by the use of [[HTML|hypertext]] and through the [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/networked Networked] approach to new media.  An example of hypermediation would be an online shopper who buys a particular item, then in turn gets links to related items, then articles related to those items etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hypermediated?|url = https://www.englishforums.com/English/Hypermediated/nwpnn/post.htm|website = www.englishforums.com|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hypermediation: Commerce as Clickstream|url = http://www.nicholascarr.com/?page_id=134|website = Nicholas Carr|accessdate = 2015-10-16|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Web 2.0]] - Web 2.0 is the concept of websites geared toward content created by users. Web 2.0 allows the web to be used as a platform. It also enables the users to control their own data. [[Tim O'Reilly]] and Dale Dougherty invented the phrase Web 2.0 at the Media Conference in 2004. Some examples of Web 2.0 are [[AdSense|Google AdSense]], Flickr, [[BitTorrent]], [[Napster]] and [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html retrieved 2015-10-08&lt;/ref&gt;
*Networking is a term that defines the transformation of old media to new media through communication that enables users to produce or compute material of their own on the internet.  It's a medium that consists of blogs, emails, and social media networks which allows more global connections to reach many to share ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lister et al. (2009) New Media: A Critical Introduction p. 30-35, Publisher Routledge 2 Parks Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon Ox14 4Rn Simultaneously published in the USA and Canada&lt;/ref&gt;
*Commodification of Experience - The packaging of human experience in some form to be sold back to the consumer. This is a common term in study of the role new media plays. An example of the top-down ideal. Common examples include cable subscriptions, vacation resort packages, memberships and, more abstractly, one's presence on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Commodifying Human Experience: An Interview with Jeremy Rifkin|url = http://www.alternet.org/story/79/commodifying_human_experience%253A_an_interview_with_jeremy_rifkin|newspaper = AlterNet|date = 2000-03-31|access-date = 2015-10-16|first = Tamara|last = Straus}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Simulation is a term that can be defined as a virtual representation of reality. For example, according to New Media and Visual Culture, virtually, things seem real based on experience, but they are not real because they have not actually happened. French theorist, [[Jean Baudrillard]], believed that simulation was the modern stage of simulacrum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.success.com/article/old-school-networking-with-new-media-methods retrieved 2015-10-04&lt;/ref&gt;
* Virtual - Lev Manovich describes a [[virtual world]] as an interactive world created by a computer that many people can access at one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manovich|first1=Lev|title=Computer as an Illusion Machine|url=http://atc.berkeley.edu/bio/Lev_Manovich/|website=The Art, Technology, and Culture Colloquim|publisher=The University of California|accessdate= 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A virtual world is an [[interactive]] and [[digital media|digital]] space. Virtual worlds are often created as a [[simulation]] of something which already exists in the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;http://manovich.net/content/04-projects/016-the-aesthetics-of-virtual-worlds/13_article_1996.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{lang|la|XII Panegyrici Latini}}''''' or '''''Twelve Latin Panegyrics''''' is the conventional title of a  collection of twelve [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]]  and [[Late Antiquity|late antique]] prose [[panegyric]] orations written in Latin.
The authors of most of the speeches in the collection are anonymous, but appear to have been Gallic in origin. Aside from the first panegyric, composed by [[Pliny the Younger]] in {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;100, the other speeches in the collection date to between {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;289 and 389 and were probably composed in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 4"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The original manuscript, discovered in 1433, has perished; only copies remain.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 3–4"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Gaul had a long history as a center of rhetoric. It maintained its dominance of the field well into the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Haarhoff, ''Schools of Gaul'' (London, 1920; rept. Johannesburg, 1958), ''passim'', cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; An early lead in the field was taken by the [[Aedui]], early allies of Rome and eager to assimilate to the ways of their new rulers: Maenian schools were celebrated as early as the reign of [[Tiberius]] ({{abbr|r.|Ruled}}&amp;nbsp;{{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;14–37).&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' 3.43, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to flourish into the days of Eumenius' grandfather, but were closed by the mid-3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;''Pan''. 9.17.2–3, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There was some revival in the city in the late 3rd century, but after the establishment of Trier as an imperial capital in the 280s, the orators began feeling jealousy for the imperial patronage enjoyed by the citizens of Trier.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 8"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the political and economic hegemony of the city, however, Trier failed to make any significant mark on the rhetoric of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Haarhoff, ''Schools of Gaul'', 48, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nixon and Rodgers suggest that it was simply too close to the imperial court.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 8"/&gt; 
The surviving evidence (which might be prejudiced by [[Ausonius]]' ''Professors of Bordeaux'') points to a shift from Autun and Trier as centers of the art in the Tetrarchic and Constantinian period, moving to Bordeaux later in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Haarhoff, ''Schools of Gaul'', 46–48, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 8; Nixon and Rodgers, 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The panegyrics evince a familiarity with prior handbooks of rhetoric. Some have argued that [[Menander of Laodicea]]'s treatises were particularly influential on the collection, and believed his precepts were used in the tenth panegyric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Mesk |title=Zur Technik der lateinischen Panegyriker |journal=[[Rheinisches Museum für Philologie]] |volume=67 |issue= |year=1912 |pages=569–590 [p. 573] |url=http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/067/Mesk.pdf }} Cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because so much of Menander's advice consisted of standard rhetorical procedure, the parallels adduced in favor of Menander as a model are insufficient to prove his direct use by the panegyrists. Other handbooks of rhetoric might also have had influence on the collection. [[Quintilian]]'s ''Institutio Oratoria'', for example, treats the subject of an oration's ancestry, parentage, and country in a manner similar to the panegyrics of 289, 291, 297, 310, 311, 321, and 389.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 3.7.10ff; Galletier I: xxxi, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In any case, the other panegyrics in the collection vary widely from Menander's schema.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Parallels with other Latin orators, like [[Cicero]] and [[Pliny the Younger]], are less frequent than they would have been if those authors had served as stylistic models.&lt;ref&gt;E. Vereecke, "Le Corpus des Panégyriques latins de l'époque tardive," ''Antiquité classique'' 44 (1975): 151–53, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language and style ==
The Latin of the panegyrics is that of a [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Golden Age|Golden Age]] Latin base, derived from an education heavy on Cicero, mixed with a large number of [[Classical Latin#Silver Age Latin|Silver Age]] usages and a small number of Late and [[Vulgar Latin|Vulgar]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; To students of Latin in Late Antiquity, Cicero and [[Virgil]] represented the paragons of the language; as such, the panegyrists made frequent use of them. Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' is the favorite source, the ''[[Georgics]]'' the second favorite, and the ''[[Eclogues]]'' a distant third.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 16. See also: Rees, "Praising in Prose: Vergil and the Panegyric," in ''Romane Memento: Vergil in the Fourth Century'' (London: Duckworth, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; (Other poets are much less popular: there are infrequent allusions to [[Horace]],&lt;ref&gt;As at 9.2.4, referencing ''Carmina'' 2.1.22, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and one complete borrowing from [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;12.25.2–3, modeled on Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 15.746–61, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;) When drawing from Cicero's body of work, the panegyrists looked first to those works where he expressed admiration and contempt. As a source of praise, Cicero's panegyric of [[Pompey]] in support of the Manilian law (''[[De Imperio Cn. Pompei]]'') was quite popular. It is echoed thirty-six times in the collection, across nine or ten of the eleven late panegyrics. Cicero's three orations in honor of [[Julius Caesar]] were also useful. Of these, the panegyrists were especially fond of the ''[[Pro Marcello]]''; across eight panegyrics there are more than twelve allusions to the work. For vilification, the [[Catiline Orations|Catiline]] and [[In Verrem|Verine]] orations were the prominent sources (there are eleven citations to the former and eight to the latter work).&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other classic prose models had less influence on the panegyrics. Pliny's ''Panegyricus'' model is familiar to the authors of panegyrics 5, 6, 7,&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 18 n.68.&lt;/ref&gt; 11, and especially 10, in which there are several verbal likenesses. [[Sallust]]'s ''Bellum Catilinae'' is echoed in the panegyrics 10 and 12, and his ''Jugurthine War'' in 6, 5, and 12.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Livy seems to have been of some use in panegyric 12&lt;ref&gt;At 12.15.6, borrows its sentiments and phrasing to Livy 28.44.8, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and 8.&lt;ref&gt;At 8.16.4, which echoes Livy 38.17.3, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The panegyrist of 8 must have been familiar with [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]], whose praise of [[Marcus Aurelius]] he mentions,&lt;ref&gt;At 8.14.2, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and the panegyrist of 6 seems to have known [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]''.&lt;ref&gt;At 6.9.3, which echoes Tacitus ''Agricola'' 12; B. Baldwin, "Tacitus, the ''Panegyrici Latini'', and the ''Historia Augusta''," ''Eranos'' 78 (1980): 175–78, and N. Baglivi, "Osservazioni su Paneg. VII(6),9," ''Orpheus'' 7 (1986): 329–37, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Aeduan orators, who refer to Julius Caesar in the context of Gaul and Britain, are either directly familiar with his prose or know of his figure through intermediaries like [[Florus]], the historian.&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, "Studen zu den Panegyrici Latini," 546, 554, (cited at Nixon and Rodgers, 18 n.72) argues for the latter case; Nixon and Rodgers (at Nixon and Rodgers, 18) argue for the former.&lt;/ref&gt; Panegyric 12, meanwhile, contains a direct allusion to Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili|Bellum civile]]''.&lt;ref&gt;At 12.6.1–2, alluding to ''Bellum civile'' 3.80.1–81.2, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accentual and metrical clausulae were used by all the Gallic panegyrists. All of the panegyrists, save Eumenius, used both forms at a rate of about 75 percent or better (Eumenius used the former 67.8 percent of the time, and the latter 72.4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Oberhelman and Ralph G. Hall, "Meter in Accentual Clausulae," ''Classical Philology'' 80:3 (1985): 222–23, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a common metrical rhythm at the time, but had gone out of style by the 5th century, when metrical considerations no longer mattered.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

|colspan = "4" align="center"  | After Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 20.
|}

The collection comprises the following speeches:
# by [[Pliny the Younger]]. It was originally a speech of thanks (''gratiarum actio'') for the [[consul]]ship, which he held in 100, and was delivered in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in honour of Emperor [[Trajan]]. This work, which is much earlier than the rest of the collection and geographically anomalous, probably served as a model for the other speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 4; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny was a popular author in the late 4th  century—[[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] modeled his letters on Pliny's, for example&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 7 n.22; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 22 n.84.&lt;/ref&gt;—and the whole collection might have been designed as an ''[[exemplum]]'' in his honor.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 7"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He later revised and considerably expanded the work, which for this reason is by far the longest of the whole collection. Pliny presents Trajan as the ideal ruler, or ''optimus princeps'', to the reader, and contrasts him with his predecessor [[Domitian]].
# by [[Pacatus Drepanius|Pacatus]] in honour of Emperor [[Theodosius I]], delivered in [[Rome]] in 389.
# by [[Claudius Mamertinus]] in honour of Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], delivered in [[Constantinople]] in 362, also as a speech of thanks at his assumption of the office of consul of that year.
# by [[Nazarius (rhetorician)|Nazarius]]. It was delivered in [[Rome]] before the Senate in 321 at the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the accession of [[Constantine I]] and the fifth anniversary of his sons [[Crispus]] and [[Constantine II (emperor)]] becoming [[Caesar (title)|''caesares'']]. The speech is peculiar because none of the honoured emperors was present at its delivery, and because it celebrates Constantine's victory over [[Maxentius]] (at the [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]]) in 312, avoiding almost any reference to contemporaneous events.
# from the year 311, delivered in [[Trier]] by an anonymous orator, who gives thanks to Constantine I for a tax relief for his home town [[Autun]].
# by an anonymous (yet different) author, also delivered at the court in Trier in 310, at the occasion of Constantine's ''quinquennalia'' (fifth anniversary of accession) and the founding day of the city of Trier. It contains the description of an appearance of the sun god [[Apollo]] to Constantine, which has often been regarded as a model of Constantine's later [[Battle of Milvian Bridge|Christian vision]]. Also, the speech promulgates the legend that the emperor [[Claudius II]] was Constantine's ancestor.
# by an anonymous author delivered at the wedding of Constantine to [[Maximian]]'s daughter [[Fausta]] in 307, probably also at Trier, and it therefore contains the praise of both emperors and their achievements. The bride and the wedding feature only to a very limited degree in the oration.
# celebrates the reconquest of [[Roman Britain|Britain]] by [[Constantius Chlorus]], ''caesar'' of the [[tetrarchy]], from [[Allectus]] in 296. The speech was probably delivered in 297 in Trier, then the residence of Constantius.
# is the second speech in the collection where the emperor was not present. It is by [[Eumenius]], teacher of [[rhetoric]] at Autun, and is directed at the governor of the province of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]]. It was most probably delivered in 297/298, either in Autun or [[Lyon]]. Apart from its main subject, the restoration of the school of rhetoric at Autun, it praises the achievements of the emperors of the tetrarchy, especially those of Constantius.
# from the year 289 (and therefore the earliest of the [[Late Antiquity|late antique]] speeches of the collection), at Trier in honour of Maximian at the occasion of the founding day of the city of Rome. According to a disputed manuscript tradition, the author was a certain [[Claudius Mamertinus|Mamertinus]], who is identified with the author of the next speech.
# from 291, also at Trier to Maximian, at the emperor's birthday. It is often attributed to Mamertinus, probably ''magister memoriae'' (private secretary) of Maximian, though the text is corrupt and the authorship not entirely certain.
# by an anonymous orator, delivered in Trier in 313, celebrating (and describing extensively) Constantine's victory over Maxentius in 312. The author of this panegyric makes heavy use of Virgil.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==
The panegyrics exemplify the culture of imperial ''praesentia'', or "presence", also encapsulated in the imperial ceremony of ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'', or "arrival".&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 6–7. See also: S. MacCormack, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435301 Change and Continuity in Late Antiquity: The Ceremony of "Adventus"]," ''Historia'' 21:4 (1972): 721–52; B.S. Rodgers, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435950 Divine Insinuation in the "Panegyrici Latini"]," ''Historia'' 35:1 (1986): 69–104.&lt;/ref&gt; The panegyrics held it as a matter of fact that the appearance of an emperor was directly responsible for bringing security and beneficence.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The orators held this visible presence in tension with another, more abstract notion of the timeless, omnipresent, ideal emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The panegyrist of 291 remarked that the meeting between Diocletian and Maximian over the winter of 290/91 was like the meeting of two deities; had the emperors ascended the Alps together, their bright glow would have illuminated all of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''Pan''. 11.10.4–5, 11.4, cited in Van Dam, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Panegyrics came to form part of the vocabulary through which citizens could discuss notions of "authority". Indeed, because panegyrics and public ceremony were such a prominent part of imperial display, they, and not the emperor's more substantiative legislative or military achievements, became the emperor's "vital essence" in the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and tradition of the collection ==
=== Compilation and purpose ===
The formation of the ''Panegyrici Latini'' is usually divided into two or three phases. At first, there was a collection of five speeches by various anonymous authors from Autun, containing numbers 5 through 9 above.&lt;ref&gt;W. Baehrens, "Zur quaestio Eumeniana," ''Rheinisches museum fur philologie'' 67 (1912): 313; and Galletier, 1: xiii and xix, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the speeches 10 and 11, which are connected to Trier, were appended; when 12 joined the collection, is uncertain. At some later date, the speeches 2, 3 and 4 were added.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from the earlier orations because they were delivered outside of Gaul (in Rome and Constantinople), and because the names of their authors are preserved. Pliny's panegyric was set at the beginning of the collection as classical model of the genre.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 4"/&gt; Sometimes the author of the last speech, Pacatus, is credited as the editor of the final ''corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;As in R. Pichon, ''Les derniers écrivains profanes'' (Paris, 1906), 285–91, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 6 n. 18; Roger Rees, "The Private Lives of Public Figures in Latin Prose Panegyric," in ''The Propaganda of Power: The Role of Panegyric in Late Antiquity'', ed. Mary Whitby  (Boston: Brill, 1998), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is founded on the position of Pacatus' speech in the ''corpus''—second after Pliny's—and because of the heavy debt Pacatus owes to the earlier speeches in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, "Private Lives", 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the speeches in the borrow from their predecessors in the collection, Pacatus borrows the most, taking ideas and phraseology from almost all the other speeches. He is especially indebted to the panegyric of 313.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the collection is thematically unconnected and chronologically disordered, Nixon and Rodgers conclude that "it served no political or historical purpose", and was simply a tool for students and practitioners of panegyrical rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 7"/&gt; Roger Rees, however, argues that the circumstances of its composition (if Pacatus is taken as its compiler) suggest that it was intended to illustrate Gaul's continuing loyalty to Rome. Along the same line, Pacatus' speech of 389 might have been meant to reassure Theodosius (who had defeated the usurper [[Magnus Maximus]] in Gaul the previous year) that Gaul was completely loyal to him.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manuscript tradition ===
The ''Panegyrici Latini'' make up most of the sixteen pre-400 Latin prose speeches in praise of Roman emperors that survive today. (The remaining four consist of three fragmentary speeches from Symmachus and one speech by Ausonius.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;) Only one manuscript of the ''Panegyrici Latini'' has survived into the 15th century, when it was discovered in 1433 in a monastery in [[Mainz]], Germany by [[Giovanni Aurispa|Johannes Aurispa]].&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 3–4"/&gt; That manuscript, known as M (Moguntinus), was copied several times before it was lost. Two branches of Italian manuscripts derive from a copy Aurispa made of M, X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 35–36; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also lost,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; but twenty-seven manuscripts descend from the pair. The evidence of the surviving manuscripts suggests that Aurispa's copy of M was made in haste, and that the Italian manuscripts are generally inferior to the other tradition, H.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another independent tradition branches off of M: H (at the [[British Library]]: Harleianus 2480), N (at [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], Romania: Napocensis), and A (at the [[Uppsala University Library]]).&lt;ref name="NR36R19"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 36; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; H and N are both 15th-century manuscripts, transcribed in a German hand. H shows corrections from a near-contemporary, ''h''. N was copied at some time between 1455 and 1460 by the German theologian Johannes Hergot.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 36"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed investigation of the manuscripts by D. Lassandro has revealed that A derives from N and N derives from H.&lt;ref&gt;D. Lassandro, "I manoscritti HNA nella tradizione dei ''Panegyrici Latini''," ''Bolletino del Comitato per la preparazione della Edizione Nazionale dei classici Greci e Latini'' 15 (1967): 55–97, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 36, and Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; H is usually considered the best surviving manuscript.&lt;ref name="NR36R19"/&gt;

Modern editions of the ''Panegyrici'' incorporate variant readings from outside H.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are in agreement, they sometimes preserve the true reading of M against H. They also contain useful emendations from the intelligent humanist corrector of Vaticanus 1775.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 36"/&gt; Early print editions also prove helpful, as Livineius' 1599 Antwerp edition contains variant readings from the work of scholar Franciscus Modius, who made use of another manuscript at the [[abbey of Saint Bertin]] at [[Saint-Omer]] (Bertinensis).&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 36; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Bertinensis is now generally believed to be cognate with, rather than derived from, M. [[Johannes Cuspinian|Cuspinianus]]' 1513 Vienna edition has proved more problematic. The relationship of M to the manuscripts Cuspinianus used is a mystery, and additional material, varying in length from single words to whole clauses, is found in Cuspinianus' text and nowhere else. Some scholars, like Galletier, reject Cuspinianus' additions in their entirety; Nixon and Rodgers chose to judge each addition separately.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 36"/&gt; Puteolanus' 1476 Milan edition and ''h''{{'}}s corrections have also proved valuable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The term ''parrhesia'' first appears in Greek literature in Euripides and can be found in ancient Greek texts throughout the end of the fourth century and during fifth century B.C.&lt;ref name = "foucault" /&gt; The term is borrowed from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] παρρησία ''parrhēsía'' (πᾶν "all" and ῥῆσις "utterance, speech") meaning literally "to speak everything" and by extension "to speak freely", "to speak boldly", or "boldness".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|parrhsi/a|παρρησία|cite}}&lt;/ref&gt; It implies not only freedom of speech, but the obligation to speak the truth for the common good, even at personal risk.

==Usage in ancient Greece==
In ancient Greece, rhetoric and '''parrhesia''' were understood to be in opposition to each other through the dialogues written by [[Plato]]. There are two major philosophies during this period, one being [[Sophistry]] and one being [[Dialectic]]. 

Sophistry is most commonly associated with the use of rhetoric or means of persuasion to teach or persuade an audience. In its opposition is the practice of dialectic, supported by Plato and his mentor Socrates, which uses dialogue to break apart complex issues in search of absolute truth or knowledge. In Plato's writings, specifically [[Gorgias]], the term ''parrhesia'' is more closely associated with dialectic meaning that it is "free speech" and not rhetoric or manipulation. 

Parrhesia was a fundamental component of the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]] of [[Classical Athens]]. In [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|assemblies]] and the [[Athenian law court (classical period)|courts]] Athenians were free to say almost anything, and in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre]], playwrights such as [[Aristophanes]] made full use of the right to ridicule whomever they chose.&lt;ref name="wallace"&gt;{{Citation | first = Robert W | last = Wallace | contribution = The Power to Speak — and not to listen – in Ancient Athens | editor1-first = Ineke | editor1-last = Sluiter | editor2-first = Ralph Mark | editor2-last = Rosen | year = 2002 | title= Free Speech in Classical Antiquity | pages = 222–3 | publisher = Brill}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere there were limits to what might be said; freedom to discuss politics, morals, religion, or to criticize people would depend on context: by whom it was made, and when, and how, and where.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John Willoby | last = Roberts | year = 1984 | title = City of Sokrates | page = 148 | publisher = Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

If a man was seen as immoral, or his views went contrary to popular opinion, then there were great risks involved in making use of such an unbridled freedom of speech, as [[Socrates]] found out when he was sentenced to death for not adoring Athens' gods and for corrupting the young.&lt;ref name="wallace"/&gt; 

=== Cynic philosophers ===
{{main article|Cynicism (philosophy)}}

Parrhesia was a central concept for the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic philosophers]], as epitomized in the shameless speech of [[Diogenes of Sinope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Luis E | last = Navia | title = Diogenes the Cynic | page = 179 | publisher = Humanity Books}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Epicureans ===
{{main article|Epicureans}}
Parrhesia was also used by Epicureans in a friendly manner of frank criticism during teaching Epicurean philosophy and offering psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;6Konstan D, Clay D and Glad CE: Philodemus: On frank criticism (Peri parrhesias). Society of Biblical Literature, Atlanta, USA, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament use==
A related use of parrhesia is found in the Greek [[New Testament]], where it means "bold speech", the ability of believers to hold their own in discourse before political and religious authorities (e.g. Acts 4:13: "Now when they saw the boldness [την παρρησίαν] of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized them as companions of Jesus."). It is also used to describe the reply Jesus made to the [[Pharisees]].&lt;ref name = Burton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120211164007/http://www.drbilllong.com/EvenMoreWords/ParrhesiaII.html | first = William 'Bill' | last = Long | contribution = Parrhesia and Earliest Christianity | title = Even more words | date = December 1, 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Heinrich | last = Schlier | contribution = παρρησία, παρρησιάζομαι | title = Theological Dictionary of the New Testament | editor1-first = Gerhard | editor1-last = Kittel | editor2-first = Gerhard | editor2-last = Friedrich | place = Ann Arbor | publisher = Eerdmans | year = 1967 | volume = V | pages = 871ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage in rabbinic Jewish writings==
Parrhesia appears in [[midrash|Midrashic]] literature as a condition for the transmission of [[Torah]]. Connoting open and public communication, ''parrhesia'' appears in combination with the term, [[wikt:δῆμος|δῆμος]] (''dimus'', short for ''dimosia''), translated ''coram publica'', in the public eye, i.e. open to the public&lt;ref&gt;A meaning found in ''Sylloge lnscriptionum Graecum'', 2nd edition, ed. Diltenberger 1888-1901, no.807, an inscription from after 138 C. E.&lt;/ref&gt; As a mode of communication it is repeatedly described in terms analogous to a [[Commons]]. ''Parrhesia'' is closely associated with an ownerless wilderness of primary mytho-geographic import, the ''Midbar Sinai'' in which the Torah was initially received. The dissemination of Torah thus depends on its teachers cultivating a nature which is as open, ownerless, and sharing as that wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;''Bamidbar Rabbah'' 1:7&lt;/ref&gt; The term is important to advocates of [[Open Source Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Varady | first =Aharon|title= ‘Make yourself into a Maqom Hefker’: Teachings on Open Source in Judaism | type = sourcesheet | url = http://opensiddur.org/development/open-siddur/make-yourself-into-a-maqom-hefker-teachings-on-open-source-in-judaism-sourcesheet/ | publisher = The Open Siddur Project | accessdate = 29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the text from the [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mekhilta]] where the term ''dimus parrhesia'' appears (see bolded text).

והם הלכו במדבר. התורה נתנה לדמוס כומר במקום של אדמות. השאלה ניתנה בארץ ישראל. הם אמרו לאומות העולם שאין להם חלק בכך. מדוע לא קמה התורה בארץ ישראל? לא לתת אמון לאומות העולם, ללמוד כי חייתי בארצם וכי הם לא קיבלו אותנו. כלומר, לא לתת מחלוקת בין השבטים, כי לא נאמר בארצי שהתורה ניתנה, וזה אומר שבארצי נתתי את התורה. בשלושה דברים, התורה מושווה למדבר, האש והמים, כדי לומר לך: "אמא מיה וילי!.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mekhilta de Rebbi Yishmael|url=http://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta.19.2.7?lang=he&amp;layout=lines&amp;sidebarLang=all|website=the Sefaria Project|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::Torah was given over ''dimus '''parrhesia''''' in a ''maqom hefker'' (a place belonging to no one). For had it been given in the Land of Israel, they would have had cause to say to the nations of the world, “you have no share in it.” Thus was it given ''dimus '''parrhesia''''', in a place belonging to no one: “Let all who wish to receive it, come and receive it!” Why was the Torah not given in the land of Israel? In order that the peoples of the world should not have the excuse for saying: `Because it was given in Israel's land, therefore we have not accepted it. Another reason: To avoid causing dissension among the tribes [of Israel]. Else one might have said: In my land the Torah was given. And the other might have said: In my land the Torah was given. Therefore, the Torah was given in the ''Midbar'' (wilderness), ''dimus '''parrhesia''''', in a place belonging to no one. To three things the Torah is likened: to the ''Midbar'' (wilderness), to fire, and to water. This is to tell you that just as these three things are free to all who come into the world, so also are the words of the Torah free to all who come into the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9780827610033 | volume = Tractate Baḥodesh | chapter = 5 | at = on Shemot 20:2 | publisher = JHU | ISBN = 978-0-82761003-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Israel|Israeli]] Hebrew,"parrhesia" (פרהסיא, פרהסיה) means simply "in public".

== Modern scholarship ==
[[Michel Foucault]] developed the concept of parrhesia as a mode of [[discourse]] in which one speaks openly and truthfully about one's opinions and ideas without the use of rhetoric, manipulation, or generalization.&lt;ref name="foucault"/&gt; Foucault's use of parrhesia, he tells us, is troubled by our modern day [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] model of evidential necessity. For [[Descartes]], [[truth]] is the same as the undeniable.  Whatever can be doubted must be, and, thus, speech that is not examined or criticized does not necessarily have a valid relation to truth.

There are several conditions upon which the traditional Ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] notion of parrhesia relies. One who uses parrhesia is only recognized as doing so if he or she holds a credible relationship to the truth, if he serves as [[critic]] to either himself or popular opinion or [[culture]], if the revelation of this truth places him in a position of danger and he persists in speaking the truth, nevertheless, as he feels it is his moral, social, and/or political [[obligation]]. Further, in a public situation, a user of parrhesia must be in a social position less empowered than those to whom he is revealing.

Foucault (1983) sums up the Ancient Greek concept of parrhesia as such:
{{Quote | So you see, the parrhesiastes is someone who takes a risk. Of course, this risk is not always a risk of life. When, for example, you see a friend doing something wrong and you risk incurring his anger by telling him he is wrong, you are acting as a parrhesiastes. In such a case, you do not risk your life, but you may hurt him by your remarks, and your friendship may consequently suffer for it. If, in a political debate, an orator risks losing his popularity because his opinions are contrary to the majority's opinion, or his opinions may usher in a political scandal, he uses parrhesia. Parrhesia, then, is linked to courage in the face of danger: it demands the courage to speak the truth in spite of some danger. And in its extreme form, telling the truth takes place in the "game" of life or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = Fearless Speech | pages = 15–16}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and
{{Quote | To summarize the foregoing, parrhesia is a kind of verbal activity where the speaker has a specific relation to truth through frankness, a certain relationship to his own life through danger, a certain type of relation to himself or other people through criticism (self-criticism or criticism of other people), and a specific relation to moral law through freedom and duty. More precisely, parrhesia is a verbal activity in which a speaker expresses his personal relationship to truth, and risks his life because he recognizes truth-telling as a duty to improve or help other people (as well as himself). In parrhesia, the speaker uses his freedom and chooses frankness instead of persuasion, truth instead of falsehood or silence, the risk of death instead of life and security, criticism instead of flattery, and moral duty instead of self-interest and moral apathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = Fearless Speech | pages = 19–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault (1984) sums up that:
{{Quote | The Parrhesiastes is the person who says everything. Thus, as an example, in his discourse "On the Embassy," Demosthenes says: It is necessary to speak with parrhesia, without holding back at anything without concealing anything. Similarly, in the "First Philippic," he takes up exactly the same term and says: I will tell you what I think without concealing anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = The Courage of Truth | page = 9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22222">In [[financial regulation]], "'''politically exposed person'''" ('''PEP''') is a term describing someone who has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in [[bribery]] and [[corruption]] by virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold. The terms politically exposed person and '''senior foreign political figure''' are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums.  [[Foreign official]] is a term for individuals deemed as government persons under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] or FCPA, and although definitions are similar to PEP, there are quite a few differences and should not be used interchangeably.  The term PEP is typically used referring to customers in the financial services industry, while 'foreign official' refers to the risks of third party relationships in all industries.

==Definition by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering==
While there is no global definition of a PEP, most countries have based their definition on the 2003 [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) standard, as for example the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority|Swiss financial market regulator]] in 2011, which quoted it as "the international standard"&lt;ref name="FINMA Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Due diligence obligations of Swiss banks when handling assets of "politically exposed persons".|url=http://www.finma.ch/e/aktuell/Documents/bericht_pep-abkl%C3%A4rung_20111110_e.pdf|date=10 November 2011|publisher=Eidgenoessische Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Australian government in 2015.&lt;ref name="Austrac Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft guidance note 15/01. Key terms used in 'politically exposed person' definition.|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/draft-gn1501-pep.docx|date=January 2015|publisher=Australian government|author=Australian Transaction reports and Analysis Center(Austrac)|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
FATF is an international inter-governmental body, founded in 1989 on the initiative of the [[G7]] and hosted by the [[OECD]], to set standards and promote implementing measures against [[money laundering]], [[financing of terrorism]] and financing of proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to preserve the integrity of the [[global financial system]].&lt;ref name="FATF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF_Recommendations.pdf|title=INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM &amp; PROLIFERATION|author=FATF|publisher=ATF/OECD|date=15 February 2012|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In February 2012, the FATF's latest definition of politically exposed persons (PEP), revised from 2003, is as follows:&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|123}} 
*''Foreign PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example [[Head of state|Heads of state]] or [[Head of government|Heads of government]], senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. 
*''Domestic PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions, for example Heads of State or of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. (Not all countries subscribe to the concept of domestic PEPs with respect to regulatory requirements/application of due diligence. For example, US law, specifically Section 312 of the USA Patriot Act and its implementing regulations provide for enhanced due diligence for SFPFs (Senior Foreign Political Figure) only, defined as: "a current or former senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military, or judicial branches of a 'foreign' government...a senior official of a major 'foreign' political party; and a senior executive of a 'foreign' government-owned commercial enterprise.)
*Persons who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function by a [[state owned enterprise]] or an [[international organisation]] refers to members of [[senior management]], i.e. directors, deputy directors and members of the board or equivalent functions.

Requirements for a PEP apply to [[family member]]s or close associates, any individual publicly known, or known by the financial institution to be a close personal or professional associate.&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|18}}
"The FATF definition is not intended to include middle-ranking or more junior individuals."&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|121}}

A forerunner definition was by the 1997 [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] aimed at reducing corruption in developing countries, which came into force February 1999; it used the term 'foreign official'.

==Implementation==
Most of the 37 FATF member countries treat domestic and foreign PEPs with heightened [[scrutiny]].  
The FATF guidance implies that if a person is a foreign PEP, it ''de facto'' makes them a domestic PEP in their own country. This makes sense for crime prevention, because to export proceeds of crime, the PEP must first use their own domestic financial system and thus, importance is placed on domestic, and non-foreign PEPs.&lt;ref name="Ukraine Crisis"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=The $70 Billion Missing From the Ukraine: Does it Demonstrate a Whopping Failure of Global Anti-Money Laundering and Corruption Laws?

===Australia===
Under Australia's AML/CTF Rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/businesses/legislation/amlctf-act|title=AML/CTF Act|first=Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre|last=(AUSTRAC)|date=30 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically exposed persons (PEPs) are individuals who occupy a prominent public position or functions in a government body or international organisation, both within and outside Australia. This definition also extends to their immediate family members and close associates.

The AML/CTF Rules define three categories of PEPs:

* Domestic PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an Australian government body
* Foreign PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in a government body of a foreign country.
* International organisation PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an international organisation.

A reporting entity must have procedures to identify whether any individual customer or beneficial owner is a PEP, or an associate of a PEP. The reporting entity must undertake this identification process before it provides the customer with a designated service, or as soon as practicable afterwards. A reporting entity must implement additional due diligence measures and risk management systems where the PEP is high ML/TF risk or is a foreign PEP.

===Canada===
Canada considers all foreign PEPs to pose a money laundering and terrorist financing risk.&lt;ref name="Politically Exposed Persons"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=Politically Exposed Persons, Duhaime's Financial Guide and Anti-Money Laundering Law.|url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/aml-law-in-canada/politically-exposed-person|publisher=Duhaime Law|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act that came into effect in 2016, a politically exposed person now also includes all domestic PEPs and Heads of International Organisations (HIOs). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://complyadvantage.com/pep-screening-and-monitoring-in-canada/|title=PEP Screening &amp; Monitoring in Canada|last=|first=|date=7 June 2017|website=ComplyAdvantage|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{See also|Banco de Chile#Controversies{{!}}Banco de Chile}}

In Chile, financial institutions are mandated to report any transaction suspicious for potential involvement in bribery by virtue of a PEP's position and the influence that they may hold. {{As of| 2015}}, 2,200 to 3,000 individuals are considered PEPs, 150 of them foreign, and also their second grade relatives are under financial observation by the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Chilean newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' 22 February 2015, [http://www.latercera.com/noticia/negocios/2015/02/655-617858-9-pep-asi-opera-la-vigilancia-financiera-a-la-clase-politica.shtml PEP: así opera la vigilancia financiera a la clase política] Fernando Vega, retrieved on 22 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre amended the Financial Intelligence Centre Act to refer to Politically Influential Persons (PIP) instead of PEP. This was done in order to include private sector officials who have business dealings with public sector officials and elected officials in the public services procurement deals.

===UK===
{{As of |January 2015}} likewise the UK's PEP definition is identical to the 2003 FATF definition, i.e. without the 2012 update to include domestic PEPs; It is found in the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 Section 14(5)&lt;ref name=uk&gt;{{cite web|title=The Money Laundering Regulations 2007|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/2157/regulation/14/made|work=No. 2157 PART 2 Enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring, Regulation 14|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A politically exposed person is considered any individual who fits any of the criteria listed below:

* A foreign person who has held any time in the preceding year a prominent public function outside the United Kingdom, in a state or international institution
* Members of courts of auditors or of the boards of central banks
* Ambassadors, chargés d’affaires and high-ranking officers in the armed forces
* Members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of state-owned enterprises
* Heads of state, heads of government, ministers and deputy or assistant ministers
* Members of parliaments
* Members of supreme courts, constitutional courts or of other high-level judicial bodies
The definition explicitly excludes middle-ranking or more junior officials.

PEP status also extends to relatives and close associates. Relatives and close associates include a spouse, a partner, children and their spouses or partners and parents. Close associates include any individual who is known to have joint beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement, or any other close business relations. It also includes any individual who has sole beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement which is known to have been set up for the benefit of a person referred to in regulation.

The [[Financial Conduct Authority]] and Joint Money Laundering Steering Group both publish comprehensive guidance on both PEPs and other KYC related matters to assist firms in complying with their legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-fca.org.uk/money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing|title=FCA Information on Money Laundering &amp; Terrorist Financing|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th EU AML Directive is expected update the definition to include domestic PEPs, and limit relatives-status to spouse and partner only, and no longer the children and parents of PEPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMLD4 and Domestic PEPS

|url=http://www.lkshields.ie/publications/the-fourth-anti-money-laundering-directive|publisher=LK Shields}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The term [[foreign official]] has been used by US enforcement agencies relating to persons who have similar characteristics as PEPs, as referenced in the US [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].{{UnitedStatesCode|15|78dd-1}} It is used in all industries, not only by financial institutions. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]]'s [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN) did not use the term PEP in its regulations as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/testimony/pdf/20100204.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicious activity requires a financial institution to submit a [[suspicious activity report]] to FinCEN. The term 'Senior Foreign Political Figure', as defined by section 312 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] is to a great extent similar to the definition of PEP, and also excludes middle-ranking or more junior individuals.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The term PEP is recognized (and was defined) by the 'Wolfsberg Group' of eleven global banks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/pdf/faq/Wolfsberg_PEP_FAQs_(2008).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The designation "politically exposed person" dates back to the late 1990s, in what was known as the "Abacha Affair." [[Sani Abacha]] was a Nigerian dictator who organized a large scale, systematic theft of assets from the Nigerian central bank for some years with his family members and associates. It is believed that several billion dollars were stolen, and that the funds were transferred to bank accounts in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="senat.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/ue/pac/E2734.html|date=30 June 2004|title=Proposition de directive du Parlement européen et du Conseil relative à la prévention de l'utilisation du système financier aux fins du blanchiment de capitaux, y compris le financement du terrorisme|language=French|author=French Senate,Justice et affaires intérieures|publisher=French Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Nigerian Government that succeeded the Abacha Regime made an effort to recover the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200108080222.html|title=Nigeria: Abacha Loot: Swiss Govt to Dock 60 Bankers, Lawyers|first=Chidi|last='Uzor|date=8 August 2001|publisher=|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lodged complaints with several European agencies, including the [[Federal Office of Police]] of [[Switzerland]] which investigated close to sixty Swiss banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=en&amp;msg-id=22828|title=Switzerland provides mutual legal assistance in the Abacha case - To date, USD 645 million have been frozen in Switzerland|author=|date=21 January 2000|publisher=Federal Office of Justice Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this investigation, the concept of "politically exposed person" emerged, around which the UN organised a committee in December 2000, that eventually led to the October 2003 resolution of [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], entered into force in December 2005, with ongoing annual reviews of implementation and asset recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention against Corruption|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html#UNCACfulltext|publisher=UN office of drugs and crime (UNODC)|accessdate=12 February 2015|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had become [[European Union law]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="senat.fr"/&gt;

PEP-specific compliance legislation addresses the link between [[government corruption]], [[money laundering]] and [[terrorism financing]].&lt;ref name="FATF Guidance"&gt;{{cite web|title=FATF Guidance on PEP Legislation.|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Guidance-PEP-Rec12-22.pdf|publisher=FATF|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 11, 2001, more than 100 countries have changed their laws related to financial services regulation, combating political corruption.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Heavy fines have been imposed on financial institutions for conducting business with PEPs without following adequate procedures, as in the case of [[Riggs Bank]].&lt;ref name="Riggs Bank"&gt;{{cite web|title=At Riggs Bank, A Tangled Path Led to Scandal.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/19/us/at-riggs-bank-a-tangled-path-led-to-scandal.html|publisher=New York Times|date=19 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of regulation, political leaders like [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] have made news in 2013 for having [[Toxic asset|frozen assets]] in US banks that did not follow [[due diligence]].&lt;ref name="Mubarak Asset Freeze"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frozen Mubarak assets worth around $1bn.|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/04/17/efsa-frozen-mubarak-assets-worth-around-1bn/|publisher=Daily News Egypt|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk screening and PEP datasets==
Most financial institutions view a PEP as a potential compliance risk, and perform enhanced monitoring of accounts that fall within this category. Screening for PEPs is usually performed at the beginning of account opening, called initial [[due diligence]] or [[know your customer]] (KYC). Screening of accounts periodically is performed as part of ongoing due diligence.

There are a number of companies advertising for regulatory, financial and reputational risk screening. 

Due diligence to uncover PEPs can be time consuming and requires the checking of names, dates of birth, national identification numbers and photos of clients against a reputable database of known PEPs, which usually contains over one million profiles.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} No 'official' PEP list exist. The [[CIA]] and [[United Nations|UN]] have lists of [[heads of state]]s, which fall below the PEP definitions of FATF. 

Vendors maintain their own particular database of PEPs and other high-risk customers.  The world's largest PEP database of 1.6 million counterparts gives Accuity [4] part of RELX Group (formerly Reed Elsevier) [5] a strong market position. World Compliance&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/intl/en/resources/brochures/WorldCompliance-Data.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; by Lexis Nexis has a global PEP list, Lexis Diligence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/lexis-diligence.page|title=Lexis Diligence® - Trusted Due Diligence Solution|website=www.lexisnexis.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Lexis Nexis]], GSW Spotlight &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gsw.global/en/spotlight|title=GSW Spotlight® - The most up-to-date database of profiles of high-risk individuals, debarred persons, sanctioned entities and PEPs|website=www.gsw.global}}&lt;/ref&gt; by GoldSchaff &amp; Wolfson, [[World-Check]] by [[Thomson Reuters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-check.com|title=Thomson Reuters Risk Management Solutions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dow Jones]] offers a global PEP database,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dowjones.com/info/pep-list-screening.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211204244/http://www.dowjones.com/info/pep-list-screening.asp |archivedate=2015-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ComplyAdvantage offers an AI-driven database of PEPs and anti-money laundering data,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://complyadvantage.com/politically-exposed-persons/|title=Politically Exposed Person (PEP) Data|last=|first=|date=|website=www.complyadvantage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory DataCorp offers PEP list screening,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Regulatory DataCorp, Inc.

Geneva based Polixis&lt;ref&gt;http://polixis.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is seen as a challenger solution since it offers an AI-driven database of PEPs with a peculiarity that the data can be linked to a much larger set of economic data through their ARDIS software.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tdg.ch/geneve/geneve-bureau-polixis-robotise-controle-clients-fortunes-banques/story/19614383&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of crowd sourced lists of Politically Exposed Persons being made available utilizing public contributions. As of March 2016, Ukrainian activists has announced the launch of publicly available Register of Politically Exposed Persons – pep.org.ua, an exclusive public online database designed to help to withstand money laundering from state Ukrainian budget through international banks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7525">'''Preservation of meaning''' in library, archival or museum collections involves understanding spiritual, ritual, or cultural perceptions of value for specific objects, and ensuring these values are maintained and respected.  Meaning is something assigned to objects of cultural or spiritual significance based on interpretations and perceived values by user populations, a process known as social construction of an object (Barker, 77).  When moved to [[memory institution]]s such as libraries or museums, these objects of social construction require unique approaches to preservation and maintenance in order to remain relevant as representations of cultural or spiritual societies.

In many memory institutions of the Western World, including libraries and museums, focus is often placed on the informational content and physical attributes, or artifactual value, of collected materials.  Preservation policies are primarily concerned with the maintenance of these two things, either through reformatting to preserve textual information, or repairs and environmental controls to ensure continued existence of their physical structure (Foot, 19). However, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and informational aspects of objects in order to ensure we are also preserving the integrity of the spiritual or cultural values which may be fundamental in defining the object.   
 
Concerns arise when actions taken to preserve the physical object may compromise the spiritual or cultural integrity of a given object.  Artifacts, including books, throughout history and the present were created and utilized according to rules and taboos that may not be inherently understood in today's world of mass consumer goods and material culture.  While not all books, documents, and artifacts have rituals or socially constructed beliefs associated with their continued existence, it is a relevant issue for many cultural and religious collections.

== Examples ==

An extreme example of how efforts to physically preserve may compromise the socially constructed meaning of the object is the [[Shinto]] Shrines of Ise Jingu, in [[Japan]] (Maré, 2004).  These shrines are of significant cultural and spiritual value to the Japanese people, but every twenty years since the time of Emperor Temmu in the 7th century C.E. the buildings are completely destroyed and rebuilt.  The rebuilding process is based on descriptions in the Documents on the rituals of the Great Shrine of Ise which dates from 804 C.E. and ensures that the recreations are exact replicas of the shrines taken down.  Physical preservation of these monuments would damage the spiritual and cultural integrity of the process and purpose behind the continuous rebuilding.

Similarly, in the [[Buddhist]] faith, materials are considered to have a life, which must be allowed to progress and end naturally.  Impermanence (anitya) in the Buddhist faith relates to the natural end of all things, [[nirvana]], and acts of physical preservation would be contrary to this belief (Karlström). Buddhist [[Conservation of South Asian household shrines|shrines]] are an example of such items that hold spiritual meaning. 

Physical preservation can also work to maintain spiritual and culture integrity of an object, especially in the case of musical instruments.  At the violin museum in [[Cremona, Italy]], nine instruments crafted by the [[Amatis]], [[Guarneris]], and by Antonio [[Stradivari]] are played ceremoniously six days a week – both to keep them in good physical, playable condition, and to maintain their cultural significance and meaning.  From the island of [[Java]] in [[Indonesia]], the instruments of the [[gamelan]] are treated with respect and reverence, and played on a regular basis to maintain their physical and spiritual life.  They are played only for certain occasions and only by certain individuals trained in the art.  They must also be handled and stored with care to be sure no one should compromise their spiritual integrity by stepping over them.  (Kartomi and Mendonça) Gamelan instruments can be found in museums throughout North America, but to accurately remain gamelan instruments, they must be treated and respected according to both their physical and spiritual properties.

However, examples of the significance of meaning and spiritual integrity exist in North America as well.  ''[[Jish]]'' is a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] medicine bundle used in religious rituals related to curing or prevention, and specific care and established provenance is necessary to preserve the existence of ''jish'' versus a simple bundle of herb and grasses.  [[NAGPRA]], or North American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act has helped to highlight this issue of meaning and spiritual integrity in the United States.  The act not only covers objects and remains recovered from American Indian graves, but the subsequent literary material developed based on the examination and analysis of these objects.  (Grose)

Preservation of meaning is perhaps most relevant and recognized in museum collections, but this does not mean there are not key books and documents that are defined by their social construction as well as their physical existence.  When a book printed on acid paper turns to dust, there is no doubt that it ceases to exist as book.  However, when books are stacked on top of a [[Koran]], or a [[Guru Granth Sahib]] is repaired rather than ceremoniously cremated, the spiritual integrity of these texts is compromised or destroyed, and the physical object is void of spiritual or cultural meaning.  It may at this point actually cease to be what it had been previously identified as, at least in terms of its cultural or spiritual meaning.

Admittedly, more work and research needs to be done in regard to  preservation of meaning in the area of Library Science.  However, it is necessary for libraries and archival institutions to assess their preservation priorities in consideration of social and cultural meaning in tandem with physical attributes and informational context.  Preservation and curatorial policies and activities can take into account how materials are housed, handled, repaired, or analyzed not just in terms of preserving physical qualities, but spiritual and cultural meaning as well.

'''Protoscholastic writing''' re-introduced [[Space (punctuation)|space]] between words into the punctuation of western languages. It replaced [[Liturgy|liturgical]] models starting in the 7th century and by the 14th century it was the standard. The protoscholastic mode of writing was primarily introduced for faster decoding of written texts for scholars, rather than for oral communication (the focus of liturgical models).&lt;ref&gt;Saenger, Paul Henry. ''Space Between the Words: The Origins of Silent Reading'', pg.120, Stanford University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-8047-4016-X}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=w3vZaFoaa3EC]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">A '''puppet ruler''' is a person who has a title indicating possession of [[political power]], but who, in reality, is controlled by outside individuals or forces.  Such outside power can be exercised by a foreign government, in which case the puppet ruler's domain is called a [[puppet state]].  But the puppet ruler may also be controlled by internal forces, such as non-elected officials.

== Examples ==
=== In Latin America ===
Governing through puppet presidents has long been a political tactic in [[Latin America]]. Many dictators and strongmen have formally handed over power to other officials for several reasons, often in order to follow constitutional provisions for elections and term limits, to provide a civilian façade for military rule, or to be able to go into semi-retirement away from the capital city. Strongmen who sometimes governed through figureheads included [[Diego Portales]] of [[Chile]], [[Rafael Núñez (politician)|Rafael Núñez]] of [[Colombia]], [[Tomás Guardia Gutiérrez]] of [[Costa Rica]], [[Fulgencio Batista]] of [[Cuba]], [[Ulises Heureaux]] and [[Rafael Trujillo]] of the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Gabriel García Moreno]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Raoul Cédras]] of [[Haiti]], [[Porfirio Díaz]] and [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] of [[Mexico]], the [[Somoza family]] of [[Nicaragua]], [[José Antonio Remón Cantera]], [[Omar Torrijos]] and [[Manuel Noriega]] of [[Panama]], [[Dési Bouterse]] of [[Suriname]], and [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] and [[Juan Vicente Gómez]] of [[Venezuela]]. While figureheads who decided to act autonomously were often dismissed, on rare occasions the "puppets" later became significant political figures in their own right. For example, [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] turned against and exiled Calles to the United States and [[Joaquín Balaguer]] was elected to the Dominican presidency six times after the assassination of Trujillo.
=== Elsewhere ===

A puppet does not have to be a national ruler.  For example, [[Oscar K. Allen]] was widely recognized to be [[Huey Long]]'s puppet while serving as governor of [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5107&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Interwar period|the years before]] and during [[World War II]], [[Puyi]], the deposed [[Emperor of China]], is usually considered to have been the [[Emperor of Manchukuo|puppet ruler of]] [[Manchukuo]], a [[client state]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] on the Chinese mainland. &lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 281&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pu Yi 1988, p 298&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Win Myint (politician)|Win Myint]], the current [[President of Myanmar|president]] of [[Myanmar]], is widely viewed by political commentators as a puppet president for [[Aung San Suu Kyi]], who is constitutionally barred from holding the office of president.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28927">The relationship between the level of '''religiosity''' and the level of '''education''' has been studied since the second half of the 20th century.

The parameters of the two components diverse: the "level of [[religiosity]]" remains a concept which is difficult to differentiate [[Scientifically based research|scientifically]], while the "[[International Standard Classification of Education|level of education]]" is easier to compile, such as [[Educational measurement|official data]] on this topic, because data on education is publicly accessible in many countries.

Different studies show contrasted conclusions regarding any link between the two concepts, depending on whether "religiosity" is measured by religious practices (attendance at places of worship, for example) or specific religious beliefs (belief in miracles, for example), with notable differences between nations. For example, an international study states that in some Western nations the intensity of beliefs decreases with education, but attendance and religious practice increases.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; Other studies indicate that the religious have higher education than the non-religious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt; Other studies find that the positive correlation with low or non religiosity and education has been reversed in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith Souls" /&gt;

In terms of university professors, one study concluded that in the US, the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities, were religious.&lt;ref name=gross2009 /&gt;

==Studies==

===Global studies===

A [[Pew Center]] study about religion and education around the world in 2016, found that [[Jews]] are most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 13.4 years of schooling;&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 19, 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jews]] also have the highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita (61%).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; Based on the study data, [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of education, with an average of 5.6 years of schooling for both.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; About 36% of the world Muslim population and 41% of the world Hindu population have no formal schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]] have the lowest average levels of higher education than any other major religious group, with only 8% and 10% respectively have [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Christians]] ranked as the second most educated religious group around in the world with an average of 9.3 years of schooling.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; [[Christians]] were found to have the second highest number of [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degrees per capita while in absolute numbers ranked in the first place (220 million).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the study, Christians in [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and [[Asia]]-[[Pacific]] regions are highly educated since many of the world universities were built by the historic [[Christian denominations|Christian churches]],&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; in addition to the historical evidence that "Christian monks built libraries and, in the days before printing presses, preserved important earlier writings produced in Latin, Greek and Arabic".&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study, Christians have a significant amount of [[gender equality]] in educational attainment,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and the study suggests that one of the reasons is the encouragement of the [[Protestant Reformers]] in promoting the [[education of women]], which led to the eradication of illiteracy among females in Protestant communities.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

The [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]]—which includes [[atheists]], [[agnostics]] and those who describe their religion as “nothing in particular”—ranked as the third most educated religious group with an average of 8.8 years of schooling,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; and around 16% of unaffiliated have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

[[Buddhists]] have an average of 7.9 years of schooling, and around 12% of Buddhists have graduate and post-graduate degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; According to the same study "there is a large and pervasive gap in educational attainment between Muslims and Christians in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]" as [[Muslim]] adults in this region are far less educated than their [[Christian]] counterparts,&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; with scholars suggesting that this gap is due to the [[Christian school|educational facilities]] that were created by [[Christian missionaries]] during the colonial era for fellow believers.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt;

According to a 2015 global survey by [[WIN/GIA|Gallup International]], the most religious had lower levels of education, however, religious people in general were a majority in all educational levels.&lt;ref name=GallupInt2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Losing our Religion?

In one analysis of [[World Values Survey]] data by Edward Glaeser and Bruce Sacerdote noted that in 65 former socialist countries there is a negative relationship between years of education and belief in God, with similar negative correlations for other religious beliefs while, in contrast, there were strong positive correlations between years of education and belief in God in many developed countries such as England, France and the US.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser" /&gt; They concluded that "these cross-country differences in the education-belief relationship can be explained by political factors (such as communism) which lead some countries to use state controlled education to discredit religion". The study also concludes that, in the United States and other developed nations, "education raises religious attendance at individual level," while "at the same time, there is a strong negative connection between attendance and education across religious groups within the U.S. and elsewhere." The authors suggest that "this puzzle is explained if education both increases the returns to social connection and reduces the extent of religious belief," causing more educated individuals to sort into less fervent denominations.&lt;ref name="Sacerdote Glaeser"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/glaeser/files/w8080.pdf |title= Education and Religion |last1= Sacerdote |first1= Bruce |last2= Glaeser|first2= Edward L.|work= |publisher= National Bureau of Economic Research|page=29|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical analysis of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prizes]] awarded between 1901 and 2000 reveals that 65.4% of [[List of Christian Nobel laureates|Nobel laureates were Christians]], over 20% were Jewish, and 10.5% were atheists, agnostics, or freethinkers.&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;Baruch A. Shalev, ''100 Years of Nobel Prizes'' (2003), Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors , p.57&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study that was done by [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] in 1998, 60% of [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel prize laureates in physics]] from 1901 to 1990 had a [[Christian]] background.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=physicsfuller Nobel prize winners in physics from 1901 to 1990]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1901-2013, 22% of all Nobel prizes have been awarded to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Biographies: Nobel Prize Laureates|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/nobels.html|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
===Britain===

Research in nonreligion in Britain has shown that the positive relationship between education and non-religion has been reversed with generations after 1955. In other words, the nonreligious populations tend to have less education and religious populations tend to have higher education, even though religious affiliation has decreased for both.&lt;ref name="Voas Brit"&gt;{{cite book|last1=David Voas and Siobhan McAndrew|editor1-last=Arweck|editor1-first=Elisabeth|editor2-last=Bullivant|editor2-first=Stephen|editor3-last=Lee|editor3-first=Lois|title=Secularity and Non-religion|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415710442|chapter=Three Puzzles of Non-religion in Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===India===

A survey conducted by the ''Times of India'' revealed that 22% of [[IIT Bombay]] graduates do not believe in the existence of God, while another 30% do not know.&lt;ref name=toi2015&gt;{{cite web|title=Less than half of passing IIT batch believes in God’s existence|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Less-than-half-of-passing-IIT-batch-believes-in-Gods-existence/articleshow/46938504.cms|publisher= Times Of India|accessdate=29 September 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===

In Ireland, the non-religious have a greater level of education than the general population.&lt;ref name=Census.ie&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile 7 – Religion, Ethnicity and Irish Travellers|url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/census/documents/census2011profile7/Profile%207%20Education%20Ethnicity%20and%20Irish%20Traveller%20entire%20doc.pdf|publisher=Census Statistics Office|accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

In 1980, a study was conducted in Spain that showed that many educated people were Catholic.&lt;ref name= "congress"&gt;{{cite web|last=Scofield|first=James|title=Spain: Religion|url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+es0062)|work=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

According to the General Social Survey, which has collected data on Americans since 1972, people who are educated often are more religious by various measures. For instance, as of 2010 sociologist Philip Schwadel found that, with each additional year of education, the likelihood of attending religious services increased 15%, the likelihood of reading the Bible at least occasionally increased by 9%. The likelihood of switching to a mainline Protestant denomination increased by 13%.&lt;ref name="CNN GSS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kavanagh|first1=Jim|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwadel said, “With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God...But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’”&lt;ref name="CNN GSS" /&gt;

Sociologist Bradley Wright reviewed results from the 2008 Pew US Religious Landscape Survey and noted that religious groups normally have significant levels of education compared to those who are non-religious. "The irony" he states "is that some of the religiously unaffiliated explain their rejection of religion in terms of superior learning, but several religious groups have much higher levels of education."

He found that [[Hindus]], [[Jews]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|title=US Religious Landscape Survey: Diverse and Dynamic|format=PDF|publisher=The Pew Forum|page=85|publication-date=February 2008|accessdate=2012-09-17|ref=refEducationLevel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/|title=Faith, Education and Income|work=The New York Times|accessdate=May 13, 2011|first=David|last=Leonhardt|date=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]], [[Buddhists]], and [[Orthodox Christians]]&lt;ref name="Faith, Education and Income"&gt;[https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/faith-education-and-income/?_r=1 Faith, Education and Income]&lt;/ref&gt; have the highest levels of education. [[Catholics]], [[Mormons]], and [[Muslims]] are at about the national average.. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] have by far the lowest education. Evangelicals are somewhat below the national average. The religiously unaffiliated are just slightly above average in levels of college education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Bradley R.E.|title=Christians are hate-filled hypocrites-- and other lies you've been told : a sociologist shatters myths from the secular and christian media|year=2010|publisher=Bethany House|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=9780764207464|pages=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological research by Patricia Snell and Christian Smith on many dimensions of general American youth have noted that older research on baby boomers showed correlations where higher education undermined religiosity, however, studies on today's youth have consistently shown that this has disappeared and now students in college are more likely religious than people who do not go to college.&lt;ref name="Smith Souls"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=Souls in Transition: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of Emerging adults|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195371796|pages=248–251|author2=Patricia Snell |quote=However, something very interesting emerged when scholars took a second look at the question more recently. They found that the religiously undermining effect of higher education on recent generation of youth disappeared. Most of the older research was conducted on baby boomers for whom college did indeed corrode religious faith and practice. But many studies more recently have shown that conventional wisdom about baby boomers does not apply to today's youth. Higher education no longer seem to diminish religion in emerging adults." "In every case, emerging adults are slightly more religious than those who are not in college, although only the differences in overall religiousness and service attendance are statistically significant. In short, if anything, it is ''not'' attending college that is associated with lower levels of religious practice, though those differences are slight.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]'s 2002 Index of Leading Religious Indicators for the US, the relationship between education and religiosity are complex. For instance, there are slight differences in belief in God and membership in a congregation: 88% of those with postgraduate degrees believe in God or a universal spirit, compared to 97% of those with a high school education or less; 70% of postgraduate degree holders say they are members of a congregation, compared to 64% of those with a high school education or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winseman|first1=Albert L.|title=Does More Educated Really = Less Religious?|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/7729/does-more-educated-really-less-religious.aspx|website=Gallup Poll|date=February 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin indicates that Americans with post-graduate education have a similar religious distribution and affiliation to the general population, with a higher "public religiosity" (i.e., membership in congregations and worship attendance), but slightly less "belief." Advanced education in U.S. does not seem to produce much religious skepticism since so many post-graduates are religious believers.&lt;ref name="Post ARIS 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kosmin|first=Barry|title=Religion and the Intelligentsia: Post-graduate Educated Americans 1990-2008|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/publications/religion-and-the-intelligentsia-post-graduate-educated-americans-1990-2008/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by Barry Kosmin and Ariela Keysar on college students looked at three worldviews — Religious, Secular, and Spiritual — and looked students from levels from freshmen to post-graduates from majors such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), Social and Behavioral Sciences, Arts and Humanities, and Undecided. The Religious were 31.8% of the total sample (40% from STEM, 27% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 27% from Arts and Humanities, and 5% from Undecided); the Secular were 28.2% of the total sample (38% from STEM, 29% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 30% from Arts and Humanities, and 3% from Undecided); the Spiritual were 32.4% of the total sample (29% from STEM, 36% from Social and Behavioral Sciences, 31% from Arts and Humanities, and 4% from Undecided).&lt;ref name="Kosmin keysar College"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kosmin|first1=Barry|last2=Keysar|first2=Ariela|title=Religious, Spiritual and Secular: The emergence of three distinct worldviews among American college students|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/centers/isssc/Documents/ARIS_2013_College%20Students_Sept_25_final_draft.pdf|publisher=Trinity College|pages=8–9|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Neil Gross and Solon Simmons done on more than 1,400 professors from 20 disciplinary fields and religiosity found that the majority of professors, even at "elite" universities were religious believers. As a whole, university professors were less religious than the general US population, but it is hardly the case that the professorial landscape is characterized by an absence of religion. In the study, 9.8% were atheists, 13.1% were agnostic, 19.2% believe in a higher power, 4.3% believe in God some of the time, 16.6% had doubts but believed in God, 34.9% believed in God and had no doubts. At "elite" doctoral universities 36.5% were either atheists or agnostics and 20.4% believed in God without any doubts. Furthermore the authors noted, "religious skepticism represents a minority position, even among professors teaching at elite research universities."&lt;ref name=gross2009&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009).

However, both groups were still a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gross|first=Neil|title=How Religious are America’s College and University Professors?|url=http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Gross_Simmons.pdf|publisher=SSRC|author2=Solon Simmons |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study noted positive correlations, among nonreligious Americans, between levels of education and not believing in a deity.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Phil | last1=Zuckerman | year=2009 | title=Atheism, Secularity, and Well-Being: How the Findings of Social Science Counter Negative Stereotypes and Assumptions | url=http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf | journal=Sociology Compass | volume=3 | issue=6 | pages=949–971 | doi=10.1111/j.1751-9020.2009.00247.x | ref=harv | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141228104545/http://www.pitzer.edu/academics/faculty/zuckerman/Zuckerman_on_Atheism.pdf | archivedate=2014-12-28 | df= }}

[[Frank Sulloway]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and [[Michael Shermer]] of the [[California State University]] conducted a study that found in their polling sample of "credentialed" U.S. adults (12% had Ph.Ds and 62% were college graduates) 64% believed in God, and there was a [[correlation]] indicating that religious conviction diminished with education level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox said that people with less education have decreased in religiosity in America. Their views on family and work have been associated with this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Daniel|title=Less-educated Americans turning their backs on religion|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-08/asa-lea081511.php|work=American Sociological Association|publisher=Eureka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on secularity has noted that, in America, agnostics have significant levels of education, while atheists have relatively low levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Barry A. Kosmin and Ariela Keysar. ''Secularism &amp; Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives''. Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist Christian Smith has done research on American evangelicals and has found that, on average, self-identified evangelicals have more years of education than fundamentalists, liberals, Roman Catholics, and the nonreligious, but slightly less than [[mainline Protestant]]s.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving|year=1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226764192|pages=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also found that evangelicals were the least likely to have high school education or less, the nonreligious were the most likely to have high school education or less, and higher proportions of evangelicals had studied at the graduate level than fundamentalists, liberals, and the nonreligious.&lt;ref name="Smith Evangelicals" /&gt;

Sociologist Philip Schwadel found that higher levels of education "positively affects religious participation, devotional activities, and emphasizing the importance of religion in daily life", education is not correlated with disbelief in God, and correlates with greater tolerance for atheists' public opposition to religion and greater skepticism of "exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Effects of Education on Americans’ Religious Practices, Beliefs, and Affiliations|last=Schwadel|first=Philip|year=2011|journal=Review of Religious Research|volume=53|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s13644-011-0007-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study: More educated tend to be more religious, by some measures|author=Jim Kavanagh|date=11 August 2011|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/08/11/study-more-educated-tend-to-be-more-religious-by-some-measures/|quote=With more years of education, you aren’t relatively more likely to say, ‘I don’t believe in God,’” he said. “But you are relatively more likely to say, ‘I believe in a higher power.’}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Pew Center]] study there is correlation between education and income: about 77% of American [[Hindus]] have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree, followed by [[Unitarian Universalists]] (67%), [[Jews]] (59%), [[Anglican]] (59%), [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] (56%) and [[Presbyterian Church (USA)|Presbyterians]] (47%) and [[United Church of Christ]] (46%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/|title=The most and least educated U.S. religious group|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; While cording to the same study about (43%) of American [[atheists]], and (42%) [[agnostics]], and (24%) of those who say their religion is “nothing in particular” have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree.

==In specific religious denominations==

===Mormons===
Studies of [[Mormons]] in the US show that Mormons with higher education attend church more regularly than less-educated Mormons. Survey research indicated that 41% of Mormons with only elementary school education attend church regularly, compared to 76% of Mormon college graduates and 78% of Mormons who went beyond their college degrees to do graduate study attending [[Church service|church]] regularly.&lt;ref&gt;Stan L. Albrecht, "The Consequential Dimension of Mormon Religiosity" Latter-Day Saint Social Life, Social Research on the LDS Church and its Members (Provo, Utah: BYU [[Religious Studies Center]], 1998), 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evangelical groups===
Edward Dutton studied findings that indicate that universities that are particularly transitional and prestigious tend to have (in contrast to less transitional universities), tightly differentiated and ‘fundamentalist’ student evangelical groups and higher levels of conversion while at university. He argued that Oxford University students are likely to be not just more intelligent in IQ terms than comparable students but more creative, more original in their thinking and more able to acquire knowledge —  factors Dutton found made religious experience more likely in an individual.&lt;ref name=dutton&gt;{{cite web|last=Dutton|first=Edward|title=Why does Jesus go to Oxford University?

In 1975, Norman Poythress studied a sample of 234 US college undergraduates, grouping them into relatively homogeneous religious types based on the similarity of their religious beliefs and compared their personality characteristics. He found that "Literally-oriented religious Believers did not differ significantly from Mythologically-oriented Believers on measures of intelligence, authoritarianism, or racial prejudice. Religious Believers as a group were found to be significantly less intelligent and more authoritarian than religious Skeptics." He used [[SAT]] scores as a measure of intelligence for this study.&lt;ref&gt;

===Christian fundamentalists===
Contrary to the researchers' expectations, fundamentalist 'converts' were not less educated people. However, a weak 'negative correlation' between education and [[Christian fundamentalism]] was found by Burton et al. (1989),&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Burton; Stephen Johnson; Joseph Tamney, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3511296 Education and Fundamentalism], ''Review of Religious Research'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; a study comparing the religious beliefs and educational achievements of white, [[Protestant]] residents of [[Delaware County, Indiana]].

[[File:Lifeshmoo.jpg|thumb|250 px]]
The '''shmoo''' (plural: '''shmoon''', also '''shmoos''') is a fictional [[cartoon]] creature created by [[Al Capp]] (1909–1979); the character first appeared in its classic [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' on August 31, 1948. The popular character has gone on to influence pop culture, language and even science. 
__TOC__

==Description==
A shmoo is shaped like a plump [[bowling pin]] with stubby legs. It has smooth skin, eyebrows and sparse whiskers—but no arms, nose or ears. Its feet are short and round but dextrous, as the shmoo's [[comic book]] adventures make clear. It has a rich gamut of facial expressions and often expresses love by exuding hearts over its head. [[Cartoonist]] Al Capp ascribed to the shmoo the following curious characteristics:
*They [[Asexual reproduction|reproduce asexually]] and are incredibly prolific, multiplying exponentially faster than rabbits. They require no sustenance other than air.
*Shmoos are delicious to eat, and are eager to be eaten. If a human looks at one hungrily, it will happily immolate itself—either by jumping into a frying pan, after which they taste like chicken, or into a broiling pan, after which they taste like steak. When roasted they taste like pork, and when baked they taste like catfish. (Raw, they taste like [[oyster]]s on the half-shell.)
*They also produce eggs (neatly packaged), milk (bottled, grade-A), and butter—no churning required. Their pelts make perfect bootleather or house timbers, depending on how thick one slices them.
*They have no bones, so there's absolutely no waste. Their eyes make the best [[suspenders|suspender]] buttons, and their [[Vibrissae|whiskers]] make perfect toothpicks. In short, they are simply the perfect ideal of a subsistence agricultural herd animal.
*Naturally gentle, they require minimal care, and are ideal playmates for young children. The frolicking of shmoon is so entertaining (such as their staged "shmoosical comedies") that people no longer feel the need to watch television or go to the [[film|movies]].
*Some of the more tasty varieties of shmoo are more difficult to catch. Usually shmoo hunters, now a sport in some parts of the country, utilize a paper bag, flashlight and stick to capture their shmoos. At night the light stuns them, then they can be whacked in the head with the stick and put in the bag for frying up later on.

==The original story==
{{TOC right}}
In a sequence beginning in late August 1948, Li'l Abner discovers the shmoos when he ventures into the forbidden "Valley of the Shmoon" following the mysterious and musical sound they make (from which their name derives). Abner is thrown off a cliff and into the valley below by a primitive "large gal" (as he addresses her), whose job is to guard the valley. (This character is never seen again.) There, against the frantic protestations of a naked, heavily bearded old man who shepherds the shmoos, Abner befriends the strange and charming creatures. "Shmoos", the old man warns, "is the greatest menace to hoomanity th' world has evah known!" "Thass becuz they is so bad, huh?" asks Li'l Abner. "No, ''stupid''", answers the man—and then encapsulates one of life's profound [[paradox]]es: "It's because they's so ''good!!''".

Having discovered their value ("Wif these around, nobody won't nevah havta work no more!!"), Abner leads the shmoos out of the valley—where they become a sensation in [[Dogpatch]] and, quickly, the rest of the world. Captains of industry such as J. Roaringham Fatback, the "Pork King", become alarmed as sales of nearly all products decline, and in a series of images reminiscent of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the "Shmoo Crisis" unfolds. On Fatback's orders, a corrupt exterminator orders out "Shmooicide Squads" to wipe out the shmoos with a variety of firearms, which is depicted in a macabre and comically graphic sequence, with a tearful Li'l Abner misguidedly saluting the supposed "authority" of the extermination squads.

After the shmoos have been eliminated, Dogpatch's extortionate grocer Soft-Hearted John is seen cackling as he displays his wares—rotting meat and produce: "Now them mizzuble starvin' rats has t'come crawlin t'me fo' the necessities o' life!! They complained 'bout mah prices befo'!! Wait'll they see th' new ones!!". The exterminator congratulates him.

However, it is soon discovered that Abner has secretly saved two shmoos, a "boy" and a "girl". The boy shmoo, as a Dogpatch native, is required to run from the girl shmoo in the annual [[Sadie Hawkins Day]] race. (Shmoos are usually portrayed as gender-neutral, although Capp sidesteps this issue to allow the comic plot twist.) When he is caught by her, in accordance with the rules of the race, they are joined in marriage by Marryin' Sam (whom they "pay" with a dozen eggs, two pounds of butter and six cupcakes with chocolate frosting—all of which Sam reckons to be worth about 98 cents). The already expanding shmoo family is last seen returning towards the Valley of the Shmoon.

The sequence, which ended just before [[Christmas]] of 1948, was massively popular, both as a commentary on the state of society and a classic [[allegory]] of greed and corruption tarnishing all that is good and innocent in the world. The Shmoo caused an unexpected national sensation, and set the stage for a major licensing phenomenon. In their very few subsequent appearances in ''Li'l Abner'', shmoos are also identified by the [[U.S. military]] as a major threat to [[national security]].

==Analysis==
{{quote|The Shmoo, any literate person must know, was one of history's most brilliant [[utopia]]n satires.|''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Pakenham |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-09-29/entertainment/0209290383_1_al-capp-harlan-ellison-abner |title=Editor's Choice: The Short Life and Happy Times of the Shmoo, by Al Capp, with an introduction by Harlan Ellison |work=Baltimore Sun |date=2002-11-29 |accessdate=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Capp is at his [[allegorical]] best in the epics of the Shmoos, and later, the Kigmies", wrote comic strip historian [[Jerry Robinson]] (in ''The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art'', 1974). "Shmoos are the world's most amiable creatures, supplying all man's needs. Like a [[fertility]] myth gone berserk, they reproduced so prodigiously they threatened to wreck the economy"—if not [[Western culture|western civilization]] as we know it, and ultimately [[society]] itself.

Al Capp offered his version of the origin of the Shmoo in a wryly satirical article, "I Don't Like Shmoos", in ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' (June 1949):

{{quote|I was driving from New York City to my farm in [[New Hampshire]]. The top of my car was down, and on either side of me I could see the lush and lovely [[New England]] countryside... It was the good earth at its generous summertime best, offering gifts to all. And the thought that came to me was this: Here we have this great and good and generous thing—the Earth. It's eager to give us everything we need. All we have to do is just let it alone, just be happy with it.

Cartoonists don't think like people. They think in pictures. Little pictures that will fit into a comic strip. And so, in my mind, I reduced the Earth... down to the size of a small critter that would fit into the ''Li'l Abner'' strip—and it came out a Shmoo... I didn't have any message—except that it's good to be alive. The Shmoo didn't have any social significance; it is simply a juicy li'l critter that gives milk and lays eggs... When you look at one as though you'd like to eat it, it dies of sheer ecstasy. And if one ''really'' loves you, it'll lay you a [[cheesecake]]—although this is quite a strain on its li'l innards...

I thought it was a perfectly ordinary little story, but when it appeared in newspapers, all hell broke loose! ''Life'', in an editorial, hailed the Shmoo as the very symbol and spirit of [[free enterprise]]. ''Time'' said I'd invented a new era of enlightened management-employee relationship, (they called it ''Capp''-italism.) ''[[The Daily Worker]]'' cussed me out as a Tool of the Bosses, and denounced the Shmoo as the [[Opium of the People|Opium of the Masses...]]}}

Superficially, the Shmoo story concerns a cuddly creature that desires nothing more than to be a boon to mankind. Although initially Capp denied or avoided discussion of any satirical intentions ("If the Shmoo fits", he proclaimed, "wear it!"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Search Site |url=http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_2_urb-al-capp.html |title=Exile in Dogpatch: The Curious Neglect of Cartoonist Al Capp, City Journal, Spring 2010 |publisher=City-journal.org |date=1934-08-13 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was widely seen to be stalking bigger game [[subtext]]ually. The story has [[social]], [[ethical]] and [[philosophical]] implications that continue to invite analysis to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1WXKH5B_XUC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=shmoo+analysis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4PTGpTFDEU&amp;sig=Hq_NZ6RnoDKW-w8M1tjTIqUqkw4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3DxUS7j3GZP8tAPJ2aU1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAkQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=shmoo%20analysis&amp;f=false |title=Media Analysis Techniques, 3rd ed. |author=[[Arthur Asa Berger]] |publisher=Sage Publications, Inc |date=2004-07-15 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futurehi.net/archives/000127.html |website=Future Hi |title=Shmoo Technology |date=25 April 2004 |accessdate=2010-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027014715/http://www.futurehi.net/archives/000127.html |archivedate=2004-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iUoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=shmoo+meaning&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kJPxQlilwQ&amp;sig=wPmqhDdGvOoWeWl1tpK7xWl0ZyM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RzpUS_uWDougswOq9tXhAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=shmoo%20meaning&amp;f=false |title=Capp-italist Revolution: Al Capp's Shmoo Offers a Parable of Plenty |magazine=Life |date=20 December 1948 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.nc.us/books/books.cgi?theshortlife&amp;happytimesoftheshmoo |first=KNS |last=Maré |website=Mountain Area Information Network |year=2002 |title=''The Short Life &amp; Happy Times of the Shmoo'' by Al Capp; with a foreward by Harlan Ellison |accessdate=2012-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617090532/http://main.nc.us/books/books.cgi?theshortlife&amp;happytimesoftheshmoo |archivedate=2012-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~wright/SOC621/298lec4.pdf |title=Berkeley Sociology 298 Lecture 4: Class, Exploitation, Oppression; 5 March 2002 |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the remainder of his life, Capp was seldom interviewed without reference to the nature of the Shmoo story.

The mythic tale ends on a deliberately [[irony|ironic]] note. Shmoos are officially declared a menace, and systematically hunted down and slaughtered—because they were deemed "bad for business". The much-copied storyline was a [[parable]] that was interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the [[Cold War]]. Al Capp was even invited to go on a radio show to debate [[socialist]] [[Norman Thomas]] on the effect of the Shmoo on modern [[capitalism]].

"After it came out both the left and the right attacked the Shmoo", according to publisher [[Denis Kitchen]]. "[[Communists]] thought he was making fun of socialism and [[Marxism]]. The [[right wing]] thought he was making fun of capitalism and [[the American way]]. Capp caught flak from both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888467-1,00.html |title=Harvest Shmoon |magazine=Time |date=13 September 1948 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; For him it was an [[apolitical]] [[morality tale]] about [[human nature]]... I think [the Shmoo] was one of those bursts of genius. He was a genius, there's no question about that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1114 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070623103614/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=1114 |archive-date=June 23, 2007 |title=''Everything and the Kitchen Shmoo:'' Interview with Denis Kitchen, April 2003 |dead-url=yes |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shmoo inspired hundreds of "Shmoo clubs" all over North America. College students—who had made Capp's invented idea of the [[Sadie Hawkins dance]] a universally adopted tradition—flocked to the Shmoo as well. One school, the [[University of Bridgeport]], even launched the "American Society for the Advancement of the Shmoo" in early 1949.

Capp introduced many other allegorical creatures in ''Li'l Abner'' over the years—including '''[[Bald Iggles]], Kigmies, Nogoodniks, Mimikniks, the Money Ha-Ha, Shminks, Abominable Snow-Hams, Gobbleglops''' and '''Bashful Bulganiks''', among others. Each one highlighted another disquieting facet of human nature—but none have ever had quite the same cultural impact as the Shmoo. According to publisher Denis Kitchen: "For the rest of his career Capp got countless letters [from] people begging him to bring the Shmoo back. Periodically he would do it but each time it ended the same way—with the Shmoo being too good for humanity, and he had to essentially exterminate them again. But there was always one or two who would survive for future plot twists..."

==Etymology==
The actual origin of Capp's word "shmoo" has been the subject of debate by [[linguists]] for decades, leading to the misconception that the term was derived from "[[schmo]]" or "[[schmooze]]". However, "shmue" was a [[taboo]] [[Yiddish]] term for the [[uterus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6zPgjduXBcQC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=%22al+capp%22+yiddish+words&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Z7AHEHSII4&amp;sig=EcKDyys4rwnkrsnPiWEXz5huZ-4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result |title=Perspectives on American English |first=J. L. |last=Dillard |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1980 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of many Yiddish slang variations that would find their way into ''Li'l Abner''. Revealing an important key to the story, Al Capp himself wrote that the Shmoo metaphorically represented the limitless bounty of the earth in all its richness—in essence, [[Mother Nature]] herself. In Li'l Abner's words, "Shmoos ''hain't'' make believe. The hull [whole] earth is one!!"

==In science==
[[File:Shmoos s cerevisiae.jpg|thumb|''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' mating type '''a''' with shmoo responding to '''α'''-factor]]
The term "shmoo" has entered the English language, defining highly technical concepts in at least four separate fields of [[science]]:
* "[[Shmoo plot]]" is a technical term relating to the graphical display of test results in [[electrical engineering]], dating back at least to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5217603/ |title=The Sensitivity Function in Variability Analysis |first=Charles |last=Belove |journal=[[IEEE]] Transactions on Reliability |volume=R-15 |issue=2 |year=1966 |pages=70–76 |doi=10.1109/TR.1966.5217603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name most likely arose because the shape of the two-dimensional plots often resembled a shmoo. The term is also a verb: to "shmoo" means to run the test.
*In [[microbiology]], the shmoo's uncanny resemblance to budding [[mating of yeast|yeast]]—combined with its near-limitless usefulness—has led to the character's adoption as a mascot of sorts for scientists studying yeast as a [[model organism]] for [[genetics]] and [[cell biology]]. In fact, the cellular bulge that is produced by a [[haploid]] yeast cell as a response to a pheromone from the opposite mating type (either {{typo|a}} or α) is referred to as a "shmoo", because cells that are undergoing mating and present this particular structure resemble the cartoon character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcj.com/hoodedutilitarian/2010/12/strange-windows-keeping-up-with-the-goonses-part-3/#more-12736 |title=Strange Windows: Keeping up with the Goonses (part 3) |first=Alex |last=Buchet |date=18 December 2010 |website=The Hooded Utilitarian |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole process is known to biologists as "shmooing". Shmoos are essential; without them, we would have neither [[bread]] nor [[beer]]. The word "shmoo" has appeared in nearly 700 science publications since 1974; it is used in labs studying the bread- and beer-making species ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', (Source: ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine, November 2007).
*It has been used in discussions of [[socioeconomics]], for instance. In [[economics]], a "[[widget (economics)|widget]]" is any material good which is produced through labor (extracted, refined, manufactured, or assembled) from a finite resource—in contrast to a "shmoo", which is a material good that reproduces itself and is captured or bred as an economic activity (the original shmoo reproduces without requiring any material sustenance). "If shmoos really existed, they would be a '[[free good]]'." [[Erik Olin Wright]] uses the "parable of the shmoo" to introduce discussion of class structure and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzuLVijEFbgC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=parable+of+the+shmoo&amp;source=web&amp;ots=Vz0OSRE-gC&amp;sig=EzcNyRciPN7rxlHhM3ljUD0Z7tE |last=Wright |first=Erik Olin |authorlink=Erik Olin Wright |title=Class Counts: Comparative Studies in Class Analysis |year=1997 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Echinoderm]] biologists use "shmoo" (often spelled "schmoo") to refer to a very simple, highly derived, blob-shaped [[larva]] found in some [[sea urchin]]s (e.g. Wray 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory A. Wray |url=http://sysbio.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/3/308.short |title=Parallel Evolution of Nonfeeding Larvae in Echinoids |journal=Systematic Biology |volume=45 |issue=3 |year=1996 |pages=308–322 |doi=10.1093/sysbio/45.3.308 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
*In the field of [[particle physics]], "shmoo" refers to a high energy [[cosmic ray]] survey instrument utilized at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] for the [[Cygnus X-3]] Sky Survey performed at the LAMPF (Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility) grounds. Over one hundred white "shmoo" detectors were at one time sprinkled around the accelerator beamstop area and adjacent mesa to capture subatomic cosmic ray particles emitted from the [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]] [[constellation]]. The detectors housed [[scintillator]]s and [[photomultiplier]]s in an array that gave the detector its distinctive shmoo shape. The particle accelerator [[Tevatron]] at [[Fermilab]] houses superconducting magnets which produce ice formations that also resembled shmoos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Higgins |first=William S. |url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/cms/?pid=1000966 |title=Shmoos of the Tevatron |magazine=Symmetry |date=June 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The shmoo has been suggested as a hypothetical example of the potential [[falsifiability]] of [[natural selection]] as a key driving mechanism of [[biological evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;

An unexpected—and virtually unprecedented—postwar merchandising phenomenon followed Capp's introduction of the Shmoo in ''Li'l Abner''. As in the strip, shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950—including a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cover story. They also garnered nearly a full page of coverage (under "Economics") in ''Time's'' International section. Major articles also ran in ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'' and countless other publications and newspapers. Virtually overnight, as a ''Life'' headline put it, "The U.S. Becomes Shmoo-Struck!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;lpg=PA46&amp;dq=life+magazine+shmoo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zkzHLwx3TW&amp;sig=nVW43cHolwZepvLo6JSyEhIEUIQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Cq06TdTZFov2tgP8uLD9Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The U.S. Becomes Shmoo-Struck! |magazine=Life |date=20 September 1948 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There had never previously been anything like it. Comparisons to contemporary cultural phenomena are inevitable. But modern crazes are almost always due to massive marketing campaigns by large media corporations, and are generally aimed at the youth market.

Forty million people read the original 1948 Shmoo story, and Capp's already considerable readership roughly ''doubled'' following the overwhelming success of the Shmoo... |Denis Kitchen}}

The Shmoo was so popular it even replaced [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse]] as the face of the Children's [[United States Treasury security#Nonmarketable securities|Savings Bond]], issued by the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] in 1949. The valid document was colorfully illustrated with Capp's character, and promoted by the [[Federal Government of the United States]] with a $16&amp;nbsp;million advertising campaign budget. According to one article at the time, the Shmoo showed "Thrift, loyalty, trust, duty, truth and common ''cents'' [that] add up to aid to his nation". Al Capp accompanied President [[Harry S. Truman]] at the bond's unveiling ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fishinghistory.blogspot.com/2008/09/shmoo-part-i.html |title=The Shmoo Part I |first=T. E.

===Comic books and reprints===
''The Life and Times of the Shmoo'' (1948), a paperback collection of the original sequence, was a bestseller for [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] and became the first cartoon book to achieve serious literary attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,886491,00.html |title=The Miracle of Dogpatch |magazine=Time |date=27 December 1948 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distributed to small town magazine racks, it sold 700,000 copies in its first year of publication alone. It was reviewed coast to coast alongside [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s ''[[Crusade in Europe]]'' (the other big publication at the time).

The original book and its sequel, ''The Return of the Shmoo'' (1959), have been collected in print many times since—most recently in 2002—always to high sales figures.&lt;ref name="deniskitchen.com"/&gt;

There was also a separate line of [[comic book]]s, ''Al Capp's Shmoo Comics'' (featuring Washable Jones), published by the Capp family-owned [[Toby Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Steven |url=http://fourcolorshadows.blogspot.com/2012/05/super-shmoo-al-capps-shmoo-1949.html |title=Super Shmoo – Al Capp's Shmoo – 1949 |website=Four-Color Shadows |date=26 May 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comics historian and ''Li'l Abner'' expert [[Denis Kitchen]] recently edited a complete collection of all five original ''Shmoo Comics'', from 1949 and 1950. The book was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]] in 2008. Kitchen edited a second Shmoo-related volume for Dark Horse in 2011, on the history of the character in newspaper strips, collectibles and memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superitch.com/?p=11296 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716164811/http://superitch.com/?p=11296 |archive-date=2011-07-16 |title=The Oddly Compelling Interview: Denis Kitchen |date=6 August 2010 |website=I.T.C.H. |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animation and puppetry===
Shmoos were originally meant to be included in the 1956 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] ''[[Li'l Abner (musical)|Li'l Abner]]'' [[musical theatre|musical]], employing stage [[puppetry]]. The idea was reportedly abandoned in the development stage by the producers, however, for reasons of practicality. A variation of the character had earlier appeared as a [[marionette]] puppet on television. "Shmoozer", a talking shmoo with an anthropomorphic human body, was a recurring [[sidekick]] character on ''[[Fearless Fosdick]]'', a short-lived puppet series that aired on NBC-TV in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389616/epcast Fearless Fosdick (TV show) at IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Capp's death in 1979, the Shmoo gained its own [[Animated television series|animated series]] as part of ''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'' (which consisted of reruns of ''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' mixed with the Shmoo's own cartoons; the two pairs of characters didn't actually "meet"). The characters ''did'' meet, however, in the early 1980s Flintstones [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show]]''. The Shmoo appeared, incongruously, in the segment ''Bedrock Cops'' as a police officer alongside part-time officers [[Fred Flintstone]] and [[Barney Rubble]]. Needless to add, this Shmoo had little relationship to the ''L'il Abner'' character, other than a superficial appearance. A later [[Hanna-Barbera]] venture, ''[[The New Shmoo]]'', featured the character as an (inexplicably) shape-shifting mascot of Mighty Mysteries Comics, a group of teens who solve ''[[Scooby-Doo]]''-like mysteries. In this series the Shmoo could magically "morph" into any shape at will—like ''[[Tom Terrific]]''. None of these revisionist revivals of the venerable character was particularly successful.

==In popular culture==
*[[Frank Sinatra]], who was frequently spoofed by Al Capp in ''Li'l Abner'', has a line in the [[MGM]] musical ''[[On the Town (film)|On the Town]]'' (1949) about cops "multiplyin' like shmoos!"
*[[Florence King]] refers to owning a ceramic shmoo, which she threw out of her window after reading the books of [[Ayn Rand]].
*In the 1990 movie ''[[Book of Love (1990 film)|Book of Love]]'', the character Crutch wins a stuffed shmoo at a carnival.
*In the ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' TV episode "Who Knew?", [[Colonel Potter]] (played by [[Harry Morgan]]) displays an inflatable shmoo toy in his office that he purchased for his grandson.
*In [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[Known Space]]'' stories, an alien species known as the [[Bandersnatch (Known Space)|Bandersnatch]], also edible and intelligent, is described as being "smooth as a shmoo".
*In the novel ''[[The Forge of God]]'' by [[Greg Bear]], "Shmoo" is the name humans give to the race of [[robots]] that visits Earth, due to their similar shape.
*Some overlapping similarities exist between shmoos and [[tribble]]s—the multitudinous alien creatures featured in a 1967 TV episode from the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'']].  Like shmoos, tribbles ''also'' reproduced at such an alarming rate, they threatened ecological disaster. However, [[David Gerrold]]—who wrote "[[The Trouble With Tribbles]]"—drew his inspiration from an actual event: Australia's environmentally destructive [[rabbit]] overpopulation.
*The characters Gleep and Gloop—two protoplastic creatures from the [[Hanna-Barbera]] [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] [[animated cartoon]] series ''[[The Herculoids]]''—were clearly inspired by (and are sometimes mistaken for) shmoos.
*French artists [[Etienne Chambaud]] and David Jourdan have written "Economie de l'abondance ou La courte vie et les jours heureux", a new adventure of ''[[Jacques le fataliste et son maître]]'' from [[Diderot]], based on the discovery by Jacques of the Shmoo.
*In the 2006 film ''[[Lucky Number Slevin]]'', the character known only as "The Boss" (played by [[Morgan Freeman]]) refers to the Shmoo, recounting its original features as a source of plenty (in a monologue taken from an old ''Li'l Abner'' comic).
* The [[Marxist]] political philosopher [[Gerald Cohen]] used the story of the Shmoo to illustrate his objections to capitalism in an episode of ''Opinions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA9WPQeow9c |title=G. A. Cohen – Against Capitalism – Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-02-02 |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Simpsons]]'' uses a statue of the Shmoo to replace the giant phallic statue from the film [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|''A Clockwork Orange'']] in the episode "[[Treehouse of Horror XXV]]".
* In the North American version video game, ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' there is an enemy monster called "''Schmoo''" (in the original Japanese version it is an [[Obake]] called "''Kyuu''" a homage to the character in manga, [[Obake no Q-tarō]]) which is apparently a homage to The Shmoo. Schmoo appear in the Forbidden Library and killing one may result in obtaining the rare sword "''Crissaegrim''" (its rare item drop), one of the most powerful swords in the game.
*During the Soviet Union's blockade of [[West Berlin]], Germany in 1948, candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners from transport planes by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron. The commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting the inflatable shmoos as part of Operation: Little Vittles.  "When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted...."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Newsweek]]'', 11 October 1948&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shmoos invaded the [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]], as challenger [[Thomas Dewey]] accused incumbent [[Harry S. Truman]] of "promising everything, including the Shmoo!"&lt;ref&gt;''Newsweek'', 5 September 1948&lt;/ref&gt;
*Capp periodically reintroduced the Shmoos in ''Li'l Abner'', sometimes with significant variations. "Bad" Shmoos (called "Nogoodniks") debuted in a series of Sunday strips in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=34&amp;s=264&amp;ai=41615&amp;arch=y&amp;ssd=8/24/2002%2012:01:00%20PM |title=Bad Shmoos from The Scoop Archive, 24 August 2002 |publisher=Scoop.diamondgalleries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nasty cousin of the good-natured Shmoo, Nogoodniks were a sickly shade of green, and had "li'l red eyes, sharp yaller teeth, an' a dirty look". Frequently sporting [[5 o'clock shadow]]s, eye patches, scars, bandages and other ruffian attributes—they devoured "good" Shmoos, were the sworn enemies of "hoomanity", and wreaked havoc on Dogpatch.
*In the ABC sitcom ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'', Beverley Goldberg endearingly refers to her children as Shmoos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">'''Traditional transmission''' (also called '''cultural transmission''') is a design feature of [[language]] that the [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Charles F. Hockett]] developed to distinguish the features of human language from those of [[animal communication]]. He discovered thirteen features that all human languages have. Animals might communicate with some of the thirteen basic design features of language but never with all of them. Traditional transmission is exemplified by the fact that language is learned in [[social group]]s. Although there is disagreement about how much linguistic capability humans are born with, it is known that the only way that humans learn language and refine its use as they grow is in social settings.

'''Tragedy''' (from the {{lang-grc-gre|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | [[Middle English]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Middle French]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Latin]] ''tragoedia'' &lt; {{lang-grc|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Tragedy | page = 1637 | first = E | last = Klein | title = A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language | volume = II L–Z | publisher = Elsevier | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;}})  is a form of [[drama]] based on human [[suffering]] that invokes an accompanying [[catharsis]] or pleasure in audiences.{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1999 | p = 21 | loc = §2 | ps =: ‘two-fold mood[…] the strange mixture and duality in the affects of the [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] [[Cult of Dionysus|enthusiasts]], that phenomenon whereby pain awakens pleasure while rejoicing wrings cries of agony from the breast.  From highest joy there comes a cry of horror or a yearning lament at some irredeemable loss.  In those Greek festivals there erupts what one might call a [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] tendency in nature, as if it had cause to sigh over its [[Sparagmos|dismemberment]] into [[Individuation|individuals]]’.}}  While many [[culture]]s have developed forms that provoke this [[paradox]]ical response, the term ''tragedy'' often refers to a specific [[Poetic tradition|tradition]] of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 14–16}}  That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of [[cultural identity]] and historical continuity—"the [[Classical Athens|Greeks]] and the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]], in one cultural form; [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenes]] and [[Christian]]s, in a common activity," as [[Raymond Williams]] puts it.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | p = 16}}

From its origins in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] 2500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], as well as a large number of fragments from other poets; through its singular articulations in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Jean Racine]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]] to the more recent [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] tragedy of [[August Strindberg]]; [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Modernism|modernist]] meditations on death, loss and suffering; [[Heiner Müller|Müller's]] [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] reworkings of the tragic canon; and [[Joshua Oppenheimer]]'s incorporation of tragic pathos in his nonfiction film, ''[[The Act of Killing]]'' (2012), tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 13–84}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}  A long line of [[philosophers]]—which includes [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]],{{Sfn | Benjamin | 1998}} [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]]{{Sfn | Deleuze | Guattari | 1972}}—have analysed, speculated upon, and criticised the genre.{{Sfn | Felski | 2008 | p = 1}}{{Sfn | Dukore | 1974 | ps =: primary material.}}{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}

In the wake of Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make [[genre]] distinctions, whether at the scale of [[poetry]] in general (where the tragic divides against [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]). In the [[Modernity|modern]] era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, [[melodrama]], [[Tragicomedy|the tragicomic]], and [[epic theatre]].{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}{{Sfn | Pfister | 1977}}{{Sfn | Elam | 1980}}  [[Drama]], in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-[[Genre|generic]] [[deterritorialization|deterritorialisation]] from the [[Nineteenth century theatre|mid-19th century]] onwards. Both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Augusto Boal]] define their [[epic theatre]] projects ([[non-Aristotelian drama]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], respectively) against models of tragedy. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation.{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}

== Origin ==
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure]]
The word "tragedy" appears to have been used to describe different phenomena at different times. It derives from [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang |grc|τραγῳδία}}, [[sandhi|contracted]] from ''trag(o)-aoidiā'' = "[[goat]] [[Ode|song]]", which comes from ''tragos'' = "he-goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing" (''[[cf.]]'' "ode"). Scholars suspect this may be traced to a time when a goat was either the prize&lt;ref&gt;See [[Horace]], ''Epistulae'', II, 3, 220: "Carmino qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum".&lt;/ref&gt; in a competition of [[Greek dances|choral dancing]] or was that around which a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] danced prior to the animal's [[ritual]] [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}  In another view on the etymology, [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] (2nd–3rd century CE) says that the original form of the word was ''trygodia'' from ''trygos'' (grape harvest) and ''ode'' (song), because those events were first introduced during grape harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV1.p0071&amp;id=Literature.AthV1&amp;isize=M&amp;pview=hide%20 | first = Athenaeus | last = of Naucratis | title = The deipnosophists | publisher = Wisc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 335 BCE (long after the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]] of [[Classical Greece|5th-century]] [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] tragedy), [[Aristotle]] provides the earliest-surviving explanation for the origin of the [[drama]]tic [[The arts|art form]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', in which he argues that tragedy developed from the [[improvisation]]s of the leader of [[Greek chorus|choral]] [[dithyramb]]s ([[hymn]]s sung and danced in praise of [[Dionysos]], the god of wine and fertility):{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}
{{Quote |Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature. | Poetics IV, 1449a 10–15{{Sfn | Janko | 1987 | p = 6}}}}

In the same work, Aristotle attempts to provide a scholastic definition of what tragedy is:
{{Quote |Tragedy is, then, an enactment of a deed that is important and complete, and of [a certain] magnitude, by means of language enriched [with ornaments], each used separately in the different parts [of the play]: it is enacted, not [merely] recited, and through pity and fear it effects relief ([[catharsis]]) to such [and similar] emotions. | Poetics, VI 1449b 2–3&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Aristotle, Poetics, section 1449b | publisher = Tufts | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is some dissent to the dithyrambic origins of tragedy, mostly based on the differences between the shapes of their choruses and styles of dancing.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}} A common descent from pre-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] fertility and burial rites has been suggested.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] discussed the origins of Greek tragedy in his early book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872). Here, he suggests the name originates in the use of a chorus of goat-like [[satyr]]s in the original [[dithyramb]]s from which the tragic genre developed.

Scott Scullion writes:  {{quote|There is abundant evidence for tragoidia understood as "song for the prize goat". The best-known evidence is Horace, Ars poetica 220-24 ("he who with a tragic song competed for a mere goat"); the earliest is the Parian Marble, a chronicle inscribed about 264/63 BCE, which records, under a date between 538 and 528 BCE: "Thespis is the poet ... first produced ... and as prize was established the billy goat" (FrGHist 239A, epoch 43); the clearest is Eustathius 1769.45: "They called those competing tragedians, clearly because of the song over the billy goat"...&lt;ref&gt;Scott Scullion: "Tragedy and Religion: The Problem of Origins", in Gregory (ed.), A Companion to Greek Tragedy, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdTuNrx6z4oC&amp;q=%22There+is+abundant+ancient+evidence%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22There%20is%20abundant%20ancient%20evidence%22&amp;f=false p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 441}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pages = 3–5}}{{Sfn | Goldhill | 1997 | p = 54}}{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 206}}{{Sfn | Styan | 2000 | p = 140}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | p = 104 | ps =: “most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct”.}}  Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 32–3}}{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 444}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pp = 3–5, 33 | ps =: [although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honored their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]].

Athenian tragedies were performed in late March/early April at an annual state religious festival in honor of Dionysus. The presentations took the form of a contest between three playwrights, who presented their works on three successive days. Each playwright offered a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a concluding comic piece called a [[satyr play]].{{sfn|Lucas|1954|p=7}} The four plays sometimes featured linked stories. Only one complete trilogy of tragedies has survived, the ''[[Oresteia]]'' of Aeschylus. The Greek theatre was in the open air, on the side of a hill, and performances of a trilogy and satyr play probably lasted most of the day. Performances were apparently open to all citizens, including women, but evidence is scant.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The theatre of Dionysus at Athens probably held around 12,000 people.{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 33–34}}

All of the choral parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an ''[[aulos]]'') and some of the actors' answers to the chorus were sung as well. The play as a whole was composed in various verse metres. All actors were male and wore masks. A [[Greek chorus]] danced as well as sang, though no one knows exactly what sorts of steps the chorus performed as it sang. Choral songs in tragedy are often divided into three sections: strophe ("turning, circling"), antistrophe ("counter-turning, counter-circling") and epode ("after-song").

Many ancient Greek tragedians employed the ''[[Ekkyklema|ekkyklêma]]'' as a theatrical device, which was a platform hidden behind the scene that could be rolled out to display the aftermath of some event which had happened out of sight of the audience. This event was frequently a brutal murder of some sort, an act of violence which could not be effectively portrayed visually, but an action of which the other characters must see the effects in order for it to have meaning and emotional resonance. A prime example of the use of the ''ekkyklêma'' is after the murder of [[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]] in the first play of Aeschylus' ''Oresteia'', when the king's butchered body is wheeled out in a grand display for all to see. Variations on the ''ekkyklêma'' are used in tragedies and other forms to this day, as writers still find it a useful and often powerful device for showing the consequences of extreme human actions. Another such device was a crane, the [[mechane]], which served to hoist a god or goddess on stage when they were supposed to arrive flying. This device gave origin to the phrase "[[deus ex machina]]" ("god out of a machine"), that is, the surprise intervention of an unforeseen external factor that changes the outcome of an event.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BCE) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BCE, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek tragedy]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}  From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BCE-476 CE), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and even reached England.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 36, 47}}  While Greek tragedy continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BCE marks the beginning of regular [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].}}  [[Livius Andronicus]] began to write Roman tragedies, thus creating some of the first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write tragedies (though he was more appreciated for his comedies).{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  No complete early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three other early tragic playwrights—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 49}}

From the time of the empire, the tragedies of two playwrights survive—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}  Nine of [[Senecan tragedy|Seneca's tragedies]] survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 49–50}}  Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}

Seneca's tragedies rework those of all three of the Athenian tragic playwrights whose work has survived. Probably meant to be recited at [[elite]] gatherings, they differ from the Greek versions in their long declamatory, narrative accounts of action, their obtrusive moralising, and their bombastic rhetoric. They dwell on detailed accounts of horrible deeds and contain long reflective [[soliloquies]]. Though the gods rarely appear in these plays, ghosts and witches abound. Senecan tragedies explore ideas of [[Revenge tragedy|revenge]], the occult, the supernatural, suicide, blood and gore. The Renaissance scholar [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] (1484–1558), who knew both Latin and Greek, preferred Seneca to Euripides.

==Renaissance==
===Influence of Greek and Roman===
Classical Greek drama was largely forgotten in Western Europe from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 16th century. [[Medieval theatre]] was dominated by [[mystery play]]s, [[morality play]]s, [[farce]]s and [[miracle play]]s. In Italy, the models for tragedy in the later Middle Ages were Roman, particularly the works of Seneca, interest in which was reawakened by the [[Padua]]n [[Lovato Lovati|Lovato de' Lovati]] (1241–1309).&lt;ref name=lovati&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lovato-de-lovati/ "Lovati, Lovato de'"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His pupil [[Albertino Mussato]] (1261–1329), also of Padua, in 1315 wrote the [[Latin verse]] tragedy ''Eccerinis'', which uses the story of the tyrant [[Ezzelino III da Romano]] to highlight the danger to Padua posed by [[Cangrande della Scala]] of [[Verona]].&lt;ref name=muss&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/albertino-mussato// "Mussato, Albertino"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times, and may be considered the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work. The earliest tragedies to employ purely classical themes are the ''Achilles'' written before 1390 by [[Antonio Loschi]] of [[Vicenza]] (c.1365–1441) and the ''Progne'' of the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Gregorio Correr]] (1409–1464) which dates from 1428–29.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;"Drama", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', eleventh edition, Vol. '''VIII''', p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1515 [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]] (1478–1550) of Vicenza wrote his tragedy ''Sophonisba'' in the [[vernacular]] that would later be called [[Italian language|Italian]]. Drawn from [[Livy]]'s account of [[Sophonisba]], the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] princess who drank poison to avoid being taken by the Romans, it adheres closely to classical rules. It was soon followed by the ''Oreste'' and ''Rosmunda'' of Trissino's friend, the Florentine [[Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai]] (1475–1525). Both were completed by early 1516 and are based on classical Greek models, ''Rosmunda'' on the ''[[Hecuba]]'' of [[Euripides]],  and ''Oreste'' on the ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' of the same author; like ''Sophonisba'', they are in Italian and in blank (unrhymed) [[hendecasyllable]]s. Another of the first of all modern tragedies is ''A Castro'', by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] poet and playwright [[António Ferreira]], written around 1550 (but only published in 1587) in polymetric verse (most of it being blank hendecasyllables), dealing with the murder of [[Inês de Castro]], one of the most dramatic episodes in Portuguese history.   Although these three Italian plays are often cited, separately or together, as being the first regular tragedies in modern times, as well as the earliest substantial works to be written in blank hendecasyllables, they were apparently preceded by two other works in the vernacular: ''Pamfila'' or ''Filostrato e Panfila'' written in 1498 or 1508 by [[Antonio Cammelli]] (Antonio da Pistoia); and a ''Sophonisba'' by [[Galeotto del Carretto]] of 1502.&lt;ref name=hallam&gt;Henry Hallam (1837) [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8JMAAAAcAAJ ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries''].

From about 1500 printed copies, in the original languages, of the works of [[Sophocles]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and [[Euripides]], as well as comedic writers such as [[Aristophanes]], [[Terence]] and [[Plautus]], were available in Europe and the next forty years saw [[Humanism|humanists]] and poets translating and adapting their tragedies.  In the 1540s, the European university setting (and especially, from 1553 on, the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by scholars. The influence of Seneca was particularly strong in its humanist tragedy. His plays, with their ghosts, lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory, brought a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action to many humanist tragedies.

The most important sources for French tragic theatre in the Renaissance were the example of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and the precepts of [[Horace]] and [[Aristotle]] (and contemporary commentaries by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] and [[Lodovico Castelvetro]]), although plots were taken from classical authors such as [[Plutarch]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], etc., from the Bible, from contemporary events and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish).  The Greek tragic authors ([[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]) would become increasingly important as models by the middle of the 17th century. Important models were also supplied by the [[Spanish Golden Age]] playwrights [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Tirso de Molina]] and [[Lope de Vega]], many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage.

{{see also|English Renaissance theatre|Shakespearean tragedy|Revenge play|Domestic tragedy}}

The common forms are the:
* ''Tragedy of circumstance'': people  are born into their situations, and do not choose them; such tragedies explore the consequences of birthrights, particularly for monarchs
* ''Tragedy of miscalculation'': the [[protagonist]]'s error of judgement has tragic consequences
* ''[[Revenge play]]''

In English, the most famous and most successful tragedies are those of [[William Shakespeare]] and his [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] contemporaries. Shakespeare's tragedies include:
* ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''
* ''[[Coriolanus]]''
* ''[[Hamlet]]''
* ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''
* ''[[King Lear]]''
* ''[[Macbeth]]''
* ''[[Othello]]''
* ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''
* ''[[Timon of Athens]]''
* ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''
* ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''

A contemporary of Shakespeare, [[Christopher Marlowe]], also wrote examples of tragedy in English, notably:
* ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]''
* ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]''

[[John Webster]] (1580?–1635?), also wrote famous plays of the genre:
* ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''
* ''[[The White Devil]]''

===Opera===
Contemporary with Shakespeare, an entirely different approach to facilitating the rebirth of tragedy was taken in Italy.  [[Jacopo Peri]], in the preface to his ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' refers to "the ancient Greeks and Romans (who in the opinion of many sang their staged tragedies throughout in representing them on stage)."{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 22}}  The attempts of Peri and his contemporaries to recreate ancient tragedy gave rise to the new Italian musical genre of [[opera]]. In France, tragic operatic works from the time of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] to about that of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] were not called opera, but ''tragédie en musique'' ("tragedy in music") or some similar name; the ''tragédie en musique'' is regarded as a distinct musical genre.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Graham Sadler, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/44040 "Tragédie en musique"], Grove Music Online (subscription required). Accessed March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some later operatic [[composer]]s have also shared Peri's aims: [[Richard Wagner]]'s concept of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' ("integrated work of art"), for example, was intended as a return to the ideal of Greek tragedy in which all the arts were blended in service of the drama.{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 178}} [[Nietzsche]], in his ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) was to support Wagner in his claims to be a successor of the ancient dramatists.

==Neo-classical==
[[File:Talma as Nero in Britannicus by Racine - Delacroix - zeno.jpg|thumb|190px|French actor [[François-Joseph Talma|Talma]] as Nero in Racine's ''[[Britannicus (play)|Britannicus]].]]
For much of the 17th century, [[Pierre Corneille]], who made his mark on the world of tragedy with plays like ''Medée'' (1635) and ''Le Cid'' (1636), was the most successful writer of French tragedies. Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of ''Le Cid'' was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:
* The stage—in both comedy and tragedy—should feature noble characters (this would eliminate many low-characters, typical of the farce, from Corneille's comedies). Noble characters should not be depicted as vile (reprehensible actions are generally due to non-noble characters in Corneille's plays).
* Tragedy deals with affairs of the state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a work to be tragic, it need not have a tragic ending.
* Although [[Aristotle]] says that [[catharsis]] (purgation of emotion) should be the goal of tragedy, this is only an ideal. In conformity with the moral codes of the period, plays should not show evil being rewarded or nobility being degraded.

Corneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called "heroic comedies") and many continued to be successes, although the "irregularities" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticised (notably by [[François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac]]) and the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signalled the end of his preeminence.

[[Jean Racine]]'s tragedies—inspired by Greek myths, [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]—condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of [[pathos]] and amorous passion (like [[Phèdre]]'s love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century. Racine's two late plays ("Esther" and "Athalie") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women. Racine also faced criticism for his irregularities: when his play, ''[[Bérénice]]'', was criticised for not containing any deaths, Racine disputed the conventional view of tragedy.

==Bourgeois==
{{further|Bourgeois tragedy|Augustan drama}}

Bourgeois tragedy (German: Bürgerliches Trauerspiel) is a form that developed in 18th-century Europe. It was a fruit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterised by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play, [[George Lillo]]'s ''The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell'', which was first performed in 1731. Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''Miss Sara Sampson'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany.

==Modern development==
In [[modernist literature]], the definition of tragedy has become less precise. The most fundamental change has been the rejection of Aristotle's dictum that true tragedy can only depict those with power and high status. [[Arthur Miller]]'s essay "Tragedy and the Common Man" (1949) argues that tragedy may also depict ordinary people in domestic surroundings.{{sfn|Miller|1949|p=894}} British playwright [[Howard Barker]] has argued strenuously for the rebirth of tragedy in the contemporary theatre, most notably in his volume ''[[Arguments for a Theatre]]''. "You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies. After the musical, you're anybody's fool," he insists.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=13}} Critics such as [[George Steiner]] have even been prepared to argue that tragedy may no longer exist in comparison with its former manifestations in classical antiquity. In ''The Death of Tragedy'' (1961) George Steiner outlined the characteristics of Greek tragedy and the traditions that developed from that period. In the Foreword (1980) to a new edition of his book Steiner concluded that ‘the dramas of Shakespeare are not a renascence of or a humanistic variant of the absolute tragic model. They are, rather, a rejection of this model in the light of tragi-comic and “realistic” criteria.’ In part, this feature of Shakespeare’s mind is explained by his bent of mind or imagination which was ‘so encompassing, so receptive to the plurality of diverse orders of experience.’ When compared to the drama of Greek antiquity and French classicism Shakespeare’s forms are ‘richer but hybrid'.&lt;ref&gt;George Steiner, ''The Death of Tragedy'' [1961] (Oxford University Press, 1980; Yale University Press, 1996), p. xiii. See also George Steiner, ‘ “Tragedy.” Reconsidered.’ ''New Literary History'' 35:1 (Winter 2004), pp. 1-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
===Aristotle===
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his work [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] that
tragedy is characterised by seriousness and involves a great [[person]] who experiences a reversal of [[luck|fortune]] (''[[Peripeteia]]''). Aristotle's [[definition]] can include a change of fortune from bad to good as in the ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but he says that the change from good to bad as in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' is preferable because this induces [[pity]] and [[fear]] within the spectators. Tragedy results in a [[catharsis]] (emotional cleansing) or healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama.

According to [[Aristotle]], "the [[structure]] of the best tragedy should not be simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing [[fear]] and [[pity]]—for that is peculiar to this form of art."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Trans. W.H. Fyfe. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1932. Section 1452b&lt;/ref&gt;  This reversal of fortune must be caused by the tragic hero's ''[[hamartia]]'', which is often translated as either a [[character flaw]], or as a mistake (since the original Greek etymology traces back to ''hamartanein'', a sporting term that refers to an [[archery|archer]] or [[spear]]-thrower missing his target).&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Amelie Oksenberg. ''[[Literary criticism|Essays on Aristotle’s Poetics]]''. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1992. Page 178&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], "The misfortune is brought about not by [general] vice or depravity, but by some [particular] error or frailty."&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'', Aristotle&lt;/ref&gt;  The reversal is the inevitable but unforeseen result of some action taken by the hero. It is also a misconception that this reversal can be brought about by a higher power (e.g. the [[law]], the [[god]]s, [[destiny|fate]], or [[society]]), but if a character’s downfall is brought about by an external cause, [[Aristotle]] describes this as a [[misadventure]] and not a tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics''. Section 1135b&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the tragic hero may achieve some revelation or recognition ([[anagnorisis]]--"knowing again" or "knowing back" or "knowing throughout") about human fate, destiny, and the will of the gods. Aristotle terms this sort of recognition "a change from ignorance to awareness of a bond of love or hate."

In ''Poetics'', Aristotle gave the following definition in [[ancient Greek]] of the word "tragedy" (τραγῳδία):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', 1449b&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ἔστιν οὖν τραγῳδία μίμησις πράξεως σπουδαίας καὶ τελείας μέγεθος ἐχούσης, ἡδυσμένῳ λόγῳ χωρὶς ἑκάστῳ τῶν εἰδῶν ἐν τοῖς μορίοις, δρώντων καὶ οὐ δι᾽ ἀπαγγελίας, δι᾽ ἐλέου καὶ φόβου περαίνουσα τὴν τῶν τοιούτων παθημάτων κάθαρσιν."

which means ''Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete (composed of an introduction, a middle part and an ending), and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions.''

Common usage of tragedy refers to any story with a sad ending, whereas to be an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tragedy the [[narrative|story]] must fit the set of requirements as laid out by ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.  By this definition social drama cannot be tragic because the hero in it is a victim of circumstance and incidents that depend upon the society in which he lives and not upon the inner compulsions — psychological or religious — which determine his progress towards self-knowledge and death.&lt;ref&gt;Chiari, J. ''Landmarks of Contemporary Drama''. [[London]]: [[Jenkins (publisher)|Jenkins]], 1965. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exactly what constitutes a "tragedy", however, is a frequently debated matter.

According to Aristotle, there are four species of tragedy:

1. Complex, which involves [[Peripety]] and [[Discovery (fiction)|Discovery]]

2. Suffering, tragedies of such nature can be seen in the Greek mythological stories of Ajaxes and Ixions

3. Character, a tragedy of moral or ethical character. Tragedies of this nature can be found in Phthiotides and [[Peleus]]

4. Spectacle, that of a horror-like theme. Examples of this nature are [[Graeae|Phorcides]] and [[Prometheus]]

===Hegel===
[[G.W.F. Hegel]], the German philosopher most famous for his dialectical approach to [[epistemology]] and history, also applied such a methodology to his theory of tragedy. In his essay "Hegel's Theory of Tragedy," [[A.C. Bradley]] first introduced the English-speaking world to Hegel's theory, which Bradley called the "[[tragic collision]]", and contrasted against the Aristotelian notions of the "[[tragic hero]]" and his or her "hamartia" in subsequent analyses of the Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy and of Sophocles' Antigone.{{Sfn | Bradley | 2007 | pp = 114–56}} Hegel himself, however, in his seminal "[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]" argues for a more complicated theory of tragedy, with two complementary branches which, though driven by a single dialectical principle, differentiate Greek tragedy from that which follows Shakespeare. His later lectures formulate such a theory of tragedy as a conflict of ethical forces, represented by characters, in ancient Greek tragedy, but in Shakespearean tragedy the conflict is rendered as one of subject and object, of individual personality which must manifest self-destructive passions because only such passions are strong enough to defend the individual from a hostile and capricious external world:
{{Quote |The heroes of ancient classical tragedy encounter situations in which, if they firmly decide in favor of the one ethical pathos that alone suits their finished character, they must necessarily come into conflict with the equally [''gleichberechtigt''] justified ethical power that confronts them. Modern characters, on the other hand, stand in a wealth of more accidental circumstances, within which one could act this way or that, so that the conflict is, though occasioned by external preconditions, still essentially grounded in the character. The new individuals, in their passions, obey their own nature... simply because they are what they are. Greek heroes also act in accordance with individuality, but in ancient tragedy such individuality is necessarily... a self-contained ethical pathos...  In modern tragedy, however, the character in its peculiarity  decides in accordance with subjective desires... such that congruity of character with outward ethical aim no longer constitutes an essential basis of tragic beauty...{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | pp = 567–8}}}}

Hegel's comments on a particular play may better elucidate his theory: "Viewed externally, Hamlet's death may be seen to have been brought about accidentally... but in Hamlet's soul, we understand that death has lurked from the beginning: the sandbank of finitude cannot suffice his sorrow and tenderness, such grief and nausea at all conditions of life... we feel he is a man whom inner disgust has almost consumed well before death comes upon him from outside."{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | p = 572}}

==Similar dramatic forms in world theatre==
===Ancient Indian drama===
The writer [[Bharata Muni]], in his work on [[dramatic theory]] ''[[Natya Shastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Nātyaśāstra'', नाट्य शास्त्र, c. 200 BCE – 200 CE),{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 517}} identified several ''[[Rasa (art)|rasas]]'' (such as pity, anger, disgust and terror) in the emotional responses of audiences for the [[Sanskrit drama]] of [[History of India|ancient India]]. The text also suggests the notion of [[musical mode]]s or jatis which are the origin of the notion of the modern melodic structures known as [[raga]]s. Their role in invoking emotions are emphasised; thus compositions emphasising the notes [[gandhara]] or [[rishabha]] are said to provoke "sadness" or "pathos" (''karuna rasa'') whereas [[rishabha]] evokes heroism (''vira rasa''). Jatis are elaborated in greater detail in the text ''[[Dattilam]]'', composed around the same time as the ''Treatise''.

The celebrated ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]], ''[[Mahabharata]]'', can also be related to tragedy in some ways.  According to [[Hermann Oldenberg]], the original epic once carried an immense "tragic force".&lt;ref name = Oldenberg&gt;{{Citation | first = Hermann | last = Oldenberg | author-link = Hermann Oldenberg | year = 1922 | title = Das Mahabharata | place = Göttingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was common in Sanskrit drama to adapt episodes from the ''Mahabharata'' into dramatic form.

A '''turn construction unit''' (TCU) is the fundamental segment of speech in a conversation, as analyzed in [[conversation analysis]].

The idea was introduced in (Sacks, Schegloff, &amp; Jefferson 1974) and is meant to describe pieces of conversation which may comprise an entire turn. The end of a TCU, called a ''transition relevance place'' (TRP), marks a point where the turn may go to another speaker, or the present speaker may continue with another TCU.

== Turn Construction Unit (TCU) ==
A '''Turn Construction Unit (TCU)''' is a building component of a turn in a conversation. It is a unit of conversation that completes a communicative act.

=== Types of TCU ===

There are four types of TCU categorized by the roles they play in the utterance:

1. '''Lexical TCU''': e.g. "Yes", "There"&lt;br /&gt;
2. '''Phrasal TCU''': e.g. "In the basket", "out of here"&lt;br /&gt;
3. '''Clausal TCU''': e.g. "When I am free", "If I got the job"&lt;br /&gt;
4. '''Sentential TCU''': e.g. "I am working on my thesis", "He has got my car"

=== Criteria for Turn Construction Unit ===
A general rule to identify a TCU would be to look for a possible completion in an ongoing utterance. There are three criteria to determine what constitutes a TCU:&lt;br /&gt;
1. '''Intonationally Complete''': This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with the hint of a falling tone, signaling the possible ending of the utterance.&lt;br /&gt;
2. '''Grammatically Complete''': This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with a hint of its syntactic completeness, i.e. it signals the end of a sentence in terms of its grammatical structure.&lt;br /&gt;
3. '''Pragmatically Complete''': This means the utterance is seen to have possibly accomplished its purpose in response to the situation during a conversation. For example, the utterance "She is really" can be seen as pragmatically complete in response to the exclamation, "That girl is really pretty!", in the sense that it functions as an agreement to the previous comment.

Scholars in the field of conversation analysis have debated over the relative significance of the above three criteria as signifiers of the end of an utterance. There are, however, no conclusive answer to the discussion, and one can classify a TCU as such when observing either one (or more) of the above features.

== Transition Relevance Place (TRP)==
'''Transition Relevance Place''' (or TRP) is a point of possible completion (or potential end) of an utterance (hence a TCU) where speaker change is a possible next action.

'''Victorian burlesque''', sometimes known as '''travesty''' or '''extravaganza''',&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'',  "the various genre terms were always applied freely", and by the 1860s their use had become "arbitrary and capricious": see [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque,"] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}.  In an 1896 article on Burlesque in ''The Theatre'', the three terms are used interchangeably: see Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt; is a genre of theatrical entertainment that was popular in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England and in the New York theatre of the mid 19th century. It is a form of [[parody music|parody]] in which a well-known opera or piece of classical theatre or ballet is adapted into a broad comic play, usually a musical play, usually risqué in style, mocking the theatrical and musical conventions and styles of the original work, and often quoting or [[pastiche|pastiching]] text or music from the original work. Victorian burlesque is one of several forms of [[burlesque]].

Like [[ballad opera]], burlesques featured musical scores drawing on a wide range of music, from popular contemporary songs to operatic arias, although later burlesques, from the 1880s, sometimes featured original scores.  Dance played an important part, and great attention was paid to the staging, costumes and other spectacular elements of stagecraft, as many of the pieces were staged as [[extravaganza]]s.  Many of the male roles were played by actresses as [[breeches role]]s, purposely to show off their physical charms, and some of the older female roles were taken by male actors.

Originally short, one-act pieces, burlesques were later full-length shows, occupying most or all of an evening's programme. Authors who wrote burlesques included [[J. R. Planché]], [[H. J. Byron]], [[G. R. Sims]], [[F. C. Burnand]], [[W. S. Gilbert]] and [[Fred Leslie]].

==History==
Burlesque theatre became popular around the beginning of the [[Victorian era]]. The word "burlesque" is derived from the Italian ''burla'', which means "ridicule or mockery".&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', which defines the word as "That species of literary composition, or of dramatic representation, which aims at exciting laughter by caricature of the manner or spirit of serious works, or by ludicrous treatment of their subjects; a literary or dramatic work of this kind."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baldick&gt;Baldick, Chris. [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t56.e153 "Burlesque",] ''The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', Oxford University Press, 2008. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 16 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', Victorian burlesque was "related to and in part derived from [[pantomime]] and may be considered an extension of the introductory section of pantomime with the addition of gags and 'turns'."&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Erich Schwandt|Schwandt, Erich]] et al. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/04381 "Burlesque",] ''Grove Music Online''. Oxford Music Online, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another antecedent was [[ballad opera]], in which new words were fitted to existing tunes.&lt;ref&gt;Moss,  Harold Gene. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/830406 "Popular Music and the Ballad Opera",] ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', Vol. 26, No. 3 (Autumn, 1973), pp. 365–82, University of California Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1831 Royal Olympic.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Olympic Theatre]], for which Planché wrote ''Olympic Revels'']]
[[Lucia Elizabeth Vestris|Madame Vestris]] produced burlesques at the [[Olympic Theatre]] beginning in 1831 with ''Olympic Revels'' by [[J. R. Planché]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. ''A Book of Burlesque'' (London: Henry and Co., 1891), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  In these pieces, comedy stemmed from the incongruity and absurdity of the grand classical subjects, with realistic historical dress and settings, being juxtaposed with the everyday modern activities portrayed by the actors. For example, ''Olympic Revels'' opens with the gods of Olympus in classical Greek dress playing [[whist]].&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early burlesques, the words of the songs were written to popular music, as had been done earlier in ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.  Later in the Victorian era, burlesque mixed [[operetta]], [[music hall]] and [[revue]], and some of the large-scale burlesque spectacles were known as [[extravaganza]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[H. J. Byron]]'s 1863 ''Il trovatore'' parody, which was labelled "a burlesque extravaganza": see Marvin, Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), p. 42, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English style of burlesque was successfully launched in New York in the 1840s by the manager and comedian William Mitchell, who had opened his Olympic Theatre in December 1839. Like the London prototypes, his burlesques included characters with nonsensical names such as Wunsuponatyme and The King of Neverminditsnamia, and made fun of all kinds of music currently being presented in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Delmer D. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/779924 "Public Music Performances in New York City from 1800 to 1850",] ''Anuario Interamericano de Investigacion Musical'', Vol. 6 (1970), pp. 5–50, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike pantomime, which aimed at all ages and classes, burlesque was aimed at a narrower, highly literate audience;&lt;ref name=tls/&gt; some writers, such as the Brough brothers,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Barnabas Brough]] and his brother [[William Brough (writer)|William Brough]] wrote successful burlesques, sometimes jointly and sometimes alone. Their burlesques include ''The Enchanted Isle'' (1848), ''Medea'' (1856), ''Masaniello'' (1857), ''The Sphinx'' (1849) and ''The Last Edition of Ivanhoe'' (1850). See Dereli, Cynthia. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3577 "Brough, Robert Barnabas (1828–1860)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at a conservative middle class audience, and [[H. J. Byron]]'s success was attributed to his skill in appealing to the lower middle classes.&lt;ref name=tls&gt;Speaight, George. "All froth and bubble", ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 1 October 1976, p. 1233&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most frequent subjects for burlesque were the plays of Shakespeare and grand opera. From the 1850s onwards, burlesquing of Italian, French and, later in the century, German opera was popular with London audiences. [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]'' received their British premieres in 1855 and 1856 respectively; British burlesques of them followed quickly.  ''Our Lady of the Cameleon'' by [[Leicester Silk Buckingham]] and ''Our Traviata'' by William F. Vandervell (both 1857) were followed by five different burlesque treatments of ''Il trovatore'', two of them by H. J. Byron: ''Ill Treated Trovatore, or the Mother the Maiden and the Musicianer'' (1863) and ''Il Trovatore or Larks with a Libretto'' (1880).&lt;ref name=marvin&gt;Marvin,  Roberta Montemorra. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3878318 "Verdian Opera Burlesqued: A Glimpse into Mid-Victorian Theatrical Culture",] ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 1 (March 2003), pp. 33–66, Cambridge University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]], [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]], [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]], [[Charles Gounod|Gounod]], [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]], [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]] were burlesqued.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt; In a 2003 study of the subject, Roberta Montemorra Marvin noted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
By the 1880s, almost every truly popular opera had become the subject of a burlesque. Generally appearing after an opera's premiere or following a successful revival, they usually enjoyed local production runs, often for a month or longer. The popularity of stage burlesque in general and operatic burlesque in particular seems to have stemmed from the many ways in which it entertained a diverse group, and the manner in which it fed and fed on the circus-like or carnivalesque atmosphere of public Victorian London.&lt;ref name=marvin/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[W. S. Gilbert]] wrote five opera burlesques early in his career, beginning with ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'' (1866), the most successful of which was ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1870s, [[Lydia Thompson]]'s burlesque troupe, with [[Willie Edouin]], became famous for their burlesques, by such authors as [[H. B. Farnie]] and [[Robert Reece]], both in Britain and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, W. J., rev. J. Gilliland. "Thompson, Lydia (1838–1908)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shakespeare scholar [[Stanley Wells]] notes that although parodies of Shakespeare had appeared even in Shakespeare's lifetime, the heyday of Shakespearean burlesque was the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, Stanley. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2867735 "Shakespearian Burlesques",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 16, No. 1 (Winter, 1965), pp. 49–61, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011  {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wells observes that the typical Victorian Shakespeare burlesque "takes a Shakespeare play as its point of departure and creates from it a mainly comic entertainment, often in ways that bear no relation to the original play."&lt;ref name=Wells55&gt;Wells, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Wells gives, as an example of the puns in the texts, the following: Macbeth and Banquo make their first entrance under an umbrella.  The witches greet them with "Hail! hail! hail!": Macbeth asks Banquo, "What mean these salutations, noble thane?" and is told "These showers of 'Hail' anticipate your 'reign'".&lt;ref name=Wells55/&gt;  Musically, Shakespearean burlesques were as varied as the others of the genre.  An 1859 burlesque of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' contained 23 musical numbers, some from opera, such as the serenade from ''[[Don Pasquale]]'', and some from traditional airs and popular songs of the day including "[[Buffalo Gals]]", and "Nix my Dolly".&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs,  Henry E., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2869557 "The Bard Debunked",] ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 31, No. 2 (Summer, 1980), pp. 294–96, Folger Shakespeare Library in association with George Washington University, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faustupto.jpg|right|thumb|Sheet music from ''[[Faust up to Date]]'']]
The dialogue for burlesques was generally written in rhyming couplets, or, less often, in other verse forms, such as blank verse; it was notable for its bad [[pun]]s.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  For example, in ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888), a couplet reads:
:Mephistopheles: "Along the Riviera dudes her praises sing."
:Walerlie: "Oh, did you Riviera such a thing?"&lt;ref&gt;Lubbock, Mark.  [http://www.theatrehistory.com/british/lightopera001.html "History of British musical theatre",] ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'', New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962, pp. 467–68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Grove'', although "an almost indispensable element of burlesque was the display of attractive women dressed in tights, often in [[Breeches role|travesty roles]] ... the plays themselves did not normally tend to indecency."&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;  Some contemporary critics took a sterner view; in an 1885 article, the critic Thomas Heyward praised Planché ("fanciful and elegant") and Gilbert ("witty, never vulgar"), but wrote of the genre as a whole, "the flashy, 'leggy', burlesque, with its 'slangy' songs, loutish 'breakdowns', vulgar jests, paltry puns and witless grimacing at all that is graceful and poetic is simply odious. … Burlesque, insensate, spiritless and undiscriminating, demoralizes both the audience and the players. It debases the public taste."&lt;ref&gt;Heyward, Thomas, "Burlesque: Its Uses and Abuses", ''Tinsley's Magazine'', November 1885,  p. 477&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert expressed his own views on the worth of burlesque:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The question whether burlesque has a claim to rank as art is, I think, one of degree. Bad burlesque is as far removed from true art as is a bad picture. But burlesque in its higher development calls for high intellectual power on the part of its professors. [[Aristophanes]], [[Rabelais]], [[George Cruikshank|Geo Cruikshank]], the authors of the ''[[Rejected Addresses]]'', [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]], Planché were all in their respective lines professors of true burlesque.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W. S., Letter to Blanche Reives, ''quoted'' in "Modern Burlesque", ''The Orchestra'', November 1880, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 1859 [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]] burlesque ''Hi-A-Wa-Tha'', the American playwright Charles Walcot encapsulated the character of burlesque in the epilogue, addressed to the audience by [[Mrs. John Wood]] as Minnehaha:
:Ye who love extravaganza,
:Love to laugh at all things funny,
:Love the bold anachronism.
:And the work of paste and scissors,
:And "the unities" destruction,
:Nigger airs, old glees, and catches,
:Interspersed with gems of Op'ra,
:Jokes and puns, good, bad, and so-so, –
:Come and see this mutilation,
:This disgraceful Hiawatha, Mongrel, doggerel Hiawatha!&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Hewitt, Barnard. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3204686  "Mrs. John Wood and the Lost Art of Burlesque Acting",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 13, No. 2 (May, 1961), pp. 82–85, Johns Hopkins University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a similar vein, ten years later, Gilbert gave an English viewpoint on burlesque, in his epilogue to ''[[The Pretty Druidess]]'':
:So for burlesque I plead. Forgive our rhymes;
:Forgive the jokes you've heard five thousand times;
:Forgive each breakdown, cellar-flap, and clog,&lt;ref&gt;Three types of dance popular in burlesque&lt;/ref&gt;
:Our low-bred songs – our slangy dialogue;
:And, above all – oh, ye with double barrel –

[[File:The_High_Rollers_Extravaganza_Co._-_Bend_Her_-_c.1900.jpg|thumb|300px|American burlesque on ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben Hur]]'', c. 1900.]]
Actresses in burlesque would often play [[breeches role]]s, which were male roles played by women; likewise, men eventually began to play older female roles.&lt;ref name=Hall&gt;Hall, Edith. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30222456 "Classical Mythology in the Victorian Popular Culture"], ''International Journal of the Classic Tradition'', 1999, vol. 5, issue 3, pp. 336–366, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  These reversals allowed viewers to distance themselves from the morality of the play, focusing more on joy and entertainment than catharsis, a definitive shift away from neoclassical ideas.&lt;ref name=Hall /&gt;

The depiction of female sexuality in Victorian burlesque was an example of the connection between women as performers and women as sexual objects in Victorian culture.&lt;ref name="Buszek"&gt;Buszek, Maria-Elena.  [http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=394dd17c-6070-4982-a2c4-2e5723826ac7%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=5&amp;hid=115 "Representing 'Awarishness': Burlesque, Feminist Transgression, and the 19th-Century Pin-up"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''The Drama Review'', 1999, vol. 43, issue 4, pp. 141–162, accessed 4 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the history of theatre the participation of women on stage has been questioned.  Victorian culture viewed paid female performance as being closely associated with prostitution, “a profession in which most women in the theatre dabbled, if not took on as a primary source of income.”&lt;ref name=Buszek /&gt;

==Gaiety Theatre==
[[Image:Florence St. John.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Florence St. John]] in ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'']]
Burlesque became the specialty of London's [[Royal Strand Theatre]] and [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] from the 1860s to the early 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Sherson, Erroll, "Lost London Playhouses", ''The Stage'', 28 June 1923, p. 21, one of a series of articles later published in a 1925 book of same name.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1860s and 1870s, burlesques were often one-act pieces running less than an hour and using [[pastiche]]s and parodies of popular songs, opera [[aria]]s and other music that the audience would readily recognize. [[Nellie Farren]] starred as the Gaiety Theatre's "principal boy" from 1868, and [[John D'Auban]] choreographed the burlesques there from 1868 to 1891.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps". ''The Times'', 17 April 1922, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Biographical file for John D'Auban, list of productions and theatres, [[The Theatre Museum]], London (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward O'Connor Terry]] joined the theatre in 1876. Early Gaiety burlesques included ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'' (1868, by Gilbert), ''The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole'' (1877), ''Blue Beard'' (1882), ''Ariel'' (1883, by [[F. C. Burnand]]) and ''[[Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed]]'' (1883).

Beginning in the 1880s, when comedian-writer [[Fred Leslie]] joined the Gaiety, composers like [[Meyer Lutz]] and [[Osmond Carr]] contributed original music to the burlesques, which were extended to a full-length two- or three-act format.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatrical Humour in the Seventies", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 February 1914, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These later Gaiety burlesques starred Farren and Leslie.  They often included Leslie's [[libretti]], written under his pseudonym, "A. C. Torr",&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Maurice. 'The spark that lit the bonfire', in ''Gilbert and Sullivan News'' (London) Spring 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and were usually given an original score by Lutz: ''[[Little Jack Sheppard]]'' (1885), ''[[Monte Cristo Jr.]]'' (1886), ''Pretty Esmeralda'' (1887), ''[[Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim]]'' (1887),&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 14 and 55&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mazeppa'' and ''[[Faust up to Date]]'' (1888).  ''[[Ruy Blas and the Blase Roue|Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué]]'' (1889) made fun of the play ''[[Ruy Blas]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 57–58&lt;/ref&gt;  The title was a pun, and the worse the pun, the more Victorian audiences were amused.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Donald J., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3825187 "The Uses of Victorian Laughter",] ''Victorian Studies'', Vol. 10, No. 2 (December 1966), pp. 145–76,  Indiana University Press, accessed 2 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last Gaiety burlesques were ''[[Carmen up to Data]]'' (1890),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |title=Programme for ''Carmen up to Data'' |access-date=10 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210092757/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Archive/August/prog1detail1.htm |archive-date=10 December 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, pp. 254–55&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Cinder Ellen up too Late]]'' (1891), and ''Don Juan'' (1892, with lyrics by [[Adrian Ross]]).&lt;ref&gt;Hollingshead, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cuttings&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm Arthur Lloyd Music Hall site (on Gaiety) ''Cuttings''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104132022/http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Gaiety.htm |date=4 January 2008 }} accessed 01 Mar 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1890s, Farren retired, Leslie died, and musical burlesque went out of fashion in London, as the focus of the Gaiety and other burlesque theatres changed to the new genre of [[Edwardian musical comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gänzl, Kurt. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38669 "Edwardes, George Joseph (1855–1915)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 3 February 2011 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, [[Seymour Hicks]] declared that burlesque "is dead as a doornail and will never be revived." From her retirement, Nellie Farren endorsed this judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, W. Davenport. "Burlesque: Old ''v.'' New", ''The Theatre'', 1 March 1896, pp. 144–45&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Web archiving''' is the process of collecting portions of the [[World Wide Web]] to ensure the information is [[digital preservation|preserved]] in an [[archive]] for future researchers, historians, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decay of References to Web sites in Articles Published in General Medical Journals: Mainstream vs Small Journals|url = http://www.schattauer.de/index.php?id=1214&amp;doi=10.4338/ACI-2013-07-RA-0055|journal = Applied Clinical Informatics|date = 2013-01-01|volume = 4|issue = 4|doi = 10.4338/aci-2013-07-ra-0055|first = P.|last = Habibzadeh|first2 = Schattauer GmbH – Publishers for Medicine and Natural|last2 = Sciences|pmc = 3885908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web archivists typically employ [[web crawler]]s for automated capture due to the massive size and amount of information on the Web.  The largest web archiving organization based on a bulk crawling approach is the [[Internet Archive]] which strives to maintain an archive of the entire Web. 

The International Web Archiving Workshop (IWAW), begun in 2001, has provided a platform to share experiences and exchange ideas. The later founding of the [[International Internet Preservation Consortium|International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)]], in 2003, has greatly facilitated international collaboration in developing standards and open source tools for the creation of web archives. These developments, and the growing portion of human culture created and recorded on the web, combine to make it inevitable that more and more libraries and archives will have to face the challenges of web archiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:25658314|title=Truman, Gail. 2016. Web Archiving Environmental Scan. Harvard Library Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National library|National libraries]], [[national archive]]s and various consortia of organizations are also involved in archiving culturally important Web content. 

Commercial web archiving software and services are also available to organizations who need to archive their own web content for corporate heritage, regulatory, or legal purposes.

==Provenance and development==

Early practice of web archiving involved the highlighting of a "site of the week award" as a record for the contest. Besides that, another early practice was the professional link list (for example [[Amnesty International]]'s list of human rights groups) and ([https://www.yahoo.com Yahoo!]) directory and Open Directory Project.

In the mid-1990s, one of the more important listing sites of its kind continually updated an index of worthwhile website destinations organized by content category.

In 1998, Yahoo directory was considered to have made a significant contribution to emerging online library science, not only by its classification scheme but also by the means of the content "navigation" it developed.

Soliciting, evaluating, and categorizing websites – the large-scale collecting, hand-sorting, and display of websites – could be considered an original form of website analysis. The rise of the algorithmic search engine has largely led to the disappearance of such manual methods.

==Collecting the web==
Web archivists generally archive various types of web content including [[HTML]] web pages, [[style sheet (web development)|style sheets]], [[JavaScript]], [[digital image|images]], and [[digital video|video]]. They also archive [[metadata]] about the collected resources such as access time, [[MIME type]], and content length.  This metadata is useful in establishing [[Authentication|authenticity]] and [[provenance]] of the archived collection.

==Methods of collection==
{{see also|List of Web archiving initiatives}}

===Remote harvesting===
The most common web archiving technique uses [[web crawler]]s to automate the process of collecting [[web page]]s.  Web crawlers typically access web pages in the same manner that users with a browser see the Web, and therefore provide a comparatively simple method of remote harvesting web content. Examples of web crawlers used for web archiving include:
* [[Heritrix]]
* [[HTTrack]]
* [[Wget]]

There exist various free services which may be used to archive web resources "on-demand", using web crawling techniques. These services include the [[Wayback Machine]] and [[WebCite]].

===Database archiving===
Database archiving refers to methods for archiving the underlying content of database-driven websites. It typically requires the extraction of the [[database]] content into a standard [[logical schema|schema]], often using [[XML]]. Once stored in that standard format, the archived content of multiple databases can then be made available using a single access system. This approach is exemplified by the [http://deeparc.sourceforge.net/ DeepArc] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110227202744/http://www.nla.gov.au/xinq/ Xinq] tools developed by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] and the [[National Library of Australia]] respectively. DeepArc enables the structure of a [[relational database]] to be mapped to an [[XML schema]], and the content exported into an XML document. Xinq then allows that content to be delivered online. Although the original layout and behavior of the website cannot be preserved exactly, Xinq does allow the basic querying and retrieval functionality to be replicated.

===Transactional archiving===
Transactional archiving is an event-driven approach, which collects the actual transactions which take place between a [[web server]] and a [[web browser]]. It is primarily used as a means of preserving evidence of the content which was actually viewed on a particular [[website]], on a given date. This may be particularly important for organizations which need to comply with legal or regulatory requirements for disclosing and retaining information.

A transactional archiving system typically operates by intercepting every [[HTTP]] request to, and response from, the web server, filtering each response to eliminate duplicate content, and permanently storing the responses as bitstreams.

==Difficulties and limitations==

===Crawlers===
Web archives which rely on web crawling as their primary means of collecting the Web are influenced by the difficulties of web crawling:
* The [[robots exclusion protocol]] may request crawlers not access portions of a website.  Some web archivists may ignore the request and crawl those portions anyway.
* Large portions of a web site may be hidden in the [[Deep Web (search indexing)|Deep Web]].  For example, the results page behind a web form can lie in the Deep Web if crawlers cannot follow a link to the results page.
* [[Crawler trap]]s (e.g., calendars) may cause a crawler to download an infinite number of pages, so crawlers are usually configured to limit the number of dynamic pages they crawl.

However, it is important to note that a native format web archive, i.e., a fully browsable web archive, with working links, media, etc., is only really possible using crawler technology.

The Web is so large that crawling a significant portion of it takes a large amount of technical resources.  The Web is changing so fast that portions of a website may change before a crawler has even finished crawling it.

===General limitations===
Some web servers are configured to return different pages to web archiver requests than they would in response to regular browser requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Are current archiving systems reliable enough?|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|journal = International Urogynecology Journal|date = 2015-07-30|issn = 0937-3462|pages = 1-1|doi = 10.1007/s00192-015-2805-7|first = Parham|last = Habibzadeh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is typically done to fool search engines into directing more user traffic to a website, and is often done to avoid accountability, or to provide enhanced content only to those browsers that can display it.

Not only must web archivists deal with the technical challenges of web archiving, they must also contend with intellectual property laws.  Peter Lyman&lt;ref&gt;Lyman (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; states that "although the Web is popularly regarded as a [[public domain]] resource, it is [[copyright]]ed; thus, archivists have no legal right to copy the Web". However [[national library|national libraries]] in some countries &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|title=Legal Deposit {{!}} IIPC|website=netpreserve.org|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316103200/http://netpreserve.org/legal-deposit|archivedate=2017-03-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a legal right to copy portions of the web under an extension of a [[legal deposit]].

Some private non-profit web archives that are made publicly accessible like [[WebCite]], the [[Internet Archive]] or the [[Internet Memory Foundation]] allow content owners to hide or remove archived content that they do not want the public to have access to. Other web archives are only accessible from certain locations or have regulated usage. WebCite cites  a recent lawsuit against Google's caching, which [[Google]] won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.webcitation.org/faq |title=WebCite FAQ |work=Webcitation.org |author= |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2018}}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aspects of web curation==
Web curation, like any digital curation, entails:

* Certification of the trustworthiness and integrity of the collection content
* Collecting verifiable Web assets
* Providing Web asset search and retrieval
* Semantic and ontological continuity and comparability of the collection content

Thus, besides the discussion on methods of collecting the Web, those of providing access, certification, and organizing must be included. There are a set of popular tools that addresses these curation steps:

A suite of tools for Web Curation by [[International Internet Preservation Consortium]]:
* [[Heritrix]] – collecting Web asset
* [[NutchWAX]] – search Web archive collections
* [[Open source Wayback Machine]] – search and navigate Web archive collections using NutchWax
* [[International Internet Preservation Consortium#Web Curator Tool|Web Curator Tool]] – Selection and Management of Web Collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |title=Web Curator Tool |publisher=Webcurator.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104051655/http://webcurator.sourceforge.net/manuals.shtml |archivedate=2011-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other open source tools for manipulating web archives:
* [[WARC Tools]] – for creating, reading, parsing and manipulating, [[Web ARChive|WARC]] archives programmatically
* Google Search Tools – for indexing and searching full-text and metadata within web archives{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Free but not open source tools also exist:
* [[WARC Software Development Kit]] (WSDK) represents a set of simple, compact, and highly optimized Erlang modules to manipulate (create/read/write) the [[Web ARChive|WARC]] ISO 28500:2009 file format.
