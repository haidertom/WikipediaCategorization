[[File:Kvindernes Udstilling 1895.gif|thumb|Sketch of the Women's Exhibition from ''Illustreret Tidende'']]
The '''Women's Exhibition from the Past and Present''' ({{lang-da|'''Kvindernes Udstilling fra Fortid og Nutid'''}}) held in [[Copenhagen]] in 1895 was an art and culture exhibition for women from the [[Nordic countries]]. Inspired by the [[1893 Chicago's World's Fair|1893 World's Fair]] in [[Chicago]], it was designed to demonstrate how far Nordic women had advanced in the areas of education, employment and art. The first of its kind in Europe, it was considered a great success.&lt;ref name=eg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmagad.dk/udstillinger/1895-kvindernes-udstilling-iii.html|title=Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|author=Hald, Tonny|publisher=Emma Gad|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/170/bio/1294/%20-/|title=Emma Gad (1852 - 1921)|author=Ludvigsen, Christian|publisher=Kvinfo|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Kvindeudstillingens-gamle-og-nye-koekken.jpg|thumb|Old and new kitchen exhibit]]
The Chicago World's Fair in 1893 had impressed Danish visitors with its [[The Woman's Building (Chicago)|Woman's Building]] containing presentations of art and literature. [[Sophie Oxholm]] (1848–1935), who had visited the exhibition, was obviously impressed by the exhibition, especially the show of Danish needlework. On her return to Denmark, she immediately brought a number of influential women together with a view to arranging a Nordic women's exhibition in Copenhagen the following year. Despite initial enthusiasm, as a result of budgetary and management problems, it was announced in February 1894 that the exhibition would not be held until 1895.&lt;ref name=eg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmagad.dk/eg-omtale/omtale/2004-eva-lous.html|title=Eva Lous: Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|publisher=Emma Gad|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxholm, who experienced difficulty in managing the arrangements, gave up her position as head of the coordinating committee in early 1895. She was replaced by Bertha Buch of the [[Danish Women's Society|Women's Society]] but it was [[Emma Gad]] (1852–1921) who proved to be the most effective member. Appointed deputy chair, Gad managed to complete all the arrangements on time. These included selecting the site of the exhibition which was ultimately shared between the Industrial Association building (''Industriforeningen''), which had been built in connection with the 1872 Nordic Exhibition, and the premises of [[Den Frie Udstilling]]. It was therefore possible for the exhibition to open on 22 June 1895 in the presence of [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise]].&lt;ref name=eg/&gt;

==Exhibition==
[[File:Den-groenlandske-Afdeling-paa-Kvindeudstillingen enhanced.jpg|thumb|The Greenland exhibit]]
In addition to exhibits from Denmark, the exhibition contained areas specifically dedicated to the Danish provinces and overseas territories ([[Faroe Islands]], [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Danish West Indies]]) as well as to Norway and Sweden. There are records of the 2,415 exhibits covering painting, curiosities (including items associated with celebrated women), arts and crafts, costumes, jewellery (including gold- and silverware), literature (manuscripts, journals and books) and appliances. There were also separate listings of exhibits relating to housekeeping, philanthropy, hygiene, education, household crafts (spinning and weaving, leather, wood, embroidery, silk painting, and [[whitework]]), music and art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kb.dk/e-mat/dod/112308017118.pdf|title=Fortegnelse over Kvindernes Udstilling 1895|publisher=Nielsen &amp; Lydiche|year=1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Den Frie Udstilling building, there was a separate inventory of 301 artworks, paintings and sculptures, listed by artist.&lt;ref name=frie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kunstbib.dk/samlinger/udstillingskataloger/samlingen/000084459|title=Kunst: Den frie Udstillings bygning|publisher=Nielsen &amp; Lydiche|year=1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key organizers==
The two women who were instrumental in organizing the exhibition were Sophie Oxholm and, above all, Emma Gad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/49591|title=Kvinnornas utställning i Köpenhamn|publisher=''Idun'' (Årg. 8, N:r 26)|date=28 June 1895|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcome==
The Women's Exhibition was a great success. Not only was it appreciated in Denmark and beyond, it made a substantial profit. Gad had hoped the money could be used for an independent "Women's Building" (''Kvindernes Bygning'') with a meeting room, reading room, restaurant and accommodation for women from the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvindernesbygning.dk/|title=Kvindernes Bygning|publisher=Kvindernes Bygning|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work did not begin on the building until 1929. It was completed in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvindernesbygning.dk/historie|title=Kvindernes Bygnings historie|publisher=Kvindernes Bygning|accessdate=12 March 2018 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;DIV ALIGN="justify"&gt;
'''50 Moganshan Road''' ({{zh|s=莫干山路50号}}) or "'''M50'''" is a [[contemporary art]] district in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], that houses a thriving community of more than a hundred artists whose studios are open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artspeakchina.org/mediawiki/index.php/Moganshan_Lu_%E8%8E%AB%E5%B9%B2%E5%B1%B1%E8%B7%AF Moganshan Lu] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214100737/http://www.artspeakchina.org/mediawiki/index.php/Moganshan_Lu_%E8%8E%AB%E5%B9%B2%E5%B1%B1%E8%B7%AF |date=2011-02-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lonely-planet"&gt;{{cite book| first=Christopher| last=Pitts| title=Pocket Shanghai | publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]| isbn=978-1-74179-963-7 | date=April 2013| edition=3rd | pages=86–87 | chapter=Top Sights: M50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often compared with New York's [[SoHo]] and Beijing's [[798 Art Zone]].&lt;ref name="chinaart"&gt;[http://www.chinaartnetworks.com/feature/wen21.shtml Shanghai SoHo--50 Moganshan Road] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820131527/http://www.chinaartnetworks.com/feature/wen21.shtml |date=2010-08-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The art quarter has become a popular cultural attraction for local and international visitors alike, and was named among the top ten things to do in Shanghai by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/travel/cityguide/article/0,31489,1851908_1851830_1851818,00.html Shanghai: 10 Things to Do], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The name refers to its actual address in Shanghai, and is often shortened to M50 or Moganshan Road.  It is tucked away in an old industrial area along the [[Suzhou Creek]].  The art quarter is located in industrial and residential [[Putuo District, Shanghai|Putuo District]], but conveniently close to downtown [[Jing'an District]].

==History==
50 Moganshan Road was once the Chunming Slub Mill.  The art scene was started in 2000 by local artist Xue Song who was initially attracted by the cheap rent of the disused industrial space. Other artists including Ding Yi, Qu Fengguo, and Wang Xingwei, soon followed.&lt;ref name="artzine"&gt;[http://www.artzinechina.com/display.php?a=81 Shanghai’s Blossoming Arts District] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128020315/http://www.artzinechina.com/display.php?a=81 |date=2012-01-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the quarter’s former factories and warehouses have been converted into art galleries, artists’ studios, design agencies and other visual art and cultural businesses of various sizes.  The land and buildings are still owned by Shangtex, the state-owned textile group that operated the now defunct factory.&lt;ref name="chinaart"/&gt;

==Artists and galleries==
M50 hosts over 120 galleries and art studios.  Some of Shanghai's best known artists work here, including [[Zhou Tiehai]], [[Ding Yi (artist)|Ding Yi]], [[Yelan (artist)|Yelan]], [[Xu Zhen (artist)|Xu Zhen]] and the media art collective [[Liu Dao]]. Galleries include [[ShanghART]], [[EastLink Gallery]], [[island6]], [[Pantocrator Gallery]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://pantocratorgallery.com/ Pantocrator Gallery].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Biz Art]].&lt;ref name="artzine"/&gt;

==Transportation==
The closest [[Shanghai Metro]] station in the vicinity of M50 is [[Jiangning Road Station]] (on [[Line 13, Shanghai Metro|Line 13]]), followed by [[Zhongtan Road Station]] (on [[Line 3, Shanghai Metro|Line 3]] and [[Line 4, Shanghai Metro|Line 4]]).

'''Aestheticism''' (also the '''Aesthetic Movement''') is an intellectual and [[art movement]] supporting the emphasis of [[aesthetic]] values more than social-political themes for [[literature]], [[fine art]], [[music]] and other [[art]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Fargis|title=The New York Public Library Desk Reference - 3rd Edition|year=1998|publisher=Macmillan General Reference|pages=261|isbn=0-02-862169-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Denney, Colleen. [https://books.google.com/books?id=RvTZrnmy5RoC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=%22Aesthetic+movement%22+swinburne&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fQGt-5H3y4&amp;sig=Ir3QCh29f7c926rkx620LbcB5fs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7kjKSuy9BNDdlAebobGSAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Aesthetic%20movement%22%20swinburne&amp;f=false "At the Temple of Art: the Grosvenor Gallery, 1877-1890"], Issue 1165, p. 38, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-8386-3850-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning&amp;nbsp;— "art for art's sake". It was particularly prominent in Europe during the 19th century, supported by notable figures such as [[Walter Pater]] and [[Oscar Wilde]], but contemporary critics are also associated with the movement, such as [[Harold Bloom]], who has recently argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works, which he believes has been a growing problem in humanities departments over the 20th century. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the 19th century, it was related to other movements such as [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] or [[Decadent movement|decadence]] represented in France, or [[decadentism]]o represented in Italy, and may be considered the British version of the same style.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Aesthetic literature==
The British decadent writers were much influenced by the [[Oxford]] professor [[Walter Pater]] and his essays published during 1867–68, in which he stated that life had to be lived intensely, with an ideal of beauty.  His text ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'' (1873) was very well regarded by art-oriented young men of the late 19th century. Writers of the [[Decadent movement]] used the slogan "[[Art for Art's Sake]]" (''L'art pour l'art''), the origin of which is debated. Some claim that it was invented by the philosopher [[Victor Cousin]], although [[Angela Leighton]] in the publication ''On Form: Poetry, Aestheticism and the Legacy of a Word'' (2007) notes that the phrase was used by [[Benjamin Constant]] as early as 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Angela Leighton (2007) 32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally accepted to have been promoted by [[Théophile Gautier]] in France, who interpreted the phrase to suggest that there was not any real association between art and [[morality]].

[[Image:Design for an Aesthetic theatrical poster.png|thumb|left|300px|One of many ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoons about æsthetes]]
The artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages. As a consequence, they did not accept [[John Ruskin]],  [[Matthew Arnold]], and [[George MacDonald]]'s conception of art as something moral or useful, "Art for truth's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Raeper, William (1987) George MacDonald, p. 183. Tring, Herts., and Batavia, IL: Lion Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they believed that Art did not have any [[didactic]] purpose; it only needed to be beautiful. The Aesthetes developed a cult of beauty, which they considered the basic factor of art. Life should copy Art, they asserted. They considered nature as crude and lacking in design when compared to art. The main characteristics of the style were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, great use of symbols, and [[Synesthesia|synaesthetic]]/[[ideasthesia|Ideasthetic]] effects—that is, correspondence between words, colours and music. Music was used to establish mood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Predecessors of the Aesthetics included [[John Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], and some of the [[Pre-Raphaelite]]s who themselves were a legacy of the Romantic spirit. There are a few significant continuities between the Pre-Raphaelite philosophy and that of the Aesthetes: Dedication to the idea of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’; admiration of, and constant striving for, beauty; escapism through visual and literary arts; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media. This final idea is promoted in the poem ''L’Art'' by [[Théophile Gautier]], who compared the poet to the sculptor and painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Aesthetic Movement in English Literature|last=McMullen|first=Lorraine|publisher=Bytown Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Ottawa, ON|pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]] are most strongly associated with Aestheticism. However, their approach to Aestheticism did not share the creed of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’ but rather “a spirited reassertion of those principles of colour, beauty, love, and cleanness that the drab, agitated, discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reassertion of beauty in a drab world also connects to Pre-Raphaelite escapism in art and poetry.

In Britain the best representatives were [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], both influenced by the French Symbolists, and [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The style and these poets were satirised by [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s comic opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' and other works, such as [[F. C. Burnand]]'s drama ''[[The Colonel (play)|The Colonel]]'', and in comic magazines such as ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]],'' particularly in works by George Du Maurier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=YgrdCQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=michele%20mendelssohn&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Henry James, Oscar Wilde and Aesthetic Culture|last=Mendelssohn|first=Michèle|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0748623853|location=|pages=22–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compton Mackenzie]]'s novel ''[[Sinister Street]]'' makes use of the type as a phase through which the protagonist passes as he is influenced by older, decadent individuals. The novels of [[Evelyn Waugh]], who was a young participant of aesthete society at Oxford, describe the aesthetes mostly satirically, but also as a former participant. Some names associated with this assemblage are [[Robert Byron]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Harold Acton]], [[Nancy Mitford]], [[A.E. Housman]] and [[Anthony Powell]].

==Aesthetic visual arts==

Artists associated with the Aesthetic style include Simeon Solomon, [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[Aubrey Vincent Beardsley|Aubrey Beardsley]]. Although the work of [[Edward Burne-Jones]] was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] which promoted the movement, it also contains narrative and  conveys moral or sentimental messages hence it falls outside the given definition.

==Aesthetic Movement decorative arts==
[[File:Florian Papp Aesthetic Exhibition.jpg|thumb|Aesthetic Movement antiques at [[Florian Papp]], New York City]]
The primary element of Decorative Art is utility. The maxim "art for art's sake", identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the Aesthetic Movement, especially [[fine art]], cannot apply in this context. Decorative art must first have utility, but may also be beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Dresser]]. ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862.&lt;/ref&gt; Decorative art is dissociated from fine art.&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated London News'' LXXXI, Saturday, August 12, 1882, p.175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important elements of the Aesthetic Movement have been identified as Reform and Eastern Art.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Morley. ''Reform and Eastern Art'' Decorative Arts Society Journal, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Government Schools of Design were founded from 1837 onwards in order to improve the design of British goods. Following the Great Exhibition of 1851 efforts were intensified and Oriental objects purchased for the schools teaching collections. [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]], architect and Orientalist was requested to set out key principles of design and these became not only the basis of the schools teaching but also the propositions which preface ''The Grammar of Ornament'' (1856), which is still regarded as the finest systematic study or practical sourcebook of historic world ornament.

Jones identified the need for a new and modern style that would meet the requirements of the modern world, rather than the continual re-cycling of historic styles, but saw no reason to reject the lessons of the past. [[Christopher Dresser]], a student and later Professor at the school  worked with Owen Jones on ''The Grammar of Ornament'', as well as on the 1863 decoration of The Oriental Courts (Chinese, Japanese, and Indian) at the South Kensington Museum, advanced the search for a new style with his two publications ''The Art of Decorative Design'' 1862, and ''Principles of Design'' 1873.

Production of Aesthetic style furniture was limited to approximately the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Aesthetic style furniture is characterized by several common themes:
* [[Ebonized]] wood with gilt highlights.
* Far Eastern influence.
* Prominent use of nature, especially flowers, birds, ginkgo leaves, and peacock feathers.
* Blue and white on [[porcelain]] and other fine china.

Ebonized furniture means that the wood is painted or stained to a black ebony finish. The furniture is sometimes completely ebony-colored. More often however, there is gilding added to the carved surfaces of the feathers or stylized flowers that adorn the furniture.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

As aesthetic movement decor was similar to the corresponding writing style in that it was about sensuality and nature, nature themes often appear on the furniture. A typical aesthetic feature is the gilded carved flower, or the stylized peacock feather. Colored paintings of birds or flowers are often seen. Non-ebonized aesthetic movement furniture may have realistic-looking three-dimensional-like renditions of birds or flowers carved into the wood.

Contrasting with the ebonized-gilt furniture is use of blue and white for porcelain and china. Similar themes of peacock feathers and nature would be used in blue and white tones on dinnerware and other crockery. The blue and white design was also popular on square porcelain tiles. It is reported that [[Oscar Wilde]] used aesthetic decorations during his youth. This aspect of the movement was also satirised by ''Punch'' magazine and in ''Patience''.

In 1882 Oscar Wilde visited Canada, where he toured the town of Woodstock, Ontario and gave a lecture on May 29 titled "The House Beautiful".&lt;ref&gt;O'brien (1982) 114.&lt;/ref&gt; This particular lecture featured the early Aesthetic art movement, also known as the "Ornamental Aesthetic" art style, where local flora and fauna were celebrated as beautiful and textured, layered ceilings were popular. An example of this can be seen in [[Annandale National Historic Site]], located in Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada. The house was built in 1880 and decorated by Mary Ann Tillson, who happened to attend Oscar Wilde's lecture in Woodstock, and was influenced by it. Since the Aesthetic art movement was only prevalent from about 1880 until about 1890, there are not many surviving examples of this particular stylem but one such example is [[18 Stafford Terrace]], London, which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted the principles of Aesthetics.

[[File:The mmuo of a girl.jpg|thumb|An Agbogho Mmuo and two attendees]]
'''Agbogho Mmuo''', or '''Maiden [[Igbo mythology|Spirits]]''' are annual performances held during the [[dry season]] in the [[Nri-Igbo|Nri]]-[[Awka]] area in the northern part of the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]s' traditional territory. Performed only by men wearing [[African traditional masks|masks]], the masquerades imitate the character of [[adolescence|adolescent]] girls, exaggerating the girls' beauty and movements. The performance is always accompanied by [[Igbo music|musicians]] who sing and play tributes to both real and spirit maidens.

The performances showcase an ideal image of an Igbo maiden. This ideal is made up by the smallness of a young girl’s features and the whiteness of her complexion, which is an indication that the mask is a spirit. This whiteness is created using a chalk substance used for ritually marking the body in both West Africa and the [[African Diaspora]]. The chalky substance is also used in [[Uli (design)|uli design]], created and exhibited on the skin of Igbo women. Most maiden spirit mask are decorated with representations of hair combs, and other objects, modeled after late 19th-century ceremonial hairstyles. These hairstyles include elaborate coiffures and crests which intend to add beauty to the mask.

This art style is featured in the book [[Purple Hibiscus]] written by [[Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]].

'''Applied aesthetics''' is the application of the branch of philosophy of aesthetics to cultural constructs.
{{TOC right}}

==Architecture and interior design==

Although structural integrity, cost, the nature of building materials, and the functional utility of the building contribute heavily to the design process, architects can still apply aesthetic considerations to buildings and related [[architecture|architectural]] structures. Common aesthetic design principles include ornamentation, edge delineation, texture, flow, solemnity, symmetry, color, granularity, the interaction of sunlight and shadows, transcendence, and harmony.

[[Interior design]]ers, being less constrained by structural concerns, have a wider variety of applications to appeal to aesthetics. They may employ color, color harmony, wallpaper, ornamentation, furnishings, fabrics, textures, lighting, various floor treatments, as well as adhere to aesthetic concepts such as [[feng shui]].

==Digital art==

A new art form struggling for acceptance is [[digital art]], a by-product of computer programming that raises new questions about what truly constitutes art.  Although paralleling many of the aesthetics in traditional media, digital art can additionally draw upon the aesthetic qualities of cross-media tactile relationships; interactivity; autonomous generativity; complexity and interdependence of relationships; suspense; and playfulness.

Artists working in this type of art are often forced to justify their use of a computer rather than a traditional medium, leading to, like the debate over Warhol's "Brillo Pad Boxes", a question of what constitutes art.

The criticisms of digital art are many. For example, graphics programs allow perfect shading to be achieved with little to no effort. In other types of programs, there is a sense that because of the variety of tools, filters, distortions, etc., that an artist has a veritable image factory at their disposal. The various criticisms ultimately come down to the issue of "what effort is the artist putting into their work?"

The 3d art community frequently references that while the programs they utilize render and shade the objects, their efforts are more akin to the sculptor or architect, presenting an aesthetically arranged, lighted, and textured scene. The users of the other programs such as Photoshop or Gimp point out that while they may have many tools at their disposal, the art itself must be that much more detailed and imaginative to stand out. In both cases there is the challenge of overcoming the barriers of limited technology and the lack of direct contact with one's medium.

==Education and social sciences==

Educators are also interested in how aesthetic designs influence the ways that students think and learn. Some historical figures like [[John Dewey]] have approached education through aesthetics. More recently, Elliot Eisner and jan jagodzinski have reopened the debate. Other researchers with [[postmodern]] or [[poststructural]] influences have done the same, these include Cleo H. Cherryholmes and [[Michel Foucault]]. Aesthetics in education has been linked to [[pragmatism]] as well as other areas of curriculum development and implementation.

See ''Understanding Curriculum," Chapter 11, Understanding Curriculum as Aesthetic Text, by William F. Pinar, William M. Reynolds, Patrick Slattery and Peter Taubman (1995) for more information.

==Fashion design==

[[Fashion design]]ers use a variety of techniques to allow people to express the truth about their unconscious minds by way of their clothing. To create wearable personality designers use fabric, cut, colour, scale, references to the past, texture, color harmony, distressing, transparency, insignia, accessories, beading and embroidery.
It is also used to find the average size of things, to make a product suitable for a high number of customers.

==Film, television, and video==

[[Film]] combines many diverse disciplines, each of which may have their own rules of aesthetics. The aesthetics of [[cinematography]] are closely related to still [[photography]], but the movement of the subject(s), or the camera and the intensities, colors, and placement of the [[lighting]] are highly important. [[Sound recording]], editing, and mixing are other, highly important areas of film, often closely related with the [[Film score|musical score]]. As in [[Theatre]], [[art direction]], in the design of the sets and shooting locations also applies, as well as [[costume design]] and [[makeup]]. All of these disciplines are closely inter-twined and must be brought together by the aesthetic sensibilities of the [[Film director|director]].

[[Montage sequence|Montage]], or editing is probably the one discipline unique to film, video, and television. The timing, rhythm and progression of shots form the ultimate composition of the film. This procedure is one of the most critical element of [[post production]], and incorporates sound editing and mixing, as well as the design and execution of digital [[special effects]].

In the case of a [[video installation]], the method of presentation becomes critical. The work may be screened on a simple [[video monitor|monitor]], projected on a wall or other surface, or incorporated into a larger sculptural installation. A video installation may also involve sound, with similar considerations to be made based on speaker design and placement, volume, and tone.

==Gastronomy==

{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}
{{Original research|section|date=December 2007}}
Although [[culinary|food]] is a basic and frequently experienced commodity, careful attention to the aesthetic possibilities of foodstuffs can turn eating into [[gastronomy]]. Chefs inspire our aesthetic enjoyment through the visual sense using colour and arrangement; they inspire our senses of taste and smell using [[spices]], diversity/contrast, anticipation, seduction, and decoration/garnishes. In regard to [[drinking water]], there are formal criteria for aesthetic value including [[odour]], [[colour]], [[total dissolved solids]] and clarity. There are numerical standards in the [[United States|U.S.]] for aesthetic acceptability of these parameters.

Note, however, a use of a word translated to "culinary" in Adorno's aesthetics. Adorno distinguishes between technically accurate and "beautiful" musical interpretation, and an interpretation higher which brings out the "truth" in the musical text: interpretations more rehearsed, with more time for rehearsal, but which might sound strange to audiences pandered-to by popular conductors (perhaps in the way Glenn Gould enstranges the music of Beethoven).

Unfortunately for the ordinary reader of Adorno, this isn't something technical such as "original instruments". It is instead the work of art that doesn't pander to what the audience "wants"...its whims.

This is linked to a Marxist interpretation which instead of treating the audience as an all-powerful "customer" adopts a teacherly or even priestly stance "above" the mere audience, something only the most "snobbish" of French chefs would dare, proposing to teach it to like Higher Things.

There are rarefied forms of *haute* cuisine; but note that common sense usually has a horselaugh about precious Yuppies eating designer food which it withholds about concert-goers listening to Berg; your man in the street merely thinks the latter crowd to be odd jobs, and doesn't resent them, meaning that ethical judgements play a role in aesthetic judgements that specialists in ethics, and specialists in aesthetics, systematically disregard...but which artists such as Tolstoy regarded as central.

Based on Adorno's theory of the (merely) culinary as not being "art", this would seem to mean that it is a joke, for an Adornoite (if such a person exists meaningfully), to treat cooking as an art form or eating as art appreciation.

Monty Python would often reverberate with this sort of arcana in a strange way: in the Mr. Creosote passage of The Meaning of Life, an enormously fat man is persuaded by the fawning waiter to have one more sweet whereupon Mr. Creosote throws up all over the dining room. Note that the scene has more claims to be art, despite being nauseating, than designer food.

This MAY be an unconscious comment on any theory of art that blindly equates "fine dining" and a visit to the picture galleries, a sort of tourist equation in which picture galleries are overrun in fact by post-prandial Mr. Creosotes. Even the ordinary man in the street would say that the starving artist visiting the gallery has a "better" apprehension of the higher, more inner, more elusive aura of the art work than Mr. Creosote, which means that for some authors, including Adorno, there is a nexus between ethics (which nearly tracks aesthetics polyphonically, where we use "good" and "bad" in ethics to characterise people and their deeds, and in aesthetics to judge what to buy).

The possibility of a rejection of the culinary in art starts with Kant's theory of the sublime but does not end there; post Holocaust (with its Nazis playing Bach: with Adorno's questions about poetry after Auschwitz) the culinary, and whether the German officer enjoying a "fine" meal has much of anything to do with art, become important aesthetic questions.

A Marxist theory of art would probably conclude that the chef cannot be an artist, lacking autonomy and beholden to the customer, Mr. Creosote, in all regards.

==Humor==

{{Further|Humor|Jokes|Mathematical humor}}
There is a developed theory of the aesthetics of jokes and humor, including a mathematical and logical analysis.

==Industrial design==

[[Industrial Design]]: Designers need many aesthetic qualities to improve the marketability of manufactured products: smoothness, shininess/reflectivity, texture, pattern, curviness, color, simplicity, usability, velocity, symmetry, naturalness, and modernism.
The staff of the Design Aesthetics section focuses on design, appearance and the way people perceive products. Design aesthetics is interested in the appearance of products; the explanation and meaning of this appearance is studied mainly in terms of social and cultural factors. The distinctive focus of the section is research and education in the field of sensory modalities in relation to product design. These fields of attention generate design baggage that enables engineers to design products, systems, and services, and match them to the correct field of use.

==Information technology==

Aesthetics in [[information technology]] has focused upon the study of [[human-computer interaction]] and creating [[user-friendly]] devices and [[software applications]]. [[Software]] itself has aesthetic dimensions ("[[software aesthetics]]"), as do information-technology-mediated processes and experiences such as computer [[video games]] and [[virtual reality]] simulations. [[Digital culture]] is a distinct aesthetic to judge the appeal of digital environments such as [[Web browser]]s, [[website]]s, and icons, as well as visual and aural art produced exclusively with digital technologies. The notion of [[cyberspace]] has sometimes been linked to the concept of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

Aesthetics in information technology do also apply to the act of designing [[software]] itself. Numerous [[programmers]] profess to experiencing a dimension of [[elegance]] in the functionality and structuring of software at the [[source code]] level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/front/node3.html Preface to the First Edition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a short, powerful expression that clearly expresses the intent of the code can be considered "beautiful" to the poor programmer charged with maintaining said code. This contrasts with code that is (as code all too often is) short, cryptic, unclear, and unnecessarily "clever". In-line documentation, while not strictly code, can be considered something a programmer would need to be good at in order to write beautiful code. Correctly done, documentation can accentuate the effect of beautiful code, when it is clear, concise, explains the intent of the programmer, and expands the understanding that one can gain by simply looking at the code. Comments that are redundant (only explain what the code already explains), cryptic, and overly long or short can detract from beautiful code. Aesthetics in programming can also have a practical level: Under the right conditions, elegant code can run faster and more efficiently, and (most importantly) be less prone to errors.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Knuth,  "Literate Programming", http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this would say that the need to justify "good design" by reference to "cost savings" means that "good design" isn't "art" insofar as art is autonomous, and many aestheticians would have to say that art emerges in applications only in excess of cost savings. In information technology, theorists of "user friendliness" have to justify their "user friendly" applications and often disregard basic statistics when most users like a system, but a significant minority hate it.

That is, they may discard the standard deviation of their data in order to sell a good design for the best price, and this has nothing to do with art insofar as art is a useful signifier (if you cost-justify everything you are a businessman and not an artist).

A folk phenomenon among real programmers is in fact their frequent hatred of practice described in books as best practice and good design. A Marxist theory of industrial "art" would ascribe this to alienation, in which subaltern programmers never produce code they own in any meaningful sense, with the problem that the same sort of alienation, soldiering, and bloody-mindedness appeared, it seems, in Soviet computing shops.

The most sophisticated writings on the topic of aesthetics are to be found in the late [[Edsger Dijkstra|Edsger Wybe Dijkstra's]] corpus of papers and notes on computing: in Dijkstra, the art is real, but Ying with respect to the Yang of applications; Dijkstra seemed to have refused any analysis of programming as other than applied mathematics and, strange to say, never pursued what Adorno (the midcentury theoretician of whom Dijkstra was apparently unaware) called a purely culinary elegance...despite the protests of others that his work was "hard to digest", in Adorno's words not very culinary.

Dijkstra's beauty refused the notion of accessibility as do many "artistic" works ancient and modern: it was hard as is the Grosse Fuge, Beethoven's syncopated and neo-primitive late movement. In fact, no aesthetician makes "user friendliness" canonical and necessary in a work of art, strange to say in an era when supposedly the masses rule through the market; for most art theorists, it is nice if the canaille can enjoy some pretty rondo of Mozart and whistle it on the street, but would deny that this property must be shared by the Masonic prelude and fugue or the Requiem mass.

This makes strange any claim that a programmer making his work "user friendly" to all comers is some sort of artist by virtue of that. For Dijsktra, truth was primary, and beauty the automatic result.

==Landscape design==

[[Landscape architecture|Landscape designers]] draw upon design elements such as axis, line, landform, horizontal and vertical planes, texture, and scale to create aesthetic variation within the landscape. They may additionally make use of aesthetic elements such as pools or fountains of water, plants, seasonal variance, stonework, fragrance, exterior lighting, statues, and lawns.

==Literature==

{{main|Literary merit}}
In [[poetry]], [[short story|short stories]], [[novel]]s and [[non-fiction]], authors use a variety of techniques to appeal to our aesthetic values. Depending on the type of writing an author may employ rhythm, illustrations, structure, time shifting, juxtaposition, dualism, imagery, fantasy, suspense, analysis, humor/cynicism, and thinking aloud.

==Maps==

Aesthetics in [[cartography]] relates to the visual experience of map reading and can take two forms: responses to the map itself as an aesthetic object (e.g., through detail, colour, and form) and also the subject of the map symbolised, often the landscape (e.g., a particular expression of terrain which forms an imagined visual experience of the aesthetic).

Cartographers make aesthetic judgments when designing maps to ensure that the content forms a clear expression of the theme(s). Antique maps are perhaps especially revered due to their aesthetic value, which may seem to be derived from their styles of ornamentation. As such, aesthetics are often wrongly considered to be a by-product of design. If it is taken that aesthetic judgments are produced within a certain social context, they are fundamental to the cartographer's symbolisation and as such are integral to the function of maps.

==Marketing==

As opposed to Industrial Design, which focuses on the aesthetic qualities of consumer products (see below), the use of aesthetics in marketing concerns itself with the "trade dress" of a product, such as its branding, its commercial representation, or the reputation of its producer. Marketing professionals may tickle the consumer's aesthetic appreciation of sassyness, [[sophistication]], color-harmony, stylishness, catchy jingles, slogans, craftsmanship, soothingness, attentiveness, authenticity, or the related perceived experiences associated with product consumption.

Marketing consists of intriguing the human mind to think in a direction where it would not have done so previously - or not without outside input. Human curiosity, self gain or mental adjustment is what drives marketing development itself.

==Mathematics==

{{Main|Mathematical beauty}}
{{Further|mathematical humor}}
The aesthetics of [[mathematics]] are often compared with music and poetry. Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] expressed his views on the indescribable beauty of mathematics when he said "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful." Math appeals to the "senses" of logic, order, novelty, elegance, and discovery. Some concepts in math with specific aesthetic application include sacred ratios in [[geometry]], the intuitiveness of axioms, the complexity and intrigue of fractals, the solidness and regularity of [[polyhedra]], and the [[serendipity]] of relating theorems across disciplines.  There is a developed aesthetic and theory of humor in [[mathematical humor]].

==Music==

{{main|Aesthetics of music}}
Some of the aesthetic elements expressed in [[music]] include lyricism, [[harmony]], hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, volume dynamics, resonance, playfulness, color, subtlety, elatedness, depth, and mood (see [[musical development]]). Aesthetics in music are often believed to be highly sensitive to their context: what sounds good in modern [[rock music]] might sound terrible in the context of the early [[baroque music|baroque]] age.

==Neuroesthetics==

[[Cognitive science]] has also considered aesthetics, with the advent of [[neuroesthetics]], pioneered by [[Semir Zeki]], which seeks to explain the prominence of great art as an embodiment of biological principles of the brain, namely that great works of art capture the essence of things just as vision and the brain capture the essentials of the world from the ever-changing stream of sensory input. ''See also'' [[Vogelkop bowerbird]].

==Performing arts==

[[Theater|Performing arts]] appeal to our aesthetics of storytelling, grace, balance, class, timing, strength, shock, humor, costume, irony, beauty, drama, suspense, and sensuality. Whereas live stage performance is usually constrained by the physical reality at hand, film performance can further add the aesthetic elements of large-scale action, fantasy, and a complex interwoven musical [[film score|score]]. [[Performance art]] often consciously mixes the aesthetics of several forms. [[Role-playing games]] are sometimes seen as a performing art with an aesthetic structure of their own, called [[role-playing game theory|RPG theory]].

==Two-dimensional and plastic arts==

Aesthetic considerations within the [[visual arts]] are usually associated with the sense of [[visual perception|vision]]. A painting or sculpture, however, is also perceived spatially by recognized associations and context, and even to some extent by the senses of smell, hearing, and touch. The form of the work can be subject to an aesthetic as much as the content.

In painting, the aesthetic convention that we see a three-dimensional representation rather than a two-dimensional canvas is so well understood that most people do not realize that they are making an aesthetic interpretation. This notion is the basis of [[abstract impressionism]].

In the United States during the postwar period, the "push-pull" theories of [[Hans Hofmann]], positing a relation between color and perceived depth, strongly influenced a generation of prominent abstract painters, many of whom studied under Hofmann and were generally associated with [[abstract expressionism]]. Hofmann's general attitude toward abstraction as virtually a moral imperative for the serious painter was also extremely influential.

Some aesthetic effects available in visual arts include variation, juxtaposition, repetition, field effects, symmetry/asymmetry, perceived mass, subliminal structure, linear dynamics, tension and repose, pattern, contrast, perspective, 3 dimensionality, movement, rhythm, unity/Gestalt, matrixiality and proportion.

==Urban life==

[[Image:Clifton suspension bridge from hotwells 600.jpg|thumb|300px|Towns and cities have been planned with aesthetics in mind; here in [[Bristol]] (England), 19th century private sector development was designed to appear attractive.]]
Over half of mankind lives in cities; although it represents a lofty goal, [[urban planning|planning]] and achieving urban aesthetics ([[beautification]]) involves a good deal of historical luck, happenstance, and indirect gestalt. Nevertheless, aesthetically pleasing cities share certain traits: ethnic and cultural variety, numerous microclimates that promote a diversity of vegetation, sufficient public transportation, Public art and freedom of expression in the community in the forms of sculpture, [[graffiti]] and [[street art]], a range of build-out (or zoning) that creates both densely and sparsely populated areas, scenic neighboring geography (oceans or mountains), public spaces and events such as [[park]]s and [[parade]]s, musical variety through local radio or street musicians, and enforcement of laws that abate noise, crime, and pollution.

==Website Design==

Recent research suggests that the visual aesthetics of computer interface is a strong determinant of users’ satisfaction and pleasure. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses found that users’ perceptions consist of different main dimensions. Lavie and Tractinsky found two main dimension which they termed  “classical aesthetics”  and “expressive aesthetics”.&lt;ref&gt;Lavie, T., &amp; Tractinsky, N. (2004). Assessing Dimensions of Perceived Visual Aesthetics of Websites. International Journal of Human Computer Studies , 269-298.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''Classical Aesthetics'' - pertains to aesthetic notions that presided from antiquity until the 18th century. These notions emphasize orderly and clear design and are closely related to many of the 	design rules advocated by usability experts.
*''Expressive Aesthetics'' - created by the designers’ creativity and originality and by the ability to break design conventions.
While both dimensions of perceived aesthetic are drawn from a pool of aesthetic judgments, they are clearly distinguishable from each other. &lt;br /&gt;
In a recent study Moshagen and Thielsch found four core dimensions of website aesthetics:&lt;ref&gt;Moshagen, M. &amp; Thielsch, M. T. (2010). Facets of visual aesthetics. In: ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', 68 (10), 689-709.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Simplicity
* Diversity
* Colors
* Craftsmanship

Simplicity and diversity have repeatedly been treated as formal parameters of aesthetic objects throughout the history of empirical aesthetics. Colors are a very critical property of aesthetic objects. Craftsmanship addresses the skillful and coherent integration of the relevant design dimensions. While simplicity is highly correlated to classical aesthetics as mentioned by Lavie and Tractinsky, the other three factors could be treated as deeper differentiation of expressive aesthetics.

&lt;br /&gt;
'''Best practices for aesthetic Website Design'''&lt;br /&gt;
•	Create visual clues based on groupings; related items or links are grouped together while unrelated items are separated.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings and subheadings to allow visual scanning of content.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use headings, subheadings, font sizes, bold fonts and italic fonts in proportion to the importance of the item.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Align elements on a page so that they are all visually connected; size all elements on the page to create balance and unity; nothing should look out of place unless you have a specific reason for the effect.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Choose a font style that supports the site atmosphere and stick to it; limit styles to 2 at the most.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use images and photos for visual appeal and to communicate ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
•	Use one set of design elements across your website.

'''Website Design Aesthetics and Credibility''' &lt;br /&gt;
Website design influences user’s perception of site credibility. One of the factors that influences whether users stay or go on a web page is the page aesthetics. Another reason may involve a user's judgment about the site's credibility. Findings indicate that when the same content is presented using different levels of aesthetic treatment, the content with a higher aesthetic treatment was judged as having higher credibility. We call this the amelioration effect of visual design and aesthetics on content credibility. Holmes suggests that this effect is operational within the first few seconds in which a user views a web page. Given the same content, a higher aesthetic treatment will increase perceived credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, J., &amp; Robins, D. (2008). Aesthetics and Credibility in Web Site Design. Information Processing and Management: an International Journal , 386-399.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assemblage''' is an artistic form or medium usually created on a defined substrate that consists of three-dimensional elements projecting out of or from the substrate. It is similar to [[collage]], a two-dimensional medium. It is part of the [[visual arts]], and it typically uses found objects, but is not limited to these materials.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1992) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/Assemblage-Art "Assemblage Art"]. ''Glossary of Art, Architecture &amp; Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed. Retrieved February 7, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistory.about.com/od/glossary/g/a_assemblage.htm About.com art history] Retrieved March 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origin of the art form dates to the cubist constructions of [[Pablo Picasso]] c. 1912–1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3ATA%3AE%3Aex4620&amp;page_number=3&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 ''The Guitar,'' MoMA]&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the word (in its artistic sense) can be traced back to the early 1950s, when [[Jean Dubuffet]] created a series of [[collage]]s of butterfly wings, which he titled ''assemblages d'empreintes''. However, both [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and others had been working with [[found objects]] for many years prior to Dubuffet. Russian artist [[Vladimir Tatlin]] created his "counter-reliefs" in the mid 1910s. Alongside Tatlin, the earliest woman artist to try her hand at assemblage was [[Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven]], the Dada Baroness. In Paris in the 1920s [[Alexander Calder]], [[Jose De Creeft]], [[Picasso]] and others began making fully 3-dimensional works from metal scraps, found metal objects and wire. In the U.S., one of the earliest and most prolific assemblage artists was [[Louise Nevelson]], who began creating her sculptures from found pieces of wood in the late 1930s.

The painter [[Armando Reverón]] is one of the first to use this technique when using disposable materials such as bamboo, wires, wires or kraft paper. In the thirties he made a skeleton with wings of mucilage, adopting this style years before other artists. Later, Reverón made instruments and set pieces such as a telephone, a sofa, a sewing machine, a piano and even music books with their scores.

In 1961, the exhibition "The Art of Assemblage" was featured at the New York [[Museum of Modern Art]]. The [[exhibition]] showcased the work of early 20th-century European artists such as [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], and [[Kurt Schwitters]] alongside Americans [[Man Ray]], [[Joseph Cornell]], Robert Mallary and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and also included less well known American West Coast assemblage artists such as [[George Herms]], [[Bruce Conner]] and [[Edward Kienholz]].  William C Seitz, the curator of the exhibition, described assemblages as being made up of preformed natural or manufactured materials, objects, or fragments not intended as art materials.&lt;ref&gt;William C. Seitz, ''The Art of Assemblage'', Doubleday (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/momaorg/shared/pdfs/docs/press_archives/2897/releases/MOMA_1961_0112_110.pdf|title=The Art of Assemblage|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]|accessdate=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visual attractiveness or visual appeal is attraction produced primarily by [[visual perception|visual stimuli]].

==Physical attractiveness==
{{Main|Physical attractiveness}}

[[Physical attractiveness]] is the perception of the physical traits of an individual [[human]] [[person]] as pleasing or [[beauty|beautiful]]. It can include various implications, such as [[sexual attractiveness]], [[cuteness]], [[Interpersonal attraction#Similarity (like-attracts-like)|similarity]] and [[physical attractiveness|physique]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Physical attractiveness can also include the attraction of smell. Pheromones secreted by animals and humans alike can attract others, and this is viewed as being attracted to smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/14/science-of-attraction-_n_6661522.html|title=The Strange Science Of Sexual Attraction|last=Gregoire|first=Carolyn|date=2015-02-14|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=HuffPo isn't the best possible source for medicine related topics|date=June 2018}} [[Human sex pheromones]] may play a role in human attraction, although it is unclear how well humans can actually pick up on the pheromones of another. 

Judgment of attractiveness of physical traits is partly universal to all human cultures, partly dependent on culture or [[society]] or time period, partly biological, and partly subjective and individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hönekopp | first = Johannes | authorlink = | title = Once more: Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?

==The Science Behind Attraction==
According to a study determining the golden ratio for facial beauty, the most attractive face is one with average distances between facial features, and an average length and width of the face itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pallett|first=Pamela|last2=Link|first2=Stephen|last3=Lee|first3=Kang|date=November 6, 2009|title=New "Golden" Ratios for Facial Beauty|pmc=2814183|journal=Vision Research|volume=50|pages=149–154|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Facial attractiveness, or [[beauty]], can also be determined by symmetry. If a face is asymmetrical, this can indicate unhealthy genetic information. Therefore, if a face is symmetrical (see [[Facial symmetry]]), healthy genetic information is implied. People will judge potential mates based off the physical expression of the genetic health, which is their apparent attractiveness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=B.C.|last2=Little|first2=A.C.|last3=Penton-Voak|first3=I.S.|last4=Tiddeman|first4=B.P.|last5=Burt|first5=D.M.|last6=Perrett|first6=D.I.|date=November 2001|title=Facial symmetry and judgements of apparent health: Support for a “good genes” explanation of the attractiveness–symmetry relationship|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513801000836|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=22|pages=417-420|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This supports the good genes theory, which indicates that attractiveness is seen as a way to ensure that offspring will have the healthiest genes and therefore the best chance of survival. Certain trains that indicate good genes (such as clear skin or facial symmetry) are seen as desirable when choosing a partner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/good-genes-hypothesis|title=Good genes hypothesis|last=The Editors of Encyclopedia Britannica|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Brittanica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Sexual Selection and Attraction in Non-human Animals==

Among animals, females often are "choosy" about who they pick for a mate. They will look for characteristics in their potential mates that ensure their offspring will have healthy genetic material. Therefore, they will be attracted to certain traits or behaviors of their potential mates. Attraction among animals is based mostly on what will give the females the best chance of having the most and healthiest offspring that will likely survive to adulthood because of the traits they will inherit from the male&lt;ref&gt; Alcock, J. (2001). The Evolution of Reproductive Behavior. In Animal Behavior. (7 ed. pp. 341) Sunderland, Massachusetts: Arizona State University. &lt;/ref&gt;. Females will look for signs of health in the males, such as large and fancy adornments, bright colors, or other features that the male will only have if he is in good health. &lt;ref&gt;Bateson, P.

The '''Baghdad School''' was a relatively short-lived yet influential school of [[Islamic art]] developed during the late 12th century in the capital [[Baghdad]] of the ruling [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. The movement had largely died out by the early 14th century, five decades following the invasion of the [[Mongols]] in 1258 and the downfall of the Abbasids' rule, and would eventually be replaced by stylistic movements from the [[Mongol]] tradition.  The Baghdad School is particularly noted for its distinctive approach to manuscript illustration.  The faces depicted in illustrations were individualized and expressive, with the scenes often highlighting realistic features of everyday life from the period.  This stylistic movement used strong, bright colors, and employed a balanced sense of design and a decorative quality, with illustrations often lacking traditional frames and appearing between lines of text on manuscript pages.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online, s. v. "Baghdad school," accessed May 04, 2013, http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/48804/Baghdad-school.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Baghdad School of art is noted for its manuscript artwork. The school consisted of calligraphers, illustrators, transcribers and translators, who collaborated to produce illuminated manuscripts derived from non-Arabic sources. The characteristic Baghdad School artistic style, which features sprightly characters bearing highly expressive faces and hand gestures (rather than stereotypical people), reached its peak in the first half of the 13th-century, although some examples can be identified at earlier periods.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad School," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., CRC Press, 2003, p. 1259&lt;/ref&gt;  Illustrations in this style represent a skilful blend of Byzantine, Persian and Arab features.&lt;ref&gt;Ekhtiar, M., ''Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' New York, N.Y., [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2011, p. 94; Ipşiroğlu, M.S., ''Painting and Culture of the Mongols,'' Abrams, 1966, p. 37; Rahimova, Z., "Miniature Painting of the Middle Eastern Arabic School of Miniature," ''Journal of the Academy of Arts'' (Uzbekistan), No. 2, 2015, [http://sanat.orexca.com/2015/2012-2-2015/miniature-painting-of-the-middle-eastern-arabic-school-of-miniature/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Very few illuminated copies of the [[Quaran|Q'ran]] from this period have survived, but a number of secular manuscripts are still extant.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: Miriam Drake (ed), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., [[CRC Press]], 2003, p. 1259.&lt;/ref&gt; These manuscripts are primarily scientific treatises or social commentaries. 

The descriptor, "Baghdad School", was coined by the French [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]], Eustache De Lorey, in 1938, when he curated an exhibition of illustrations from ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani]]'' for the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref&gt;Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; Some art historians and curators used the term, ''Mesopotamian School,''&lt;ref&gt;See for example: Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," ''Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin,'' n.d.,  p,. 277, [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:]; Dimand, M.S., ''A Handbook of Mohammedan Decorative Arts,'' New York, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 1930, pp 18-20 or Rahimova, Z., "Miniature Painting of the Middle Eastern Arabic School of Miniature," ''Journal of the Academy of Arts'' (Uzbekistan), No. 2, 2015, [http://sanat.orexca.com/2015/2012-2-2015/miniature-painting-of-the-middle-eastern-arabic-school-of-miniature/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; while other scholars have suggested that the term should be replaced with something broader, such as the Arab School of Miniatures, because its exponents were not just confined to Baghdad and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Osier, P., ''Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations and illustrations of ''[[De Materia Medica]]''==

The [[Greeks|Greek]] [[materia medica]], in particular herbals and [[bestiaries]], which described the characteristics and medicinal uses of various plants and animals found in the Mediterranean world, were among the books transcribed.&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;“Preparation of Medicine from Honey: Leaf from an Arabic Translation of the Materia Medica of Dioscorides [Iraq, Baghdad School] (13.152.6)”. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000--. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/13.152.6 (December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  Several Arabic translations of [[Dioscorides]]' work, ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' have been discovered. [[Dioscorides]]' treatise was considered especially important, and remains one of the best examples of manuscript translation and illustration produced by the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt; [[Dioscorides]] was a renowned [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] physician, herbalist, and pharmacist serving the [[Roman Empire]] and its armies during the first century CE, whose work gained influence throughout the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;

Of these, a manuscript known as the ''Mashhad Manuscript'', originally believed to be 13th-century  work, has been reassessed and now dated to between 1152 and 1176, providing one of the earliest examples of illustrations in the style of the Baghdad School.&lt;ref&gt;Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," Metropolitan Museum of Art, n.d. [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:] The manuscript has no colophon with date, but it has a 4-page introduction written by Mihran ibn Mansur ibn Miihran, who translated it for Najm ad-din Alpi, the Urtuqid prince, ruler from 1152 to 1176.&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example of these translations is the translation and work probably by Abdallah ibn al-Fadl.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, M., ''New Accessions of Islamic Art,'' Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, n.d. [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257747.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:]; Day, G.E., "Mesopotamian Manuscripts of Dioscorides," Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, n.d., p,. 277, [https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257424.pdf.bannered.pdf Online:] The manuscript has a colophon which establishes the date as the month of Rajab 620 A.H./ July-August 1224&lt;/ref&gt; The illustrations were considered especially important, and it remains one of the best examples of manuscript translation and illustration produced by the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;  [[Dioscorides]] was a renowned Greek physician, herbalist, and pharmacist serving the [[Roman Empire]] and its armies during the first century CE, whose work gained influence throughout the medieval Islamic world.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt; 

Among the illustrated manuscript leaves of the 13th-century [[Dioscorides]]' ''Materia Medica'' is the page entitled, “Physician Preparing an Elixir," also referred to by The Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History as “Preparation of Medicine from Honey.”  It is dated 1224 CE and was found in [[Iraq]] or Northern Jazira, possibly [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;  The page depicts an illustration of a bearded physician with a colorful blue headscarf and red clothing seated on an ornamental stool.  He is mixing a yellow pot with a ladle while overlooking a yellow cauldron hanging from a red tripod above a wide blue container.  His other hand is raised up towards his mouth.  A large blue jug lies to the left of the tripod.  Two overhanging trees on either side of the scene bear leaves and two different types of what appear to be colorful fruit or flowers—red on the left and yellow on the right.  The ground below the scene is covered with green grass, however there is no background depicted in the illustration thus reducing the sense of depth. The style of illustration depicted on this manuscript leaf is thus an excellent example of the Baghdad School: the colors are bright and distinctive, the objects depicted in the scene have a balanced, symmetrical design with the trees framing the illustration, and finally, the man’s face appears to be in a state of deep, expressive contemplation.  The scene itself has a realistic and personalized quality to it, depicting a physician in a natural setting as he prepares a medicinal mixture containing honey for his patients, and yet also has ornamental characteristics with its design and choice of colors—another distinctive feature of the Baghdad School.&lt;ref name="britannica" /&gt;

==Transcription and illustration of ''Maqamat''==
The Abbasid artist, [[Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti|Yahya Al-Wasiti]], who lived in [[Baghdad]] in the late Abassid era (12th to 13th-centuries), was one of the pre-eminent exponents of the Baghdad school. In 1236-37, he is known to have transcribed and illustrated the book, ''[[Maqamat Badi' az-Zaman al-Hamadhani|Maqamat]]'' (also known as the ''Assemblies'' or the ''Sessions''), a series of anecdotes of social satire written by [[Al-Hariri of Basra]].&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopedia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative concerns the travels of a middle-aged man as he uses his charm and eloquence to swindle his way across the Arabic world.&lt;ref&gt;Esanu, O., ''Art, Awakening, and Modernity in the Middle East: The Arab Nude,'' Routledge, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works ==

Yet other examples of work in the style of the Baghdad School include the illustrations in ''Kalila wa Dimna'' ([[Panchatantra|Fables of Bidpai]]), (1222); a collection of fables by the Hindu, Bidpai translated into Arabic ,&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: Miriam Drake (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science,'' Volume 2, 2nd ed., CRC Press, 2003, p. 1259; Dimand, M.S., ''A Handbook of Mohammedan Decorative Arts,'' New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1930, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Rasa'il al-Ikhwan al-Safa'' (The Epistles of the Sincere Brethren) (1287); an example of an illuminated manuscript produced after the Mongol invasion.&lt;ref&gt;"Baghdad school," in: ''Encyclopedia Britannica,'' [https://www.britannica.com/art/Baghdad-school Online:]; Brend, B., ''Islamic Art,'' [[Harvard University Press]], 1991, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In the 20th-century, al-Waiti's illustrations and the Baghdad School served as an inspiration for [[Iraqi art#Jama’et Baghdad lil Fenal-Hadith (The Baghdad Modern Art Group)|The Baghdad Modern Art Group]].&lt;ref&gt;Wijdan, A. (ed.), ''Contemporary Art From The Islamic World,'' p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in the 1950s by artists, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]], members of the group believed that the Mongol invasion of the 13th-century represented a "break in the chain of pictorial Iraqi art"&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt; and wanted to reassert a national identity and build a distinctive Iraqi identity which referenced heritage and tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F.

She initially worked as a designer at [[Mademoiselle (magazine)|''Mademoiselle'']] and later moved on to work part-time as a picture editor at [[House &amp; Garden (magazine)|House and Garden]], [[Aperture]], and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbarakruger.com/biography.shtml |title=Biography - Barbara Kruger - Photograph Collage, Advertising, Slogans, Art |publisher=Barbara Kruger |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote film, television, and music columns for ''[[Artforum]]'' and ''Real Life Magazine'' at the suggestion of her friend [[Ingrid Sischy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Kruger's earliest works date back to 1969. These works were large wall hangings made out of different materials such as yarn, beads, sequins, feathers and ribbons. These pieces represented the feminist recuperation of craft during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rogallery.com/Kruger_Barbara/kruger-biography.html|title=Barbara Kruger, American (1945- )|last=|first=|date=2017-03-17|website=Rhode Island Gallery|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kruger crocheted, sewed and painted bright-hued and erotically suggestive objects, some of which were included by curator [[Marcia Tucker]] in the 1973 [[Whitney Biennial]].&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words" /&gt; They were inspired by [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]]'s show at the Museum of Modern Art. Although some of these works were included in the [[Whitney Biennial]], Kruger became detached and unsatisfied with her working output.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 1976 she took a break from making what had become more abstract works, feeling that her work had become meaningless and mindless.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She then moved to Berkeley, California where she taught at the [[University of California]] and became inspired by the writings of [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Roland Barthes]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1977 she returned to artmaking, working with her own architectural photographs and publishing an artist's book, ''Picture/Readings'', in 1979.&lt;ref name="christies.com"&gt;[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5496978 Barbara Kruger, ''Untitled (When I hear the word culture I take out my checkbook)'' (1985)] [[Christie's]] Evening Sale of Works from the Peter Norton Collection, 8 November 2011, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; She was inspired to photograph architecture from her family "looking at family homes [they] could never afford."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/barbara-kruger#_|title=Barbara Kruger|last=Bollen|first=Christopher|date=February 28, 2013|website=Interview Magazine|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of her art career, she was intimidated to enter New York galleries due to the art scene which was an atmosphere that, to her, did not welcome "particularly independent, non-masochistic women."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, she received early support for her projects from groups such as the Public Art Fund that encouraged her to continue art making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She switched to her modern practice of collage in the early 80's.

==Artistic practice==
Addressing issues of language and sign, Kruger has often been grouped with such [[feminist art|feminist postmodern artists]] as [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Sherrie Levine]], [[Martha Rosler]], and [[Cindy Sherman]].&lt;ref name="christies.com"/&gt; Like Holzer and Sherman, in particular, she uses the techniques of mass communication and advertising to explore gender and identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nga.gov.au/exhibitions/readMyLips/index.html Read My Lips: Jenny Holzer, Barbara Kruger, Cindy Sherman, June 6 - August 9, 1998] [[National Gallery of Australia]].&lt;/ref&gt; Kruger is considered to be part of the [[The Pictures Generation|Pictures Generation]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Eklund, [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pcgn/hd_pcgn.htm Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History: The Pictures Generation] Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imagery and text===
[[File:Belief+Doubt (2012).jpg|thumb|Belief+Doubt (2012) at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]]
Much of Kruger's work pairs found photographs with pithy and assertive text that challenges the viewer. Her method includes developing her ideas on a computer, later transferring the results (often billboard-sized) into images.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; Examples of her instantly recognizable slogans read "I shop therefore I am," and "Your body is a battleground," appearing in her trademark white letters against a red background. Much of her text calls attention to ideas such as [[feminism]], [[consumerism]], and individual autonomy and desire, frequently appropriating images from mainstream magazines and using her bold phrases to frame them in a new context.

Kruger has said that "I work with pictures and words because they have the ability to determine who we are and who we aren't."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schirn.de/en/exhibitions/2010/barbara-kruger.html Barbara Kruger: Circus, December 15, 2010 - January 30, 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224141600/http://www.schirn.de/en/exhibitions/2010/barbara-kruger.html |date=December 24, 2010 }} Kunsthalle Schirn, Frankfurt.&lt;/ref&gt; A larger category that threads through her work is the appropriation and alteration of existing images. In describing her use of appropriation, Kruger states: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pictures and words seem to become the rallying points for certain assumptions. There are assumptions of truth and falsity and I guess the narratives of falsity are called fictions. I replicate certain words and watch them stray from or coincide with the notions of fact and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, Barbara &amp; Richard Prince. [http://bombsite.com/issues/3/articles/63 "Interview with Barbara Kruger and Richard Prince"], ''BOMB Magazine'', Spring, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her poster for the 1989 [[List of protest marches on Washington, D.C.|Women's March on Washington]] in support of legal abortion included a woman's face bisected into positive and negative photographic reproductions, accompanied by the text "Your body is a battleground."&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words" /&gt; A year later, Kruger used this slogan in a billboard commissioned by the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]]. Twelve hours later, a group opposed to abortion responded to Kruger's work by replacing the adjacent billboard with an image depicting an eight-week-old fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/art/barbara-kruger#page5 |title=Barbara Kruger - Page |publisher=Interview Magazine |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kruger's early monochrome pre-digital works, known as 'paste ups', reveal the influence of the artist's experience as a magazine editorial designer during her early career. These small scale works, the largest of which is 11 x 13&amp;nbsp;inches (28 x 33&amp;nbsp;cm), are composed of altered found images, and texts either culled from the media or invented by the artist. A negative of each work was then produced and used to make enlarged versions of these initial 'paste ups'.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Kruger: Paste Up, November 21, 2009 - January 23, 2010, Sprüth Magers Gallery, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1978 and 1979, she completed "Picture/Readings," simple photographs of modest houses alternating with panels of words.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words" /&gt;  From 1992 on, Kruger designed several magazine covers, such as ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', and ''[[The New Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hagen (June 14, 1992), [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/14/arts/art-barbara-kruger-cover-girl.html Barbara Kruger: Cover Girl] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Her signature font style of [[Futura (typeface)|Futura Bold]] type is likely inspired from the "Big Idea" or "Creative Revolution" advertising style of the 1960s that she was exposed to during her experience at ''[[Mademoiselle (magazine)|Mademoiselle.]]''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1990, Kruger scandalized the Japanese American community of [[Little Tokyo, Los Angeles]], with her proposal to paint the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]], bordered by provocative questions, on the side of a warehouse in the heart of the historic downtown neighborhood.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; Kruger had been commissioned by MOCA to paint a mural for "A Forest of Signs: Art in the Crisis of Representation," a 1989 exhibition that also included works by [[Barbara Bloom (artist)|Barbara Bloom]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Jeff Koons]], [[Sherrie Levine]], and [[Richard Prince]]. But before the mural went up, Kruger herself and curator Ann Goldstein presented it at various community meetings over the time period of 18 months.&lt;ref name="MOCA's mural mess"&gt;Christopher Knight (December 14, 2010), [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/12/moca-whitewashes-blu-mural.html MOCA's mural mess] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Only after protests did the artist offer to eliminate the pledge from her mural proposal, while still retaining a series of questions painted in the colors and format of the American flag: "Who is bought and sold? Who is beyond the law? Who is free to choose? Who follows orders? Who salutes longest? Who prays loudest? Who dies first? Who laughs last?".&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; A full year after the exhibition closed, Kruger's reconfigured mural finally went up for a two-year run.&lt;ref name="MOCA's mural mess"/&gt;

In 1994, Kruger's ''L'empathie peut changer le monde'' (''Empathy can change the world'') was installed on a train station platform in [[Strasbourg]], France. One year later, with architects Henry Smith-Miller and Laurie Hawkinson and landscape architect Nicholas Quennell, she designed the 200-foot-long (60 m) sculptural letters ''Picture This'' for a stage and outdoor amphitheater at the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]], Raleigh.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; Between 1998 and 2008, she created permanent installations for the [[Fisher College of Business]], the Broad Contemporary Art Museum at [[LACMA]], the [[Moderna Museet]], Stockholm, and the [[Price Center]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stuartcollection.ucsd.edu/StuartCollection/Kruger.htm Barbara Kruger: Another, 2008] University of California, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; For a site-specific piece that she produced at the [[Parrish Art Museum]] in 1998, Kruger placed across the upper range of the museum's Romanesque facade stark red letters that read, "You belong here"; below, on columns separating three arched entry portals, stacked letters spelled "Money" and "Taste."&lt;ref&gt;Ken Johnson (August 6, 2004), [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/arts/art-review-the-hamptons-a-playground-for-creativity.html The Hamptons, A Playground For Creativity] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2005, Kruger installed a digitally printed vinyl mural across the entire facade of the Italian pavilion, thereby dividing it into three parts—green at the left, red at the right, white in between. In English and Italian, the words "money" and "power" climbed the portico's columns; the left wall said, "Pretend things are going as planned," while "God is on my side; he told me so" fills the right.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Knight (June 21, 2005), [http://articles.latimes.com/2005/jun/21/entertainment/et-venice21 Fueled by politics] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, her installation ''Belief+Doubt'', which covers 6,700 square feet (620 m²) of surface area and was printed onto wallpaper-like sheets in the artist's signature colors of red, black and white, was installed at the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]].&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"&gt;Kelly Crow (August 2, 2012), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443866404577564944016522540 An Artist Has Her Say—All Over a Museum's Lobby and Store] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other works===
Since the mid-1990s, Kruger has created large-scale immersive video and audio installations. Enveloping the viewer with the seductions of direct address, the work continues her questioning of power, control, affection and contempt: still images now move and speak and spatialize their commentary.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Kruger: The Globe Shrinks, September, 3 - October 23, 2010, Sprüth Magers Gallery, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, Kruger produced a series of fiberglass sculptures of compromised celebrities, including [[John F. Kennedy|John F.]] and [[Robert Kennedy]] hoisting [[Marilyn Monroe]] on their shoulders.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; For a concurrent show that same year in New York, she had city buses wrapped with quotations from figures such as [[Malcolm X]], [[Courtney Love]], and [[H.L. Mencken]]. For her first retrospective, at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], she created 15 billboards and countless wild postings, executed and installed in both English and Spanish.&lt;ref name="She Has a Way With Words"/&gt; For a public awareness campaign to promote arts instruction in the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]], Kruger covered a bus with phrases like "Give your brain as much attention as you do your hair and you'll be a thousand times better off"; "from here to there"; "Don't be a jerk"; and "You want it. You buy it. You forget it."&lt;ref&gt;Howard Blume (October 8, 2012), [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/10/launified-arts-education-campaign-launched.html Campaign launched to promote arts education in L.A.

===Teaching===
Kruger has taught at the Independent Study Program at the [[Whitney Museum]]; [[California Institute of the Arts]], Valencia; [[University of California, Berkeley]]; Chicago; and [[UCSD]] for five years before joining the faculty at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]]. In 1995–96, she was artist in residence at the [[Wexner Center for the Arts]], where she created Public Service Announcements addressing issues of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wexarts.org/about/residencies/ Wexner Center Residency Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525165749/http://www.wexarts.org/about/residencies/ |date=May 25, 2012 }} [[Wexner Center for the Arts]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, she was the Wiegand Foundation Artist in Residence at [[Scripps College]], Claremont.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.scrippscollege.edu/press-releases/barbara-kruger-to-be-wiegand-artist-in-residence-at-scripps Barbara Kruger to be Wiegand Foundation Artist in Residence at Scripps] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701122206/http://media.scrippscollege.edu/press-releases/barbara-kruger-to-be-wiegand-artist-in-residence-at-scripps |date=July 1, 2013 }} [[Scripps College]], Claremont.&lt;/ref&gt; She has written about television, film and culture for ''[[Artforum]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''The New York Times'', and ''[[The Village Voice]]''.

=== Connections with other artists ===
Kruger was involved with a group of artists from her graduating classes from [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]] in the 1970s, including [[Ross Bleckner]] and [[David Salle]], listing them as her "first peer group." She considered [[Diane Arbus]] to be her "first female role model ... [that] didn't wash the floor six times a day." She also was connected with [[Julian Schnabel]], Marilyn Lerner, [[Sherrie Levine]], [[Cindy Sherman]], Jim Welling, [[Nancy Dwyer]], [[Louise Lawler]], [[Sarah Charlesworth]], [[Laurie Simmons]], Carol Squiers, [[Judith Barry]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Richard Prince]], [[Becky Johnston]], and [[Lynne Tillman]]. She was also involved in a group called Artists Meeting for Cultural Change.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Exhibitions==
&lt;!-- [[File:Shop barbara kruger.jpg|thumb|upright|Example of Barbara Kruger work]] --&gt;
In 1979, Barbara Kruger exhibited her first works combining appropriated photographs and fragments of superimposed text at [[MoMA PS1|P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center]], in Long Island City, Queens. Her first institutional show was staged in London, when [[Iwona Blazwick]] decided to exhibit her work at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in 1983.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;Caroline Roux (May 9, 2011), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/barbara-kruger-slogans-that-shake-society-2281119.html Barbara Kruger: Slogans that shake society] ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Los Angeles mounted the first retrospective exhibition to provide a comprehensive overview of Kruger's career since 1978, which travelled to the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moca.org/library/archive/exhibition/detail/1999/kruger Barbara Kruger, October 17, 1999 - February 13, 2000] Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.&lt;/ref&gt; Kruger has since been the subject of many one-person exhibitions, including shows organized by the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]] in London (1983); the [[Musée d'art contemporain de Montréal]] (1985); [[Serpentine Gallery]] in London (1994); Palazzo delle Papesse Centro Arte Contemporanea in [[Siena]] (2002); [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]] (2005); and [[Moderna Museet]] in Stockholm (2008). In 2009, Kruger was included in the seminal show "[[The Pictures Generation]], 1974–1984" at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Kruger has also participated in the [[Whitney Biennial]] (1983, 1985, and 1987) and [[Documenta]] 7 and 8 (1982 and 1987). She represented the United States at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1982 and again participated in 2005, when she received the [[Leone d'Oro]] for lifetime achievement.

In 2007, Kruger was one of the many artists to be a part of South Korea's [[Incheon Women Artists' Biennale]] in [[Seoul]]. This marked [[South Korea]]'s first women's [[wikt:biennale|biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= South Korea Kicks off First Women's Biennial | publisher=ARTINFO  | date= November 6, 2007| url= http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/26010/south-korea-kicks-off-first-womens-biennial/ | accessdate=2008-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, she designed "Consider This ...", an exhibition at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacma.org/art/exhibition/consider-this%E2%80%A6 Consider This..., April 9, 2006–January 15, 2007] [[LACMA]]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, Kruger's ''Between Being Born and Dying'', a major installation commissioned by the Lever House Art Collection, opened at the New York City architectural landmark [[Lever House]]. In 2012, as a member of the board of the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA)]], Kruger volunteered to be the lead funder of the museum's scholarly exhibit ''Ends of the Earth: Land Art to 1974'' and to create a new work on vinyl to sell with proceeds going entirely toward the show's $1 million budget.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Boehm (March 28, 2012), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-moca-20120328,0,5295919,full.story MOCA bets on festival's star power] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; An exhibition of new and recent work from Barbara Kruger was hosted by [[Modern Art Oxford]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/event/barbara-kruger/&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014.

Kruger's words and pictures have been displayed in both galleries and public spaces, as well as framed and unframed photographs, posters, postcards, T-shirts, electronic signboards, façade banners, and billboards.

==Recognition==
The [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] awarded Kruger the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles#Women in the Arts|MOCA Award to Distinguished Women in the Arts]] in 2001. In 2005, she was included in The Experience of Art at the [[Venice Biennale]] and was the recipient of the [[Leone d'Oro]] for lifetime achievement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/612 "Barbara Kruger"] Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Retrieved 14 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 10th anniversary Gala in the Garden at the [[Hammer Museum]] in 2012, Kruger was honored by TV presenter [[Rachel Maddow]].&lt;ref&gt;Julie Miller (October 7, 2012), [http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2012/10/steve-martin-tom-hanks-katy-perry-hammer-museum Steve Martin and Rachel Maddow Toast World-Renowned Artists at the Hammer Museum; Katy Perry Toasts Nail Art] ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Kruger joined [[John Baldessari]] and [[Catherine Opie]] in leaving the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|Museum of Contemporary Art]]'s board in protest, but later returned in support of the museum's new director, Philippe Vergne, in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Boehm and Deborah Vankin (March 19, 2014), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-moca-board-news-20140319,0,7583742.story Artists return to MOCA board] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art market==
Kruger's first dealer was [[Gagosian Gallery]], with which she did two shows in Los Angeles in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt; In 1986, she was the first woman to join the prominent contemporary art gallery of [[Mary Boone]]&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Spears (August 24, 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/29/arts/design/29kruger.html Resurgent Agitprop in Capital Letters] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; and has had nine solo shows there since. Kruger is also represented by Rhona Hoffman Gallery, Chicago; and [[Sprüth Magers Berlin London]] and L&amp;M Arts in Los Angeles. In late 2011, her 1985 photo of a [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist's dummy]], ''Untitled (When I Hear the Word Culture I Take Out My Checkbook),'' was sold at [[Christie's]] for a record $902,500.&lt;ref name="online.wsj.com"/&gt;

== Supreme lawsuit ==
[[Supreme (clothing)|Supreme]], a skateboard and apparel brand established in 1994, have been accused of taking their logo, the white word "Supreme" on a red box, from Kruger's signature style. [[James Jebbia]], founder of Supreme, has admitted that the logo was taken from Barbara Kruger's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2013/05/supreme-court-the-12-greatest-moments-of-supremes-legal-battle-with-leah-mcsweeney/128|title=Supreme™ Court: The 12 Greatest Moments of Supreme's Legal Battle With Leah McSweeney|last=Deleon|first=Jian|date=May 1, 2013|website=Complex|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara herself had not commented on this issue until a recent lawsuit between Supreme and [[Leah McSweeney]], founder of Married to the Mob (MTTM), a women's street clothing brand. MTTM used the Supreme logo to make a "Supreme Bitch" logo that was printed on T-shirts and hats. In response, Kruger said, "What a ridiculous clusterfuck of totally uncool jokers. I make my work about this kind of sadly foolish farce. I'm waiting for all of them to sue me for copyright infringement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2013/05/barbara-kruger-responds-to-supremes-lawsuit-a-ridiculous-clusterfk-of-totally-uncool-jokers|title=Barbara Kruger Responds to Supreme's Lawsuit: 'A Ridiculous Clusterf**k of Totally Uncool Jokers'|last=Kamer|first=Foster|date=May 2, 2013|website=Complex|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the lawsuits were dropped on agreement that McSweeney could continue to use the words "Supreme Bitch" if it was "not in the way Barbara Kruger does."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/style/2013/07/the-war-of-supreme-vs-married-to-the-mob-has-ended-with-a-settlement|title=The Battle of Supreme™ vs. Married to the Mob is Over, and This Is Why|last=Kamer|first=Foster|date=July 1, 2013|website=Complex|access-date=March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Halloween-card-mirror-2.jpg|thumb|[[Divination]] rituals such as the one depicted on this early 20th century [[Halloween]] [[greeting card]], where a woman stares into a mirror in a darkened room to catch a glimpse of the face of her future husband, while a witch lurks in the shadows, may be one origin of the Bloody Mary legend.]]
'''Bloody Mary''' is a [[folklore]] legend consisting of a [[ghost]], phantom, or spirit [[Conjuration|conjured]] to reveal the future. She is said to appear when her name is chanted repeatedly in a mirror. The Bloody Mary [[Apparitional experience|apparition]] may be benign or malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend.  Bloody Mary appearances are mostly "witnessed" in group participation play.

==Ritual==
Historically, the [[Necromancy|ritual]] encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backward holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face.&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book | authorlink= | first=Bill| last=Ellis| title=Lucifer Ascending: The Occult in Folklore and Popular Culture| publisher=[[University of Kentucky]] Press| year=2004| isbn=978-0-8131-2289-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, a chance that they would see a [[Human skull symbolism|skull]] (or the face of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]]) instead, indicating that they were going to die before they would have the chance to marry.&lt;ref name="Ellis" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Ronald Hutton| first=Ronald| last=Hutton| title=Stations of the Sun: A History of the Ritual Year in Britain| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| year=2001| isbn=978-0-19-285448-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ritual of today, Bloody Mary allegedly appears to individuals or groups who ritualistically invoke her name in an act of [[catoptromancy]]. This is done by repeatedly chanting her name into a mirror placed in a dimly-lit or candle-lit room. In some traditions the name must be repeated thirteen times (or some other specified number of times).&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; The Bloody Mary apparition allegedly appears as a corpse, witch or ghost, can be friendly or evil, and is sometimes "seen" covered in blood. The lore surrounding the ritual states that participants may endure the apparition screaming at them, cursing them, strangling them, stealing their soul, drinking their blood,&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/horrors/a/bloody_mary.htm Bloody Mary at Urban Legends]&lt;/ref&gt; or scratching their eyes out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halloween-website.com/bloody_mary.htm ''Bloody Mary'']; www.Halloween–Website.com; retrieved November 15, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Some variations of the ritual call Bloody Mary by a different name—"Hell Mary" and "Mary Worth" are popular examples.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt; The [[Urban legend|modern legend]] of [[Hanako-san]] in Japan strongly parallels the Bloody Mary mythology.&lt;ref&gt;de Vos, Gail (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6HJwCRAlpioC&amp;pg=PA155 What Happens Next? Contemporary Urban Legends and Popular Culture]''. ABC-CLIO. p. 155. {{ISBN|1598846345}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern addition of taunting Bloody Mary regarding her baby indicates the legendary figure's conflation with the historic figure [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]], also known as "Bloody Mary", whose life was marked by a number of [[miscarriage]]s or [[False pregnancy|false pregnancies]]&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/ghosts/bloodymary.asp|title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Bloody Mary|publisher=[[Snopes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is remembered for her [[Mary I of England#Religious policy|violent religious reforms]].&lt;ref&gt;Loades, pp. 207–208; Waller, p. 65; Whitelock, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phenomenon explained==
Staring into a mirror in a dimly-lit room for a prolonged period can cause one to hallucinate.&lt;ref name="Caputo"/&gt; Facial features may appear to "melt", distort, disappear, and rotate, while other hallucinatory elements, such as animal or strange faces, may appear. Giovanni Caputo of the University of Urbino, writes that this phenomenon, which he calls the "strange-face illusion", is believed to be a consequence of a "dissociative identity effect", which causes the brain's facial-recognition system to misfire in a currently unidentified way.&lt;ref name="Caputo"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Caputo| first1=Giovanni B| year=2010| title=Strange-face-in-the-mirror illusion| journal=Perception Magazine| volume=39| issue=7| pages=1007–1008| doi=10.1068/p6466| url=http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6466| accessdate=October 18, 2012| pmid=20842976| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025085513/http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6466#| archive-date=2012-10-25| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible explanations for the phenomenon include illusions attributed, at least partially, to the perceptual effects of ''[[Troxler's fading]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5906432/an-optical-illusion-that-explains-the-origins-of-imaginary-monsters ''An Optical Illusion that Explains the Origins of Imaginary Monsters'']; accessed December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caputo"/&gt; and possibly [[Hypnosis|self-hypnosis]].

'''Bristol board''' (also referred to as '''Bristol paper''' or '''Super white paper''') is an [[Woodfree uncoated paper|uncoated]], machine-finished [[paperboard]]. It is named after the city of [[Bristol]] in the southwest of [[England]] as that is where it was first produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mixed Media Superstar: All About Bristol Board|url=https://www.craftsy.com/blog/2015/06/what-is-bristol-board/|publisher=Craftsy|accessdate=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common sizes include {{cvt|22+1/2|×|28+1/2|in|mm|0}} and its bulk thickness is {{convert|0.006|in|mm}} or higher&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoppub.about.com/library/glossary/bldef-bristolpaper.htm About.com: Desktop Publishing].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ISO 216|A4, A3, A2 and A1]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daler-rowney.com/en/content/graphic-series Daler Rowney] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831062219/http://www.daler-rowney.com/en/content/graphic-series |date=August 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studioartshop.com/acatalog/Paper_and_Pads.html Goldline pads included in product listings]&lt;/ref&gt; Bristol board may be rated by the number of [[wikt:ply|plies]] it contains or, in Europe, by its [[grammage]] of 220 to 250&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is normally white, but is also made in different colours.

==Applications==
Bristol paper is used for printing documents, [[brochures]], promotional materials and [[envelopes]]. It is often used for water color painting. It is also used for [[paperback]] book or catalog covers, [[file folders]], tags, and [[Ticket (admission)|tickets]]. Another use is for scale models; some students use this kind of paper for the walls in their scale models. One-ply Bristol is thin enough to be translucent, and two and three ply bristol are the most popular thicknesses. 

Bristol board is commonly used for [[technical drawing]], [[illustration]] projects, [[comic book]] art, and other two-dimensional art forms. It provides two working surfaces, front and back. This quality separates it from illustration board, which has only a front working surface. 

The surface texture is either '''plate''' or '''vellum'''. ''Plate'' finish is as smooth as glass{{fact|date=November 2018}}, and is very good for pen and ink. ''Vellum'' (or ''kid'') finish is a medium texture more appropriate to friction-based media, such as crayon, chalks, or charcoal. A third finish, ''engravers'' or ''wedding'', may be used for formal [[engraving|engraved]] wedding invitations.

[[Image:Broad Ave Binghampton Memphis TN 1.jpg|thumb|Broad Avenue in 2010]]
'''Broad Avenue''' is a street and [[arts district]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], known for its transformation from a collection of vacant storefronts to a vibrant arts district in less than a decade.

==History==
Broad Avenue was originally the main street of [[Binghampton, Memphis|Binghampton]], a small [[railroad town]] chartered in 1895. In 1919, the city was [[annexed]] by [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], and Broad Avenue gradually fell into disrepair. In the mid-2000s, various efforts were organized to bring the street back into use. From 2007 to 2012, the street became a vibrant arts district as local businesses began to occupy the then-vacant storefronts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2010/nov/23/editorial-broad-avenue-struts-its-stuff/ |title=Editorial: Broad Avenue struts its stuff|publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2010 a two-day "demonstration" was arranged in which the still vacant storefronts along Broad were temporarily filled with local vendors and stores in order to show what the street had the potential to become.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmctv.com/Global/story.asp?S=13521178 |title=Taking Back Our Neighborhoods: A New Face for an Old Broad - Action News 5 - Memphis, Tennessee |publisher=Wmctv.com |date=2012-10-02 |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
In May 2011, French artist Guillaume Alby painted a large 1,800-square-foot geometrically styled mural on the 2500 block of Broad Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey |first=Thomas |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/may/07/wall-power/ |title=Muralist transforms warehouse wall along Broad Avenue |publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of other art projects followed. These included another mural on a warehouse wall facing the street and the lighting-up of the iconic watertower which identifies Broad Avenue, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bailey |first=Thomas |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/mar/17/2-art-projects-will-brighten-broad-ave/ |title=2 art projects will brighten Broad Ave. |publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also home to a bi-annual art walk, in which local artists display their wares along the street. The event is accompanied by free music and food from local restaurants and bakeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memphisconnect.com/2012/04/12/21335/ |title=Spring Art Walk on Broad Avenue Friday |publisher=MemphisConnect |date=2012-04-12 |accessdate=2012-10-06 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cycling==
Broad Avenue is currently the home of the Memphis Greenline (cycling path) headquarters, and was used as an early demonstration of proposed bike lanes for the city of Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memphisdailynews.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=54312 |title=Broad Ambitions |publisher=Memphis Daily News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420160055/http://www.memphisdailynews.com/editorial/Article.aspx?id=54312 |archivedate=2013-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration, which proved to be a success (resulting in the permanent addition of bike lanes) was arranged by [[Livable Memphis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.bikeleague.org/blog/2010/11/a-better-block-on-broad/ |title=Bikeleague.org Blog » Blog Archive » A Better Block on Broad |publisher=Blog.bikeleague.org |date=2010-11-22 |accessdate=2012-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006044431/http://blog.bikeleague.org/blog/2010/11/a-better-block-on-broad/ |archivedate=2012-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, it was proposed as a connector for cyclists between [[Overton Park]] and [[Shelby Farms Park]], two key locations in Memphis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patterson |first=Sara |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2011/jul/10/greenline-could-get-link-to-midtown |title=Shelby Farms Greenline could get link to Midtown Memphis |publisher=The Commercial Appeal |date= |accessdate=2012-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14318">'''Cheriyal Scroll Painting''' is a stylized version of [[Nakashi art]], rich in the local motifs peculiar to the [[Telangana]]. They are at present made only in [[Hyderabad]], [[Telangana]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff Reporter|title=Sankranthi Saahitya Sangeetha Festival|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/17/stories/2007011719050200.htm|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=17 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[scroll]]s are painted in a narrative format, much like a film roll or a comic strip, depicting stories from Indian mythology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rajan|first=Anjana|title=Retelling the Ramayana|url=http://www.hindu.com/ms/2008/12/16/stories/2008121650010100.htm|accessdate=6 December 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and intimately tied to the shorter stories from the Puranas and Epics. Earlier, these paintings were prevalent across Andhra, as also various other parts of the country, albeit flavoured with their distinct styles and other local peculiarities dictated by the local customs and traditions. In the same way, [[Cheriyal]] scrolls must have been popular across [[Telangana]] in earlier times, though with the advent of television, cinemas and computers it has been fenced into its last outpost, the [[Cheriyal]] town.

[[File:Cherial 1.jpg|thumbnail|A contemporary Cheriyal Scroll painting]]

==History==
Scroll paintings have a rich history and play an important role in the Asian artistic tradition. In China, scroll paintings were part of the sophisticated traditions of the nobility and the courts. In India however, the scroll painting was the prerogative of the itinerant bard and the village artist, in essence a folk tradition of the villages.

In India, each region and village developed its own scroll painting traditions, marked by characteristic content, form and technique depending on the local ethos, patronage and socio-economic conditions. Rajasthan is known for its ''Pabuji ki Pad'', ''Devenarayana katha'' as also stories from the legend of ''Dhola and Maru''. Goa evolved the ''Dasavathara'', as Maharashtra did ''Pinguli'' and the ''Chitra Katha'' traditions. Maharashtra and Gujarat are also known for a sophisticated scroll painting tradition called the ''Prasasti Patra''. Orissa and Bengal are famous for their ''Patachitra'' traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Scroll Paintings of Bengal: Art in the Village By Amitabh Sengupta published by AuthorHouse&lt;/ref&gt;

While the above-mentioned traditions could have significantly influenced the Cheriyal scroll paintings and artists, the [[Cheriyal]] paintings were and continue to be a distinctly local invention, peculiar to the [[Telangana]] region, drawing mainly on local traditions. It can safely be said that the local temple art traditions and the [[Kalamkari]] tradition across [[Telangana]] in particular, and the graphic art traditions of the Deccan and South India in general were the major influences that shaped and guided the art of scroll paintings. However, it should also be remembered that the sphere of activity, subject and artistic idiom of every scroll painting including that of Cheriyal is peculiar and confined to the village or habitment.

To quote from A. L. Dallaiccola's South Indian Paintings- A catalogue of the British Museum collection - ''Although in the past the majority of Indian people might have been illiterate, they were not uneducated. They were taught the principles ruling their religious and social life through the recitation of stories drawn from the epics, the puranas and other religious texts... In the past, the retelling of these stories provided the education of the unlettered, and the discourses were accompanied by visual aids: scrolls, painted cloth hangings, sets of paintings, and wooden boxes with folding, concertina-like doors painted with scenes from the 'career' of a deity, such as the portable shrine from [[Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh|Tirupati]] that is now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]]... The earliest known reference to the picture showmen is found in [[Patanjali]]'s ''Mahabhashya'' (2nd century BC). Commenting on the passage on the historic present in [[A. R. Raja Raja Varma|Panini]]'s grammar, the ''Ashtadhyayi'' (c. 5th century BC), [[Patanjali]] takes as an example some picture showmen who are discussing the killing of Kamsa at the hands of Krishna... There is also a specific mention of a picture showing Kamsa being dragged by the hair and beaten by Krishna. Numerous references to picture showmen and painted scrolls occur in literary sources. The scrolls showing the torments of hell, ''yamapattaka'', seem to have been particularly popular.''&lt;ref name="MuseumDallapiccola2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=British Museum|author2=Anna Libera Dallapiccola|title=South Indian Paintings: A Catalogue of the British Museum Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FIzWapiacQcC&amp;pg=PA78|publisher=Mapin Publishing Pvt Ltd|isbn=978-0-7141-2424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mandhets were the itinerant bards and performers of Andhra Pradesh while the Nakashis were the artists. The Nakashis of [[Telangana]] also made dolls, much like the [[Kinnal]] dolls of Karnataka, in addition to the painted scrolls. These scrolls were a very important part of the sociological and cultural setting of [[Telangana]]. As these paintings are now confined to [[Cheriyal]] village, they are called [[Cheriyal]] scrolls. In earlier times, the scrolls were a colourful backdrop to the equally interesting oral traditions of the common people, - the village hajjam-barber, toddy tapper, dhobhi-washerman, chamar-leatherworker, fisherman, weaver and farmer: (''Madiga, Goud, Mudiraju, Malas, Padmashali, Chakala and Mangali''&lt;ref&gt;Folk Painting Traditions of India by Sarita Chauhan Booklet series - 52 published by Institute for Social Democracy http://www.isd.net.in/Publication/Booklet/2012/Booklet_52.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;) the seven working and marginalised castes and communities of the village. The scrolls set out the adventures and exploits of local folk heroes who performed on the fringes of the epics, Puranas, etc. of the Hindu 'Greater Tradition'. Each community had its peculiarities and its favourite heroes and heroines as also selection of stories from local Mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;http://jigyasa0.tripod.com/folk.html Jagdish and Kamla Mittal Museum of Indian Art&lt;/ref&gt; It was also customary to sacrifice a goat after the recitation of the story from the scroll in some communities.

==Present times==
At present, Cheriyal painting work is continuing  by
the families of D. Vaikuntam, D.Nageshar, D.Venkataramana,
D.Pavan Kumar.
Dhanalokota Vaikuntam started learning work
from his father Venkataramiah and elder brother Chandraiah at
the age of 12. He studied intermediate and at present he is
living at Hyderabad. He got married with vanaja at the age of
20. After the marriage with Vaikuntam, vanaja also started
doing Cherial painting. He trained to his children Sarika,
Rakesh and Vinay Kumar. He received many awards and
certificates for his excellency in Cherial painting.

Today the long stories from the local mythologies have been cut short, as the traditional patrons for the long scrolls no longer exist. The artists have been forced to adapt and nowadays they paint smaller versions of the scrolls, depicting a single episode or character from the traditional stories. These are amenable to framing and can be hung on walls in modern homes. Further, the colours are no longer prepared in the traditional manner. While earlier, they used natural white extracted from sea shells, black from lampsoot and yellow from turmeric. However, the traditional art continues to linger and survive and even has been a source of inspiration to contemporary artists like Laxman Aelay&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehansindia.com/posts/index/2013-10-06/Painting-a-new--narrative-73269&lt;/ref&gt; of Kadirengudam village of Andhra Pradesh.

==The Tradition==
[[File:Cherial 5.jpg|thumbnail|left|Contemporary Cheriyal Dolls]]
The traditional art form became an inseparable part of the profession of the story-telling, balladeer community known as ''Kaki Padagollu''. They displayed the scrolls and accompanied by music and dance went from village to village narrating and singing their ballads based from their rich folklore which was rooted in the [[Puranas]] and Indian Epics, enlivening many a lazy village evening.

In a typical recitation, the storyteller-balladeer would  wander from village to village in a team of usually five people, with two to narrate the story while the others would provide a simple but hectic musical accompaniment with the harmonium, tabala and castanets. The stage would also be a simple affair (many times even to the extent of being a rough and ready fixture), erected on four poles with a horizontal bar on which the scrolls could be displayed.
 
[[File:Cheriyal painting - toddy tappers.jpg|thumb|A traditional Cheriyal scroll painting depicting the legends of the toddy tapper community. Circa 18th - 19th century.]]

The scroll would flow like a film roll. It was generally about 
three feet in width and went up to 40 – 45 feet in length, depending upon the story. The traditional scrolls are normally in vertical format, illustrating stories in a series of horizontal panels. A floral border in the middle separates the two panels, while the linear narrative is demonstrated by holding in both hands or suspending it from a tree or a building and continually rolling it. Like large sized comic strips, each panel of the scroll depicted one part of the story. Hence, a scroll would easily have around 50 panels. As the bard would narrate the story, the panel depicting that particular part of the story would be displayed. The choice of episodes and iconography of each deity was painted, keeping in mind the caste for which the scroll was made.

[[File:Cherial 3.jpg|thumbnail|left|A modern Cheriyal painting in making]]

By virtue of its distinct traditional style and characteristics [[Cheriyal]] Paintings were recently given a Geographical Indications (GI) tag. There are very few artists remaining who continue to paint using this unique technique. A recent innovation has been the painting of single pictures (as opposed to a continuous scroll) meant for wall decorations.

== Process ==
The making of the canvas is a very elaborate procedure. The [[Khadi]] cotton is treated with a mixture of starch (from rice), suddha matti (white mud), a paste of boiled tamarind seeds and gum water thrice. It has to be ensured that every coating is thoroughly dried before the next one is applied.
Once the canvas is ready, the artists sketch the outline directly onto the canvas using a brush. The outlines are very well defined and sharply reflecting the quality and experience of the craftsman.
The colors are made by the artists from natural sources. Brushes are made with hair of squirrels tied to a stick.
Dolls and masks are made of wood, saw dust and tamarind paste. Masks are made even with coconut shells.

[[File:Cherial 4.jpg|thumbnail|Contemporary Cheriyal Dolls]]

== Characteristics ==
Cheriyal Paintings can be easily recognised by the following peculiarities and unique characteristics:

• Painted in vivid hues, mostly primary colors, with a predominance of red in the background, the paintings are characterised by the unbridled imagination of the local artisans who were not constrained by the academic rigour that characterised the more classical [[Tanjore painting]] and [[Mysore painting]]. For example, the artist hardly bothers about perspective in Cheriyal paintings and sets out the narrative by placing the relevant figures in appropriate order and position in the relevant background. The iconography of even the major deities like Shiva, Vishnu, etc. has a strong local idiom.

•The subjects of these scroll paintings are easy to relate to – as the themes and stories are familiar – drawn from ancient literary, mythological and folk traditions. The common themes are from the Krishna Leela, Ramayana, Mahabharata, Shiva Puranam, Markandeya Puranam interspersed with the ballads and folk-stories of communities like Gauda, Madiga and so on.

• The main narrative is spiced up with scenes from simple rural life - Women doing chores in the kitchen, men working in the paddy fields or boozing away in merry abandon, festival scenes, etc. are endearingly depicted.

• The costumes and settings in which the figures are depicted are typical and  reflect the culture of Andhra, where these paintings originated.

• Within the narrow panels, proportion is created by depicting trees, or a building, a pillar with drawn curtains, etc. However more often than not, the proportion of individual characters is determined by their relative importance in that particular scene, with the most important character being the largest and most detailed and the lesser characters being smaller and less detailed.

==GI rights==
Cheriyal scroll painting received  Intellectual Property Rights Protection or [[Geographical Indication]] (GI) status in 2007.

'''Color symbolism''' in [[art]] and [[anthropology]] refers to the use of color as a [[symbol]] in various [[Culture|cultures]]. There is great diversity in the use of colors and their associations between cultures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith|first=N.S. |last2=Whitfield|first2=T.W.A. |last3=Wiltshire|first3=T.J. |date=April 1990 |title=The accuracy of the NCS, DIN, and OSA-UCS colour atlases |journal=Color Research &amp; Application |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=111–116 |doi=10.1002/col.5080150209 |issn=0361-2317}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even within the same culture in different time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Color psychology and color therapy: a factual study of the influence of color on human life |last=Birren |first=Faber |date=2006 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=978-1425424107 |location=Whitefish, MT |oclc=74452551}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same color may have very different associations within the same culture at any time. Diversity in color symbolism occurs because color meanings and symbolism occur on an individual, cultural and universal basis. Color symbolism is also context-dependent and influenced by changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Color symbolism |doi=10.5040/9781501303364.ch-014 |title=Color Studies |editor1=Edith Anderson Feisner |editor2=Ronald Reed |edition=3rd |year=2016 |publisher=Bloomsbury |location=New York |isbn=978-1-50130-336-4 |oclc=1053938255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic representations of religious concepts or articles may include a specific color with which the concept or object is associated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |language=de |title=Encyclopaedia Britannica|doi=10.1163/9789004337862_lgbo_com_050367 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence to suggest that colors have been used for this purpose as early as 90,000 BC.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Color symbolism in marketing==
Color plays an important role in setting expectations for a product and communicating its key characteristics.&lt;ref name=Asiam&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Aslam |first=Mubeen M. |date=2006 |title=Are You Selling the Right Colour? A Cross‐Cultural Review of Colour as a Marketing Cue |journal=Journal of Marketing Communications |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=15–30 |doi=10.1080/13527260500247827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color is the second most important element that allows consumers to identify brand packaging.&lt;ref name=Popa&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popa|first=C.N. |last2=Popescu|first2=S. |last3=Berehoiu|first3=R.M.T. |last4=Berehoiu|first4=S.M.T. |date=2013 |title=Considerations regarding use and role of colour in marketing |url=http://managementjournal.usamv.ro/pdf/vol.XIII/Art44.pdf |journal= Scientific Papers Series - Management, Economic Engineering in Agriculture and Rural Development |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=269–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketers for products with an international market navigate the color symbolism variances between cultures with targeted advertising. The car manufacturer, Volkswagen ran a commercial in Italy with a black sheep in the middle of a larger flock symbolizing those who owned a VW Golf as someone unique and self-assured among a crowd of others who were not. In several cultures around the world, a black sheep represents an outcast and is seen as something undesirable. In Italy, a black sheep represents confidence and independence.[[File:Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017.jpg|thumb|Friaul Val Aupa Drentus Sheep credit Kaspar Nickles 2017]] There are many additional variances in color symbolism between cultures. Cold is symbolized by blue in East Asia, the USA, and Sweden while warmth is symbolized by yellow in the USA and by blue in The Netherlands. Sometimes the meanings of colors are in stark opposition across geographic boundaries, requiring products marketed to specific demographics to account for those changes across different markets. For instance, feminity is symbolized by blue in The Netherlands and pink in the USA., whereas masculinity is symbolized by blue in Sweden and the USA, and red in the UK and France.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt; In some instances color symbolism in marketing is constructed. For companies whose products are defined by the name of their color their sales are susceptible to the symbolism and association of that name. In one example, a company selling a paint color named “off white” more than doubled its sales by renaming the same color as “ancient silk.”&lt;ref name=Popa/&gt;

==Conceptualizations of colors cross-culturally==
Color symbolism has morphed over time. Between the 5th and 17th centuries color was largely related to in a religious context. Blue was symbolic of heaven and white of purity. Today, purity is still symbolized by white in Australia and the USA but by blue in other countries like India. Similarly, the church influenced the perception of colors like crimson and purple. Largely because the dyes for these colors could only be sourced from precious pigments, religious figures like Madonna, Cardinals, and the Virgin were seen in scarlet and purple. [[File:Vatican II - Dubois - Liénart.JPG|thumb|Vatican II - Dubois - Liénart]]Today, purple symbolizes evil and infidelity in Japan, but the same is symbolized by blue in East Asia and by yellow in France. Additionally, the sacred color of Hindu and Buddhist monks is orange. [[File:Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap.jpg|thumb|Preah Pithu T Monks - Siem Reap]] The Renaissance was also a time in which black and purple were colors of mourning. Today, Mourning or death is symbolized by white in East Asia, black in the USA, and blue in Iran, while happiness is symbolized by white in Australia and NZ, and yellow in China.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

There is a general disagreement over whether reactions to color and their symbolism are a result of cultural conditioning or of instinct. Several studies concluded that color is part of the social learning process because of the significant symbolism within the culture. High quality, trustworthiness and dependability are symbolized by blue in the USA, Japan, Korea and green and yellow in China - as well as purple in China, South Korea and Japan. Because of these variances, critical cues vary across cultures. Warning signs are coded differently as danger is symbolized by green in Malaysia, and red in the USA and Mexico. The same color of green symbolizes envy in Belgium and the USA, but envy is symbolized by yellow in Germany and Russia, and purple in Mexico. Even the colors that denote powerful emotions vary. Love is symbolized by green in Japan, red and purple in China, Korea, Japan and the USA. Unluckiness is symbolized by red in Chad, Nigeria and Germany. Luckiness is symbolized by red in China, Denmark and Argentina. The traditional bridal color is red in China and white in the USA. Ambition and desire are symbolized by red in India.&lt;ref name=Asiam/&gt;

== Color symbolism in Arabic culture ==
Color has different meanings in different countries.  We can specifically look at the Arabic culture and take it into consideration. We can start with the color white. In the Arabic culture, white is thought of as the color that is symbolic for nature.  Since it related with nature, it has a meaning that is one of positivity. It also relates with that of being clean and pure.  White is a color that is commonly worn during prayers and with that, it symbolizes purity. White’s positive connotation carries out into other aspects.  It is also used as a symbol for positivity in the future. White is also used to symbolize the end of war. You will also see women adorn white at their weddings as a sign of positivity.  Since doves are white, they share the symbolic meaning that comes with the color.  This in turn causes them to be associated with positivity of good news. 

When you look at the color Black in Arabic culture you can find that it is related to funerals and death. Women will often wear black to funerals in order to show that they are sad for those who have passed.  Also relating to death, black is associated with hell. Black is also used to symbolize dark.  Hell is thought to be a dark black place associating black as negative.  Black in general is looked at as having negative connotations around it. For example, the symbolism of a black heart refers to someone who is unkind.  
[[File:Red rose with black background.jpg|thumb]]
Green is a color that is commonly found in Islam.  It is a color found in nature and with this, it is associated with and represents goodness. Green is a color that has an overall positive meaning.   The color green also has to do with truthfulness, again going with positivity.  If you look at phrases, the symbolic meanings are generally positive.  If you look at the phrase green hand, it relates to being generous which is a positive thing. 

Red has an overall positive association with it. Often you will find that red is a color associated with roses and blood.  The color red has to do with love and passion.  In sayings you can find it to have either a negative or positive meaning such as the term red eye relates with anger.  The Arabic culture also associates this color with death.

Blue is related with positivity when discussing it with nature, otherwise it can be related with negative connotations. When used in the phrase blue eyes, it refers to jealousy. A blue body relates with death and therefore is associated with negativity.

Yellow is another color that is also associated with nature and the sun.  Again, since it is a color related with nature, it takes on the symbolic meaning of positivity.  Gold is also categorized under here and is also takes on a positive meaning.  Generally, when used in phrases, the color yellow has to do with negativity.  For example, a yellow smile means to be mean.

==Colors and emotions==
[[File:Emotions - 3.png|thumb]]
Color symbolism is displayed in many ways. One of the most common ways we see color symbolism displayed in through our emotions. In this article Color-emotions associations: Past experience and personal preference it takes a look at how we connect colors with our emotions and how it depends on a person’s preference and or their past experiences. 
	This article first starts out by talking about the different colors and what they are associated with. The first color it talks about is the color blue and how people see blue as comfort and security and how they see orange as being upsetting. The next one they talk about is yellow which is more of a happy color compared to purple which they say is dignified but I have never heard of purple being seen that way. The next one this article talks about which I find very interesting is the color red. People view the color red in two different ways, one being as a strong and passionate color. However, it is also seen in a very different way, people see it as an aggressive color because it is the color of blood. The last color this article talks about is the color green and how just like red it has two different views. Green can be viewed positively as in quietness but can also be viewed negatively as in guilt. 
	This study took a look at how we associate colors with emotions. This study was done and showed that we associated lighter colors such as blue or yellow with more positive emotions. It then showed how we associated darker colors such as grey or black with more native emotions. However, something very interesting that this study did find is that most young prefer the color black over many other colors. 
	The study was done with college aged students to see how they associate their emotions with colors. Many tests were done such as matching tasks and matching color tests to see what colors they associate with their emotions. The study had 44 men and 54 women in it and they again were all college students. They identified a color sample with one emotion only and it showed what emotional response is connected to a color. 
	The results from this study did find that people mostly associate the color green with being the most positive. Over 95% off people said that green s the most positive because it makes them feel relaxed and then comfortable and at peace. It also showed that people saw yellow as the more excited and energetic emotion, with over 90% agreeing with this. 79% of students found that blue was a calming color because it reminded them of the ocean which is known as a calming place. People did have different answers when it came to red because like explained earlier, red is seen in two very different ways, It has been seen as love by many but also as evil because it remind people of blood. Many people did not seem to like the color purple very much as it was not favored by many for their preferences. The color black was seen to be more negative emotions like fear and depression. Overall, this article shows how color can be important because it is how people associate their emotions and things based on color symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Kaya &amp; H., Naz &amp; Helen.

In a '''cumulative tale''', sometimes also called a '''chain tale''', action or dialogue repeats and builds up in some way as the tale progresses. With only the sparest of plots, these tales often depend upon repetition and rhythm for their effect, and can require a skilled storyteller to negotiate their tongue-twisting repetitions in performance.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Ashliman|first= D.L.|authorlink=D. L. Ashliman|editor= Donald. Haase|encyclopedia= The Greenwood encyclopedia of folktales and fairy tales |title=Chain Tale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9KEk9wQPjkC|publisher= Greenwood Press|isbn= 978-0-313-33441-2|page= 176}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climax is sometimes abrupt and sobering as in "[[The Gingerbread Man]]."   The device often takes the form of a [[cumulative song]] or [[nursery rhyme]]. Many cumulative tales feature a series of animals or forces of nature each more powerful than the last.

==History==
Cumulative tales have a long pedigree. In an early Jewish [[Midrash]], considered to date from the sixth century AD, [[Abraham]] is brought before King [[Nimrod]], who commands him to worship fire.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Nimrod#Text of the Midrash Raba version|Text of the Midrash Raba version]]. This is not itself a cumulative tale, though many cumulative tales seem to echo its theme.&lt;/ref&gt; Abraham replies that it would be more reasonable to worship water, which can quench fire and is therefore more powerful. When this premise is granted, he points out that the clouds, as sustainers of water, are more worthy of worship, and then that the wind that disperses them is more powerful still. Finally he confronts Nimrod with the observation that "man can stand up against the wind or shield himself behind the walls of his house" ([[Genesis Rabba]] xxxviii).

There is a similar tale, [[The Mouse Turned into a Maid]], in the [[Panchatantra]], in which the mouse-maid is successively introduced to the sun, the cloud, the wind and the mountain. She prefers each in turn as stronger than the last, but finally a mouse is found to be stronger than even the mountain, and so she marries the mouse. Stories of this type, such as the Japanese [[The Husband of the Rat's Daughter]], are widely diffused.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. L. Ashliman]], "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type2031c.html The Mouse Who Was to Marry the Sun: fables of Aarne-Thompson type 2031C]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
In the [[Aarne-Thompson]] classification system, types 2000-2100 are all cumulative tales, including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/folktexts.html D. L. Ashliman's page of story types]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6091">'''Dancing England''' was a series of showcase traditional dance concerts held at the Derby Assembly Rooms from 1979 to 1987. They were devised and curated by Phil Heaton and John Shaw, members of the Black Cap Sword Dancers, and two very notable characters on the Nottingham and Derby folk and dance scene of the 1970s. Dancing England was set up to showcase the best of traditional dance in the UK, along with unique and/or interesting folk customs to celebrate the UK's wide cultural heritage.

==Dancing England gone by==

In 1979 Phil and John of Black Cap decided to hold a 'Feast' and invite the best dancers from across the UK as their guests, and so the idea of Dancing England was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-nut.net/articles/phil.php] The Nut on the Web. Retrieved on 2016-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

The event was held in the evening and consisted of a series of performances by dance teams across all the styles of UK traditional dance; [[Morris dance|Cotswold Morris]], [[Rapper sword]], [[Long Sword dance|Longsword]], North West, [[Clog dance (British)|step clog dancing]], [[Border Morris|Border]], [[Molly dance|Molly]], and much more. There were also performances by [[Mummers play|mummers]] and [[Pace Egg play|Pace Eggers]], musicians and from some of the more idiosyncratic traditional teams; notably [[Britannia Coco-nut Dancers|The Britannia Coconut Dancers]], [[Abbots Bromley Horn Dance|Abbotts Bromley Horn Dancers]] and the [[Whittlesey#Whittlesea Straw Bear|Whittlesey Straw Bear]]. There were stalls selling music, ephemera and crafts, films, workshops and talks. The event was refreshed with plenty of real ale, and finished with a ceilidh late at night.

==Daughter of Dancing England==

After Dancing England came to an end in 1987, there was a brief reprise in 1993 at the same venue for the Daughter of Dancing England event. This only ran for one year, and both Dancing England and Daughter of same were sadly missed.

==The Dancing England Rapper Tournament (DERT)==

Dancing England featured a rapper sword competition in the afternoon prior to the evening concert, in homage to the Newcastle Tournament of Music and Art which was held in the city from just after the Great War until the 1950s. Following the sad demise of Dancing England in 1987, the competition continued under the name of [[Dancing England Rapper Tournament|DERT]] and now travels around the country being hosted by a different rapper sword team every year.

==The modern Dancing England Series, 2017 onwards==

2019 - Nottingham Playhouse; Saturday 26th January 2019

2017 - Sheffield City Hall; Saturday 18 February 2017.

The neighborhood is bounded by [[Brooklyn Bridge Park]] to the north, the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to the west, [[Brooklyn Heights]] to the south and Vinegar Hill to the east. Dumbo is part of [[Brooklyn Community Board 2]].

The area was originally a [[ferry]] landing, characterized by 19th- and early 20th-century industrial and warehouse buildings, [[Sett (paving)|Belgian block]] streets, and its location on the East River by the imposing anchorage of the Manhattan Bridge. The entirety of Dumbo was bought by developer [[David Walentas]] and his company Two Trees Management in the late 20th century, and remade into an upscale residential and commercial community—first becoming a haven for art [[Art museum|galleries]], and currently a center for technology [[Startup company|startups]].

The large community of tech startups earned DUMBO the nickname of "the center of the Brooklyn Tech Triangle". In that time, Dumbo had become Brooklyn's most expensive neighborhood, as well as New York City's fourth-richest community overall; this is owing in part to its large concentration of technology [[Startup company|startups]], its close proximity to Manhattan, and its large number of former industrial buildings that have been converted into spacious [[luxury real estate|luxury]] residential [[lofts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Nonko | first=Emily | title=The 8 Most Expensive Neighborhoods in New York City | website=New York.com | date=January 27, 2015 | url=http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971 | accessdate=November 7, 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029075613/http://www.newyork.com/articles/real-estate/the-most-expensive-neighborhoods-in-new-york-city-75971/ | archivedate=October 29, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood is the corporate headquarters for e-commerce retailer [[Etsy]] and home furnishing stores company [[West Elm]].

In the 1890s, the western portion of the neighborhood was known as [[Fulton Landing]], after the [[ferry]] stop that connected it to Manhattan before the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] opened. At that time, it was primarily a manufacturing district, with warehouses and factories that made machinery, paper boxes and [[Brillo]] soap pads. The area has been known variously as Rapailie, Olympia, and Walentasville.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The [[cardboard box]] was invented in the Robert Gair building on Washington Street by Robert Gair, a Scottish emigrant; because of Gair's fame, the area was known as Gairsville for a long time.&lt;ref name="DumboNYC"/&gt; The Gair building is now home to [[Etsy]].&lt;ref name="usa"/&gt;&gt;

The [[Jay Street Connecting Railroad]] ran through Dumbo's waterfront from circa 1904–1906 through 1957. It ran from rail yards beneath the Manhattan and Brooklyn Bridges to buildings near the waterfront in Dumbo and Vinegar Hill. At the height of operations, it had spurs into several buildings, a [[car float bridge]] on Bridge Street, and a yard with capacity of 120 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jay Street Terminal / Jay Street Connecting Railroad | website=TrainWeb.org | date=November 30, 2017 | url=http://members.trainweb.com/bedt/indloco/jst.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/the-jay-street-connecting-railroad/|title=The Jay Street Connecting Railroad|first=William|last=Bryk|date=April 22, 2003|work=NY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were abandoned in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RAIL LINE TO END ITS BROOKLYN RUN; Jay Street Connecting Road Allowed to Discontinue Operations in Harbor | website=The New York Times | date=April 16, 1959 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/04/16/archives/rail-line-to-end-its-brooklyn-run-jay-street-connecting-road.html | access-date=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the railroad's tracks are still visible on streets in Dumbo.&lt;ref name=NYPress-JSC-2003/&gt;

With the [[deindustrialization]] of New York City, Dumbo began to become primarily residential; artists and other young homesteaders seeking relatively large and inexpensive [[loft apartment]] spaces for studios and homes began moving there in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt; The acronym "Dumbo" arose in 1978, when new residents coined it in the belief such an unattractive name would help deter developers.&lt;ref name="nyt2007-12-25"/&gt;

Near the end of the 20th century, as property became more and more expensive in Manhattan, Dumbo became increasingly [[gentrification|gentrified]]. Even so, the acronym 'Dumbo' was largely unknown as late as 1997, and the area itself was very inclusive, serving mainly as an enclave for artists located along the [[East River]] and under the [[Manhattan Bridge]]. At this stage there were still many air conditioner repair shops, auto shops, and "seedy back alleys and wharves"; and, because the neighborhood was still gentrifying from its industrial past, it lacked even a bookstore, coffee shop, or [[Self-service laundry|laundromat]].&lt;ref name="nyt 19971010"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3DC153CF933A25753C1A961958260&amp;pagewanted=all "As It Turns Artistic, A Noirish Enclave Steps Into the Light"].

The DUMBO Historic District, a historic industrial complex and national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] in Dumbo, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2000.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; It consists of 95 contributing buildings; the manufacturing concerns located in this district included [[Benjamin Moore &amp; Co.]] (paint), Arbuckle Brothers (coffee and sugar), J.W.

'''Family folklore''' is the branch of [[folkloristics]] concerned with the study and use of [[folklore]] and traditional [[culture]] transmitted within a family group. This includes items of material culture, crafts produced by family members or memorabilia saved as reminders or remainders of significant family events. It also includes family photos and photo albums in paper and electronic format, along with bundles of other pages held for posterity: certificates, letters, journals, notes and shopping lists. Family stories and sayings, originally recounting actual events, are told and retold until the historical facts give way to a distilled expression of common identity. Family customs are performed, modified, forgotten, created or resurrected with alarming frequency; each time with the goal of defining and solidifying the perception of this family as unique, distinct and different from other families.

Family folklore has long been included in the documentation of the folklore of regional, ethnic, religious or occupational groups.&lt;ref name="FamilyFolklore"&gt;Margaret R. Yocum (1997). "Family Folklore", pg. 279. In ''Folklore An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'', ed. Thomas Green. California / ABC-CLIO.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only since the 1970s that this lore has also been investigated as a defining element of the family group itself. Heralded by a call from Mody Boatright to document the "family saga" in 1958,&lt;ref name="Boatright"&gt;Mody C. Boatright (1958). "The Family Saga as a Form of Folklore". In ''The Family Saga and Other Phases of American Folklore'', eds. Mody C. Boatright, Robert B. Downs, and John T. Flanagan. Urbana / University of Illinois Press.&lt;/ref&gt; folklorists responded with published accounts of stories and traditions passed down in their own families.&lt;ref name="Garrett"&gt;Kim S. Garrett (1961), "Family Stories and Sayings", pp 273–281. In ''Publications of the Texas Folklore Society'', Vol. XXX.&lt;/ref&gt; L. Karen Baldwin’s unpublished dissertation (1975)&lt;ref name="Baldwin"&gt;L. Karen Baldwin (1975). ''Down on Bugger Run: Family Group and the Social Base of Folklore''. University of Pennsylvania / Unpublished Dissertation. &lt;/ref&gt; laid further theoretical groundwork for family folklore "… not only is the family a folk group, it is the first folk group anyone belongs to."&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;Polly Stewart (2008), "Karen Baldwin (1943 - 2007)", pp. 485–486. In ''Journal of American Folklore'', Vol. 121, Fall 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field has since blossomed, broadening to include an ever expanding understanding of family. The conventional extended family, consisting of a heterosexual married couple with children and grandparents now incorporates gay partners, unmarried committed relationships and children adopted or born through non-traditional methods and procedures. The family traditions themselves are transformed to meet the needs and expectations of these new members and new relationships. 

The study of family folklore is distinct from family [[genealogy]] or family history. Instead of focusing on historical dates, locations and verifiable events, its unique stories, customs and handicrafts identify the family as a distinct social group. At the same time, the family lore passed along has been molded and transformed to relay a sense of family identity and set of values both within and without the family group. The family lore defines the family story.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;For an individual family, folklore is its creative expression of a common past. As raw experiences are transformed into family stories, expression, and photos, they are codified in forms which can easily be recalled, retold, and enjoyed. Their drama and beauty are heightened, and the family’s past becomes accessible as it is reshaped according to its needs and desires. … Its stories, photographs, and traditions are personalized and often creative distillations of experience, worked and reworked over time.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin"&gt;Steven J. Zeitlin, Amy J. Kotkin, and Holly Cutting Baker (1993). ''A Celebration of American Family Folklore: Tales and Traditions from the Smithsonian Collection'', pg. 2. Cambridge / Yellow Moon. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Family as a folk group ==
A new baby is born or a child is adopted into an established [[family]] group, which contains a microcosm of social alignments found in many larger groups: the vertical relationship between grandparents and grandchildren, the horizontal relationship between siblings and cousins of a generation or age group, clusters of girls or boys and skill-based family alliances.&lt;ref name="Toelken"&gt; [[Barre Toelken]] (1996). ''The Dynamics of Folklore'', pp 196–197. Utah / Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sims"&gt; Sims, Martha C., Martine Stephens (2005). ''Living Folklore'', pg 31. Utah / Utah State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The child grows up in this family, sees and learns the family lore as it is performed throughout the seasons and the life cycle. Not only is the family the first folk group of the child, it is "the group in which important primary folkloric socialization takes place and individual aesthetic preference patterns for folkloric exchange are set."&lt;ref name="FamilyFolklore" /&gt;

The dynamics of family folklore remain unsettled not only through the addition of newborns and adoptions, but more particularly by the regular incorporation of new adult family members through each marriage or committed relationship. In the formation of each new family node, a unique subset and combination of the customs and traditions of both families is incorporated into a new story, both modifying and enriching the current family lore. 

As part of the ongoing national discussion of "family" and what it means, family folklore redefines itself as well. Along with the classic family "father-mother-child(ren)", it expands to include single-parent families, blended families, communes, gay and lesbian families. The indicator for family now includes any group which self-identifies as a family based on intimacy, shared space and shared history. Any collection of adults and children in a committed relationship which sees itself as "us", unique and separate from other families, will develop and transmit stories and customs which are unique. Non-traditional families frequently strive to re-establish and re-enact traditional family customs and lore. This becomes a demonstration both to themselves and to outsiders that they are indeed a family of "tradition".

== Transmission ==
The transmission of individual stories and customs within a family depends for the most part upon the personality, character, and lifestyle of individual family members. It is not normally passed along as part of a defined family role. As a family reshapes itself around each birth, death, marriage and other life events, individual members elect to pick up items of family lore to own and perform. This might be learning a skill, telling a story (or story cycle) or baking a traditional pie for the Thanksgiving table. The transmission of individual items can picked up by several different family members, for example when several grown siblings use a family recipe or tradition in their own households. This type of transmission through multiple individuals was first described in an article by Dégh and Vázsonyi as "multi-conduit transmission".&lt;ref name="Dégh"&gt;Linda Dégh and Andrew Vázsonyi (1975). "Hypothesis of Multi-Conduit Transmission in Folklore", pp. 207–255. In ''Folklore. Performance and Communication'', ed. Dan Ben-Amos. Den Haag, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; By choosing to own a piece of the family lore, a family member signifies that this tradition embodies beliefs and values to which he adheres. By successfully transmitting it further within the family, these beliefs and values come to define the family.   

There are multiple spheres within the family and household which are "traditionally" defined as in the purview of one gender or the other, making an intersection with [[gender studies]] manifest. The transmission of the folklore in these areas will run through either the male or the female lines. An obvious area of gender-related transmission is seen in the kitchen, where food preparation and mealtime customs and forms are generally performed by the women. They are then transmitted from mother to daughter in the course of everyday meal preparation. A variant of this is seen when a man in the family has taken over the preparation of a special meal or special recipe. One common example of this practice is described by Thomas Adler in the article "Making Pancakes on Sunday: The Male Cook in Family Tradition".&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;Thomas A. Adler (1981). "Making Pancakes on Sunday: The Male Cook in Family Tradition", pp. 45–55. In ''Western Folklore'', Vol. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many families have some variation of this tradition: the BBQ ribs, grilled hamburgers, or deep-fat fried turkey prepared as a single specialty by the non-cook in the family.

A different gender-related variation in folklore transmission is seen in storytelling. The same story will be shaped and told differently by a man and a woman, even though they were both present at the original event. For an event occurring during the apple harvest, a woman’s narration might include details of the apple butter recipe they were cooking up at the time. In contrast, the man's narration gives only enough detail to "make a point worth telling". This gender-based variance has been studied by both Baldwin and Margaret Yocum within individual family groups. They found "… women's telling to be more collaborative, interruptible, and filled with information and genealogy; men's telling, by contrast, is often uninterrupted and more competitive."&lt;ref name="FamilyFolklore2"&gt; Margaret Yocum, Family Folklore, pg. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within families, there is also a notable tendency toward traditional deference where one family member becomes the designated performer for a specific custom or tradition, even though it is known to everyone within the family group. So it happens that when the "last basketmaker" dies, another member will step up to become "the last basketmaker".&lt;ref name="Toelken" /&gt; No one else performs this tradition as long as the designated tradition bearer is available, acknowledging this individual as the (current) keeper of this tradition. Only when this person is no longer available will the tradition be picked up by someone else to carry forward. "Traditional deference" can be found in many folk groups, but is particularly evident within the family group.

== Detritus of family lore ==
If the family lore which is picked up and transmitted represents the chosen familial beliefs and values, then family stories, documents and photographs which do not support and enhance these values become problematic. For the most part news clipping on arrests, photographs of the uncle who deserted the family, stories of a sister who cheated, or dishonorable discharge papers will not be saved. That is not the family story this family wants to preserve. 

Family traditions are also lost or modified in response to difficult events within the family. This is obvious when one of the tradition bearers has died. If no one else steps up to own that tradition, a hole is left in the celebration and this tradition is lost. In a divorce there is also frequently the loss of a parent no longer available to play his or her role in the established traditions. In response to this event, one family decided to change the traditions. The customary tall Christmas tree decorated by the (missing) tall father was traded in for a short tree which the children could decorate. Ornaments were discarded and new ones purchased. The toy train was no longer set up.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg 170.&lt;/ref&gt; These became the new traditions for the Christmas celebration, modified to support and tell the new family story. 

Another reason family folklore might be suppressed or lost is when the references are too painful at the present time or to the present generation. When Catherine Noren found photo albums and other old family portraits in her grandmother’s attic, she unwittingly unearthed an entire family history of a prosperous German-Jewish family before the Holocaust. It became her task, one generation removed, to explore and record the family history in a book containing photos, diaries and memories of her family history.&lt;ref name="Noren"&gt;Catherine Noren (1976). ''The Camera of My Family''. New York / Knopf, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; It is only because these albums and portraits had not been discarded along with the narrative that Noren came to know her family story.

== Forms ==
It is only since the 1970s that family folklore has been investigated as a defining element of the family group itself. As part of this investigation, the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]] in Washington, D.C. set up a tent for several years&lt;ref&gt;From 1974–1978&lt;/ref&gt; to collect the family lore of visitors to the Festival. The goal was to establish an archive of family folklore as part of the Smithsonian collections. Using the taped interviews collected, representative pieces have been published in the book ''A Celebration of American Family Folklore: Tales and Traditions from the Smithsonian Collection''.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; Despite its lack of performance data, this collection provides a solid overview of the wide range of family folklore forms. 

=== Family stories and sayings === 
A '''family story''' initially recounts an actual historical event concerning named family members. Seasoned with time and re-telling, the story gets revised and honed to express specific values and character traits valued in the family. Instead of historical accuracies, the narration becomes a medium to re-state and re-enforce shared values of the family group. These stories generally take the form of an [[anecdote]] and follow the pattern of many common traditional tales.&lt;ref&gt;For further examples including traditional heroes, rogues, survivors, migrants and more, see Zeitlin, pp. 10–125.&lt;/ref&gt; A favorite family story involves how the parents met, or how they decided on the one true partner among several. In one family, if the story is to be believed, the prospective bride had to untie all the knots in the string to demonstrate her care and diligence.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Another family tells how the young couple got stuck at the top of a Ferris wheel when he proposed, and she had to either say yes or jump.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 96. &lt;/ref&gt; Given time and repetition, the anecdotes serve to shape the family story as a whole, populating it with real individuals and historical events made personal. In their transmission, these stories serve to codify the norms of behavior within the family.

The setting for telling family stories becomes part of the tradition. It can include the family occasions where stories are told, the location and prompt for the storytelling, the family members who initiate the session as well as the designated raconteurs and custodians of the stories.  Each of these elements needs to be documented along with the stories themselves as an integral part of the storytelling tradition within this family. In one family following the holiday meal, the men would retire to the study and the women would move into the kitchen. At some point in the cleanup, usually after the best dishes had been washed and put away, the mother would bring out a bottle of schnapps to help complete the work. This became the trigger for family stories and jokes, the laughter from the kitchen frequently bringing the men to join in the storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Told by the Riedel family from Freiburg, Germany. Recorded October 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of verbal lore common within family groups is the unique '''family expression''' or [[saying]]. A saying can be created at any time; it starts as a one-time utterance of a family member to capture a single moment. Through repetition, this then becomes a shorthand reference to both the original and the current situation. In one family, the saying "… good worker, very strong" signifies that the speaker wants to come along, and would in fact be a value-add to the planned undertaking. This expression originally referenced a first move of the family, a move that current family members took no part in.&lt;ref&gt;Told by the Wiley family from Seattle. Recorded June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the saying has become code words for all family members, used to communicate encrypted commentary on the present as well as re-enforce and strengthen the family’s shared experience and history.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 146 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Photos, letters, journals and other papers ===
Papers stacked, bundled or boxed: news clippings, photographs, letters, scrawled notes, journals, receipts. These pages of family artifacts take many forms, and have become a significant part of family archival materials. Frequently jumbled together in cardboard boxes, they commonly pose a problem as to their value-add to the family story. The boxes are passed along until they are either thrown out in a move, destroyed in a fire, or find an owner within the family,&lt;ref name="Dégh"/&gt; someone with the interest and time to house and evaluate them. 

The largest collection of papers is frequently the photographs, either kept in a drawer or labeled and organized into albums. Singly each photo documents only a single moment; taken together they comprise an important visual history of the family. Either way, they serve as triggers for more extensive memories, stories and events in the life of this family. They are brought out at gatherings and used to commemorate lifetime events such as a wedding or funeral. 

Noteworthy is the consistency in which American families of all ethnic backgrounds tend to have photographs of the same milestones. Naked babies on carpets or in the wading pool, the first day of school, the birthday cake surrounded by family and guests, generational portraits gathered around the new baby can be found in many family albums.&lt;ref&gt;see Zeitlin, pg. 184 ff&lt;/ref&gt; This pictorial repetition by American families of all backgrounds and traditions documents the universality of family photography as an important custom. 

As with storytelling, the occasion for photo-taking becomes a family tradition in and of itself. Year after year, the same pictures are snapped; documenting a family which is growing and changing, adding and subtracting members, detailing a new location. The camera can be as much a part of the celebration as the birthday cake or the menorah.  

The ubiquity of cameras and on-line photos since the rise of cellphone cameras and personal websites is actively changing the tradition of family photos and photo albums. The availability of video recordings and teleconferencing allows for a daily log of family growth and minutiae to be saved and transmitted to family near and far, in real time. Grandparents can get a daily or weekly update on children's growth or milestone events. Family members can video-conference with each other, making geographic distance much less significant in family relations. A new family custom, using the technology of today, is to put together a slideshow or video documenting the story leading up to the current celebration. At this time a folklorist can only speculate on evolving customs of family photography.   

Some families have also amassed over decades a collection of letters and other papers written by or about family members. One family, in sorting through boxes of papers, discovered all diplomas for family members from 2nd grade Sunday School up through doctoral degrees. Other family documents include the family Bible, military enlistment or discharge papers and Certificates of Baptism. While certificates authenticate the dates and events in the family history, letters and journals are particularly revealing as to the character and thoughts of individual family members. 

Similar to photographs, letters and journal entries document a single day in the life of a family member. Once these papers have been saved, it falls to members of the following generations to evaluate them. Are they to be preserved as part of the family story or discarded as inconsequential or even damaging to the family? For the most part unfavorable documents are discarded; that is not the family story this family wants to save.

The introduction of emails, IMs and other electronic messaging means that paper documents of family history are no longer regularly generated. Seldom is electronic communication printed out for the family files. The 19th and 20th centuries, providing access both to widespread literacy and to resources to create and preserve paper documents might mean that these forms of family history and lore are themselves becoming history.

=== Family customs ===
Each family has its own traditions, played out year after year, event after event. These traditions are frequently so engrained that the recognition of them as unique to this family only occurs when compared to other families.  This is also an area of family folklore that is most exposed to change or modification. With each additional marriage or committed relationship, a new member from a different family gets added, an individual who does not recognize the family customs as "traditional". These new members bring their own traditions which need to be reconciled, perhaps added or even substituted into the current performance. Not only through marriage, but births and deaths also add a fluid dynamic to the family traditions. When the first grandchild is born, everyone moves into a new role, Mom becomes Grandmom, Brother becomes Uncle, and the family Benjamin loses his position to the new baby. These factors lead to a dynamic development of new and renewed family traditions. 

One major and understudied area of family traditions is found in [[foodways]], which includes everything involved in the procurement, preparation, serving and eating of daily meals at home.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Owen Jones (1983). ''Foodways and Eating Habits: Directions for Research Paperback''. California Folklore Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[American Folklore Society]] has a section dedicated completely to Foodways. Many other scholarly groups also consider the study of food traditions as part of their domain, including Gender Studies, Ethnic Studies, Ethnology as well as modern findings on [[Nutrition and Health]]. &lt;/ref&gt; Most of us go home each evening for dinner, wake up for breakfast and pack up a lunch or snack pack to take with us for the day. All the assumptions about how this occurs, who does what when arise only when the established process (i.e. family custom) hits a snag: we've run out of milk or someone ate the last of the cookies. Maybe Dad is off on a trip and can't make the Sunday morning pancakes.&lt;ref name="Adler"/&gt; Each of these food customs is understood and accepted by the group as a whole, and followed as a matter of course with little or no discussion. 

It is also customary that family mealtimes differ: breakfast food differs from supper and snacks, weekends frequently vary from the weekday diet. In one busy family a scoop of ice cream on the breakfast cereal turned the meal into an easy, fun supper. There might also be a traditional Sunday Dinner to be prepared and staged weekly with an expanded family group gathered around the table. 

Holidays and "life event" celebrations, from birthdays to wakes include multiple family customs, either superimposed upon the more broadly defined societal celebrations, or substituting for them. This is seen most obviously in traditions found in the preparation and "performance" of a holiday meal. Each family has their own unique traditions, from special dishes prepared only for this dinner, to a single individual who prepares and presents this single dish, to the individual assigned to carve the bird. It is unnecessary to mention examples of this; each North American reader is mentally reviewing the [[Thanksgiving]] traditions unique to his own family. This list of special holiday traditions in the family expands easily from the dining table to the family wake-up calls to the distribution of presents under the Christmas tree or Hanukah lights. Each of these, along with countless other details, distinguish this family as a unique social unit.  

Another significant family tradition is that of naming customs. When a new baby is born, incorporating family names into the name for the new baby, or conversely not using family names for the next generation, can become problematic. What rules should be followed? Many ethnic groups have their own naming customs, variations of which might be found within the separate family groups of the parents. There are also differing ethnic customs of who has the authority to pick the name for the baby. When published lists of currently popular names along with expectations of individual family members are added to this mix, it can become a challenge to craft a name which pleases everyone.  

=== Handicrafts and memorabilia ===
All possessions are considered pieces of [[material culture]] - objects with which members of a culture customarily surround themselves. However, only handicrafts produced by family members and memorabilia passed along through generations are of interest in family folklore. 

[[Memorabilia]] are singular objects which are passed down through the family with the stories and memories about events or individuals attached to them. In one family a doll, given once as a Christmas present, continued to be brought out each year to celebrate Christmas and have her picture taken with the (changing) family. For her hundredth birthday, a birthday cake for the doll was included in the Christmas celebration.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 203. &lt;/ref&gt; Like the doll, almost any object imbued with family stories and memories can become a family [[heirloom]]. As such, it holds in the family a value often unrelated to its monetary value. As the stories and memories enveloping the object are slowly lost, the object itself becomes a simple hand-me-down, usually in poor condition and ready to be discarded.

[[Handicrafts]] are objects which have been "homemade", crafted individually using simple tools by one or more family members. The production skills for these artisanal crafts are generally transmitted within the family; the items might include weaving, welding, pottery, woodworking, quilting, basketry, cooking. They can be used functionally or as decoration in the home. Over time these handicrafts becomes a skill nurtured within the family, as well as a point of family identification for outsiders. The family cultivates both the production knowledge and the objects themselves. 

One aspect of these objects, both family memorabilia and handicrafts, is that they are for the most part one-of-a-kind. Many family members can tell the story of the Christmas doll, or have the family photographs, but only one family branch can actually possess the doll. For handicrafts, a craftsman could decide to create a quilt or a rocking chair for each child in a family. But this just postpones the decision of ownership of the item to the following generation.  

Each of these material objects carries along with its stories or memories the ability for family members to experience [[simultaneity]] in the home. "…by gathering around ourselves treasured objects from different times of our lives and our histories, we experience different eras at the same moment and in some way bring the totality of the past to bear upon the present."&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; The family history and identity is preserved and transmitted, both for the family member who walks past the bowl sitting on the counter, and the outsider who asks about the origin of the unique item. "The artifacts that family members make, use, or display can be an unseen backdrop to the duties and demands of family life. Alternatively, they might be carefully crafted statements about the values and expectations of family tradition bearers."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3406900153.html Jill Terry Rudy &lt;/ref&gt; The candy bowl on the coffee table or the silver tea service set out in the dining room speak of an elegance of hospitality which is customary in this family. 

== Institutions involved in study of family folklore == 
=== [[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]] ===
1967 marked the first [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival]], set up on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. to exhibit and demonstrate crafts and customs of diverse ethnic, regional and occupational groups. Originally including only displays from the United States, it later expanded to include traditions and customs from around the world. Each exhibit at the festival endeavors to move beyond the items of tangible culture, the arts and objects we can touch, feel and put in a glass case. Each unique performance or display at the Folklife Festival articulates the goal of the Smithsonian Institution to spread its reach beyond material objects to artifacts of [[intangible cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.folklife.si.edu/cultural-heritage-policy/ICH/about/smithsonian &lt;/ref&gt; Festival exhibits such as "The Changing Soundscape in Indian Country" (1992), "American Social Dance" (1993), "Mississippi Delta" (1997), "Asian Pacific Americans: Local Lives, Global Ties" (2010) are just a few of the exhibits included since the Festival began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.festival.si.edu/explore_festival/year.aspx Complete list of programs by year]&lt;/ref&gt; Any of these cultural intangibles, including traditions of performance, ritual, music, dance, traditional knowledge, storytelling or oral transmission, is considered for inclusion at the festival. Its intention is to "legitimize and celebrate individual Americans and their traditions".&lt;ref name="Zeitlin 272"&gt;Zeitlin, pg. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Open to the public at no cost, the festival is devised to enable each visitor to find at least one exhibit which relates to his background, narrates a segment of his story.
	
In 1974 a new tent was added to the Festival. Instead of displaying or performing recognized traditions, its goal was to collect items of family folklore from visitors. This tent was unique at the festival in asking visitors to be active contributors to the folklife on display instead of merely receptive spectators. A sign at the tent was hopeful: "Family Folklore – Will You Share Yours With Us?"&lt;ref name="Zeitlin 272"/&gt;  Card tables with checkered table clothes were set up, tape recorders and folklore interviewers on hand to prompt, listen and record family lore which visitors might share. Not only should each visitor see himself somewhere in the exhibits, but he should also recognize and record parts of his own story as a unique and valued artifact of cultural heritage. 

During the four years that the tent was included at the festival, it gradually cluttered with objects, memorabilia and photos just like any family home. Taking the taped interviews as a baseline, the stories and customs collected in the tent were used to establish an archive of family folklore as part of the Smithsonian collections. Representative pieces were then published in the book ''A Celebration of American Family Folklore: Tales and Traditions from the Smithsonian Collection''.&lt;ref name="Zeitlin" /&gt; This collection continues to be supported by the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage&lt;ref&gt;http://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/pictures/center-folklife-and-cultural-heritage&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[American Folklife Center]] at the Library of Congress. 

Since this first Smithsonian Folklife Festival, many [[List of folk festivals#USA|regional festivals]] have been established in all parts of the country. These include the [[Northwest Folklife]] Festival, the [[New England Folk Festival]] and the [[Philadelphia Folk Festival]] to name just a few.  Each of these is supported by various institutions of [[public folklore]], with the goal of displaying traditions of regional, ethnic and occupational folk groups. None of them however has duplicated the Smithsonian Folklore tent intended to collect original family folklore.

=== Oral history and oral tradition projects ===
[[Oral history]] and [[oral tradition]] first became recognized as legitimate forms of historical and cultural research in the 1960s and early 1970s. Pioneers in this field used newly developed inexpensive tape-recorders to record oral histories.  A Pulitzer Prize was awarded to [[Studs Terkel]] in 1985 for his book ''"The Good War": An Oral History of World War II'' and a special Pulitzer Prize was awarded to [[Alex Haley]] in 1977 for ''Roots: The Saga of an American Family''. With these awards, the importance of oral histories and traditions as a bona fide tool of historical and cultural research was cemented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/oral+history "Oral history"] ''Columbia Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical and folklore research using oral interviews has gone mainstream, with multiple organizations dedicated to its collection. One of the best known organizations is [[StoryCorps]], founded in 2003 and modeled on the WPA [[Federal Writers Project]]. Its expressed mission is to "record, preserve, and share stories of Americans from all backgrounds and beliefs". Special projects reach out to targeted populations to fulfill StoryCorps' commitment to record a diverse array of voices. The only requirement for the 2-person interview is that the 2 participants "care about each other", for instance family members. The participants are given a recording of the interview to take with them and add to the family archive. 

StoryCorps is just one of many organizations with a goal of recording and preserving interviews of oral history and tradition. Other organizations abound, such as [[City Lore]] of New York City and the [[Oral History Society]] of London.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">'''Fictive art''' is a practice that involves the production of objects, events, and entities designed to support the plausibility of a central narrative. Fictive art projects disguise their fictional essence by incorporating materials that stand as evidence for narrative factuality and thus are designed to deceive the viewer as to their ontological status. Very often, these materials take a form that carries presumptive cultural authority, such as 'historical' photographs or 'scientific' data. The key tension in fictive art projects stems from the impossibility of 'making real' a fiction, no matter how many or what kinds of objects are produced as evidence. Since fictive art projects are designed to pass at least temporarily as 'real', fictive artists may draw opprobrium as hoaxers, pranksters, forgers, or con artists when their projects are revealed as fictional.

==History and usage==
The term fictive art was originated by the artists [[Antoinette LaFarge]] and [[Lise Patt]], in the title of a panel at the College Art Association Conference of 2004. It is allied to the terms [[superfiction]] and [[parafiction]] but, unlike both, does not construct the central activity as a departure from (super, para) fiction. Instead, it argues for the primacy of the visual art components, emphasizing the role they play in establishing, extending, and enabling the central narrative. A number of exhibitions in recent years have included examples of fictive art as part of broad explorations of the relationship between media, illusion, and deception; examples include "More Real? Art in the Age of Truthiness" at SITE Santa Fe (2012) and "Faking It" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (2012).

==Examples of fictive art==
Fictive art has antecedents going back several centuries; for example, the 'Rowley' creations of [[Thomas Chatterton]], the 'Formosan' inventions of [[George Psalmanazar]], or the [[Cottingley Fairies|Cottingley fairy]] photographs. With the rise of mass media in the second half of the 20th century, the practice of fictive art has expanded; it now includes such familiar forms as [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]]. Notable practitioners and projects include David Wilson ([[The Museum of Jurassic Technology]]), [[Kahn &amp; Selesnick|Nicholas Kahn and Richard Selesnick]] (The Circular River), [[Beauvais Lyons]] (The Hokes Archives), [[Joan Fontcuberta]] (Sputnik), [[Eve Andree Laramee]] (Yves Fissiault), and [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] (O-ism).

Since at least the 18th century (in French, German and English), '''grotesque''' (or '''grottoesque''') has come to be used as a general adjective for the strange, mysterious, magnificent, fantastic, hideous, ugly, incongruous, unpleasant, or disgusting, and thus is often used to describe weird shapes and distorted forms such as [[Halloween]] masks. In art, performance, and literature, however, ''grotesque'' may also refer to something that simultaneously invokes in an audience a feeling of uncomfortable bizarreness as well as [[sympathy|sympathetic]] [[pity]]. More specifically, the grotesque forms on [[Gothic architecture|Gothic buildings]], when not used as drain-spouts, should not be called [[gargoyle]]s, but rather referred to simply as grotesques, or [[Chimera (architecture)|chimeras]].&lt;ref&gt;Bridaham, Lester Burbank, introduction by Ralph Adams Cram, “Gargoyles, Chimeres and the Grotesque in French Gothic Sculpture”, Architectural Book Publishing Co., Inc. New York, 1930 p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was originally a noun (1560s), from Italian grottesco (through Middle French), literally "of a cave", from Italian ''grotta'' (see [[grotto]]),&lt;ref name="Online Etymology Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=grotesque |title=OED-Grotesque etymology |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; an extravagant style of [[Ancient Roman art|Ancient Roman]] decorative art rediscovered and then copied in Rome at the end of the 15th century. The word first was used of paintings found on the walls of basements of Roman ruins that were called at that time ''Le Grotte'' (The Grottoes) due to their appearance. These "caves" were in fact rooms and corridors of the [[Domus Aurea]], the unfinished palace complex started by [[Nero]] after the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in CE 64, which had become overgrown and buried, until they were broken into again, mostly from above. Spreading from Italian to the other European languages, the term was long used largely interchangeably with [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]] and [[moresque]] for types of decorative patterns using curving foliage elements.

Rémi Astruc has argued that although there is an immense variety of motifs and figures, the three main tropes of the grotesque are doubleness, [[hybridity]] and metamorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;Astruc R. (2010), Le Renouveau du grotesque dans le roman du XXe siècle, Paris, Classiques Garnier.&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the current understanding of the grotesque as an aesthetic category, he demonstrated how the grotesque functions as a fundamental existential experience. Moreover, Astruc identifies the grotesque as a crucial, and potentially universal, anthropological device that societies have used to conceptualize alterity and change.{{Citation needed (lead)|date=July 2012}} &lt;!--tags removed: for citations in this summary, see main treatment below--&gt;

==History==
[[File:Domus fresco.jpg|thumb|Roman frescos in Nero's [[Domus Aurea]]]]
===Early examples in Roman ornaments===
In art, '''grotesques''' are ornamental arrangements of [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]s with interlaced garlands and small and fantastic human and animal figures, usually set out in a [[symmetrical]] pattern around some form of architectural framework, though this may be very flimsy. Such designs were fashionable in ancient [[Rome]], as fresco wall decoration, floor mosaics, etc., and were decried by [[Vitruvius]] (c. 30 BC), who in dismissing them as meaningless and illogical, offered the description: "reeds are substituted for columns, fluted appendages with curly leaves and volutes take the place of pediments, candelabra support representations of shrines, and on top of their roofs grow slender stalks and volutes with human figures senselessly seated upon them."

When Nero's palace in Rome, the [[Domus Aurea]], was inadvertently rediscovered in the late 15th century, buried in fifteen hundred years of fill, the first breakthrough was from above, so that those keen to see the rooms had to be lowered down into them on ropes, completing their resemblance to caves, or [[grotto]]es in Italian.  The Roman wall decorations in fresco and delicate [[stucco]] were a revelation.

===Etymology in Renaissance===
[[File:Biblioteca Duomo Siena-2 Apr 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ceiling of the [[Piccolomini Library]]]]
The first appearance of the word ''grottesche'' appears in a contract of 1502 for the [[Piccolomini Library]] attached to the [[duomo]] of [[Siena]]. They were introduced by [[Raphael Sanzio]] and his team of decorative painters, who developed ''grottesche'' into a complete system of ornament in the [[Loggias]] that are part of the series of [[Raphael's Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]], Rome. "The decorations astonished and charmed a generation of artists that was familiar with the grammar of the [[classical orders]] but had not guessed till then that in their private houses the Romans had often disregarded those rules and had adopted instead a more fanciful and informal style that was all lightness, elegance and grace."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Ward-Jackson, "The Grotesque" in "Some main streams and tributaries in European ornament from 1500 to 1750: part 1" ''The Victoria and Albert Museum Bulletin'' (June 1967, pp 58-70) p 75.&lt;/ref&gt; In these grotesque decorations a tablet or candelabrum might provide a focus; frames were extended into scrolls that formed part of the surrounding designs as a kind of scaffold, as Peter Ward-Jackson noted. Light scrolling grotesques could be ordered by confining them within the framing of a pilaster to give them more structure. [[Giovanni da Udine]] took up the theme of grotesques in decorating the [[Villa Madama]], the most influential of the new Roman villas.

In the 16th century, such artistic license and irrationality was controversial matter. [[Francisco de Holanda]] puts a defense in the mouth of [[Michelangelo]] in his third dialogue of ''Da Pintura Antiga'', 1548:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"this insatiable desire of man sometimes prefers to an ordinary building, with its pillars and doors, one falsely constructed in grotesque style, with pillars formed of children growing out of stalks of flowers, with [[architrave]]s and [[Cornice (architecture)|cornice]]s of branches of myrtle and doorways of reeds and other things, all seeming impossible and contrary to reason, yet it may be really great work if it is performed by a skillful artist."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in David Summers, "Michelangelo on Architecture", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''54'''.2 (June 1972:146-157) p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mannerism===
[[Image:Grotesqueengraving.jpg|thumb|250px|Grotesque engraving on paper, about 1500 - 1512, by [[Nicoletto da Modena]].]]
The delight of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists and their patrons in arcane iconographic programs available only to the erudite could be embodied in schemes of ''grottesche'',&lt;ref&gt;An example, the vaulted arcade in the Palazzo del Governatore, Assisi, which was frescoed with grotesques in 1556, has been examined in the monograph by Ezio Genovesi, ''Le grottesche della 'Volta Pinta' in Assisi'' (Assisi, 1995): Genovesi explores the role of the local Accademia del Monte.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrea Alciato]]'s ''[[Emblemata]]'' (1522) offered ready-made iconographic shorthand for vignettes. More familiar material for grotesques could be drawn from [[Metamorphoses|Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'']].&lt;ref&gt;Victor Kommerell, ''Metamorphosed Margins: The Case for a Visual Rhetoric of the Renaissance 'Grottesche' under the Influence of Ovid's Metamorphoses'' (Hildesheim, 2008)..&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vatican loggias]], a [[loggia]] corridor space in the [[Apostolic Palace]] open to the elements on one side, were decorated around 1519 by [[Raphael]]s's large team of artists, with [[Giovanni da Udine]] the main hand involved.  Because of the relative unimportance of the space, and a desire to copy the Domus Aurea style, no large paintings were used, and the surfaces were mostly covered with grotesque designs on a white background, with paintings imitating sculptures in niches, and small figurative subjects in a revival of Ancient Roman style. This large array provided a repertoire of elements that were the basis for later artists across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In Michelangelo's [[Medici Chapel]] Giovanni da Udine composed during 1532-33 "most beautiful sprays of foliage, rosettes and other ornaments in stucco and gold" in the coffers and "sprays of foliage, birds, masks and figures", with a result that did not please [[Pope Clement VII|Pope Clement VII Medici]], however, nor [[Giorgio Vasari]], who whitewashed the grottesche decor in 1556.&lt;ref&gt;"''bellissimi fogliami, rosoni ed altri ornamenti di stuccho e d'oro''" and "''fogliami, uccelli, maschere e figure''", quoted by Summers 1972:151 and note 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Counter Reformation]] writers on the arts, notably Cardinal [[Gabriele Paleotti]], bishop of Bologna,&lt;ref&gt;Paleotti, ''Discorso intorno alle imagini sacre e profane'' (printed at Bologna, 1582)&lt;/ref&gt; turned upon ''grottesche'' with a righteous vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Summers 1972:152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasari, echoing Vitruvius, described the style as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Grotesques are a type of extremely licentious and absurd painting done by the ancients ... without any logic, so that a weight is attached to a thin thread which could not support it, a horse is given legs made of leaves, a man has crane's legs, with countless other impossible absurdities; and the bizarrer the painter's imagination, the higher he was rated".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Vasari recorded that [[Francesco Bacchiacca|Francesco Ubertini, called "Bacchiacca"]], delighted in inventing ''grotteschi'', and (about 1545) painted for Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo de' Medici]] a ''[[studiolo]]'' in a mezzanine at the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] "full of animals and rare plants".&lt;ref&gt;"Dilettossi il Bacchiacca di far grottesche; onde al Sig. duca Cosimo fece uno studiolo pieno d'animali e d'erbe rare ritratte dalle naturali, che sono tenute bellissime": quoted in Francesco Vossilla, "Cosimo I, lo scrittoio del Bachiacca, una carcassa di capodoglio e la filosofia naturale", ''Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorischen Institutes in Florenz'', '''37.'''.2/3 (1993:381-395) p. 383; only fragments survive of the decor.&lt;/ref&gt; Other 16th-century writers on ''grottesche'' included [[Daniele Barbaro]], [[Pirro Ligorio]] and [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]].&lt;ref&gt;All mentioned by Ezio Genovesi 1995, in providing explanation of the genre in the context of the painted vaulting at Assisi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engravings, woodwork, book illustration, decorations===
In the meantime, through the medium of [[engraving]]s the grotesque mode of surface ornament passed into the European artistic repertory of the 16th century, from Spain to Poland. A classic suite was that attributed to [[Enea Vico]], published in 1540-41 under an evocative explanatory title, ''Leviores et extemporaneae picturae quas grotteschas vulgo vocant'', "Light and extemporaneous pictures that are vulgarly called grotesques". Later [[Mannerist]] versions, especially in engraving, tended to lose that initial lightness and be much more densely filled than the airy well-spaced style used by the Romans and Raphael.

Soon ''grottesche'' appeared in [[marquetry]] (fine woodwork), in [[maiolica]] produced above all at [[Urbino]] from the late 1520s, then in book illustration and in other decorative uses. At [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and his team enriched the vocabulary of grotesques by combining them with the decorative form of [[strapwork]], the portrayal of leather straps in plaster or wood moldings, which forms an element in grotesques.
[[File:Boudoir.jpg|thumb|left|French [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] painted decor in the Raphaelesque ''grotesque'' manner at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], 1780s]]

===From Baroque to Victorian era===
[[File:Groteskmask i guldtråd på schabrak, 1600-1650 - Skoklosters slott - 102320.tif|thumb|Grotesque made of gold thread on saddle pad, dated from 1600-1650.]]
In the 17th and 18th centuries the grotesque encompasses a wide field of [[teratology]] (science of monsters) and artistic experimentation. The monstrous, for instance, often occurs as the notion of ''play''. The sportiveness of the grotesque category can be seen in the notion of the preternatural category of the ''lusus naturae'', in natural history writings and in cabinets of curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mauries|first=Patrick|title=Cabinets of Curiosities|year=2002|publisher=Thames and Hudson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorraine Daston and Katharine Park|title=Wonders and the Order of Nature|year=1998|publisher=Zone Books|location=USA: New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last vestiges of romance, such as the marvellous also provide opportunities for the presentation of the grotesque in, for instance, operatic spectacle. The mixed form of the novel was commonly described as grotesque - see for instance Fielding's "comic epic poem in prose". (''Joseph Andrews'' and ''Tom Jones'')

Grotesque ornament received a further impetus from new discoveries of original Roman frescoes and stucchi at [[Pompeii]] and the other buried sites round [[Mount Vesuvius]] from the middle of the century. It continued in use, becoming increasingly heavy, in the [[Empire Style]] and then in the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] period, when designs often became as densely packed as in 16th-century engravings, and the elegance and fancy of the style tended to be lost.

==Extensions of the term in art==
Artists began to give the tiny faces of the figures in grotesque decorations strange [[caricature]]d expressions, in a direct continuation of the medieval traditions of the [[drolleries]] in the border decorations or initials in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. From this the term began to be applied to larger caricatures, such as those of [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and the modern sense began to develop. It is first recorded in English in 1646 from Sir [[Thomas Browne]]:"In nature there are no grotesques".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Grotesque"&lt;/ref&gt; By extension backwards in time, the term became also used for the medieval originals, and in modern terminology medieval drolleries, half-human thumbnail vignettes drawn in the margins, and carved figures on buildings (that are not also waterspouts, and so [[gargoyle]]s) are also called "grotesques".

A boom in the production of works of art in the grotesque genre characterized the period 1920–1933 of [[German art]]. In contemporary illustration art, the "grotesque" figures, in the ordinary conversational sense, commonly appear in the genre ''grotesque art'', also known as [[fantastic art]].

==In literature==
One of the first uses of the term grotesque to denote a literary genre is in [[Essays (Montaigne)|Montaigne's ''Essays'']].&lt;ref&gt;Kayser (1957) I.2 ''Ce discours est bien grotesue''&lt;/ref&gt; The Grotesque is often linked with [[satire]] and [[tragicomedy]].&lt;ref name="Clark91p20"&gt;Clark (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOeLRDzui_wC&amp;pg=PR20 pp. 20–1]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an effective artistic means to convey grief and pain to the audience, and for this has been labeled by [[Thomas Mann]] as the "genuine antibourgeois style".&lt;ref name="Clark91p20"/&gt;

Some of the earliest written texts describe grotesque happenings and monstrous creatures. The literature of Myth has been a rich source of monsters; from the one-eyed Cyclops (to cite one example) from Hesiod's ''Theogony'' to Homer's Polyphemus in the ''Odyssey''. Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'' is another rich source for grotesque transformations and hybrid creatures of myth. Horace's ''Art of Poetry'' also provides a formal introduction classical values and to the dangers of grotesque or mixed form. Indeed, the departure from classical models of order, reason, harmony, balance and form opens up the risk of entry into grotesque worlds. Accordingly, British literature abounds with native grotesquerie, from the strange worlds of Spenser's allegory in ''The Faerie Queene'', to the tragi-comic modes of 16th-century drama. (Grotesque comic elements can be found in major works such as ''King Lear''.)

Literary works of ''mixed'' genre are occasionally termed grotesque, as are "low" or non-literary genres such as pantomime and farce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harham|first=Geoffrey Galt|title=On the Grotesque|year=1982|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gothic writings often have grotesque components in terms of character, style and location. In other cases, the environment described may be grotesque - whether urban ([[Charles Dickens]]), or the literature of the American south which has sometimes been termed "Southern Gothic". Sometimes the grotesque in literature has been explored in terms of social and cultural formations such as the carnival(-esque) in [[François Rabelais]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]. Terry Castle has written on the relationship between metamorphosis, literary writings and masquerade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castle|first=Terry|title=Masquerade and Civilization|year=1986|publisher=Methuen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major source of the grotesque is in satirical writings of the 18th century. [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' provides a variety of approaches to grotesque representation. In poetry, the works of [[Alexander Pope]] provide many examples of the grotesque.

In fiction, characters are usually considered '''grotesque''' if they induce both empathy and disgust. (A character who inspires disgust alone is simply a villain or a [[monster]].) Obvious examples would include the physically deformed and the mentally deficient, but people with cringe-worthy social traits are also included. The reader becomes piqued by the grotesque's positive side, and continues reading to see if the character can conquer their darker side. In Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest]]'', the figure of [[Caliban (character)|Caliban]] has inspired more nuanced reactions than simple scorn and disgust. Also, in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the character of Gollum may be considered to have both disgusting and empathetic qualities, which fit him into the grotesque template.

[[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' is one of the most celebrated grotesques in literature. Dr. Frankenstein's monster can also be considered a grotesque, as well as the title character, [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Erik]] in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and the Beast in [[Beauty and the Beast]]. Other instances of the romantic grotesque are also to be found in [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[E.T.A. Hoffmann]], in ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' literature or in Sterne's ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''. The romantic grotesque is far more terrible and sombre than the medieval grotesque, which celebrated laughter and fertility. It is at this point that a grotesque creature such as Frankenstein's monster (in Mary Shelley's novel published in 1818) begins to be presented more sympathetically as the outsider who is the victim of society.&lt;ref&gt;See Jeanne M. Britton, 'Novelistic Sympathy in Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" ' ''Studies in Romanticism'' Vol. 48, No. 1 (Spring, 2009)3-22, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; But the novel also makes the issue of sympathy problematic in an unkind society. This means that society becomes the generator of the grotesque, by a process of alienation.&lt;ref&gt;Hanis McLaren Caldwell, ''Literature and Medicine in Nineteenth-Century Britain: from Mary Shelley to George Eliot'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the grotesque monster in ''Frankenstein'' tends to be described as 'the creature.'

The grotesque received a new shape with ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]], when a girl meets fantastic grotesque figures in her fantasy world. Carroll manages to make the figures seem less frightful and fit for [[children's literature]], but still utterly strange. Another comic grotesque writer who played on the relationship between sense and nonsense was [[Edward Lear]]. Humorous, or festive nonsense of this kind has its roots in the seventeenth century traditions of fustian, bombastic and satirical writing.&lt;ref&gt;See Noel Malcolm, ''The Origins of English Nonsense'' (Fontana, 1997). {{ISBN|0006388442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nineteenth-century category of grotesque body was increasingly displaced by the notion of congenital deformity or medical anomaly.&lt;ref&gt;See George M. Gould and Walter M. Pyle's ''Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine'' (1896).&lt;/ref&gt; Building on this context, the grotesque begins to be understood more in terms as deformity and disability, especially after the First World War, 1914-18. In these terms, the art historian Leah Dickerman has argued that 'The sight of horrendously shattered bodies of veterans returned to the home front became commonplace. The accompanying growth in the prosthetic industry struck contemporaries as creating a race of half-mechanical men and became an important theme in dadaist work.'&lt;ref&gt;Leah Dickerman, ''Dada'', National Gallery of Art, Washington, 2005, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt; The poetry of [[Wilfred Owen]] displays a poetic and realistic sense of the grotesque horror of war and the human cost of brutal conflict. Poems such as 'Spring Offensive' and 'Greater Love' combined images of beauty with shocking brutality and violence in order to produce a sense of the grotesque clash of opposites. In a similar fashion, Ernst Friedrich (1894–1967), founder of the Berlin Peace Museum, an anarchist and a pacifist, was the author of ''War Against War'' (1924) which used grotesque photographs of mutilated victims of the First World War in order to campaign for peace.

[[Southern Gothic]] is a genre frequently identified with grotesques and [[William Faulkner]] is often cited as the ringmaster. [[Flannery O'Connor]] wrote, "Whenever I'm asked why Southern writers particularly have a penchant for writing about freaks, I say it is because we are still able to recognize one" ("Some Aspects of the Grotesque in Southern Fiction", 1960). In O'Connor's often-anthologized [[short-story]] "[[A Good Man is Hard to Find (short story)|A Good Man Is Hard to Find]]", the Misfit, a serial killer, is clearly a maimed soul, utterly callous to human life but driven to seek the truth. The less obvious grotesque is the polite, doting grandmother who is unaware of her own astonishing selfishness. Another oft-cited example of the grotesque from O'Connor's work is her short-story entitled "A Temple Of The Holy Ghost". The American novelist, [[Raymond Kennedy]] is another author associated with the literary tradition of the grotesque.

==Contemporary writers==

Contemporary writers of literary grotesque fiction include [[Ian McEwan]], [[Katherine Dunn]], [[Alasdair Gray]], [[Angela Carter]], [[Jeanette Winterson]], [[Umberto Eco]], [[Patrick McGrath (novelist)|Patrick McGrath]], [[Natsuo Kirino]], [[Paul G. Tremblay|Paul Tremblay]], [[Matt Bell (author)|Matt Bell]], [[Chuck Palahniuk]], [[Brian Evenson]], [[Caleb J.

==Theatre of the Grotesque==
The term '''[[Theatre of the Grotesque]]''' refers to an anti-[[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] school of Italian dramatists, writing in the 1910s and 1920s, who are often seen as precursors of the [[Theatre of the Absurd]].
Characterized by ironic and macabre themes of daily life in the world war 1 era. Theatre of the grotesque was named after the play 'The Mask and the Face' by Luigi Chiarelli, which was described as ' a grotesque in three acts'.

[[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] is a major author of contemporary grotesque comedy plays.

==In architecture==
{{seemain|chimera (architecture)}}
[[File:Greyfriars grotesques.JPG|thumb|Detail from the [[John Mylne (1611–1667)|John Mylne Monument]] in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]]. The text reads ...''Aetatis Suae 56'' because he died at age 56]]
In architecture the term "grotesque" means a carved stone figure.

Grotesques are often confused with [[gargoyle]]s, but the distinction is that gargoyles are figures that contain a water spout through the mouth, while grotesques do not. Without a water spout, this type of sculpture is also known as a chimera when it depicts fantastical creatures. In the Middle Ages, the term ''babewyn'' was used to refer to both gargoyles and grotesques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Janetta Rebold Benton|authorlink=|title=Holy Terrors: Gargoyles on Medieval Buildings|edition=|publisher=Abbeville Press|year=1997|location=New York|pages=8–10|url=|isbn=0-7892-0182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''babbuino'', which means "[[baboon]]".

==In typography==
{{main|Grotesque (typeface classification)}}
The word "Grotesque", or "Grotesk" in German, is also frequently used as a synonym for [[sans-serif]] in [[typography]]. At other times, it is used (along with "Neo-Grotesque", "Humanist", "[[Lineal typeface#Lineal|Lineal]]", and "Geometric") to describe a particular style or subset of sans-serif typefaces. The origin of this association can be traced back to English typefounder [[William Thorowgood]], who first introduced the term "grotesque" and in 1835 produced ''7-line pica grotesque''—the first sans-serif typeface containing actual lowercase letters. An alternate etymology is possibly based on the original reaction of other typographers to such a strikingly featureless typeface.&lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite web|url=http://typenstuff.com/help/4_22%20status%20books.pdf |title=Linéale Grotesques |publisher=Rabbit Moon Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102201041/http://typenstuff.com/help/4_22%20status%20books.pdf |archivedate=January 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular Grotesque typefaces include [[Franklin Gothic]], [[News Gothic]], [[Haettenschweiler]] and [[Lucida Sans]] (although the latter lacks the [[G#Typographic forms|spurred]] "G"), whereas popular Neo-Grotesque typefaces include [[Arial]], [[Helvetica]] and [[Verdana]].

"'''Here be dragons'''" means dangerous or unexplored territories, in imitation of a medieval practice of putting illustrations of [[dragon]]s, [[Sea monster|sea-monster]]s and other mythological creatures on uncharted areas of maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/the-enchanting-sea-monsters-on-medieval-maps-1805646/ |title=The Enchanting Sea Monsters on Medieval Maps |last=Waters |first=Hannah |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]] |date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=2017-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Duzer |first1=Chet |title=Sea Monsters on Medieval and Renaissance Maps |publisher=British Library Publishing |year=2013 |isbn=978-0712357715 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

Although several early maps, such as the ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'', have illustrations of mythological creatures for decoration, the phrase itself is an [[anachronism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Erin C. | last = Blake | year = 1999 | title = Where Be "Here be Dragons"? | work = MapHist Discussion Group | publisher =  | url = http://www.maphist.nl/extra/herebedragons.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are just two known historical uses of this phrase in the [[Latin]] form "HC SVNT DRACONES"&lt;!-- sic; don't replace HC by HIC --&gt; (i.e. ''hic sunt dracones,'' 'here are dragons'). One is on the [[Hunt–Lenox Globe]]{{Ref|lenox_globe}} (c. 1503–07), on which the term appeared around the east coast of Asia. This might be related to the [[Komodo dragon]]s on the Indonesian islands, tales of which were quite common throughout East Asia.{{Ref|mccarthy}} The other appearance of the term is on a globe engraved on two conjoined halves of ostrich eggs, dated to 1504.&lt;ref name=Wapo/&gt; Earlier maps contain a variety of references to [[legendary creature|mythical]] and real creatures, but the Lenox Globe and the egg globe are the only known surviving maps to bear this phrase. Furthermore, the two maps may be closely linked: an investigation of the egg globe performed by collector Stefaan Missinne concluded that the Hunt–Lenox Globe is in fact a cast of it.
"'Here be dragons,' [is] a very interesting sentence," said Thomas Sander, editor of the ''Portolan'', the journal of the Washington Map Society. "In early maps, you would see images of sea monsters; it was a way to say there's bad stuff out there."&lt;ref name=Wapo&gt;{{cite news|last=Kim|first=Meeri|title=Oldest globe to depict the New World may have been discovered|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/oldest-globe-to-depict-the-new-world-may-have-been-discovered/2013/08/19/503b2b4a-06b4-11e3-a07f-49ddc7417125_story.html?hpid=z1|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical phrase used by ancient Roman and Medieval cartographers was ''HIC SVNT LEONES'' (literally, "here are [[lion]]s") when denoting unknown territories on maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Duzer|first=Chet|date=2014-06-04|title=Bring on the Monsters and Marvels: Non-Ptolemaic Legends on Manuscript Maps of Ptolemy’s Geography|url=http://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.103923|journal=Viator|volume=45|issue=2|pages=303–334|doi=10.1484/J.VIATOR.1.103923|issn=0083-5897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dragons on maps ==
[[File:Psalter World Map, c.1265.jpg|thumb|The 1265 [[Psalter world map]]]]
Dragons appear on a few other historical maps:
* The [[T and O map|T-O]] [[Psalter world map]] ({{circa|1250}} AD) has dragons, as symbols of [[sin]], in a lower "frame" below the world, balancing [[Jesus]] and [[angel]]s on the top, but the dragons do not appear on the map proper.
* The [[Borgia map]] (c. 1430), in the Vatican Library, states, over a dragon-like figure in [[Asia]] (in the upper left quadrant of the map), "''Hic etiam homines magna cornua habentes longitudine quatuor pedum, et sunt etiam serpentes tante magnitudinis, ut unum bovem comedant integrum.''" ("Here there are even men who have large four-foot horns, and there are even serpents so large that they could eat an ox whole.").
* The [[Fra Mauro Map]] (c. 1450) has the "[[Island of Dragons]]" ({{lang-it|Isola de' dragoni}}), an imaginary island in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Item 558 in: {{citation|title=Fra Mauro's World Map|authorlink=Piero Falchetta|first=Piero |last=Falchetta|publisher=Brepols |year=2006|isbn=2-503-51726-9|pages=294–295}}; also in [http://geoweb.venezia.sbn.it/cms/images/stories/Testi_HSL/FM_iscr.pdf the list online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In an inscription near [[Herat]], [[Fra Mauro]] says that in the mountains nearby "there are a number of dragons, in whose forehead is a stone that  cures many infirmities", and describes the locals' way of hunting those dragons to get the stones. This is thought to be based on [[Albertus Magnus]]'s treatise ''De mineralibus''.&lt;ref&gt;"In le montagne de la citade de [[Herat|here]] sono dragoni assai, i qual hano una piera in fronte virtuosa a molte infirmitade".  Item 1457 in {{harvnb|Falchetta|2006|pp=462–464}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an inscription elsewhere on the map, the cartographer expresses his skepticism regarding "serpents, dragons and [[basilisk]]s" mentioned by "some historiographers".&lt;ref&gt;Item 460 in {{harvnb|Falchetta|2006|pp=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 19th-century Japanese map, the ''[[:File:Jishinnoben1855.jpg|Jishin-no-ben]]'', in the shape of [[ouroboros]], depicts a dragon associated with causing earthquakes.

== Other creatures on maps ==
* [[Ptolemy]]'s atlas in ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' (originally 2nd century, taken up again in the 15th century) warns of [[elephant]]s, [[Hippopotamus|hippos]] and [[Cannibalism|cannibals]].
* ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'' (medieval copy of Roman map) has "in his locis elephanti nascuntur", "in his locis scorpiones nascuntur" and "hic cenocephali nascuntur" ("in these places elephants are born, in these places [[scorpion]]s are born, here [[Cynocephaly|Cynocephali]] are born").
* [[Cotton MS. Tiberius]] B.V. fol. 58v (10th century), British Library Manuscript Collection, has "hic abundant leones" ("here lions abound"), along with a picture of a lion, near the east coast of Asia (at the top of the map towards the left); this map also has a text-only serpent reference in southernmost [[Africa]] (bottom left of the map): "Zugis regio ipsa est et Affrica. est enim fertilis. sed ulterior bestiis et serpentibus plena" ("This region of Zugis is in Africa; it is rather fertile, but on the other hand it is full of beasts and serpents.")
* The [[Ebstorf map]] (13th century) has a dragon in the extreme south-eastern part of Africa, together with an [[asp (reptile)|asp]] and a [[basilisk]].
* [[Giovanni Leardo]]'s map (1442) has, in southernmost Africa, "Dixerto dexabitado p. chaldo e p. serpent".
* [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s Carta marina navigatoria (1516) has "an elephant-like creature in northernmost [[Norway]], accompanied by a legend explaining that this 'morsus' with two long and quadrangular teeth congregated there", i.e. a [[walrus]], which would have seemed monstrous at the time.
* Waldseemüller's Carta marina navigatoria (1522), revised by Laurentius Fries, has the morsus moved to the [[Davis Strait]].
* Bishop [[Olaus Magnus]]'s ''[[Carta Marina]]'' map of [[Scandinavia]] (1539) has many monsters in the northern sea, as well as a winged, bipedal, predatory land animal resembling a dragon in northern Lapland.
* On the maps surrounding [[imperialism]], up until the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 and the discoveries made by [[David Livingstone|Livingstone]], elephants were drawn in as is shown by this excerpt from "On Poetry: a Rhapsody" by [[Jonathan Swift]]: "So geographers, in Afric maps, With savage pictures fill their gaps, And o'er uninhabitable downs, Place elephants for want of towns."

Horses have appeared in works of art throughout history, frequently as depictions of the [[Horses in warfare|horse in battle]]. The horse appears less frequently in modern art partly because the horse is no longer significant either as a mode of transportation or as an implement of war. Most modern representations are of famous contemporary horses, artwork associated with horse racing, or artwork associated with the historic [[cowboy]] or [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native American]] tradition of the American west. In the United Kingdom depictions of [[fox hunting]] and nostalgic rural scenes involving horses continue to be made.

Horses often appear in artworks singly, as a mount for an important person, or in teams, hitched to a variety of [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s.

===Prehistory and the Ancient World===
[[File:Bronze Statuette of a Horse.jpg|thumb|''Bronze Statuette of a Horse,'' late 2nd – 1st century B.C. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]
The horse appeared in prehistoric [[cave painting]]s such as those in [[Lascaux]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lascaux.culture.fr/#/en/00.xml Lascaux caves official website.(retrieved 09/09/2011[[Lascaux]])]&lt;/ref&gt; estimated to be 16,000 years old.

Prehistoric [[hill figure]]s have been carved in the shape of the horse, specifically the [[Uffington White Horse]], an example of the tradition of horse carvings upon hill-sides, which having existed for thousands of years continues into the current age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/britainfromabove/stories/secrets/whitehorse.shtml  BBC video.Retrieved 09/09/2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Upper Palaeolithic]] [[Vogelherd_Cave#Vogelherd_figurines|Vogelherd figurines]] discovered in Germany, miniature sculptures made of [[mammoth]] [[ivory]] attributed to paleo-humans of the [[Aurignacian]] culture that are among the world’s oldest-known works of figurative art, include a figure of a horse.

The equine image was common in ancient Egyptian and Grecian art, more refined images displaying greater knowledge of equine anatomy appeared in [[Classical Greece]] and in later Roman work.

Horse-drawn chariots were commonly depicted in ancient works, for example on the [[Standard of Ur]] circa 2500BC. The [[Horses of Saint Mark]] are the sole surviving example from [[Classical Antiquity]] of a monumental statue of the [[Quadriga]].

The horse was less prevalent in early Christian and Byzantine art, overwhelmed by the dominance of religious themes.

===Renaissance and after===
The [[Renaissance]] period starting in the 14th century brought a resurgence of the horse in art. Painters of this period who portrayed the horse included [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Raphael]], [[Andrea Mantegna]] and [[Titian]]. In 1482 the [[Duke of Milan]] [[Ludovico Sforza|Ludovico il Moro]], commissioned [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to create the largest equestrian statue in the world, a monument to the duke's father [[Francesco II Sforza|Francesco]], however ''[[Leonardo's horse]]'' was never completed, (until it was replicated in the late 20th century).

In the [[Baroque]] era the tradition of equine portraiture was established, with artists such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Anthony van Dyck]] and [[Diego Velázquez]] portraying regal subjects atop their mounts. Equine sporting art also became established in this era as the tradition of horse racing emerged under Tudor patronage.&lt;ref name= "Oelke"/&gt;

[[George Stubbs]] born in 1724 became so associated with his equestrian subjects that he was known as "the horse painter". A childhood interest in anatomy was applied to the horse he spent eighteen months dissecting equine carcasses and had an engraver produce book plates of his studies. These anatomical drawings aided later artists.

The mid 18th century saw the emergence of [[Romanticism]], French artists [[Théodore Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]] were proponents of this movement and both portrayed the horse in many of their works.

Equine sporting art was popular in the 19th century, notable artists of the period being [[Benjamin Marshall]], [[James Ward (artist)|James Ward]], [[Henry Thomas Alken]], [[James Pollard]], [[John Frederick Herring Sr.]] and [[Heywood Hardy]].  Horse racing gradually became more established in France and [[Impressionist]] painter [[Edgar Degas]] painted many early racing scenes. Degas was one of the first horse painters to use photographic references.&lt;ref name= "Oelke"/&gt; [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s photographic studies of animal motion had a huge influence on equine art as they allowed artists greater understanding of the horses gaits.

[[Rosa Bonheur]] became famous primarily for two chief works: ''Ploughing in the Nivernais'' (in French: ''Le labourage nivernais, le sombrage''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galerie.roi-president.com/photo-36-62-musee+d+orsay++consacre+a+l+art+de+1848+a+1914.html Galerie.roi-president.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and, ''The Horse Fair'' (in French: ''Le marché aux chevaux'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/435702 Metmuseum.org]&lt;/ref&gt; (which was exhibited at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1853 (finished in 1855) and is now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], in [[New York City]]. Bonheur is widely considered to have been the most famous female painter of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, H. W., Janson, Anthony F. ''History of Art''. Harry N. Abrams, Inc., Publishers. 6th edition.  {{ISBN|0-13-182895-9}}, page 674.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isidore Bonheur]], the younger brother of Rosa Bonheur, is known as one of the 19th century's most distinguished [[France|French]] [[animalier]] [[sculptor]]s.&lt;ref name="Christie's"&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/isidore-jules-bonheur-the-steeplechase-4194354-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=4194354&amp;sid=a339c2b1-09f5-40ec-b5a2-a4232e433766 Christie's New York, Isidore-Jules Bonheur]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2007/the-sporting-sale-including-the-john-poynton-collection-l07121/lot.307.html Isidore-Jules Bonheur, ''Le Grand Jockey'' (''A Horse and Jockey''), bronze, Sotheby's London, 6 June 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; He modeled his sculptures to catch movement or posture characteristic of the particular species. Isidore Bonheur achieved this most successfully with his sculptures of horses, usually depicted as relaxed rather than spirited, and which are among his most renowned works.&lt;ref name="Joconde"&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/joconde_fr?ACTION=RETROUVER&amp;FIELD_98=AUTR&amp;VALUE_98=BONHEUR%20Isidore%20Jules&amp;NUMBER=1&amp;GRP=0&amp;REQ=%28%28BONHEUR%20Isidore%20Jules%29%20%3aAUTR%20%29&amp;USRNAME=nobody&amp;USRPWD=4%24%2534P&amp;SPEC=3&amp;SYN=1&amp;IMLY=&amp;MAX1=1&amp;MAX2=1&amp;MAX3=100&amp;DOM=All Joconde, Le Ministère de la culture, Portail des collections des musées de France, Bonheur Isidore Jules]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Alfred Munnings]] was an acclaimed painter working in England during the 20th century, he was elected president of the [[Royal Academy]] in 1944. He specialised in equine subjects, including horse racing, portraiture and studies of gypsies and rural life.

==Subject genres==

===Military and war===
[[File:The Procession of the Trojan Horse in Troy by Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]], Detail from ''The Procession of the [[Trojan Horse]] in Troy,'' (1773), inspired by Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'']]
[[File:Uccello Battle of San Romano Uffizi.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Uccello]], ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'', c. 1438–1440. Egg tempera with walnut oil and linseed oil on poplar. 181.6 x 320 cm. [[Uffizi]].]]
[[Military art]] often depicts the [[Horses in warfare|horse in battle]] and provides some of the earliest examples of the horse in art, with [[cavalry]], horse-drawn [[chariot]]s and [[horse archers]] all appearing on ancient artifacts.

In the medieval period cavalry battles and [[knight]]s on horseback were portrayed by artists including [[Paolo Uccello]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]]. Uccello's tryptic [[The Battle of San Romano]] shows various stages of a battle. Dürer's engraving of  "Knight, Death and the Devil", 1513 shows a military subject combined with allegorical theme.

[[Sir Alfred Munnings]] was appointed as a [[war artist]] during World War I, he painted both the Canadian Cavalry Brigade and the Canadian Forestry Corps stationed in France. He considered his experiences with the Canadian units to have been among the most rewarding events of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[Elizabeth Thompson]], known as Lady Butler, was famed for her military art, especially "Scotland Forever" featuring a dramatic charge by the [[Royal Scots Greys]].


===Horse racing===

[[File:Edgar Degas - Before the Race - Walters 37850.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Edgar Degas]], ''[[Before the Race (painting)|Before the Race]]'', 1882–84, oil on panel, [[The Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore]]
[[File:Muybridge race horse animated.gif|thumb|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], Animated sequence of a race horse galloping, using photos published in 1887 (Animal Locomotion).]]
Thoroughbred racing was an inspiration for Romantic and Impressionist artists of the 19th century. [[Théodore Géricault]] painted [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]] in 1821 during his stay in England. The Impressionist era coincided with the development of racing in France, [[Manet]], [[Degas]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]] all acquired a lasting fascination with racing. Manet showing the excitement and action of the race and Degas concentrating more on the moments before the start. Degas was intensely interested in [[Eadweard Muybridge|Muybridge]]'s photographs of the horse in motion, he copied them in chalk and pencil and used them for reference in his later work.&lt;ref name= "Fairley"&gt;{{cite book

Generations of artists before Muybridge had portrayed the horse in a 'rocking horse' gallop with the horse portrayed with both front legs extended forward and both hind legs extended rearwards. Much more realistic representations were possible after the event of photography and Muybridge's work but that did not necessarily lead to the impression of movement in the artwork. [[Lowes Dalbiac Luard|Luard]] writing in 1921 compares the running action of an animal with the run and rhythm of an air in music, but the instantaneous moment recorded by a photograph as a detached chord with little meaning or context.&lt;ref name= "Luard"&gt;{{cite book

[[George Stubbs]] and [[Alfred Munnings]] have both left a vast body of work involving the racehorse.

In the 20th century, much of the artwork by [[John Skeaping]] involved the racing scene, including life-size bronzes of [[Hyperion (horse)|Hyperion]] and [[Brigadier Gerard (horse)|Brigadier Gerard]] and watercolours of race course action.

===The American West===

[[File:Charles Marion Russell - Buccaroos (1902).jpg|thumb|230px|left|[[Charles Marion Russell]], ''Buccaroos,'' 1902]]
Artwork associated with the historic [[cowboy]] or [[Indigenous people of the Americas|Native American]] tradition of the American west naturally includes many equine subjects. [[:Category:Artists of the American West|Artists of the American West]] include [[Frederic Remington]] and [[C.M. Russell]] who are known for their paintings of equine subjects. Remington was one of the first American artists to illustrate the true gait of the horse in motion (along with [[Thomas Eakins]]), as validated by the famous sequential photographs of [[Eadweard Muybridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Peggy &amp; Harold Samuels, ''Frederic Remington: A Biography'', Doubleday &amp; Co., Garden City NY, {{ISBN|0-385-14738-4}}, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;
Remington also captured equine drama in his bronze sculptures, his first, [[Bronco Buster]] ([[Williams College Museum of Art]]), was a critical and commercial success.

Inspired by El Greco's, ''Saint Martin and the Beggar'', c. 1597–1600, [[Art Institute of Chicago]] Pablo Picasso introduced horses into his work in 1905-06 notably ''[[Boy Leading a Horse]]'', [[Museum of Modern Art]]. [[Franz Marc]] and others including [[Susan Rothenberg]] and [[Deborah Butterfield]] beginning in the 1970s used horses as motifs in their paintings and sculpture throughout the 20th century. For a large and complex 20th century war painting in which a horse is the central dramatic figure, see [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]] by [[Pablo Picasso]]. While [[Impressionist]] painter [[Edgar Degas]] was particularly famous for his paintings of dancers, Degas was also known for his paintings of horses and horse racing.

===Hunting===
Hunting scenes have been a common subject matter for equestrian painters. Specialists in [[fox hunting]] subjects include [[Cecil Aldin]] and [[Lionel Edwards]].

===Rural/working life===
[[Lucy Kemp-Welch]] was well known for her depiction of wild and working horses in the landscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5438">'''''Interdisciplinary Arts''''' is an academic department in the School of Media Arts at [[Columbia College Chicago]]. As one of the earliest interdisciplinary arts programs in the United States, it has been an incubator for new approaches towards art making that has shaped the development of arts professionals for over thirty-three years. Guided by the principle that [[interdisciplinarity]] "is a defining characteristic of contemporary art practice" &lt;ref&gt;Interdisciplinary Arts Department, [http://www.colum.edu/interarts/ "Interdisciplinary Arts Department Mission Statement"], Retrieved 6 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a necessary prerequisite for those artists who will shape the future of creative practice",&lt;ref&gt;Interdisciplinary Arts Department, [http://www.colum.edu/interarts/ "Interdisciplinary Arts Department Homepage"], Retrieved 6 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the artists who work in the Interdisciplinary Arts department investigate new terrain.

Examining concepts, forms and techniques from across the fine, performing and media arts, students work with a diverse array of unique and experimental approaches that interrogate artist books, installations, gesture and movement, sound art, durational performance, interactive media, video, performance media, papermaking, letterpress, etching and offset printing, electronically controlled artworks, online artwork, performance in artificial spaces, democratic multiples, written, spoken and performed text, dramatic forms, DIY/DIT collaborative strategies and relational art forms.

== History ==
Interdisciplinary Arts was formulated in Chicago Il, 1976, by [[Suzanne Cohan-Lange]], Jean Unsworth, and Rebecca Ruben.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Beverly T., In Non-Traditional, Interdisciplinary Study at Columbia College, Artists Get a Chance to Broaden Their Horizons, Hone Creativity, [http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ416792&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ416792 "Chronicle of Higher Education"], v37 n3 pA17,20 Sep 19 1990, {{ISSN|0009-5982}}, Retrieved 9 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally accepted by the Chicago Consortium of Colleges as a program taught across several universities, in 1981, it was established as a department with a permanent home at [[Columbia College Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;Columbia College Oral History Project, [http://www.lib.colum.edu/archives/oralhistory/index.php "Columbia College Oral History Project"], Retrieved 9 Nov 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the Interdisciplinary Arts MA program was formalized within the context of the department. Since then, two MFA degrees were added: the Interdisciplinary Book &amp; Paper Arts MFA, launched in 1994; and the Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Media MFA, launched in 2002. The founding of the Interdisciplinary Arts program is preceded by the undergraduate program in the [[Studio for Interrelated Media]] program founded by [[Harris Barron]] in 1969 at the [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston.

==Programs==
The Interdisciplinary Arts MA is for art teachers who want to expand their repertoire of techniques, as well as assist practicing artists in expanding their practice to include new media. It is immersed in the five traditional art media that make up the heart of the program: visual art, movement, sound, writing, and drama.

The Interdisciplinary Book &amp; Paper Arts MFA program enables students to participate in the contemporary art world by encouraging them to consider book and paper as a site for interdisciplinary practice. It promotes the understanding of hand papermaking and the book arts as artistic media with applications in cultural discourse, community building, and collaborative practice.

The Interdisciplinary Arts &amp; Media MFA fosters an innovative dialog between the fine, performing and media arts. It is a graduate program for traditional and performing artists who want to incorporate media into their artistic practice and for media artists who want to expand into areas such as performance, installation, interactive, and relational art forms.

==Facilities==
In the 916 S. Wabash building are housed the departmental offices, faculty offices, conference room, lecture hall, two smart classrooms, large computer lab, three installation labs and the media equipment center. Additionally, the [[Center for Book and Paper Arts]] is part of the Interdisciplinary Arts department. The [[Center for Book and Paper Arts]] occupies the entire second floor of the historic [[Ludington Building]] at 1104 South Wabash and includes a papermaking studio, a letterpress facility, a bookbindery, a gallery, a smart classroom, a multi-purpose space for performance and lectures, a computer laboratory, a critique room, studio space for artists, a resource room, and offices for the staff.  Also at 1104 South Wabash are studio spaces for the MFA students.

'''Irony''' ({{ety|grc|''εἰρωνεία'' eirōneía|dissimulation, feigned ignorance}}&lt;ref&gt;Liddell &amp; Scott, ''[[A Greek-English Lexicon]]'', v. sub {{lang|grc|εἰρωνεία}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), in its broadest sense, is a [[rhetorical device]], [[literary technique]], or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. 

Irony can be categorized into different types, including: ''verbal irony'', ''dramatic irony'', and ''situational irony''. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of [[simile]], used in [[sarcasm]], and some forms of [[litotes]] can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Compass_of_Irony.html?id=7PsNAAAAQAAJ Muecke, DC., ''The Compass of Irony'', Routledge, 1969. p. 80]&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms, as identified by historian [[Connop Thirlwall]], include dialectic and practical irony.&lt;ref name="NPE" /&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Henry Watson Fowler]], in ''[[The King's English]]'', says, "any definition of irony—though hundreds might be given, and very few of them would be accepted—must include this, that the surface meaning and the underlying meaning of what is said are not the same." Also, Eric Partridge, in ''[[Eric Partridge|Usage and Abusage]]'', writes that "Irony consists in stating the contrary of what is meant."

The use of irony may require the concept of a ''double audience''. Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Irony is a form of utterance that postulates a double audience, consisting of one party that hearing shall hear &amp; shall not understand, &amp; another party that, when more is meant than meets the ear, is aware both of that more &amp; of the outsiders' incomprehension.&lt;ref name="Fowler, HW 1926"&gt;Fowler, H. W., ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage'', 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term is sometimes used as a synonym for ''incongruous'' and applied to "every trivial oddity" in situations where there is no double audience.&lt;ref name="Fowler, HW 1926"/&gt; An example of such usage is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Arthur Sullivan|Sullivan]], whose real interest was, ironically, serious music, which he composed with varying degrees of success, achieved fame for his comic opera scores rather than for his more earnest efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Gassner, J., Quinn, E., ''The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama'', Courier Dover Publications, 2002, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[American Heritage Dictionary]]''{{'s}} secondary meaning for ''irony'': "incongruity between what might be expected and what actually occurs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony |title="irony" at dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218045412/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/irony |archivedate=2010-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense, however, is not synonymous with "incongruous" but merely a definition of dramatic or situational irony. {{Anchor|Incongruity_plus_human_folly}} It is often included in definitions of irony ''not only'' that incongruity is present ''but also'' that the incongruity must reveal some aspect of human vanity or folly. Thus the majority of ''American Heritage Dictionary'''s usage panel found it unacceptable to use the word ''ironic'' to describe mere unfortunate coincidences or surprising disappointments that "suggest no particular lessons about human vanity or folly."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Free Dictionary'' under ''ironic'': http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ironic&lt;/ref&gt;

On this aspect, ''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') has also:&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "irony" entry, second definition.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|1=A condition of affairs or events of a character opposite to what was, or might naturally be, expected; a contradictory outcome of events as if in mockery of the promise and fitness of things. (In French, ''ironie du sort'').}}

==Origin of the term==
According to ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=irony |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294609/irony |accessdate=18 September 2014 |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150212010710/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/294609/irony |archive-date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{Quote|1=The term irony has its roots in the Greek comic character [[Eiron]], a clever underdog who by his wit repeatedly triumphs over the boastful character [[Alazon]]. The Socratic irony of the [[Platonic dialogues]] derives from this comic origin.}}

According to Richard Whately:&lt;ref&gt;Whately, Richard; "Rhetoric", ''Encyclopedia Metropolitan'', I. 265/1; 1845 (cited in the ''OED'' entry)&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=[[Aristotle]] mentions ''Eironeia'', which in his time was commonly employed to signify, not according to the modern use of 'Irony, saying the contrary to what is meant', but, what later writers usually express by [[Litotes]], i.e. 'saying less than is meant'.}}

The word came into English as a [[figure of speech]] in the 16th century as similar to the French ''ironie''. It derives from the Latin ''ironia'' and ultimately from the Greek ''εἰρωνεία'' eirōneía, meaning ''dissimulation, ignorance purposely affected''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "irony" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Situational irony - Baker Street tube station.jpg|thumb|A "No smoking" sign surrounded by images of a smoking [[Sherlock Holmes]] at [[Baker Street tube station]]]]

''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'' distinguishes between the following types of irony:&lt;ref name="NPE"&gt;Preminger, A. &amp; Brogan, T. V. F. Brogan, 
''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', MJF Books, 1993, {{ISBN|9780691032719}},  pp. 633–635.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Classical''' irony: Referring to the origins of irony in Ancient Greek comedy, and the way classical and medieval rhetoricians delineated the term.
*'''Romantic''' irony: A self-aware and self-critical form of fiction.
*'''Cosmic''' irony: A contrast between the absolute and the relative, the general and the individual, which Hegel expressed by the phrase, "general [irony] of the world."&lt;ref name="NPE" /&gt;
*'''Verbal''' irony: A contradiction between a statement's stated and intended meaning
*'''Situational''' irony: The disparity of intention and result; when the result of an action is contrary to the desired or expected effect.
*'''Dramatic''' irony and '''tragic''' irony: A disparity of awareness between an actor and an observer: when words and actions possess significance that the listener or audience understands, but the speaker or character does not; for example when a character says to another "I'll see you tomorrow!" when the audience (but not the character) knows that the character will die before morning. It is most often used when the author causes a character to speak or act erroneously, out of ignorance of some portion of the truth of which the audience is aware. In tragic irony, the audience knows the character is making a mistake, even as the character is making it.

===Verbal irony===
According to ''A glossary of literary terms'' by Abrams and Hartman,&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Verbal irony''' is a statement in which the meaning that a speaker employs is sharply different from the meaning that is ostensibly expressed. An ironic statement usually involves the explicit expression of one attitude or evaluation, but with indications in the overall speech-situation that the speaker intends a very different, and often opposite, attitude or evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, M. H., &amp; Harpham, G. G., ''A glossary of literary terms'', 9th Ed., Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Verbal irony is distinguished from situational irony and dramatic irony in that it is produced ''intentionally'' by speakers. For instance, if a man exclaims, "I'm not upset!" but reveals an upset [[emotional]] state through his voice while truly trying to claim he's not upset, it would not be verbal irony by virtue of its verbal manifestation (it would, however, be situational irony). But if the same speaker said the same words and intended to communicate that he was upset by claiming he was not, the utterance would be verbal irony. This distinction illustrates an important aspect of verbal irony—speakers communicate implied propositions that are intentionally contradictory to the propositions contained in the words themselves. There are, however, examples of verbal irony that do not rely on saying the opposite of what one means, and there are cases where all the traditional criteria of irony exist and the utterance is not ironic.

In a clear example from literature, in Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar'', Mark Antony's speech after the assassination of Caesar appears to praise the assassins, particularly Brutus ("But Brutus says he was ambitious; / And Brutus is an honourable man"), while actually condemning them. "We're left in no doubt as to who's ambitious and who's honourable. The literal truth of what's written clashes with the perceived truth of what's meant to revealing effect, which is irony in a nutshell".
&lt;ref&gt;
Horberry, R., ''Sounds Good on Paper: How to Bring Business Language to Life'', A&amp;amp;C Black, 2010. p. 135. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sounds_Good_on_Paper.html?id=rlBIvHRkExsC] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironic [[simile#irony|similes]] are a form of verbal irony where a speaker intends to communicate the opposite of what they mean. For instance, the following explicit similes begin with the deceptive formation of a statement that means ''A'' but that eventually conveys the meaning ''not A'':
* as soft as concrete
* as clear as mud
* as pleasant as a [[Endodontic therapy|root canal]]
* "as pleasant and relaxed as a coiled rattlesnake" (Kurt Vonnegut from ''[[Breakfast of Champions]]'')

The irony is recognizable in each case only by using knowledge of the source concepts (e.g., that mud is opaque, that root canal surgery is painful) to detect an incongruity.

====Verbal irony and sarcasm====
A fair amount of confusion has surrounded the issue of the relationship between verbal irony and [[sarcasm]].

Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'' states: &lt;blockquote&gt;Sarcasm does not necessarily involve irony and irony has often no touch of sarcasm. &lt;/blockquote&gt;This suggests that the two concepts are linked but may be considered separately. ''The Oxford English Dictionary''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s entry for [[sarcasm]] does not mention irony, but the irony entry includes:
{{Quote|1=A figure of speech in which the intended meaning is the opposite of that expressed by the words used; usually taking the form of sarcasm or ridicule in which laudatory expressions are used to imply condemnation or contempt.}}

The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' has "Non-literary irony is often called sarcasm"; while the ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' entry is:
{{Quote|1=Sarcasm: 1&amp;thinsp;: a sharp and often satirical or ironic utterance designed to cut or give pain. 2 a&amp;thinsp;: a mode of satirical wit depending for its effect on bitter, caustic, and often ironic language that is usually directed against an individual.}}

Partridge in ''[[Usage and Abusage]]'' would separate the two forms of speech completely: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Irony must not be confused with sarcasm, which is direct: sarcasm means precisely what it says, but in a sharp, caustic, ... manner. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The psychologist Martin, in ''The Psychology of Humour'', is quite clear that irony is where "the literal meaning is opposite to the intended" and sarcasm is "aggressive humor that pokes fun".&lt;ref&gt;Martin, R. A., ''The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach'', Elsevier Academic Press, 2007. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; He has the following examples: for irony he uses the statement "What a nice day" when it is raining. For sarcasm, he cites [[Winston Churchill]], who is supposed to have said, when told by [[Bessie Braddock]] that he was drunk, "But I shall be sober in the morning, and you will still be ugly", as being sarcastic, while not saying the opposite of what is intended.

Psychology researchers Lee and Katz (1998) have addressed the issue directly. They found that ridicule is an important aspect of sarcasm, but not of verbal irony in general. By this account, sarcasm is a particular kind of personal criticism levelled against a person or group of persons that incorporates verbal irony. For example, a woman reports to her friend that rather than going to a medical doctor to treat her cancer, she has decided to see a spiritual healer instead. In response her friend says sarcastically, "Oh, brilliant, what an ingenious idea, that's really going to cure you." The friend could have also replied with any number of ironic expressions that should not be labeled as sarcasm exactly, but still have many shared elements with sarcasm.

Most instances of verbal irony are labeled by research subjects as sarcastic, suggesting that the term ''sarcasm'' is more widely used than its technical definition suggests it should be (Bryant &amp; Fox Tree, 2002; Gibbs, 2000). Some [[psycholinguistic]] theorists (e.g., Gibbs, 2000) suggest that [[sarcasm]] ("Great idea!", "I hear they do fine work."), [[hyperbole]] ("That's the best idea I have heard in years!"), [[understatement]] ("Sure, what the hell, it's only cancer..."), [[rhetorical question]]s ("What, does your spirit have cancer?"), [[double entendre]] ("I'll bet if you do that, you'll be communing with spirits in no time...") and [[jocularity]] ("Get them to fix your bad back while you're at it.") should all be considered forms of verbal irony. The differences between these rhetorical devices ([[trope (literature)|tropes]]) can be quite subtle and relate to typical emotional reactions of listeners, and the rhetorical goals of the speakers. Regardless of the various ways theorists categorize figurative language types, people in conversation who are attempting to interpret speaker intentions and discourse goals do not generally identify, by name, the kinds of tropes used (Leggitt &amp; Gibbs, 2000).

====Verbal irony and echoic allusion====
Echoic allusion is the main component involved in conveying verbally ironic meaning. It is best described as a [[speech act]] by which the speaker simultaneously represents a thought, belief or idea, and implicitly attributes this idea to someone else who is wrong or deluded. In this way, the speaker intentionally dissociates themselves from the idea and conveys their tacit dissent, thereby providing a different meaning to their utterance. In some cases, the speaker can provide stronger dissociation from the represented thought by also implying derision toward the idea or outwardly making fun of the person or people they attribute it to.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Deirdre. "The Pragmatics Of Verbal Irony: Echo Or Pretence?." Lingua 116.10 (2006): 1722-1743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoic allusion, like other forms of verbal irony, relies on semantically disambiguating cues to be interpreted correctly. These cues often come in the form of [[paralanguage|paralinguistic markers]] such as prosody, tone, or pitch,&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Gregory A., and Jean E. Fox Tree. "Recognizing Verbal Irony in Spontaneous Speech." Metaphor and Symbol 17.2 (2002): 99-119. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[nonverbal communication|nonverbal cues]] like hand gesture, facial expression and eye gaze.&lt;ref&gt;González-Fuente, Santiago, Victoria Escandell-Vidal, and Pilar Prieto. "Gestural Codas Pave The Way To The Understanding Of Verbal Irony." Journal of Pragmatics 90.(2015): 26-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of echoic allusion and its disambiguating paralinguistic markers is as follows:
* Person 1: I wasn't going to eat the cake, you know.
* Person 2: Interesting, that's what it looked like you were doing, but I just must have been mistaken.
From simple semantic analysis, Person 2 appears to believe Person 1. However, if this conversation is given the context of Person 2 walking in on Person 1 about to eat some cake, and Person 2 speaking their sentence in a significantly decreased rate of speech and lowered tone, the interpretation of "I just must have been mistaken" changes. Instead of being taken as Person 2 believing Person 1, the utterance calls to mind someone who would believe Person 1, while also conveying Person 2's implication that said individual would be considered gullible. From this, Person 2 negates the possible interpretation that they believe Person 1.

===Dramatic irony===
Dramatic irony exploits the device of giving the spectator an item of information that at least one of the characters in the narrative is unaware of (at least consciously), thus placing the spectator a step ahead of at least one of the characters. [[Connop Thirlwall]] in his 1833 article ''On the Irony of [[Sophocles]]'' originally highlighted the role of irony in drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/irony.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604184251/http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/irony.htm |archivedate=2016-06-04 |df= }}; cf. G.M. Kirkwood, ''A Study of Sophoclean Drama'', p. 258: "The now familiar concept of 'dramatic irony' was originally developed in an early nineteenth century article, "On the Irony of Sophocles," by the English scholar Connop Thirlwall, who explains that in a play the sequence of events can lead to two different interpretations of the action so far: the situation as it appears to the characters in the play, and to the situation as it really is."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thirlwall's original article appears in ''Philological Museum'' (edited by J.C. Hare), vol. 2, pp. 483-537, available at https://archive.org/details/philologicalmus01haregoog&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' defines dramatic irony as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
{{Quote|1=the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned; the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.}}

According to Stanton,&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, R., "Dramatic Irony in Hawthorne's Romances", ''Modern Language Notes'', Vol. 71, No. 6 (Jun., 1956), pp. 420–426, The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; dramatic irony has three stages—installation, exploitation, and resolution (often also called preparation, suspension, and resolution)
—producing dramatic conflict in what one character relies or appears to rely upon, the ''contrary'' of which is known by observers (especially the audience; sometimes to other characters within the drama) to be true. In summary, it means that the reader/watcher/listener knows something that one or more of the characters in the piece is not aware of.

For example:
* In ''[[City Lights]]'', the audience knows that [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s character is not a millionaire, but the blind flower girl ([[Virginia Cherrill]]) believes him to be rich.&lt;ref&gt;
Clausius, C., ''The Gentleman Is a Tramp: Charlie Chaplin's Comedy'', P. Lang, 1989, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[North by Northwest]]'', the audience knows that Roger Thornhill ([[Cary Grant]]) is not Kaplan; Vandamm ([[James Mason]]) and his accomplices do not. The audience also knows that Kaplan is a fictitious agent invented by the CIA; Roger (initially) and Vandamm (throughout) do not.&lt;ref&gt;Gulino, P., ''Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach'', Continuum, 2004, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Othello]]'', the audience knows that Desdemona has remained faithful to Othello, but Othello does not. The audience also knows that Iago is scheming to bring about Othello's downfall, a fact hidden from Othello, Desdemona, Cassio, and Roderigo.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, W. C., ''A Rhetoric of Irony'', University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 63. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Rhetoric_of_Irony.html?id=jbgufPEUD6QC]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]", the reader knows that Montresor is planning on murdering Fortunato, while Fortunato believes they are friends.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe, Edgar Allan]], ''[[The Cask of Amontillado]]'', The Creative Company, 2008, pp. 22–23.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Cask_of_Amontillado.html?id=4b6PnHfQ1y8C]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Truman Show]]'', the viewer realizes that Truman is on a television show, but Truman himself only gradually learns this.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, A., ''Parallel Lives of Jesus: A Guide to the Four Gospels'', Presbyterian Publishing Corp, 2011, p. 30.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Parallel_Lives_of_Jesus.html?id=6qDZ3Aie08EC]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tragic irony====
Tragic irony is a special category of dramatic irony. In tragic irony, the words and actions of the characters contradict the real situation, which the spectators fully realize. ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' defines this as:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;
{{Quote|the incongruity created when the (tragic) significance of a character's speech or actions is revealed to the audience but unknown to the character concerned, the literary device so used, orig. in Greek tragedy.}}

[[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek drama]] was especially characterized by tragic irony because the audiences were so familiar with the [[legend]]s that most of the plays dramatized. [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' provides a classic example of tragic irony at its fullest. Colebrook writes:&lt;ref&gt;Colebrook, Claire. ''Irony''. London and New York: Routledge, 2004, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|1=Tragic irony is exemplified in ancient drama.... The audience watched a drama unfold, already knowing its destined outcome.... In Sophocles' ''Oedipus the King'', for example, 'we' (the audience) can see what Oedipus is blind to. The man he murders is his father, but he does not know it.}}

Further, Oedipus vows to find the murderer and curses him for the plague that he has caused, not knowing that the murderer he has cursed and vowed to find is himself. The audience knows that Oedipus himself is the murderer that he is seeking; Oedipus, Creon, and Jocasta do not.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, I. C.; Allan, A.; ''A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p. 125. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Guide_to_Ancient_Greek_Drama.html?id=z2t1cIVk-A8C]&lt;/ref&gt;

Irony has some of its foundation in the onlooker's perception of [[paradox]] that arises from insoluble problems. For example, in the [[William Shakespeare]] play ''Romeo and Juliet'', when Romeo finds Juliet in a drugged, deathlike sleep, he assumes her to be dead. The audience knows that Juliet has faked her death, yet Romeo believes she is truly dead, and commits suicide. Upon awakening to find her dead lover beside her, Juliet stabs herself with a dagger thus killing herself, too.&lt;ref&gt;William, J., ''Cliffs Complete Romeo and Juliet'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2009, pp. 135, 169, 181. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/CliffsComplete_Romeo_and_Juliet.html?id=c7MyAImulJ0C]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situational irony===
Situational irony is a relatively modern use of the term, and describes a sharp discrepancy between the expected result and actual results in a certain situation.
Lars Elleström writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Situational irony'' ... is most broadly defined as a situation where the outcome is incongruous with what was expected, but it is also more generally understood as a situation that includes contradictions or sharp contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;Elleström, L., ''Divine Madness: On Interpreting Literature, Music and the Visual Arts'', Bucknell University Press, 2002, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For example:
*When [[Reagan assassination attempt|John Hinckley attempted to assassinate]] [[Ronald Reagan]], all of his shots initially missed the President; however, a bullet ricocheted off the bullet-proof Presidential limousine and struck Reagan in the chest. Thus, a vehicle made to protect the President from gunfire instead directed gunfire to the president.&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/hinckley/hinckleyaccount.html The Trial of John W.

[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Sounds_Good_on_Paper.html?id=rlBIvHRkExsC]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is a story whose plot revolves around situational irony. Dorothy travels to a wizard and fulfills his challenging demands in order to go home, before discovering she'd had the ability to go back home all along. The Scarecrow longs for [[intelligence]], only to discover he is already a [[genius]], and the [[Tin Woodman]] longs to have a heart, only to discover he is already capable of [[love]]. The Lion, who at first appears to be a whimpering [[coward]], turns out to be bold and fearless. The people in [[Emerald City]] believed the Wizard to be a powerful [[deity]], only to discover that he is a bumbling, eccentric old man with no special powers at all.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Lenguazco, CD., ''English through movies. The wizard of Oz'', Librería-Editorial Dykinson, 2005, p. 27. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/English_thorugh_movies_The_wizard_of_Oz.html?id=IPQSaP-ENZkC]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[O. Henry]]'s story "[[The Gift of the Magi]]", a young couple are too poor to buy each other Christmas gifts.  The wife cuts off her treasured hair to sell it to a wig-maker for money to buy her husband a chain for his heirloom pocket watch. She's shocked when she learns he had pawned his watch to buy her a set of combs for her long, beautiful, prized hair. "The double irony lies in the particular way their expectations were foiled." &lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, W. G.; Colston, H. L.; ''Irony in Language and Thought: A Cognitive Science Reader'', Routledge, 2007, p. 59.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Cosmic irony}}Cosmic irony (irony of fate)====
The expression cosmic irony or "irony of fate" stems from the notion that the gods (or the [[Moirai|Fates]]) are amusing themselves by toying with the minds of mortals with deliberate ironic intent. Closely connected with situational irony, it arises from sharp contrasts between reality and human ideals, or between human intentions and actual results. The resulting situation is poignantly contrary to what was expected or intended.

According to Sudhir Dixit, "Cosmic irony is a term that is usually associated with [Thomas] [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]]. ... There is a strong feeling of a hostile [[deus ex machina]] in Hardy's novels." In ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' "there are several instances of this type of irony."&lt;ref&gt;Dixit, S., ''Hardy's Tess Of The D'urbervilles'', Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, 2001, p. 182.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Hardys_Tess_Of_The_Durbervilles.html?id=n45KUGyNsYQC]&lt;/ref&gt; One example follows:&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Hardy|Hardy, Thomas]], ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', Oxford World's Classics, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Justice" was done, and the President of the Immortals (in Æschylean phrase) had ended his sport with Tess.

====Historical irony====
When history is seen through modern eyes, there often appear sharp contrasts between the way historical figures see their world's future and what actually transpires. For example, during the 1920s ''The New York Times'' repeatedly scorned [[crossword|crossword puzzles]]. In 1924, it lamented "the sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern." In 1925 it said "the question of whether the puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast." Today, no U.S. newspaper is more closely identified with the crossword than ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puzzles.about.com/library/weekly/blwordplaydoc.htm|title=Puzzles|author=|date=|website=about.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318011533/http://puzzles.about.com/library/weekly/blwordplaydoc.htm|archivedate=18 March 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a more tragic example of historical irony, what people now refer to as the "[[First World War]]" was  called by [[H. G. Wells]] "the war that will end war",&lt;ref&gt;[[H. G. Wells|Wells, H. G.]], ''The War That Will End War'', 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; which soon became "[[the war to end war]]" and "the war to end all wars", and this became a widespread truism, almost a [[cliché]]. Historical irony is therefore a subset of cosmic irony, but one in which the element of time is bound to play a role. Another example could be that of the [[Vietnam War]], where in the 1960s the US attempted to stop the [[Viet Cong]] (Viet Minh) taking over South Vietnam. However, it is an often ignored fact that, in 1941, the US originally supported the [[Viet Minh]] in its fight against Japanese occupation.&lt;ref name="Neale, Jonathan page 17"&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', p. 17, {{ISBN|1-898876-67-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical irony also includes [[List of inventors killed by their own inventions|inventors killed by their own creations]], such as [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]] – unless, due to the nature of the invention, the risk of death was always known and accepted, as in the case of [[Otto Lilienthal]], who was killed by flying a glider of his own devising.

In certain kinds of situational or historical irony, a factual truth is highlighted by some person's complete ignorance of it or his belief in its opposite. However, this state of affairs does not occur by human design. In some religious contexts, such situations have been seen as the deliberate work of [[divine providence]] to emphasize truths and to taunt humans for not being aware of them when they could easily have been enlightened (this is similar to human use of irony). Such ironies are often more evident, or more striking, when viewed retrospectively in the light of later developments which make the truth of past situations obvious to all.

Other prominent examples of outcomes now seen as poignantly contrary to expectation include:

*In the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' ruling in 1856, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] barred any law that would deprive a slaveholder of his property, such as his slaves, upon the incidence of migration into free territory. So, in a sense, the Supreme Court used the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] to deny rights to slaves. Also, Chief Justice Taney hoped that the decision would resolve the slavery issue, but instead it helped cause the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Fehrenbacher, D. E., ''Slavery, Law, and Politics: The Dred Scott Case in Historical Perspective'', Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 90.

==Use==

===Comic irony===
Irony is often used in literature to produce a comic effect.  This may also be combined with [[satire]].  For instance, an author may facetiously state something as a well-known fact and then demonstrate through the narrative that the fact is untrue.

Jane Austen's ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]'' begins with the proposition "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife." In fact, it soon becomes clear that Austen means the opposite: women (or their mothers) are always in search of, and desperately on the lookout for, a rich single man to make a husband. The irony deepens as the story promotes this romance and ends in a double marriage proposal. "Austen's comic irony emerges out of the disjunction between Elizabeth's overconfidence (or pride) in her perceptions of Darcy and the narrator's indications that her views are in fact partial and prejudicial."&lt;ref&gt;Ferriss, S.; Young, M.; ''Chick Lit: The New Woman's Fiction'', Routledge, 2006, p. 77. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Chick_Lit.html?id=lMjey3Bese0C]&lt;/ref&gt;

"''[[The Third Man]]'' is a film that features any number of eccentricities, each of which contributes to the film's perspective of comic irony as well as its overall cinematic self-consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, W. E.; Vice, S.; ''Ethics at the Cinema'', Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 295.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Ethics_at_the_Cinema.html?id=QdP_xLImIugC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about performances of Shakespeare's ''[[Othello]]'' in apartheid South Africa, Robert Gordon suggests: "Could it be that black people in the audience ... may have viewed as a comic irony his audacity and naïvety in thinking he could pass for white."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, R., in ''The Shakespearean  International Yearbook: Special Section, South African Shakespeare in the Twentieth Century'', Volume 9, Ashgate Publishing, 2009. p. 147. [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Shakespearean_International_Yearbook.html?id=ZQ3LrE-Iy-kC]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romantic irony and metafiction===
Romantic irony is "an attitude of detached scepticism adopted by an author towards his or her work, typically manifesting in literary self-consciousness and self-reflection". This conception of irony originated with the German Romantic writer and critic [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "romantic irony" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Dane writes "From a twentieth-century perspective, the most crucial area in the history of irony is that described by the term romantic irony." He discusses the difficulty of defining romantic irony: "But what is romantic irony? A universal type of irony? The irony used by romantics? or an irony envisioned by the romantics and romanticists?" He also describes the arguments for and against its use.&lt;ref&gt;Dane, J. A., ''The Critical Mythology of Irony'', University of Georgia Press, 2011, Ch. 5 [https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Critical_Mythology_of_Irony.html?id=6EAw-H8zvDkC]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to earlier self-conscious works such as [[Don Quixote]] and [[Tristram Shandy]], Douglas Muecke points particularly to [[Peter Weiss]]'s 1964 play, ''[[Marat/Sade]]''. This work is a play within a play set in a lunatic asylum, in which it is difficult to tell whether the players are speaking only to other players or also directly to the audience. When The Herald says, "The regrettable incident you've just seen was unavoidable indeed foreseen by our playwright", there is confusion as to who is being addressed, the "audience" on the stage or the audience in the theatre. Also, since the play within the play is performed by the inmates of a lunatic asylum, the theatre audience cannot tell whether the paranoia displayed before them is that of the players, or the people they are portraying. Muecke notes that, "in America, Romantic irony has had a bad press", while "in England ... [it] is almost unknown."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Compass_of_Irony.html?id=7PsNAAAAQAAJ Muecke, DC., ''The Compass of Irony'', Routledge, 1969. pp. 178–180]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a book entitled ''English Romantic Irony'', Anne Mellor writes, referring to Byron, Keats, Carlyle, Coleridge, and Lewis Carroll:&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, Anne K., ''English Romantic Irony'', Harvard University Press, 1980, pp. 4, 187.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/English_romantic_irony.html?id=M_C1AAAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|1=Romantic irony is both a philosophical conception of the universe and an artistic program. Ontologically, it sees the world as fundamentally chaotic. No order, no far goal of time, ordained by God or right reason, determines the progression of human or natural events.... Of course, romantic irony itself has more than one mode. The style of romantic irony varies from writer to writer.... But however distinctive the voice, a writer is a romantic ironist if and when his or her work commits itself enthusiastically both in content and form to a hovering or unresolved debate between a world of merely man-made being and a world of ontological becoming.}}

Similarly, [[metafiction]] is: "Fiction in which the author self-consciously alludes to the artificiality or literariness of a work by parodying or departing from novelistic conventions (esp. naturalism) and narrative techniques."&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford English Dictionary'', "metafiction" entry.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of fiction that self-consciously addresses the devices of fiction, thereby exposing the fictional illusion.

Gesa Giesing writes that "the most common form of metafiction is particularly frequent in Romantic literature. The phenomenon is then referred to as Romantic Irony." Giesing notes that "There has obviously been an increased interest in metafiction again after World War II."&lt;ref&gt;Giesing, G., ''Metafictional Aspects in Novels by Muriel Spark'', GRIN Verlag, 2004, p. 6.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Metafictional_Aspects_in_Novels_by_Murie.html?id=4gRwgvoY_ysC]&lt;/ref&gt;

For examples, Patricia Waugh quotes from several works at the top of her chapter headed "What is metafiction?". These include:

"The thing is this./ That of all the several ways of beginning a book ... I am confident my own way of doing it is best" - ''[[Tristram Shandy]]''

"Since I've started this story, I've gotten boils ..." - ''The death of the novel and other stories'' by [[Ronald Sukenick]]&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, P., ''Metafiction: The Theory and Practice of Self-Conscious Fiction'', Routledge, 2002, p. 1.[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Metafiction.html?id=O2MkrWv6RIUC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, ''The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction'' refers to [[John Fowles]]'s ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, B., ''The Cambridge Introduction to Postmodern Fiction'', Cambridge University Press, 2009, pp. 108–109.
[https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Cambridge_Introduction_to_Postmodern.html?id=PoKi_TnntzcC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the first twelve chapters ... the reader has been able to immerse him or herself in the story, enjoying the kind of 'suspension of disbelief ' required of realist novels ... what follows is a remarkable act of metafictional 'frame-breaking'. Chapter 13 notoriously begins:
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do not know. This story I am telling is all imagination. These characters I create never existed outside my own mind. ... if this is a novel, it cannot be a novel in the modern sense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Socratic irony===&lt;!--'Socratic irony' redirects here--&gt;
{{Main article|Socratic method}}
'''Socratic irony'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is "the dissimulation of ignorance practised by [[Socrates]] as a means of confuting an adversary".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Socrates would pretend to be ignorant of the topic under discussion, to draw out the inherent nonsense in the arguments of his interlocutors. ''[[The Chambers Dictionary]]'' defines it as "a means by which a questioner pretends to know less than a respondent, when actually he knows more".

Zoe Williams of ''The Guardian'' wrote: "The technique [of Socratic irony], demonstrated in the Platonic dialogues, was to pretend ignorance and, more sneakily, to feign credence in your opponent's power of thought, in order to tie him in knots."&lt;ref name="Guardian Online: The Final Irony"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2 |title=Online: The Final Irony |publisher=Guardian |date=28 June 2003 |access-date=12 December 2010 |location=London |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20131104230808/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2003/jun/28/weekend7.weekend2 |archive-date=4 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more modern example of Socratic irony can be seen on the American crime fiction television series, ''[[Columbo]]''.  The character Lt. Columbo is seemingly naïve and incompetent.  His untidy appearance adds to this fumbling illusion.  As a result, he is underestimated by the suspects in murder cases he is investigating.  With their guard down and their false sense of confidence, Lt. Columbo is able to solve the cases, leaving the murderers feeling duped and outwitted.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, G. ''How to Be a Philosopher: Or How to Be Almost Certain That Almost Nothing Is Certain,'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2010, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irony as infinite, absolute negativity===
Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and others, see irony, such as that used by Socrates, as a disruptive force with the power to undo texts and readers alike.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, S, ''The concept of irony with continuous reference to Socrates'' (1841), Harper &amp; Row, 1966, p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase itself is taken from [[Hegel]]'s ''[[Lectures on Aesthetics]]'', and is applied by Kierkegaard to the irony of Socrates. This tradition includes 19th-century German critic and novelist [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] ("On Incomprehensibility"), [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Stendhal]], and the 20th century [[deconstruction]]ist [[Paul de Man]] ("The Concept of Irony"). In Kierkegaard's words, from [[On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Socratic] irony [is] the infinite absolute negativity. It is negativity, because it only negates; it is infinite, because it does not negate this or that phenomenon; it is absolute, because that by virtue of which it negates is a higher something that still is not. The irony established nothing, because that which is to be established lies behind it...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sorenkierkegaard.org/concept-of-irony.html|title=Kierkegaard, D. Anthony Storm's Commentary on - The Concept of Irony|author=|date=|website=sorenkierkegaard.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009222139/http://sorenkierkegaard.org/concept-of-irony.html|archivedate=9 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where much of philosophy attempts to reconcile opposites into a larger positive project, Kierkegaard and others insist that irony—whether expressed in complex games of authorship or simple [[litotes]]—must, in Kierkegaard's words, "swallow its own stomach". Irony entails endless reflection and violent reversals, and ensures incomprehensibility at the moment it compels speech. Similarly, among other literary critics, writer [[David Foster Wallace]] viewed the pervasiveness of ironic and other [[postmodern]] tropes as the cause of "great despair and stasis in U.S. culture, and that for aspiring fictionists [ironies] pose terrifically vexing problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallace|first=David Foster|title=E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction|journal=Review of Contemporary Fiction|volume=13|issue=2|pages=151–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irony and awkwardness===

The '90s saw an expansion of the definition of irony from "saying what one doesn't mean" into a "general stance of&amp;nbsp;detachment&amp;nbsp;from life in general",&lt;ref&gt;Kotsko, Adam, ''Awkwardness.'', O-Books, 2010, pp. 21&lt;/ref&gt; this detachment serving as a shield against the awkwardness of everyday life. Humor from that era (most notably, ''[[Seinfeld]]'') relies on the audience watching the show with some detachment from the show's typical signature awkward situations.

The generation of people in the United States who grew up in the 90s, [[Millennials]], are seen as having this same sort of detachment from serious or awkward situations in life, as well. [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|Hipsters]] are thought to use irony as a shield against those same serious or genuine confrontations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/|title=How to Live Without Irony|first=Christy|last=Wampole|date=17 November 2012|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325230612/https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/17/how-to-live-without-irony/|archivedate=25 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dan Shaughnessy]] wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;
We were always kidding about the use of irony. I maintained that it was best never to use the word because it was too often substituted for coincidence. (Alanis Morissette's song [[Ironic (song)|"Isn't it Ironic?"]] cites multiple examples of things that are patently not ironic.)&lt;ref&gt;Shaughnessy, D., ''Senior Year: A Father, A Son, and High School Baseball'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008, pp. 91-92.

Tim Conley cites the following:
"Philip Howard assembled a list of seven implied meanings for the word "ironically", as it opens a sentence:
# By a tragic coincidence
# By an exceptional coincidence
# By a curious coincidence
# By a coincidence of no importance
# You and I know, of course, though other less intelligent mortals walk benighted under the midday sun
# Oddly enough, or it's a rum thing that

==Punctuation==
{{main article|Irony punctuation}}
No agreed-upon method for indicating irony in written text exists, though many ideas have been suggested. For instance, an [[Irony punctuation|irony punctuation mark]] was proposed in the 1580s, when Henry Denham introduced a rhetorical question mark or [[percontation point]], which resembles a reversed question mark. This mark was also advocated by the French poet Marcel Bernhardt at the end of the 19th century, to indicate irony or [[sarcasm]]. French writer [[Hervé Bazin]] suggested another ''pointe d'ironie'': the Greek letter ''[[Psi (letter)|psi]]'' {{lang|el|Ψ}} with a dot below it, while [[Tom Driberg]] recommended that ironic statements should be printed in italics that lean the other way from conventional italics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3fbWAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Houston, K., ''Shady Characters: The Secret Life of Punctuation, Symbols, and Other Typographical Marks'', W.

It was initially conferred in alternate years in the fields of Classical Music, [[Classical Dance]], Theatre and [[Plastic Arts]]. From 1986-87 onwards, the awards were presented in all four fields every year. The award is presented for outstanding achievement in one of the four categories.

==Identified fictional colors==
This is a '''list of fictional colors''' which were invented for a work of fiction.
*'''Actinic''' is a new use of an older word by [[Larry Niven]] in ''[[The Ringworld Engineers]]'' for the human sensation of color in vision-damaging ultraviolet light – for example, as seen in welding-torch light (see [[Actinism]]). The term "actinic light" was also used in E.E. Smith's [[Lensman series|''Lensmen'' series]] to describe UV light, and in the novel ''Forlorn Hope'' to describe the effect of a military laser weapon upon a cloud of mercury droplets. '''Actinic''' was also mentioned in Ambrose Bierce's short story ''[[The Damned Thing (Short Story)]]'' published in 1898. It simply referred to a color that humans cannot see.
*'''Ultra Indigo''' was a color and plot point in an episode of the television series ''[[Eureka (U.S. TV series)|Eureka]]'', possessing the power to decelerate other photons and distort time.
*'''Amarklor''' and '''Kalish''' are colors in the ultraviolet range seen by [[Klingon]]s in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' novel ''[[Pawns and Symbols]]'' by Majliss Larson. In this story, Klingons see amarklor between violet and kalish, but see the color red as black.
*'''[[List of Nebulous episodes#First series|Garrow]]'''&amp;nbsp; and '''Infra-White'''&amp;nbsp; – colors invented in the ''[[Nebulous]]'' episode "Madness Is a Strange Colour". Both colors affect the human mind in odd ways, either destroying or creating sanity. Professor Nebulous claims that he discovered Infra-White by looking ''underneath and behind'' the visible spectrum.
*'''[[Fuligin]]'''&amp;nbsp;– both a color and a textile having that color, associated with the Guild of Torturers in [[Gene Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Shadow of the Torturer]]''. The color is defined as "the color that is darker than black" and also as "the color of soot". In comparison, see the real colors [[super black]] and [[vantablack]].
*'''[[Grue and bleen]]'''&amp;nbsp;– colors that change after an arbitrary, but fixed time; coined by philosopher Nelson Goodman to illustrate what he calls "the new [[riddle of induction]]."&lt;ref name="Goodman1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nelson Goodman|title=Fact, fiction, and forecast|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i97_LdPXwrAC|accessdate=8 March 2012|year=1983|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-29071-6|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Victor Rousseau Emanuel|Mull and glow]]'''&amp;nbsp;– an infrared and an ultraviolet color seen by futuristic humans in Victor Emmanuel's ''The Messiah of the Cylinder'' (1917).
*'''[[Races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hooloovoo|Hooloovoo]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a superintelligent shade of the color blue in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series by [[Douglas Adams]]. In ''[[Life, the Universe, and Everything]]'', Adams mentions [[Agrajag]]'s lair as being painted in "the whole spectrum of eye-defying colours from Ultra Violent to Infra Dead, taking in Liver Purple, Loathsome Lilac, Matter Yellow, Burnt hombre and Gan Green on the way."&lt;ref&gt;An excerpt by Tom Snyder of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|H2G2]], located here [http://www.angelfire.com/ca3/tomsnyder/hg-3-18.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Octarine]]'''&amp;nbsp;– the color of magic in the ''[[Discworld]]'' fantasy novels, described as resembling a fluorescent greenish-yellow purple.
*'''[[Squant]]'''&amp;nbsp;– a fourth primary color publicized by the experimental band [[Negativland]] in 1993.
*[[A Voyage to Arcturus#Names|'''Jale''', '''Ulfire''' and '''Dolm''']]&amp;nbsp;– Two new primary colors (Jale and Ulfire) and a compound color of ulfire and blue (dolm) from ''[[A Voyage to Arcturus]]'' (1920) by [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]]. Jale and Ulfire are described as "Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous."
*The colors [[The Stars My Destination|'''tang''' and '''burn''']] are colors in the [[infrared]] range seen by the [[albino]] [[mutant]] Olivia Presteign (whose [[Visual perception|vision]] only functions in the infrared) in the 1956 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'' by [[Alfred Bester]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Boucher|Boucher, Anthony]], Editor ''A Treasury of Great Science Fiction'' Garden City, New York:1959—Doubleday Volume Two—''The Stars My Destination'' by Alfred Bester, Pages 361–522—Color reference Page 465&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Berl''', '''Crynor''', '''Nusp''', and '''Onsible''' are colors from the ''Star Wars'' universe. They are said to be somewhere in the ultraviolet spectrum, which can be seen by [[Hutts]] and [[Kaminoans]] and some others.
*'''Htun''' is a color similar to black only seen by gnomes in the book ''[[Fairest (novel)|Fairest]]'' by [[Gail Carson Levine]].
*'''Sangoire''' is a color of red 'so dark and saturated it [is] almost black', it is also described as 'the color of blood spilled in moonlight', seen in the [[Kushiel's Legacy]] Series by [[Jacqueline Carey]].
*'''Gloxym''' is a fictional color coined by [[Kibology|Kibo]] on his FAQ. He describes Gloxym as the true color of the sky.
*'''Smaudre''' is a color from the fairy world in [[Jack Vance]]'s ''[[Suldrun's Garden]]''. The fairy folk find it lovely, but to the human eye, it appears colorless.
*'''Rawn''' and '''Pallow''' are colors associated with circles of magic beyond white, black, purple and green in Jack Vance's ''Green Magic''.
*'''Plaid''' is one of the colors outside of the natural human spectrum visible to large intelligent [[arachnid]]s in [[Vernor Vinge]]'s novel ''[[A Deepness in the Sky]]''.
*'''Shattan''' is said to be a fourth primary color for Yalia people in ''[[Wonderland Online]]''. It is said to have calming properties and appears to humans as a combination of golden and infraviolet colors.{{citation needed|reason=No mention of Shattan at the linked page.|date=July 2014}}
*'''Flange''' is "every color of the rainbow, all at once" in the book ''[[The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles]]'' by [[Julie Andrews Edwards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-reading.me/bookreader.php/1007836/Edwards_-_The_Last_of_the_Really_Great_Whangdoodles.html|title=Book: The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles|first=Edwards Julie|last=Andrews|date=|website=www.e-reading.me}}&lt;/ref&gt;It is used by the Whangdoodle to impress his bride and it is stated that it is very hard to do. The Whangdoodle is also capable of turning colors such as crash pink, some of which may or may not exist.
*'''Apocyan''', '''Cosmogone''', '''Gant''', '''Irrigo''', '''Peligin''', '''Violant''', and '''Viric''', collectively known as 'the Neathbow', are colors found only in the subterranean Neath of Failbetter Games' ''[[Fallen London]]'' universe. They are impossible shades of existing colours: apocyan is a bright pale aqua, irrigo is brilliant purple, violant has been depicted multiple ways but is usually an iridescent wine-red, cosmogene is golden yellow, gant is beige with a slight reddish tinge, peligin is an extremely dark blue-gray that's almost black, and viric is emerald green. Most of them also have supernatural properties: irrigo causes forgetfulness, violant improves memory, cosmogone and viric are heavily associated with dreams. Gant is the colour that "remains when all other colours are eaten".
*'''El Gris/Gray''' is considered the "third" and an unreal color in ''[[La Historia de los Colores|La Historia de los Colores/The Story of Colors]]'' by [[Subcomandante Marcos]]. It only exists so the black and the white don't bump into each other so hard – it does so by painting the dusks and dawns.
*'''Gloze''' and '''Flush''' are infrared colors mentioned in the book ''[[Neverness]]'' by [[David Zindell]].

==Unnamed fictional colors==
*''[[The Colour Out of Space]]''&amp;nbsp;– a vaguely described alien hue, from the story of that name by [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (1927).
*In ''[[The Golden Key]]'', an 1867 fairy tale by [[George MacDonald]], a boy sees additional colors in a [[rainbow]] in [[Fairy]]land: "He could count all the seven colours, and could see shade after shade beyond the violet; while before the red stood a colour more gorgeous and mysterious still. It was a colour he had never seen before."
*In the [[Mars|Martian]] ([[Barsoom]]) novels of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the spectrum is divided into nine colors rather than the earthly seven, and the two unearthly colors are called "the eighth ray" and "the ninth ray". [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]] describes the additional colors as "... two beautiful rays which, to me, were new and nameless. I cannot describe them any more than you could describe red to a blind man. I only know that they were beautiful in the extreme." The eighth ray exerts an anti-gravity force and is trapped in tanks by the Red Martians to levitate and propel their flying craft. The ninth ray is processed by the great atmosphere factory to create breathable air for Barsoom.
*In the 1942 novel ''[[Perelandra]]'', [[C. S. Lewis]] describes the colors of angelic beings when they manifest themselves: "We think that when creatures of the hypersomatic kind choose to 'appear' to us, they are not in fact affecting our retina at all, but directly manipulating the relevant parts of our brain. If so, it is quite possible that they can produce there the sensations we should have if our eyes were capable of receiving those colours in the spectrum which are actually beyond their range." (Chapter 16)
*In [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] ''[[From a Buick 8]]'', the characters encounter an alien plant with an unearthly color, which the narrator describes as "corpse white".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6684">The occult (from the [[Latin]] word ''occultus'' "clandestine, hidden, secret") is "knowledge of the hidden".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Crabb (writer)|Crabb, G.]] (1927). ''English synonyms explained, in alphabetical order, copious illustrations and examples drawn from the best writers''. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co.&lt;/ref&gt; In common [[English language|English]] usage, ''occult'' refers to "knowledge of the [[paranormal]]", as opposed to "knowledge of the [[measurable]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Underhill|Underhill, E.]] (1911). ''Mysticism'', Meridian, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; usually referred to as [[science]]. The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that "is meant only for certain people" or that "must be kept hidden", but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends beyond [[Speculative reason|pure reason]] and the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.P. Blavatsky|Blavatsky, H. P.]] (1888). ''The Secret Doctrine''. Whitefish, MT: [[Kessinger Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''[[esotericism|esoteric]]'' and ''arcane'' can also be used to describe the occult,&lt;ref&gt;Houghton Mifflin Company. (2004).

[[Image:Rousseau theRepastOfTheLion.jpg|thumbnail|400px|[[Henri Rousseau]]'s ''[[The Repast of the Lion]]'' (circa 1907), is an example of naïve art.]]

'''Naïve art''' is any form of [[visual art]] that is created by a person who lacks the formal education and training that a professional artist undergoes (in anatomy, [[art history]], technique, [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], ways of seeing).&lt;ref name="Roberto"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Roberto |editor-first=K.

One particularly influential painter of "naïve art" was [[Henri Rousseau]] (1844–1910), a French [[Post-Impressionist]] who was discovered by [[Pablo Picasso]].

==Characteristics==
Naïve art&lt;ref&gt;Nathalia Brodskaïa ''L'Art naïf'' éd. Parkstone International {{ISBN|9781859956687}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often seen as [[outsider art]] that is by someone without formal (or little) training or degree.  While this was true before the twentieth century, there are now [[Art school|academies]] for naïve art. Naïve art is now a fully recognized art genre, represented in art galleries worldwide.

The characteristics of naïve art are an awkward relationship to the formal qualities of painting, especially not respecting the three rules of the perspective (such as defined by the ''Progressive Painters of the Renaissance''):
# Decrease of the size of objects proportionally with distance,
# Muting of colors with distance,
# Decrease of the precision of details with distance,
The results are:
# Effects of perspective geometrically erroneous (awkward aspect of the works, children's drawings look, or medieval painting look, but the comparison stops there)
#  Strong use of pattern, unrefined color on all the plans of the composition, without enfeeblement in the background,
# An equal accuracy brought to details, including those of the background which should be shaded off.
Simplicity rather than subtlety are all supposed markers of naïve art. It has, however, become such a popular and recognizable style that many examples could be called ''pseudo-naïve''.

Whereas naïve art ideally describes the work of an artist who did not receive  formal education in an [[art school]] or [[academy]], for example [[Henri Rousseau]] or [[Alfred Wallis]], 'pseudo naïve' or 'faux naïve' art describes the work of an artist working in a more imitative or self-conscious mode and whose work can be seen as more imitative than original.

Strict naïvety is unlikely to be found in contemporary artists, given the expansion of [[Autodidactism]] as a form of education in modern times. Naïve categorizations are not always welcome by living artists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Amy|title=Lure of the Naïve|url=http://amygellerillustration.com/assets/thesis.pdf|website=amygellerillustration.com/|accessdate=July 12, 2016|ref=page 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[translation|first1=[text] Natalia Brodskaia ;|last2=Darton]|first2=adaptation Mike|title=Naïve art|date=2000|publisher=Parkstone Press|location=New York|isbn=1859953352|page=74|url=https://www.amazon.com/Naive-Schools-Movements-Natalia-Brodskaya/dp/1859953352|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is likely to change as dignifying signals are known. Museums devoted to naïve art now exist in  [[Kecskemét]], [[Hungary]]; [[Riga, Latvia]]; [[Jaen, Spain]]; [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brasil]]; [[Musée d’art naïf de Vicq en Île-de-France|Vicq]] [[France]] and [[Paris]]. Examples of English-speaking living artists who acknowledge their naïve style are: Gary Bunt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gary Bunt, English Village Life|url=http://www.artistsandart.org/2009/10/gary-bunt-english-village-life.html|website=www.artistsandart.org|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyle Carbajal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lyle Carbajal: Painting|url=http://www.notey.com/@dailyartfixx_unofficial/external/1964452/lyle-carbajal-painting-%E2%80%94-daily-art-fixx-art-blog-modern-art-art-history-painting-illustration-photography-sculpture.html|website=www.notey.com|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Kis-Lev]], Gabe Langholtz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabe Langholtz Naive Modern|url=http://www.saatchiart.com/gabelangholtz|website=www.saatchiart.com|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gigi Mills,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gigi Mills|url=http://www.askart.com/artist/Gigi_Mills/11201189/Gigi_Mills.aspx|website=www.askart.com|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Olsen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography Barbara Olsen|url=http://www.barbaraolsen.com/bio.htm|website=www.barbaraolsen.com|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paine Proffitt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Work: Paine Proffitt|url=http://www.acframinggallery.co.uk/artist/215/paine-proffitt|website=www.acframinggallery.co.uk|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alain Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alain THOMAS, an artist in the Garden of Eden|url=http://www.alain-thomas.com/uk/biographie.php|website=www.alain-thomas.com|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Primitive art" is another term often applied to art by those without formal training, but is historically more often applied to work from certain cultures that have been judged socially or technologically "primitive" by Western academia, such as Native American, subsaharan African or Pacific Island art (see [[Tribal art]]). This is distinguished from the self-conscious, "primitive" inspired movement [[primitivism (art)|primitivism]]. Another term related to (but not completely synonymous with) naïve art is [[folk art]].

There also exist the terms "naïvism" and "[[primitivism]]" which are usually applied to professional painters working in the style of naïve art (like [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zagraevsky.com/article2_engl.htm Irina Arnoldova. Painter Sergey Zagraevsky: the view of an art critic]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movements ==
Nobody knows exactly when the first naive artists appeared on the scene, as from the very first manifestations of art right up to the days of the "Modern Classic", naive artists quite unconsciously bequeathed us unmistakable signs of their creative activity. At all events, naive art can be regarded as having occupied an "official" position in the annals of twentieth-century art since - at the very latest - the publication of the ''Der Blaue Reiter'', an almanac in 1912. Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc, who brought out the almanac, presented 6 reproductions of paintings by ''le Douanier' Rousseau (Henri Rousseau)'', comparing them with other pictorial examples. However, most experts agree that the year that naive art was "discovered" was 1885, when the painter Paul Signac became aware of the talents of Henri Rousseau and set about organizing exhibitions of his work in a number of prestigious galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wetcanvas.com/Articles/Martens/naive_intro.html|title=WetCanvas: Articles: Jan and Adrie Martens: An Introduction to Naive Art|website=www.wetcanvas.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth Group ===
The [[Earth Group]] (''Grupa Zemlja'') were Croatian artists, [[architect]]s and intellectuals active in Zagreb from 1929 to 1935. The group was [[Marxist]] in orientation and was partly modelled on "[[Neue Sachlichkeit]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3.hu/ican.artnet.org/ican/text811a.html?id_text=60|title=I_CAN - Texts - page sent at 2005/04/13 17:54|website=www.c3.hu|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to more stylized forms, and the emergence of [[Naive painting]]. The group included the painters [[Krsto Hegedušić]], [[Edo Kovačević]], [[Omer Mujadžić]], [[Kamilo Ružička]], [[Ivan Tabaković]], and [[Oton Postružnik]], the sculptors [[Antun Augustinčić]], [[Frano Kršinić]], and the architect [[Drago Ibler]]. The Earth group searched for answers to social issues.  Their program emphasised the importance of independent creative expression, and opposed the uncritical copying of foreign styles. Rather than producing art for art's sake, they felt it ought to reflect the reality of life and the needs of the modern community. Activities at the group's exhibitions were increasingly provocative to the government of the day, and in 1935 the group was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3.hu/ican.artnet.org/ican/text811a.html?id_text=60|title=I_CAN - Texts - page sent at 2005/04/13 17:54|website=www.c3.hu|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hlebine School ===
A term applied to Croatian naive painters working in or around the village of Hlebine, near the Hungarian border, from about 1930. At this time, according to the World Encyclopedia of Naive Art (1984), the village amounted to little more than ‘a few muddy winding streets and one-storey houses’, but it produced such a remarkable crop of artists that it became virtually synonymous with Yugoslav naive painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hlebine School - oi|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095939383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hlebine]] is a small picturesque municipality in the North of Croatia that in 1920s became a setting against which a group of self-taught peasants began to develop a unique and somewhat revolutionary style of painting. This was instigated by leading intellectuals of the time such as the poet [[Antun Gustav Matoš]] and the biggest name in Croatian literature, [[Miroslav Krleža]], who called for an individual national artistic style that would be independent from Western influences. These ideas were picked up by a celebrated artist from Hlebine – [[Krsto Hegedušić]] and he went on to found the Hlebine School of Art in 1930 in search of national “rural artistic expression”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moonproject.co.uk/hlebine-school-of-art-more-than-peasant-doodles/|title=Hlebine School of Art: More than peasant doodles|website=MoonProject|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Generalić]] was the first master of the Hlebine School, and the first to develop a distinctive personal style, achieving a high standard in his art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmnu.org/en/vodic.asp|title=The Croatian Museum of Naive Art - Guide to the Permanent Display|last=Otvorena.hr|first=Otvorena mreza -|website=www.hmnu.org|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, the next generation of Hlebine painters tended to focus more on stylized depictions of country life taken from imagination. Generalić continued to be the dominant figure, and encouraged younger artists, including his son Josip Generalić.

The Hlebine school became a worldwide phenomenon with the 1952 Venice Biennale and exhibitions in Brazil and Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QujBgAAQBAJ|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Croatia|date=2015-04-07|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781465441737|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best known naive artists are   [[Dragan Gaži]],  [[Ivan Generalić]],  [[Josip Generalić]],  [[Krsto Hegedušić]],  [[Mijo Kovačić]], [[Ivan Lacković-Croata]],  [[Franjo Mraz]],  [[Ivan Večenaj]] and [[Mirko Virius]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2807">'''Neo-minimalism''' is an amorphous art movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. It has alternatively been called "neo-geometric" or "neo-geo" art.  Other terms include: [[Neo-conceptual art|Neo-Conceptualism]], [[Neo-Futurism]], Neo-Op, Neo-Pop, New Abstraction, Poptometry, Post-Abstractionism, Simulationism, and Smart Art.&lt;ref&gt;John Albert Walker, ''Glossary of Art, Architecture, and Design Since 1945'', Third edition, New York, G. K. Hall, 1992; p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
The aspects of "postmodern art" that have been described as neo-minimalism (and related terms) involve a general "reevaluation of earlier art forms."&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: The Western Perspective'', Twelfth edition, Thomson / Wadsworth, 2005; Vol. 2, p. 844.&lt;/ref&gt;  As its various titles indicate, the movement draws on earlier mid-to-late-20th century developments in [[Minimalist art]], [[Abstract Expressionism]] and its [[Post-painterly Abstraction|offshoots]], plus [[Pop Art]], [[Op Art]], and other threads of artistic development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/Neo-minimalism&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artists who have been linked to the term, or who have been included in shows employing it, include [[Peter Halley]], [[Philip Taaffe]], [[Lorenzo Belenguer]], [[Ashley Bickerton]], David Burdeny, Paul Kuhn, Eve Leader, [[Peter Schuyff]], [[Christopher Willard]] and [[Tim Zuck]]. The steel sculptures of [[Richard Serra]] have been described as "austere neo-Minimalism...."&lt;ref&gt;Casey Nelson Blake, "An Atmosphere of Effrontery," in: ''The Power of Culture: Critical Essays in American History'', Richard Wightman Fox and [[T. J. Jackson Lears]], eds., Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1993; p. 259 n. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and music==
Beyond painting, sculpture and other "museum art," the term has been applied to architecture, design, and music.&lt;ref&gt;''Cadence: The American Review of Jazz and Blues'', Vol. 14 (1988), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In architecture, indeed, neo-minimalism has been identified as a part of "the new orthodoxy...."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Hodge, ed., ''Not Architecture But Evidence That It Exists'', Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press, 1999; p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

"After the bacchanal of [[Postmodernism|post-modernism]], the time has again come for neo-minimalism, neo-ascetism, neo-denial and sublime poverty."&lt;ref&gt;Juhani Pallasmaa, ''Architecture in Miniature'', Museum of Finnish Architecture, 1991; p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''People's Prize''' ({{lang-ko|인민상}}) is a [[North Korea]]n arts and sciences award. It is awarded by the People's Prize Awarding Commission, which is working directly under the [[Cabinet of North Korea]].&lt;ref name="ScalapinoLee1972"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert A. Scalapino|author2=Chong-Sik Lee|title=Communism in Korea: The society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2M_yhsWc6gC&amp;pg=PA1395|year=1972|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02274-4|page=1395}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize can be granted to works of art or people. People's Prize has been an important award in the field of [[Cinema of North Korea|North Korean cinema]].

The works and people that have received the People's Prize cover such varied fields as literature, gymnastics, [[Korean revolutionary opera]], [[acupuncture]] and sculpture. The People's Prize has been received by people abroad.

==History==
The People's Prize was instituted on 8 September 1958.&lt;ref name="Weiser2016"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Chests Full of Brass: A DPRK Political History in Orders, Medals, Prizes, and Titles | last = Weiser | first = Martin  | work = Sino-NK | date = 8 January 2016 | access-date = 16 April 2016 | url = http://sinonk.com/2016/01/08/chests-full-of-brass-a-dprk-political-history-in-orders-medals-prizes-and-titles/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first North Korean feature film ''[[My Hometown (film)|My Hometown]]'' (1949) was directed by [[Kang Hongshik]]. It was the first of a film series to be awarded People's Prize. [[Kim Il-sung]] praised many of People's Prize winning movies from 1960s and 1970s of supplying an exhaustive answer to the issue of people's ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Chajusŏng|ko|3=자주성 (주체사상)}}''.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=37–42}} The [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]] gives the award to those North Korean films and film-makers seen as fulfilling the role of an "excellent textbook" for the workers party.{{sfn|Lee|2000|pp=37–42}}

Some of the works, which did not become recognized as "Immortal classics", did earn People's Prize meant only for the best productions. One such production is a three-part film ''[[Five Guerilla Brothers]]'' (1968) directed by [[Choe Ik-gyu]], and overseen by [[Kim Jong-il]] himself. Other films overseen by Kim to win the People's Prize were ''[[A Flowering Village]]'' and ''[[A Family of Workers]]'' (1971). In the case of the ''A Family of Workers'', Kim Jong-il was reportedly not satisfied with the application of the [[On the Art of the Cinema#Seed theory|seed theory]].&lt;ref name="Schönherr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Schönherr|title=North Korean Cinema: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGBog0seMFQC&amp;pg=PA47|date=13 August 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-9052-3|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bradley K. Martin|title=Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoZx6hOCNukC&amp;pg=PA252|date=1 April 2007|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4299-0699-9|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some of Kim Jong-il's movies, such as ''[[Sea of Blood]]'' (1968) and ''[[Flower girl]]'' (1972), became "Immortal classics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-23251187 |title=Ten things: North Korea's film industry |last=Cheung |first=Helier |date=2 January 2014 |website=[[BBC]] |publisher= |access-date=28 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the [[Chongryon]] established [[Korea University (Japan)|Chosun University]]'s teaching staff in Japan received the prize.&lt;ref name="Chongryon"/&gt;

Many of the works to obtain People's Prize are still highly regarded in North Korea. ''[[Reminiscences of the Anti-Japanese Guerillas]]'' is regarded as classic of literature of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Workers' Party]], and was awarded People's Prize in 2012. It is still used in daily ideological study sessions at workplaces, and many of the memoirs have later been made into movies.&lt;ref name="KCNA_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2006/200602/news02/04.htm |title=Reminiscences of Anti-Japanese Guerrillas, True Textbook of Life |author= |date=2 February 2006 |website=[[Korean Central News Agency|KCNA]] |publisher= |access-date=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People's Prize winner [[Kim Song-gun]]'s major work ''Waves of the Sea Kumgang'' was used as a background for a group photo with Kim Jong-il and Bill Clinton during [[2009 imprisonment of American journalists by North Korea#Bill Clinton's visit to Pyongyang|Clinton's visit to North Korea in 2009]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2009/08/27/why-dictators-love-kitch/ |title=Why dictators love kitch |author= |date=27 August 2009 |website=www.nkeconwatch.com |publisher= |access-date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Song-gun received the award for his painting ''Waves of the Sea Kumgang'' in 1999.&lt;ref name="KCNA_waves"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2015/201509/news14/20150914-19ee.html |archive-date=8 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908203312/http://kcna.co.jp/item/2015/201509/news14/20150914-19ee.html |title=Kim Jong Un Sends Birthday Spreads to Intellectuals |author= |date=14 September 2015 |website=[[KCNA]] |publisher= |access-date=7 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physical art''', as contrasted with [[conceptual art]], refers to art that [[concrete]]ly exists in physical [[reality]], in [[space]] and [[time]].  Its [[ontology|ontological]] status is that it is a [[physical object]].  The art is [[concrete]]ly realized but may be [[abstract art|abstract]] in nature.  For example, a painting, sculpture, or performance exists in the physical world.  This is contrasted to [[conceptual art]], some but not all kinds of [[performance art]], [[Aesthetics|computer software]], or objects of [[mathematical beauty]], such as a [[mathematical proof]], which do not exist in the [[mental world]] or in [[physical world]], but have other ontological status, such as in [[Plato]]'s world of [[Platonic ideal|ideals]].  Here, the art, may be ''realized'' in the physical world, such as a [[mathematical proof]] written on a chalkboard, but refer to objects that [[existence|exists]] in the [[mind]] as [[concept]]s, not physical objects.  A [[music]] performance is physical, while the composition, like computer software, is not.&lt;ref name=Leo2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Betancourt|first=Michael|title=A Taxonomy of Abstract Form Using Studies of Synesthesia and Hallucinations|journal=Leonardo|date=February 2007|volume=40|issue=1|pages=59–65|doi=10.1162/leon.2007.40.1.59|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/leon.2007.40.1.59|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">The theme of '''poet as legislator''' reached its [[Grandiosity|grandiose]] peak in the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]],&lt;ref&gt;C. Prendergast ed., ''Cultural Materialism'' (1995) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; epitomised in the view of the lonely, alienated poet as 'unacknowledged legislator' to the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Holmes, ''Dr Johnson and Mr Savage'' (1994) p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

However the concept had a long prehistory in Western culture, with classical figures like [[Orpheus]] or [[Solon]] being appealed to as precedents for the poet's civilising role.&lt;ref&gt;D. Griffin, ''Patriotism and Poetry in Eighteenth-Century Britain'' (2005) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical origins==

[[Plato]]'s opposition to poets in his ideal Republic was predicated on the contemporary existence of [[Homer]]ic expounders who claimed that "a man ought to regulate the tenour of his whole life by this poet's directions".&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Davies/D. J. Vaughan trans., ''The Republic of Plato'' (1908) p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Plato only allowed the already censured poet to guide the young, to be an acknowledged legislator at the price of total external control.&lt;ref&gt;E. B. Castle, ''Ancient Education and Today'' (1969) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Less threatened by the poetic role, the Romans by contrast saw poetry, with [[Horace]], as primarily pleasing, and only secondarily as instructive.&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance and Augustan views==

Building the view of the fifteenth century Florentine [[Neoplatonism in the Renaissance|Neoplatonists]] on the poet as seer,&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; however, [[Sir Philip Sidney]] developed a more powerful concept of the poet as overtopping the philosopher, historian and lawyer to stand out as "the monarch...of all sciences.&lt;ref&gt;J. A van Dorsten ed, ''Sidney: A Defence of Poetry'' (1984) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a viewpoint was more or less institutionalised in [[Augustan literature]], Johnson's [[Rasselas]] maintaining for example that the poet "must write as the interpreter of nature and the legislator of mankind"&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Johnson, ''Rasselas'' (1905) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; – a fully public, even patriotic role moreover&lt;ref&gt;D. Griffin, ''Patriotism and Poetry in Eighteenth-Century Britain'' (2005) p. 71-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic peaks==

By contrast the Romantic view of the poet as ''unackowledged'' legislator emerges at the turm of the century in the writing of [[William Godwin]], with his anarchic view of the poet as "the legislator of generations and the moral instructor of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. A. Carlson, ''England's First Family of Writers'' (2007) p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;

It received its most memorable formulation however in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s 1820 "[[A Defence of Poetry]]".&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley maintained that, through their powers of imaginative understanding, 'Poets' (in the widest sense, of ancient Greece) were able to identify and formulate emerging socio-cultural trends; and were as a result "the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration...the unacknowledged legislators of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in M. H. Abrams, ''The Mirror and the Lamp'' (1971) p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernist irony==

The grand claims of the Romantics began to give way in the twentieth century to a more ironic stance&lt;ref&gt;S. Chatterji, ''Memories of a Lost War'' (2001) p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Yeats]] speaking for his calling in general when he wrote "We have no gift to set a statesman right".&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Yeats, ''The Poems'' (1984) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

What remained of the Shelley claim was to be further diminished by [[Postmodernism]]'s distrust for grand narratives, if not perhaps destroyed entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/node/33792 Tools of the Sacred]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale known as "'''The Poison Dress'''", or "'''Embalmed Alive'''"&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt; features a [[dress]] that has in some way been [[poison]]ed. This is a recurring theme throughout legends and folk tales of various cultures, including [[Ancient Greece]], [[Mughal India]], and the [[United States]]. Although lacking evidence suggesting that some American [[urban legend]]s are directly linked to the classical tales, they share several common [[motif (narrative)|motifs]].&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite book |title=Bodies: Sex, Violence, Disease, and Death in Contemporary Legend |first=Gillian |last=Bennett |isbn=1-57806-789-8 |year=2005 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |pages=68–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek mythology==
{{main|Medea|Shirt of Nessus}}

The poison dress motif is similar to the [[Shirt of Flame]]. In [[Greek mythology]], when [[Jason]] left the sorceress [[Medea]] to marry Glauce, King [[Creon]]'s daughter, Medea took her revenge by sending Glauce a poison dress and a golden [[coronet]], also dipped in poison. This resulted in the death of the princess and, subsequently, the king, when he tried to save her.

The Shirt of Nessus is smeared with the poisoned blood of the centaur [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]], which was given to [[Hercules]] by Hercules' wife, [[Deianira]]. Deianira had been tricked by Nessus and made to believe that the blood would ensure Hercules's [[faithfulness]]. According to [[Sophocles]]' tragedy ''[[Women of Trachis|The Women of Trachis]]'', Hercules began to perspire when he put on the shirt, which soon clung to his flesh, corroding it. He eventually threw himself onto a pyre on [[Mount Oeta]] in extreme agony and burned to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Women of Trachis | url = http://www.stoa.org/diotima/anthology/soph_trach.shtml | author = Sophocles | authorlink = Sophocles | others=Robert M.

Numerous tales of poison [[khilat]]s (robes of honour) have been recorded in historical, folkloric, and medical texts of British Indianists.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt;&lt;ref name=Khilats&gt;{{cite news | first= Adrienne | last= Mayor | authorlink= Adrienne Mayor |author2=Michelle Maskiell | year= 2001 | title= Killer Khilats, Part 2: Imperial Collecting of Poison Dress Legends in India | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2386/is_2_112/ai_79548470/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 | accessdate = 2008-10-21 | work=Folklore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifts of clothing were common in major life-cycle rituals in pre-industrial India, and these stories revolve around fears of betrayal, inspired by ancient custom of giving khilats to friends and enemies as demonstrations of a social relationship or a political alliance.&lt;ref name=Bennett/&gt; 

In 1870, [[Norman Chevers]], M.D., a Surgeon-Major to the Bengal Medical Service, authored ''Manual of Medical Jurisprudence for India'', describing unusual crimes involving poisons native to India. The book included three cases of poison khilat death, attributing the cause of one of the deaths to lethal [[vesicant]]s impregnating the fabric of the robe and entering the victim's [[sweat pore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chevers | first =  Norman | title = A Manual of Medical Jurisprudence for India | location = London | publisher = Thacker | year = 1870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American urban legends==
The theme of the poison dress appears in several American [[urban legend]]s, which were recorded in folklore collections and journal articles in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=Brunvand&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Urban Legends | first = Jan Harold | last = Brunvand | authorlink = Jan Harold Brunvand| publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | pages = 322 | isbn = 0-393-32358-7 | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Folklorist]] [[Stith Thompson]] noted the classical prototype in these stories, "[[Shirt of Nessus]]", and assigned Motif D1402.5, "Magic shirt burns wearer up". [[Jan Harold Brunvand]] provides the summary of one of the stories:
{{cquote|Girl wears new formal gown to dance. Several times during the evening she feels faint, has escort take her outside for fresh air. Finally she becomes really ill, dies in the restroom. Investigation reveals that the dress has been the cause of her death. It had been used as the funeral dress for a young girl; it had been removed from the corpse before burial and returned to the store. The [[formaldehyde]] which the dress has absorbed from the corpse enters the pores of the dancing girl.&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt;}}

Folklorist Ernest Baughman speculated that the story might have been used as adverse publicity to discredit a well-known store, since several variants of the story specifically mention the name of the store at which the dress was supposedly purchased.&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt; The legend continued to be told long after its initial popularity, with "embalming fluid" sometimes replacing the formaldehyde mentioned in the earlier version.&lt;ref name=Brunvand/&gt;  This urban legend was dramatized in the episode "[['Til Death Do We Part (CSI: NY episode)|'Til Death Do We Part]]," from the crime-scene drama, ''[[CSI: NY]]''.

Also contributing to the poison-dress theme is the prevalence of [[Smallpox blankets|smallpox-contaminated blankets]], which were given to [[Native Americans in the United States|native Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/541734 |first=Adrienne |last=Mayor |authorlink=Adrienne Mayor |year=1995 |title=The Nessus Shirt in the New World: Smallpox Blankets in History and Legend |jstor=541734 |journal=Journal of American Folklore |volume=108 |issue=427 |pages=54–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Well documented examples include the [[Siege of Fort Pitt#Biological warfare involving smallpox|tainted blankets gifted to Indians at Fort Pitt]] in 1763.&lt;ref name="Fenn"&gt;Fenn, Elizabeth A.

'''Primitivism''' is a mode of aesthetic idealization that either emulates or aspires to recreate "primitive" experience. In [[Western art]], primitivism typically has borrowed from non-Western or prehistoric people perceived to be "primitive", such as [[Paul Gauguin]]'s inclusion of [[Tahiti]]an motifs in paintings and ceramics. Borrowings from primitive art has been important to the development of [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;Artspoke, Robert Atkins, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-55859-388-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitivism has often been critiqued for reproducing the racist stereotypes about non-European peoples used by Europeans to justify colonial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;See especially Marianna Torgovnick. ''Gone primitive: Savage intellects, Modern lives'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991). See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford UP, 2018) for an account of the different understandings and critiques of primitivism.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "primitivism" is often applied to other professional painters working in the style of [[Naïve art|naïve]] or [[folk art]] like [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]] and others.

== Philosophy ==
Primitivism is a utopian idea that is distinctive for its reverse teleology. The utopian end toward which primitivists aspire usually lies in a notional "state of nature" in which their ancestors existed (chronological primitivism), or in the supposed natural condition of the peoples that live beyond "civilization" (cultural primitivism).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;A. O. Lovejoy and George Boas, ''Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

The desire of the "civilized" to be restored to a "state of nature" is as longstanding as civilization itself.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In antiquity the superiority of "primitive" life principally found expression in the so-called Myth of the [[Golden Age]], depicted in the genre of European poetry and visual art known as the [[Pastoral]]. Primitivist idealism between gained new impetus with the onset of industrialization and the European encounter with hitherto unknown peoples after the colonization of the Americas, the Pacific and other parts of what would become the modern imperial system.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the idealization of indigenous peoples were chiefly used as a rhetorical device to criticize aspects of European society.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Pagden, “The Savage Critic: Some European Images of the Primitive,” ''The Yearbook of English Studies'', 13 (1983), 32–45.&lt;/ref&gt; In the realm of aesthetics, however, the eccentric Italian philosopher, historian and jurist [[Giambattista Vico]] (1688–1744) was the first to argue that primitive peoples were closer to the sources of poetry and artistic inspiration than "civilized" or modern man. Vico was writing in the context of the celebrated contemporary debate, known as the great [[Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns]]. This included debates over the merits of the poetry of Homer and the Bible as against modern vernacular literature.

In the 18th century, the German scholar [[Friedrich August Wolf]] identified the distinctive character of oral literature and located Homer and the Bible as examples of folk or oral tradition (''Prolegomena to Homer'', 1795). Vico and Wolf's ideas were developed further in the beginning of the 19th century by [[Herder]].&lt;ref&gt;See Isaiah Berlin, ''Vico and Herder'' (New York: Viking, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, although influential in literature, such arguments were known to a relatively small number of educated people and their impact was limited or non-existent in the sphere of visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William Rubin]], "Modernist Primitivism, 1984," p. 320 in ''Primitivism: Twentieth Century Art, A Documentary History'', Jack Flam and Miriam Deutch, editors.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century saw for the first time the emergence of [[historicism]], or the ability to judge different eras by their own context and criteria. A result of this, new schools of visual art arose that aspired to hitherto unprecedented levels of historical fidelity in setting and costumes. [[Neoclassicism]] in visual art and architecture was one result. Another such "historicist" movement in art was the [[Nazarene movement]] in Germany, which took inspiration from the so-called Italian "primitive" school of devotional paintings (i.e., before the age of Raphael and the discovery of oil painting).

Where conventional academic painting (after Raphael) used dark glazes, highly selective, idealized forms, and rigorous suppression of details, the Nazarenes used clear outlines, bright colors, and paid meticulous attention to detail. This German school had its English counterpart in the [[Pre-Raphaelites]], who were primarily inspired by the critical writings of [[John Ruskin]], who admired the painters before Raphael (such as Botticelli) and who also recommended painting outdoors, hitherto unheard of.

Two developments shook the world of visual art in the mid-19th century. The first was the invention of the photographic camera, which arguably spurred the development of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] in art. The second was a discovery in the world of mathematics of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], which overthrew the 2000-year-old seeming absolutes of Euclidean geometry and threw into question conventional Renaissance perspective by suggesting the possible existence of multiple dimensional worlds and perspectives in which things might look very different.&lt;ref&gt;See Linda Dalrymple Henderson, ''The Fourth Dimension and non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art'' (Princeton University Press, 19810).&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of possible new dimensions had the opposite effect of photography and worked to counteract realism. Artists, mathematicians, and intellectuals now realized that there were other ways of seeing things beyond what they had been taught in [[École des Beaux-Arts|Beaux Arts]] Schools of [[Academic painting]], which prescribed a rigid curriculum based on the copying of idealized classical forms and held up [[Renaissance painting|Renaissance perspective painting]] as the culmination of civilization and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|title=Ecole des Beaux-Arts|first=|last=Natasha|date=|website=www.jssgallery.org|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106041532/http://www.jssgallery.org/Essay/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts/Ecole_des_Beaux-Arts.htm|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beaux Arts academies held than non-Western peoples had had no art or only inferior art.

In rebellion against this dogmatic approach, Western artists began to try to depict realities that might exist in a world beyond the limitations of the three dimensional world of conventional representation mediated by classical sculpture. They looked to [[Japanese art|Japanese]] and [[Chinese art]], which they regarded as learned and sophisticated and did not employ Renaissance one-point perspective. Non-euclidean perspective and [[tribal art]] fascinated Western artists who saw in them the still-enchanted portrayal of the spirit world. They also looked to the art of untrained painters and to children's art, which they believed depicted interior emotional realities that had been ignored in conventional, cook-book-style academic painting.

Tribal and other non-European art also appealed to those who were unhappy with the repressive aspects of European culture, as [[pastoral]] art had done for millennia.&lt;ref&gt;Connelly, F, ''The Sleep of Reason'', (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Imitations of tribal or archaic art also fall into the category of nineteenth-century "historicism", as these imitations strive to reproduce this art in an authentic manner. Actual examples of tribal, archaic, and folk art were prized by both creative artists and collectors.

The painting of [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] and the music of [[Igor Stravinsky]] are frequently cited as the most prominent examples of primitivism in art. Stravinsky's ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'', is "primitivist" in so far as its [[Program music|programmatic]] subject is a pagan rite: a human sacrifice in pre-Christian Russia. It employs harsh dissonance and loud, repetitive rhythms to depict "[[Dionysian]]" [[Musical modernism|modernism]], i.e., abandonment of inhibition (restraint standing for civilization). Nevertheless, Stravinsky was a master of learned classical tradition and worked within its bounds. In his later work he adopted a more "[[Apollonian]]" [[neoclassicism]], to use [[Nietzsche]]'s terminology, although in his use of [[serialism]] he still rejects 19th-century convention. In modern visual art, Picasso's work is also understood as rejecting Beaux Arts artistic expectations and expressing primal impulses, whether he worked in a cubist, neo-classical, or tribal-art-influenced vein.

==The origins of modernist primitivism==
[[File:Fang mask Louvre MH65-104-1.jpg|thumb|150px|African [[Beti-Pahuin|Fang]] mask similar in style to those Picasso saw in Paris just prior to painting ''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'']] 
Primitivism gained a new impetus from anxieties about technological innovation but above all from the "[[Age of Discovery]]", which introduced the West to previously unknown peoples and opened the doors to [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, S: ''In Search of the Primitive'', (New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1974), pp. 215-217.&lt;/ref&gt; As the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. With the decline of [[feudalism]], philosophers started questioning many fixed medieval assumptions about human nature, the position of humans in society, and the strictures of Christianity, and especially Catholicism. They began questioning the nature of humanity and its origins through a discussion of the natural man, which had intrigued theologians since the European encounter with the [[New World]].

From the 18th century, Western thinkers and artists continued to engage in the retrospective tradition, that is "the conscious search in history for a more deeply expressive, permanent human nature and cultural structure in contrast to the nascent modern realities".&lt;ref&gt;Diamond 1974, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Their search led them to parts of the world that they believed constituted alternatives to modern civilization.

The invention of the steamboat and other innovations in global transportation in the 19th century brought the indigenous cultures of the European colonies and their artifacts into metropolitan centres of empire. Many western-trained artists and connoisseurs were fascinated by these objects, attributing their features and styles to "primitive" forms of expression; especially the perceived absence of linear perspective, simple outlines, the presence of symbolic signs such as the [[hieroglyph]], emotive distortions of the figure, and the perceived energetic rhythms resulting from the use of repetitive ornamental pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldwater, ''Primitivism in Modern Art'', rev. ed. (New York: Vintage, 1967).&lt;/ref&gt; According to recent cultural critics, it was primarily the cultures of [[Africa]] and the [[Oceanic islands]] that provided artists an answer to what these critics call their "white, Western, and preponderantly male quest" for the "elusive ideal" of the primitive, "whose very condition of desirability resides in some form of distance and difference."&lt;ref&gt;See Solomon-Godeau 1986, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; These energizing stylistic attributes, present in the visual arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Indians of the Americas, could also be found in the archaic and peasant art of Europe and Asia, as well.

==Paul Gauguin==
[[File:Paul Gauguin- Manao tupapau (The Spirit of the Dead Keep Watch).JPG|thumb|left|[[Paul Gauguin]]. ''Spirit of the Dead Watching'', 1892. Oil on canvas. [[Albright Knox Art Gallery]].]]
Painter [[Paul Gauguin]] sought to escape European [[civilization]] and technology, taking up residence in the French colony of [[Tahiti]] and adopted a stripped-back lifestyle which he felt to be more natural than was possible in Europe.

Gauguin's search for the primitive was manifestly a desire for sexual freedom, and this is reflected in such paintings as ''[[Spirit of the Dead Watching|The Spirit of the Dead Keeps Watch]]'' (1892), ''Parau na te Varua ino'' (1892), ''Anna the Javanerin'' (1893), ''Te Tamari No Atua'' (1896), and ''Cruel Tales'' (1902), among others. Gauguin's view of Tahiti as an earthly [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]] of free love, gentle climate, and naked nymphs is quite similar, if not identical, to that of the classical [[pastoral]] of academic art, which has shaped Western perceptions of rural life for millennia. One of his Tahitian paintings is called "Tahitian Pastoral" and another "[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?|Where Do We Come From"]].&lt;ref&gt;Writing about "Where Do We Come From?" in a review entitled "Back to Paradise", New York Times Art Critic Hilton Kramer quotes art historian George T.M. Shackelford: "Although, [Gauguin] downplayed the painting's relationship to the murals of Puvis on the grounds of procedure and intention, in formal terms he cannot have hoped that his figured landscape&amp;mdash;for all its apparent rejection of classical formulas and execution&amp;mdash;could escape comparison with the timeless groves that Puvis had popularized in murals for the museums in Lyon and Rouen, as well as the great hemicycle of the Sorbonne."&lt;/ref&gt; In this way Gauguin extended the academic pastoral tradition of Beaux Arts schools which had hitherto been based solely on idealized European figures copied from Ancient Greek sculpture to include non-European models.

Gauguin also believed he was celebrating Tahitian society and defending the Tahitians against European colonialism. Feminist [[postcolonial]] critics, however, decry the fact that Gauguin took adolescent mistresses, one of them as young as thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.324.&lt;/ref&gt; They remind us that like many European men of his time and later, Gauguin saw freedom, especially sexual freedom, strictly from the male colonizer's point of view. Using Gauguin as an example of what is "wrong" with primitivism, these critics conclude that, in their view, elements of primitivism include the "dense interweave of racial and sexual fantasies and power both colonial and patriarchal".&lt;ref&gt;Solomon-Godeau 1986, p.315.&lt;/ref&gt; To these critics, primitivism such as Gauguin's demonstrates fantasies about racial and sexual difference in "an effort to essentialize notions of primitiveness" with "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]ness". Thus, they contend, primitivism becomes a process analogous to [[Exoticism]] and [[Orientalism]], as critqued by [[Edward Said]], in which European [[imperialism]] and monolithic and degrading views of the "East" by the "West" defined colonized peoples and their cultures.&lt;ref&gt;(See [[Edward Said]]'s 1978 book, ''[[Orientalism]]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fauves and Picasso==
[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]''. The two figures on the right are the beginnings of [[Picasso|Picasso's]] African-inspired period.]]
{{see also|Picasso's African Period}}
In 1905-06, a small group of artists began to study art from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Oceania]], in part because of the compelling works of [[Paul Gauguin]] that were gaining visibility in Paris. Gauguin's powerful posthumous retrospective exhibitions at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris in 1903 and an even larger one in 1906 exerted a strong influence.  Artists including [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[André Derain]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pablo Picasso]] grew increasingly intrigued and inspired by the select objects they encountered. 

[[Pablo Picasso]], in particular, explored  [[Iberian sculpture]], [[African sculpture]], [[African traditional masks]], and other historical works including the [[Mannerism|Mannerist paintings]] of [[El Greco]], resulting in his masterpiece ''[[Les Demoiselles D'Avignon]]'' and, eventually, the invention of [[Cubism]].&lt;ref name="Cooper, 24"&gt;Cooper, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The generalizing term "primitivism" tends to obscure the distinct contributions to modern art from these various visual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Joshua I. “Fauve Masks: Rethinking Modern 'Primitivist' Uses of African and Oceanic Art, 1905-8.” The Art Bulletin 99, no. 2 (June 2017): 136-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticolonial primitivism==
Although primitivism in art is usually regarded as a Western phenomenon, the structure of primitivist idealism can be found in the work of non-Western and especially anticolonial artists. The desire to recover a notional and idealized past in which humans had been at one with nature is here connected to a critique of the impact of Western modernity on colonized societies. These artists often critique Western stereotypes about "primitive" colonized peoples at the same time as they yearn to recover pre-colonial modes of experience. Anticolonialism fuses with primitivism's reverse teleology to produce art that is distinct from the primitivism of Western artists which usually reinforces rather than critiques colonial stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;See Ben Etherington, ''Literary Primitivism'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of artists connected with the [[Négritude]] movement in particular demonstrates this tendency. ''Négritude'' was a movement of neo-African idealism and political agitation that was begun by francophone intellectuals and artists on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1930s, and which spread across Africa and the African diaspora in subsequent years. They self-consciously idealized pre-colonial Africa, something that took many forms. This typically consisted in rejecting overweening European rationalism and the associated ravages of colonialism while positing pre-colonial African societies as having had a more communal and organic basis. The work of the Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]] is particularly notable among the visual artists of negritude. Lam met Pablo Picasso and the European surrealists while living in Paris in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Lowery Stokes Sims. Wifredo Lam and the international avant-garde, 1923-1982. University of Texas Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Cuba in 1941, Lam was emboldened to create images in which humans, animals, and nature combined in lush and dynamic tableaux. In his iconic work of 1943, ''The Jungle'', Lam's characteristic polymorphism recreates a fantastical jungle scene with African motifs between stalks of cane. It vividly captures the way in which negritude's neo-African idealism is connected to a history of plantation slavery centred on the production of sugar.

In [[film industry|film]] and [[television]], a '''production designer''' ('''PD''') is the person responsible for the overall visual look of the production. Production designers have a key creative role in the creation of motion pictures and television. Working directly with the [[film director|director]], [[cinematographer]], and [[film producer|producer]], they must select the settings and style to visually tell the story. The term ''production designer'' was coined by [[William Cameron Menzies]] while he was working on the film ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Cairns |first=David |year=2011 |title=The Dreams of a Creative Begetter |url=https://believermag.com/the-dreams-of-a-creative-begetter/ |magazine=The Believer |issue=79 |access-date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously (and often subsequently) the people with the same responsibilities were called ''[[art director]]s''.{{sfn|Preston|1994|p=150}} It is sometimes also described as ''[[scenic design]]'' or ''set design''.

== Societies and trade organizations ==
In the United States and British Columbia,{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} production designers are represented by the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] local 800,{{sfn|Rizzo|2015|p=396}} the Art Directors Guild. The production design credit must be requested by the producer, prior to completion of photography, and submitted to the Art Directors Guild Board of Directors for the credit approval. 
In the rest of Canada, production designers are represented by the [[Director's Guild of Canada]].

[[File:CBGB toilet.jpg|alt=|thumb|Punk-related graffiti covered the bathroom in [[CBGB]].]]
'''Punk visual art''' is artwork associated with the [[punk subculture]]. It often graces [[punk rock]] [[album cover]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]] for punk concerts, [[punk zine]]s and punk websites. It is also sometimes showcased in art galleries and exhibition spaces.

The main aesthetic of punk visual art seems to be to either shock, create a sense of empathy or revulsion, make a grand point with an acidic or sarcastic wit. One characteristic associated with punk art is the usage of letters cut out from newspapers and magazines, a device previously associated with kidnap and ransom notes. A prominent example of that style is the cover of the [[Sex Pistols]]' ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks]]'' album designed by [[Jamie Reid]]. Images and figures are also sometimes cut and pasted from magazines and newspapers to create a collage.

Los Angeles artist [[Mark Vallen]] has said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Punk had a unique and complex aesthetic. It was steeped in shock value and revered what was considered ugly. The whole look of punk was designed to disturb and disrupt the happy complacency of the wider society. Outside of punk's torn and safety pinned anti-fashion statements, this impulse to outrage was never more apparent than on punk album covers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-for-a-change.com/Punk/punka.htm "A visual survey of early Punk Rock Album Covers," Essay by artist, Mark Vallen]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In New York City in the mid-1970s, there was much overlap between the punk music and art scenes. In 1978, many of the visual artists who were regulars at [[CBGB]] and other punk-related music venues participated in a large punk art exhibition in Washington, DC.  Among those featured were [[John Holmstrom]] and [[Legs McNeil]] of the fanzine ''[[Punk (magazine)|Punk]]'',; [[Alan Vega]] (a.k.a. Alan Suicide), whose electronic junk sculpture predated his role in the band [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]];  photographers [[Marcia Resnick]] and [[Jimmy De Sana]]; tattoo artist Ruth Marten; filmmaker Amos Poe; and artists [[Tom Otterness]] and [[Beth and Scott B]], who were associated with ''X Magazine''.

Also in 1978 in New York City, a related, one-night punk art show featuring films, performances and slide shows included works by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] and [[Diego Cortez]].  Other early punk art exhibits included the "Times Square Show" (1980) and "New York New Wave" at PS 1 (1981).  Punk art found an ongoing home on the New York's lower east side with the establishment of [[ABC No Rio]] Gallery in 1980. The punk aesthetic was a dominant strand from 1982 to 1986 in the art galleries of the city's East Village.

'''Purism''', referring to the arts, was a movement that took place between 1918 and 1925 that influenced French painting and architecture. Purism was led by [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and [[Le Corbusier|Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier)]]. Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created a variation of the [[Cubism|Cubist]] movement and called it Purism: where objects are represented as elementary forms devoid of detail. The main concepts were presented in their book ''Après le Cubisme'' (After Cubism) published in 1918.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Susan|title=Ozenfant and Purism: The Evolution of a Style 1915–1930|year=1981|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/p/purism Purism, Tate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post World War I==
[[File:Le Corbusier, 1921, Nature morte, oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, Musée National d'Art Moderne.jpg|thumb|right|Le Corbusier, 1921, ''Nature morte'' (''Still Life''), oil on canvas, 54 x 81 cm, [[Musée National d'Art Moderne]]]]
Le Corbusier and Ozenfant were the creators of Purism. [[Fernand Léger]] was a principle associate.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt; Purism was an attempt to restore regularity in a war-torn France post World War I.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt; Unlike what they saw as 'decorative' fragmentation of objects in Cubism, Purism proposed a style of painting where elements were represented as robust simplified forms with minimal detail, while embracing technology and the machine.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

Purism culminated in Le Corbusier’s ''Pavillon de l'Esprit Nouveau'' (Pavilion of the New Spirit), constructed for the [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in 1925. This included the work of Cubists [[Juan Gris]] and [[Jacques Lipchitz]]. Following this exhibition the relationship between Le Corbusier and Ozenfant declined.&lt;ref name="Tate" /&gt;

==L'Esprit Nouveau==

Ozenfant and Le Corbusier contributed extensively to an art magazine called ''L'Esprit Nouveau'' from 1920 to 1925 serving as a platform for propaganda towards their Purist movement.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliel, Carol S. et al. (2001). ''L'Esprit Nouveau: Purism in Paris, 1918-1925''. New York: Harry Abrams, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8109-6727-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purist Manifesto==
The Purist Manifesto lays out the rules Ozenfant and Le Corbusier created to govern the Purist movement.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;

* Purism does not intend to be a scientific art, which it is in no sense.
* Cubism has become a decorative art of romantic ornamentism.
* There is a hierarchy in the arts: decorative art is at the base, the human figure at the summit.
* Painting is as good as the intrinsic qualities of its plastic elements, not their representative or narrative possibilities.
* Purism wants to conceive clearly, execute loyally, exactly without deceits; it abandons troubled conceptions, summary or bristling executions. A serious art must banish all techniques not faithful to the real value of the conception.
* Art consists in the conception before anything else.
* Technique is only a tool, humbly at the service of the conception.
* Purism fears the bizarre and the ''original''. It seeks the pure element in order to reconstruct organized paintings that seem to be facts from nature herself. 
* The method must be sure enough not to hinder the conception.
* Purism does not believe that returning to nature signifies the copying of nature.
* It admits all deformation is justified by the search for the invariant.
* All liberties are accepted in art except those that are unclear.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"/&gt;

{{About-distinguish|Social Practice as a minor psychological theory|Practice Theory}}

{{For|the art medium of Social Practice|Social practice (art)}}

'''Social practice''' is a theory within psychology that seeks to determine the link between practice and context within social situations. Emphasized as a commitment to change, social practice occurs in two forms: activity and inquiry. Most often applied within the context of human development, social practice involves knowledge production and the theorization and analysis of both institutional and intervention practices.&lt;ref&gt;Smolka, A. L. B. (2001). Social practice and social change: activity theory in perspective. Human Development, 44(6), 362-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background in psychology==
Through research, [[Sylvia Scribner]] sought to understand and create a decent life for all people regardless of geographical position, race, gender, and social class.&lt;ref&gt;Hedegaard, M. (1998). A cultural-historical approach to mind. Human Development, 41(3), 205-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Using anthropological field research and psychological experimentation, Scribner tried to dig deeper into human mental functioning and its creation through social practice in different societal and cultural settings. She therefore aimed to enact social reform and community development through an ethical orientation that accounts for the interaction of historical and societal conditions of different institutional settings with human social and mental functioning and development.

==Social practice as activity==
Social practice involves engagement with communities of interest by creating a practitioner-community relationship wherein there remains a focus on the skills, knowledge, and understanding of people in their private, family, community, and working lives.&lt;ref&gt;“What is social practice?” (n.d.). Retrieved April 25, 2013, from http://spiritstorelimerick.weebly.com/what-is-social-practice.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach to social practice, activity is used for social change without the agenda of research. Activity theory suggests the use of a system of participants that work toward an object or goal that brings about some form of change or transformation in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hung, D., Tan, S. C., &amp; Koh, T. S. (2006). From traditional to constructivist epistemologies: a proposed theoretical framework based on activity theory for learning communities. Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 17(1), 37-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social practice as inquiry==
Within research, social practice aims to integrate the individual with his or her surrounding environment while assessing how context and culture relate to common actions and practices of the individual. Just as social practice is an activity itself, inquiry focuses on how social activity occurs and identifies its main causes and outcomes. It has been argued that research be developed as a specific theory of social practice through which research purposes are defined not by philosophical paradigms but by researchers' commitments to specific forms of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Herndl, C. G., &amp; Nahrwold, C. A. (2000). Research as social practice: a case study of research on technical and professional communication. Written Communication, 17(2), 158-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of interest==
===Education===
In education, social practice refers to the use of adult-child interaction for observation in order to propose intentions and gauge the reactions of others.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, D. W. (2010). Directions for studying early literacy as social practice. Language Arts, 88(2), 134-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Under social practice, [[literacy]] is seen as a key dimension of community regeneration and a part of the wider lifelong learning agenda.  In particular, literacy is considered to be an area of instruction for the introduction of social practice through social language and social identity. According to social practice in education, literacy and [[numeracy]] are complex  capabilities rather than a simple set of basic skills. Furthermore, adult learners are more likely to develop and retain knowledge, skills, and understanding if they see them as relevant to their own problems and challenges. Social practice perspectives focus on local literacies and how literacy practices are affected by settings and groups interacting around print.

===Literature===
As literature is repeatedly studied in education and critiqued in discourse, many believe that it should be a field of social practice as it evokes emotion and discussion of social interactions and social conditions. Those that believe literature may be construed as a form of social practice believe that literature and society are essentially related to each other. As such, they attempt to define specific sociological practices of literature and share expressions of literature as works comprising text, institution, and individual. Overall, literature becomes a realm of social exchange through fiction, poetry, politics, and history.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, P., Ferguson, P. P., &amp; Griswold, W. (Eds.). (1989). Literature and social practice, 1st Ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and social practice===

'''Social practice''' is an art medium focusing on engagement through human interaction and social discourse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education for Socially Engaged Art|last=Helguera|first=Pablo|publisher=Jorge Pinto Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since people and their relationships form the medium of such works – rather than a particular process of production – social engagement is not only a part of a work’s organization, execution, or continuation, but also an aesthetic in itself: of interaction and development.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=What we Made: conversations on art and social cooperation|last=Finkelpearl|first=Tom|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socially engaged art aims to create social and/or political change through collaboration with individuals, communities, and institutions in the creation of participatory art.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.artjob.org/content/collaboration-where-art-social-practice-begins&lt;/ref&gt;  The discipline values the process of a work over any finished product or object.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Artists working in social practice co-create their work with a specific audience or propose critical interventions within existing social systems to inspire debate or catalyze social exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cca.edu/academics/graduate/fine-arts/socialpractices|title=Social Practice Workshop|publisher=California College of the Arts|accessdate= Sep 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large overlap between social practice and pedagogy demonstrates the need for art education to embrace collaborative practice.&lt;ref&gt;Sholette, G.

Consequently, images frequently fail to do justice to the engagement and interactions that take place during a project.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artificial Hells: Participatory Art and the politics of Spectatorship|last=Bishop|first=Claire|publisher=Verso Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of terminology==

Until 2005, the term "social practice" was used in a branch of social theory considering human relationships to each other and to the larger society as "practices". The term "art and social practice" was institutionalized in 2005 with the creation of the Social Practice [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] concentration at the [[California College of the Arts]],&lt;ref name="Artnews"&gt;http://www.artnews.com/2013/10/31/how-to-speak-artspeak-properly/&lt;/ref&gt; followed by other institutions of higher education offering similar degrees. Social practice art as a medium has been referenced in the ''New York Times'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/arts/design/outside-the-citadel-social-practice-art-is-intended-to-nurture.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/education/edlife/social-practice-degrees-take-art-to-a-communal-level.html|title=Social Practice Degrees Take Art to a Communal Level|last=Grant|first=Daniel|date=2016-02-05|access-date=2016-02-08|issn=0362-4331|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Artforum'',&lt;ref&gt;http://artforum.com/inprint/issue=201207&amp;id=31944&amp;pagenum=1&lt;/ref&gt; ''ArtNews,''&lt;ref name="Artnews" /&gt; and ''Art Practical.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artpractical.com/feature/notes_toward_a_non_anthropocentric_social_practice/&lt;/ref&gt;  As an emerging field, social practice can encompass a variety of terms: public practice,&lt;ref name="OtisGPP"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.otis.edu/graduate-public-practice|title=Graduate Public Practice|website=Otis College of Art and Design|access-date=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; socially engaged art,&lt;ref&gt;http://pablohelguera.net/2011/11/education-for-socially-engaged-art-2011/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Community arts|community art]], new-genre public art,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Mapping-Terrain-New-Genre-Public/dp/0941920305&lt;/ref&gt; [[participatory art]], [[Art intervention|interventionist art]], [[Collaboration#occupational examples|collaborative art]],&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Claire. “The Social Turn: Collaboration and Its Discontents” ''Artforum,'' February 2006, 178-83.&lt;/ref&gt; [[relational art]] and dialogical aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Artnews" /&gt;

== Characteristics of social practice ==
Socially engaged art differs from its art historical ancestors in that it is not a specific movement or style, but rather a way of defining a new social order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Living as Form, Socially Engaged Art from 1991-2011|last=Thompson|first=Nato|publisher=MIT Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thousands of existing social practice projects across the world have taken vastly different approaches to their combination of publics, methodologies, aesthetics, and environments, yet these projects all share an aesthetic of human interaction and development. The end products of such works are not commodities, but rather processes for constructive social change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Some foundational characteristics of socially engaged art remain consistently relevant to a diverse range of works. For an artist or producer to create a successful social practice work, they must consider the unique context in which they are working, and identify specific characteristics of the community and environment. They must also balance aesthetic and methodology in their work, align the timeline of a project with its purpose: a quick-impact ephemeral work, or the regularity of a longitudinal work. 

=== Community and environment ===
Social practice artists and producers aim to affect their community and environment in a real (rather than symbolic) way that enables social and political change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Each project is tailored to the community and environment in which it will take place.  In social practice the identification of the public, or audience, precedes the project's development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It is impossible to create a project founded upon engagement and collaboration without first making assumptions as to who will be involved.  ''Who'' the artist or producer wishes to engage and ''where'' they wish to engage are therefore core characteristics of socially engaged art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

Environment could be described on two primary levels: the broader community, city, or region; and the immediate space being occupied – a street, museum, studio, or other area. To understand the context in which they are working, artists and producers must develop relationships with individuals, organizations and institutions that intersect many different parts of their community and environment.  One theorist makes the comparison between socially engaged art projects to exotic fruit, stating that both “usually travel poorly when “exported” to other locations to be replicated.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The community and environment are therefore not merely external influencers on a specific project – they are inherent characteristics.

=== Aesthetics and methodology ===
For much of art history, a work's aesthetic has been upheld as the primary measure of its quality. The 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century broadened the public understanding of art to consider concept and process alongside aesthetic, and by the new millennium the tables had turned to emphasize process over product: one of the defining characteristics of socially engaged art. Process is determined by method; thus social practice producers and artists are often more concerned with the methodology rather than the aesthetic of their work. Many argue that social practice has created a new aesthetic of its own: an aesthetic of human interaction and development that is based not on spectatorship but on participation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  This aesthetic captures the diverse methods employed by socially engaged art and encompasses not only traditional methods of painting, photography, architecture, and performance; but also nontraditional forms borrowed from other disciplines, such as festivals, conferences, schools, and protests.  

Aesthetics are typically hierarchical, highly subjective, and greatly determined by external influencers, such as the imagery of a given culture, or the relationship between appearance and market value.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  To escape these external influencers, aesthetics can also be defined in terms of “aesthesis,” an autonomous realm of experience and judgment that cannot be reduced to logic, reason or morality but is of great importance to humankind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Aesthetics  have the capacity to critique our beliefs and values by restructuring our perception of the world.  Their application can achieve one of the core aims of socially engaged art: the definition of a new social order characterized by engagement and participation.

Methodology in socially engaged art refers to the set of practices used throughout the process and production of a project. The method is no longer a means to an end, but an end within itself: the experience of creation and experimentation is a central element of social practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education for Socially Engaged Art|last=Helguera|first=Pablo|publisher=Verso Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While aesthetics reframe ideas and beliefs outside of the disciplines in which we have accepted them, methodology takes the frameworks of those disciplines to produce new aesthetics. Socially engaged art has embraced conferences, urban regeneration projects, pedagogical projects, and protests, which are all frameworks borrowed from other disciplines.

While aesthetics and methodology can have conflicting interests, there are important reasons why artists and producers should seek to integrate the two. Methodology will engage the public, but aesthetics will play a large role in determining how a project is interpreted.
While aesthetics and methodology can have conflicting interests, there are important reasons why artists and producers should seek to integrate the two. Ultimately, the two can work together to enhance each other: the aesthetic value of a project can increase its social function, while the method can heighten the aesthetic experience through public engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What We Made: Conversations on art and social cooperations|last=Finkelpearl|first=Tom|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Longevity vs. ephemerality ===
The method and aesthetic adopted in social practice work is greatly influenced by intended timeline.  Length determines the type of social and/or political change the artist aims to achieve, the types of dialogue created, and the ways in which an individual can engage with a work. The length of a project is also extremely situational. Some projects aim to have an immediate impact, while others prefer to build relationships that foster change over an extended period.

Ephemeral projects are typically characterized by temporary gatherings and occupation of space. They create situations in which social interactions are momentary and not expected to become long-lasting. The immediate impact of ephemeral works often means they take place around a particular issue or concept. Protests, festivals, conferences, or pop-up performances have all been used as mediums for ephemeral social practice work.

Longitudinal projects are those built upon regular and reoccurring social interactions and dialogue, organized with the intention to be sustained over a longer period. They typically occupy the same space, and are characterized by deeper partnerships and relationships that are gradually built over the course of the work’s existence. As a result, many long-term social practice projects include a pedagogical element in their work. Classes, urban regeneration work, schools, or institutional partnerships are all examples of longitudinal projects.

== Social practice and institutions ==
Much social practice has taken place in the gap between the public and cultural institutions, which has been identified and acted upon as a new site for artistic intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Living as Form, Socially Engaged Art from 1991-2011|last=Cruz|first=Teddy|publisher=Creative Time Books|year=2012|isbn=|editor-last=Thompson|editor-first=Nato|location=New York|pages=58|chapter=Democratizing Urbanization and the Search for a New Civic Imagination.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However institutions, such as museums, foundations, non-profit organizations, and universities all play a significant role in supporting and amplifying social practice work.  Many institutions constitute an extension of the public sphere, regardless of whether they are public or private in their ownership and operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=[[Maves]] Mark|first=[[Hodal]] [[Stephanie]]|date=1999|title=Museums and Livable Communities|url=|journal=The Journal of Museum Education|volume=24|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Partnerships between socially engaged art and contemporary institutions have thus widened the public sphere, and provided mutual benefits to the institution, the community, those engaged in the project, and the producers.

=== Social practice and the art market ===
In the traditional art world, market value and a work's collectability are deeply intertwined. This has posed a challenge to socially engaged artists seeking museum and gallery support, since many works go against the capitalist market to challenge traditional collecting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education for Socially Engaged Art|last=Helguera|first=Pablo|publisher=Jorge Pinto Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many socially engaged artists and producers must look elsewhere for support. The expansion of the art world in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century has seen the emergence of alternative supports, such as non-profit organizations and the ever-growing biennale network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The One and the Many: Contemporary Collaborative Art in a Global Context|last=Kester|first=Grant|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other partners include art fairs, or commissions and residencies associated with universities, foundations, and urban regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What we Made: Conversations on art and social cooperation|last=Finkelpearl|first=Tom|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Durham|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists and producers have also formed their own means of support, as artist-run exhibition spaces, journals and blogs demonstrate.

=== Social practice in the university ===
Universities often partner with producers, artists and theorists of socially engaged art. These relationships offer mutual benefits for both academic institutions and artists. Universities offer artists employment security, the support and validation often required for establishing grant-based and corporate partnerships, and access to a high interdisciplinary environment that not only accepts, but encourages, experimentation. Artists in turn provide knowledge, skills and research to support individuals and broader programs within the university. As producers and scholars, they generate both new theory and new practice for the field of socially engaged art.

==Exhibitions and conferences==

Exhibitions of social practice art often include multiple artists or [[art collective]]s, and rather than exhibiting art objects, the artist’s participatory role in their work as well as their collaboration with the public becomes the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/arts/design/outside-the-citadel-social-practice-art-is-intended-to-nurture.html&lt;/ref&gt; Several conferences are held nationally and internationally to bring together artists and academics involved in the field. They have featured [[installation art|installation]], [[performance art]], [[film]], [[dance]], art talks, forums, and gallery exhibitions.

'''The Young Friends Society of African Diasporan Institutions''' (YFS) exists to support, serve and promote [[African diaspora|African Diasporan]] cultural, historical, economic, educational, and community-based institutions through fundraising, event planning, educational and social programming. YFS also serves as a vehicle to promote networking opportunities and leadership development among its members to further strengthen the communities where these institutions are located. YFS is composed of individuals in their twenties, thirties and forties.&lt;ref name="The Young Friends Society of African Diasporan Institutions"&gt;[http://www.youngfriendssociety.org Official website of The Young Friends Society of African Diasporan Institutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

==African diasporan institutions==
African Diasporan Institutions are cultural, historic, educational, and economic institutions and organizations that are located in cities around the world that have large populations of people African descent. These institutions include but are not limited to museums, historical societies, theatre companies, dance companies, libraries and archives and performing arts groups.

==YFS history==
YFS began as an auxiliary group at the [[African American Museum in Philadelphia|African American Museum of Philadelphia]] (AAMP). While working as the educational coordinator at AAMP, [[Shantrelle P. Lewis]] witnessed a lack of young adult visitors. Following in the tradition of other arts and cultural organizations, Lewis developed a plan to attract a younger demographic that could inject a new energy into the museum.  YFS held its inaugural event, Soul Simpatico, in October 2005, and within a year it had brought in 100 new members to AAMP.

As the organization grew, it became apparent that similar institutions in Philadelphia needed innovative ways to engage young adults looking for alternatives to the conventional nightlife scene of clubs and bars. In January 2007, YFS incorporated as a Pennsylvania non-profit organization and secured 501(c)3 status by June of the same year. Over the next two years, YFS partnered with various cultural organizations in Philadelphia, grew its membership base and held several successful events. YFS also started chapters in New Orleans and New York City, with plans to expand domestically and internationally.

==Vision of YFS==

1) Institution Building: YFS will help to ensure the survival and growth of important institutions. Through the development of a young core of members, supporters and sponsors, YFS will assist in sustaining African Diasporan Institutions for future generations. Each YFS chapter will invite up to 7 institutions in its geographic area to become a partner institution. These institutions will receive direct support and benefits as a partner institution of the Young Friends Society.

2) Cross-cultural association: Over the next decade, YFS will establish chapters in major cities around the [[African Diaspora]]. This will serve as a link between the various people and cultures that exist within the African World. It serves to educate people about the similarities and variations of people of African descent. Chapters will be established in the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Caribbean]], [[South America]], [[Europe]] and the Continent of [[Africa]].

3) Individual Support: YFS serves as a major catalyst for leadership development and interaction amongst like-minded individuals who are passionate about achieving their own unique potential and developing a global society. Unlike other networking forums that tend to serve individuals from a narrow demographic, YFS will bridge positive young people from diverse socio-economic, political, cultural, intellectual and religious backgrounds to support culture. In the process, it will also provide support for its members and their respective endeavors.

'''Verisimilitude''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|ɛr|ɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɪ|l|ɪ|tj|uː|d}} is the "lifelikeness" or believability of a [[fiction|work of fiction]]. The word comes from {{lang-la|verum}} meaning truth and ''similis'' meaning similar.&lt;ref&gt; Oxford English Dictionary Online, Second Edition 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Language philosopher [[Stephen Neale|Steve Neale]] distinguishes between two types: '''cultural verisimilitude''', meaning plausibility of the fictional work within the cultural and/or historical context of the real world, outside of the work; and '''generic verisimilitude''', meaning plausibility of a fictional work within the bounds of its own [[list of fictional genres|genre]] (so that, for example, characters regularly singing about their feelings is a believable action within the [[fictional universe]] of a [[musical theatre|musical]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hall |first=Stuart |title=Representation: Cultural Representations and Signifying Practices |location=London |publisher=Sage in association with the Open University |year=1997 |page=360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dAqycFD4PBsC |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original roots==

Verisimilitude has its roots in both the Platonic and Aristotelian dramatic theory of [[mimesis]], the imitation or representation of nature. For a piece of art to hold significance or persuasion for an audience, according to [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], it must have grounding in reality.

This idea laid the foundation for the evolution of mimesis into verisimilitude in the [[Middle Ages]] particularly in Italian [[heroic poetry]]. During this time more attention was invested in pinning down fiction with theory. This shift manifested itself in increased focus on unity in heroic poetry. No matter how fictionalized the language of a poem might be, through verisimilitude, poets had the ability to present their works in a way that could still be believed in the real world. Verisimilitude at this time also became connected to another Aristotelian dramatic principle, [[decorum]]: the realistic union of style and subject. Poetic language of characters in a work of fiction as a result had to be appropriate in terms of the age, gender or race of the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gordon |last=Teskey |chapter=Renaissance Theory and Criticism |title=The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism |edition=Second |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This classical notion of verisimilitude focused on the role of the reader in his/her engagement in the fictional work of art. The goal of the novel therefore, as it became a more popular form of verisimilitude, was to instruct and offer a pleasurable experience to the reader. The novel had to facilitate the reader's willingness [[Suspension of disbelief|to suspend his/her disbelief]], a phrase used originally by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert P. |last=Ashley |title=What Makes a Good Novel |journal=The English Journal |volume=60 |issue=5 |year=1971 |pages=596–598 |jstor=813069 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Verisimilitude became the means to accomplish this mindset. To promote the willing suspension of disbelief, a fictional text needed to have credibility. Anything physically possible in the worldview of the reader or humanity's experience was defined as credible. Through verisimilitude then, the reader was able to glean truth even in fiction because it would reflect realistic aspects of human life.

==Continued evolution==

The idea that credibility, and in turn verisimilitude, rested on the reader's sense of the world encountered opposition because of the dilemma it created: every reader and every person does not have the same knowledge of the world. This kind of theory suggests that the novel consisted of distinct parts. The way novelists avoided this dilemma initially was by adding a preface to the work of fiction stating its credibility or by including more references to known history within the text of the fiction. 

As more criticism on the novel surfaced, the inclusion of a preface or a scattering of some historical references was not enough to engage the reader. French theorist [[Pierre Nicolas Desmolets]]' notion that the author should obscure the fiction or art of the novel to avoid destroying illusion: the made up attributes of the text. The novel before was perceived as a work of distinct parts. Now the novel was not thought of in terms of separate parts, but rather as a work as a whole. The novel was a total illusion of life within itself. It was a closed fictional world that could establish its own rules and laws. Verisimilitude then became deeply rooted in structure. The focus of credibility did not rest solely on the external world of the reader; the novel's credibility then could be seen in terms of the novel's own [[internal logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=F. E. |last=Sparshott |title=Truth in Fiction |journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=1967 |pages=3–7 |jstor=429239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The focus of verisimilitude was no longer concerned with the reader. The focus shifted to the novel itself. Verisimilitude was a technical problem to resolve within the context of the novel's fictional world. Detail centered on the creation of a logical cause web in the text that then could reinforce the overarching structural logic of the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ewlyn F. |last=Sterling |title=The Theory of Verisimilitude in the French Novel prior to 1830 |journal=The French Review |volume=40 |issue=5 |year=1967 |pages=613–619 |jstor=384665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodern perspective==

During the rise of the [[Postmodern literature|postmodern]] novel, some critics suggested that truth or significance lies beyond verisimilitude and that only by complete non-discursive freedom to encounter a novel could meaning truly be discovered. Verisimilitude, they argued, was not the first aspect of the text a reader experiences. The reader instead first tries to observe if the novel works as an intelligible narrative. The lens of verisimilitude is applied only after the reader establishes if the novel makes sense or not.

The reader can understand the novel as art but not necessarily as a cultural construction. The novel should challenge the construction of reality. In this sense, it was possible for art to precede reality. Reality had to catch up to the text rather than text staying present to reality. A boundary existed establishing that text does not belong to a current time or situation. In the postmodern context, verisimilitude was less of a concern for the novelist according to some critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mas'Ud |last=Zavarzadeh |title=The Semiotics of the Foreseen: Modes of Narrative in (Contemporary) Fiction |journal=Poetics Today |volume=6 |issue=4 |year=1985 |pages=432–433 |jstor=1771956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Head old Roman Glyptothek Munich 320.jpg|thumb|Portrait Bust of a Man, Ancient Rome, 60 BC]]'''Verism''' is the artistic preference of contemporary everyday subject matter instead of the heroic or legendary in art and literature; it is a form of realism. The word comes from [[Latin]] ''verus'' (true).

==Roman art==
Verism first appeared as the artistic preference of the Roman people during the late [[Roman Republic]] (147–30 BC) and was often used for Republican portraits or for the head of “[[pseudo-athlete]]” sculptures. Verism, often described as "warts and all," shows the imperfections of the subject, such as warts, wrinkles, and furrows. It should be clearly noted that the term veristic in no way implies that these portraits are more "real." Rather, they too can be highly exaggerated or idealised, but within a different visual idiom, one which favours wrinkles, furrows, and signs of age as indicators of gravity and authority. Age during the Late Republic was very highly valued and was synonymous with power, since one of the only ways to hold power in Roman society was to be part of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. Yet to be in the Senate, a Roman [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] had to be at least forty-two years of age, which in ancient times was considered a mature stage of life.&lt;ref name=smith1981&gt;''Greek, Foreigners, And Roman Republic Portraits'', Cambridge Journals: The Journal of Roman Studies, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}}[[File:General de Tivoli (Massimo) 01.JPG|thumbnail|left|General de Tivoli, pseudo-athlete with veristic head, ca. 90-70 BC, Tivoli]]It is debated among scholars and art historians whether these veristic portraits were truly blunt records of actual features or exaggerated features designed to make a statement about a person’s personality.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010"&gt;''A History of Roman Art'', Enhanced Edition, Wadsworth CENGAGE Learning, Boston, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}}  It is widely held in academia that in the ancient world [[physiognomy]] revealed the character of a person; thus, the personality characteristics seen in veristic busts could be taken to express certain virtues very much admired during the Republic.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010" /&gt;{{rp|54}} However,scholars can never know for certain the accuracy of portrait renditions made long before their own era.

==Verism throughout the Roman Empire==
As stated in the section above, verism first appeared during the Late Republic. The subjects of veristic portraiture were almost exclusively men, and these men were usually of advanced age, for generally it was elders who held power in the Republic.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|53}} However, women are also seen in veristic portraiture, though to a lesser extent, and they too were almost always depicted as elderly.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|53}} A key example of this is a marble head found at Palombara, Spain. Carved between 40 BCE and 30 BCE, during the decade of the [[Liberators' civil war|civil war]] that followed Julius Caesar’s assassination, the woman’s face shows her advanced age.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|54}} The artist carved the woman with sunken cheeks and pouches under her eyes to illustrate her age, much like male veristic portraiture of the time.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|54}}

Verism, while the height of fashion during the Late Republican era, quickly fell into obscurity when [[Augustus]] and the rest of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] (44 BC-68 AD) came to power. During this imperial reign, Greek [[Classical sculpture]] that featured "eternal youth" was favored over verism. It wasn’t until after the suicide of [[Nero]] in 68 AD that verism was revived.[[File:Vespasianus01 pushkin.jpg|thumbnail|right|Bust of Vespasian, ca. 75-79]]During the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (68-69 AD) that resulted from Nero’s suicide, when [[Galba]], [[Vitellius]], and [[Otho]] all grappled for the throne, verism made a resurgence, as seen in obverse portraits of Galba on bronze coins or marble busts of Vitellius. When [[Vespasian]] and his sons came to the throne the [[Flavian dynasty]] harnessed verism as a source of propaganda. Scholars believe that Vespasian used the shift from the Classical style to that of veristic portraiture to send a visual propagandistic message distinguishing him from the previous emperor. Vespasian’s portraits showed him as an older, serious, and unpretentious man who was in every respect the anti-Nero: a career military officer concerned not for his own pleasure but for the welfare of the Roman people, the security of the Empire, and the solvency of the treasury.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010" /&gt;{{rp|123}} Like the Romans from the Late Republic, Vespasian used veristic busts to underscore traditional values as a way to indicate to the Roman people a connection to the Republic.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010" /&gt;{{rp|123}} With this reminder of the Late Republic, many Roman citizens were likely put at ease, knowing Vespasian was truly not like the previous emperor Nero, who represented everything the Republic abhorred. Yet after the Flavian period verism again faded into obscurity.

==Verism in academia==
Veristic portraits of the late Republic hold a special fascination for classical art historians. Romans had inherited the use of sculpted marble heads from the Greeks but they did not inherit the veristic style from them. To scholars verism is uniquely Roman. Scholars have put forth multiple theories as to what or who were the precursors to Republican portraiture. Yet what is important to note is that there is not one single accepted theory of the origin of verism. The question of veristic style remains to this day essentially open and unresolved. Each theory, while plausible in its own way, will require further research and adequate consideration among scholars.

=== First Theory ===
[[File:IMG 1075 - Perugia - Museo archeologico - Urna etrusca - 7 ago 2006 - Foto G. Dall'Orto2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Etruscan Cinerary Urn, c. 150-100 BC]]Scholars believe the ancient [[Italic peoples]] had an inclination to veristic representation leading to influence on later Roman art.&lt;ref name="Richter, p. 39"&gt;Richter, ''The Origin of Verism in Roman Portraits'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; From a central Italian provenance in ancient times tribes from this area used [[Terracotta]] and [[Bronze]] to make a somewhat realistic portrayal of the human head.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Yet the ‘Italic’ heads, as they are called, are not seriously considered to be a favorable or strong theory held among scholars as being forerunners to the Republican portraits.&lt;ref name="Richter, p. 39"/&gt; Scholars note that none of the realistic looking specimens can be shown to be earlier than the arrival of the new wave of Greek influence, rather than vice versa.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

=== Second Theory ===

Scholars debate whether the heads of reclining figures on [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] cinerary urns are the forebears to Republican portraiture.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}} In Etruscan culture it was traditional and very common in [[Etruscan art]] to provide a naturalistic look to figures. Many cinerary urns are realistic looking or at least have harshly treated faces.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Scholars debate whether the realistic-looking style of head of these figures were a native creation which influenced the Romans, or whether the Romans influenced [[Etruria]].&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|31}} The issues relating to chronological time casts doubts as to the accuracy of the theory.

=== Third Theory ===

Scholars consider the ancient Roman custom of making wax portraits, known as funerary or [[Death mask]], of their ancestors as a convincing source for the veristic style. H. Drerup, a man of academia, argues that death masks molded straight from the face were early in use at Rome and exerted a ‘direct influence’ on Republican portraits.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|31}} Yet research has cast doubt on this theory. None of the funerary masks date before the 1st century AD. Evidence suggests the ancestral funerary masks merely kept pace with contemporary portraits in the round.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|31}} Chronology seems to be an issue with supporting the theory.
[[File:Face of a child-MGR Lyon-IMG 9850.jpg|thumbnail|left|Roman funerary mask of a child]]

=== Fourth Theory ===

Scholars debate whether Egyptian influence started Roman verism. A group of portraits in hard [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|Egyptian stone]] from the Roman [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] show a harsh realism that is similarly seen in Republican portraits.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|32}} Scholars believe the Egyptian portraits began to be made before the Republican portraits and strongly influenced the Romans into establishing the veristic style when Egyptian priests and cults came into contact with Italy and Greece.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|32}} Although this theory like the others has merit, lack of concrete dating of this certain Egyptian style makes scholars doubt the creditability. Suggested stylistic dates often fluctuate by two or three centuries leaving scholars with no solid evidence for when the style of harshly realistic [[Portraiture in Ancient Egypt|Egyptian portraiture]] begun.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|31}} Historians also note Romans did not have extensive military or commercial contact with [[Egypt]] before 30 BCE, which was after the Late Republic when verism was being used on portraiture.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|32}} Scholars conclude that it is unlikely that Egyptian portraits influenced the Republican style.

=== Fifth Theory ===

Another theory presented to scholars in classical academia suggests that verism came about from Greek reactions to the conquering Romans. The theory goes that Romans in the Republic privately cherished the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic culture]] yet still held onto Republic values.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|34}} This interest leaked similar portrayals seen in the more realistic Hellenistic royal portraits of the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] and [[Bactria|Bactarian]] kings of the first half of the 2nd century BC, such as the slight turn of their heads and upward glance of the eyes, into Roman veristic busts.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|34}} As Rome conquered Greece the empire saw an influx of talented Greek artists who were commissioned by the Romans to create their portraits that portrayed both the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic look]] and Republic values. It should be noted that Greek artists notoriously portrayed foreigners in an unfavorable light as a result of Greek attitudes of superiority.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|35}} For the Romans the Greeks found them not only to be foreigners, yet to be increasingly pompous and unlikeable oppressors.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|35}} Greek artists were little concerned to put the sitter’s case favorably and portrayed Romans with an unsympathetic likeness.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|35}} As a result, the Greek artist would maintain the Hellenistic ‘pathos formula’ – turn of the head and neck, eyes looking upward – but the Greek sculptor, rather than adapt the Roman’s features to a Hellenistic ruler ideal, had concentrated on bringing out an air of caricature to the face leading to what scholars call veristic portraiture.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|36}}

Some scholars refute this theory as being the cause of verism. Scholars doubt that Romans would not have been angered by the caricature like portrayal given to them by the Greeks. Many question why the Romans did not punish the Greeks for this obvious slight. Yet scholars who are in favor of this theory state that the Romans simply didn’t care for this over realistic portrayal. The Republic values of that time favored the straightforward and honest Roman citizen who did not need the deceits of art, but instead should be portrayed as they were, without artifice, for this would best bring out their Republican values.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|37}} As a result, some art historians, like [[R. R. R. Smith]], believe verism originated from the negative Greek attitudes, if not somewhat unconscious attitudes, the artists felt towards these particular foreign clients, which was allowed to work itself into the Roman portraits because the artists had been freed from the usual obligation to flatter and idealized the sitter and instead allowed to sculpt without artifice.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|38}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14564">'''Victimless Leather''' – a prototype of a stitch-less jacket, grown from cell cultures into a layer of tissue supported by a coat shaped polymer layer.&lt;ref name="hovedside"&gt;[http://tcaproject.org/projects/victimless/leather TC&amp;A – Victimless Leather] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a sub-project of the [[Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project]] where the artists are growing a [[leather]] jacket without killing any animals. Growing the victimless leather problematizes the concept of [[garment]] by making it semi-living. This artistic grown garment is intended to confront people with the moral implications of wearing parts of dead animals for protective and aesthetic reasons and confronts notions of relationships with manipulated living systems.

__TOC__

==Tissue Culture &amp; Art Project==

The [[SymbioticA]] website explains what it is, "an artistic laboratory dedicated to the research, learning, critique and hands-on engagement with the life sciences.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symbiotica.uwa.edu.au/ Official SymbioticA website] Retrieved 03.20.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The artists work with tissue, constructing and growing complex organisms that can live outside the body, making the new objects semi-living. Their projects are meant to question life, identity and the relationship between humans and other living beings and environments. They are also interested in the ethics around partial life and the possibilities around this type of technology in the future.&lt;ref name="tca"&gt;[http://tcaproject.org/ TC&amp;A website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===

These are some of the sub-projects that are also part of the TC&amp;A project, in addition to Victimless Leather:

'''NoArk''' – NoArk is a collection of cells and tissue from many different organisms, growing together inside a "vessel", a reference to [[Noah's Ark]]. The project website states that NoArk is "a tangible as well as symbolic ‘craft’ for observing and understanding a biology that combines the familiar with the other".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/noark.html TC&amp;A – NoArk] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Worry Dolls''' – Seven modern versions of the Guatemalan [[Worry doll]] were hand-crafted of degradable [[polymers]] and surgical sutures and seeded with skin, muscle and bone tissue. The tissue was then allowed to grow inside a bioreactor, replacing the polymers as it degrades, thus creating seven semi-living dolls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/ars/main_frames.html TC&amp;A – Worry Dolls] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''Disembodied Cuisine''' – Along with Victimless Leather, this is part of the "Victimless Utopia". The idea for this project was to take cells from a frog and grow them into something possible to eat, displaying it next to the still living frog the food came from. This problemetizes the whole meat industry – how we kill animals to eat them. Growing tissue outside of the body of the animal is a way to "make" meat while the animal stays healthy and living.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/disembodied/dis.html TC&amp;A – Disembodied Cuisine] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Extra Ear – ¼ Scale''' – Using human tissue, a quarter-scale replica of artist [[Stelarc]]'s ear was grown. The project wanted to confront the cultural perceptions of life now that we are able to manipulate living systems, and also discuss the notions of the wholeness of the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/extra/extra_ear.html TC&amp;A – Extra Ear – ¼ Scale] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
'''The Pig Wings Project''' – This project bases its ideas on [[xenotransplantation]] and genetically modifying pigs so their organs can be transplanted to humans. The artists used tissue engineering and stem cell technologies to grow pig bone tissue, forming three different sets of wings. One set shaped as bat wings ("evil"), one as bird wings ("good") and one as pterosaurs wings ("neutral").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/pig/pig_main.html TC&amp;A – The Pig Wings Project] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Idea==
An aim for the "Victimless Leather" project is to explore and provoke scientific truths, using conceptual art projects to encourage better understanding of cultural ideas around scientific knowledge. The project website point out how clothing has always been used to protect the fragile skin of humans, but lately have evolved into a fabricated object used as a tool to show one's identity. Based on this, clothing can be explored as a tangible example of the relationship between humans and others, and how humans treat others. As the artists put it: "This particular project will deconstruct our cultural meaning of clothes as a second skin by materialising it and displaying it as an art object."&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

The intention to grow artificial leather without killing an animal is meant as a contribution to a cultural discussion between art, science and society. Making this jacket presents a possibility of wearing leather that is not part of a dead animal. The projects are presented in Workshops and exhibitions throughout the world to address ethical questions related to [[bioscience]] and [[technology]]. The artists want the project to be seen in this cultural context, not a commercial one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Genetologic Research] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Their intention is not to create a consumer product, but to offer a starting point for the cultural discussion points mentioned above. As with most of the TC&amp;A projects the artists are concerned with the relationship between humans and other living systems, both natural and scientific made or manipulated.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt;

== The Victimless Leather project ==

[[File:Victimless leather.jpg|thumb|left|x450px|Victimless leather, photo from TC&amp;A webpage [http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/vl/images.html]]]

===Growing the jacket===
The artists wanted to make a leather-like material using living tissue, and ended up making it in the shape of a stitchless jacket. The artists based the jacket on a biodegradable polymer, coated it with [[3T3 cells|3T3]] mouse cells to form connective tissue and topped it up with human [[bone cells]] in order to create a stronger skin layer.

To create the victimless leather, the team needed an artificial environment where semi-living entities are grown, so it is grown inside a bioreactor that acts as a surrogate body. The bioreactor used in this project was custom made, based on an organ perfusion pump designed by [[Alexis Carrel]] and [[Charles Lindbergh]]. It has an automatic dripping system which feeds the cells.&lt;ref name="hovedside" /&gt; The artists assumed that when the polymer degraded, an integrated jacket would appear. The resulting jacket was tiny, about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high and 1,4&amp;nbsp;inches wide and would just fit a mouse.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 Wired – Jacket Grows From Living Tissue] Retrieved 10.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

To idealize the "victimless" of the jacket, immortalized cell lines or cells that divide and multiply forever once they are removed from an animal or human host forming a renewable resource, have been used in the project. The 3T3 mouse cells all come from a mouse who lived in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2004/10/65248 The technoscientific body] Retrieved 03.31.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development==
The research and development of “Victimless Leather” has been conducted in SymbioticA: the Art and Science Collaborative Research Laboratory, School of Anatomy and Human Biology at the University of Western Australia and in consultation with Professor Arunasalam Dharmarajan from the School of Anatomy and Human Biology as well as Verigen, a Perth-based company that specializes in tissue engineered cartilage for clinical applications. Western Australia state made the investment in the project through ArtsWa in Association with the Lotteries Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetologisch-onderzoek.nl/index.php/134/biologie/ Victimless Leather Jacket] Retrieved 05.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====Killing the Jacket====
The victimless leather was featured in the exhibition “Design and the Elastic Mind” at [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], United States. [http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2008/elasticmind/index.html] [http://www.moma.org/] February 24 – May 12, 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tca.uwa.edu.au/news.html TC&amp;A News] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt; The project was scheduled to grow continuously until May 12 when the exhibition ended. There were some problems though, when the leather started expanding too quickly, clogging tubes inside the bioreactor. The exhibition leader therefore decided to unplug the project before the end of the exhibition – in a way, killing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/54636/ TheScientist – Victimless Jacket, R.I.P.] Retrieved 03.17.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===

Because the artificial leather is made semi-living, the project might be seen as speculative and provocative to some people – questioning whether it is better to kill semi-living beings rather than living beings. "One of the most common and somewhat surprising comments we heard was that people were disturbed by our ethics of using living cells to grow living fabric, while the use of leather obtained from animals seems to be accepted without any concern for the well-being of the animals from which the skin has been removed." artist Ionat Zurr uttered after showing the jacket to the public on "The Space Between" exhibition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thespacebetween.org.au/ The Space Between] Retrieved 03.30.2011&lt;/ref&gt; in Australia.&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt;

The project also focuses on human consumption, highlighting that there are victims on every level of it, and that the boundaries between harm and benefit often are blurred. The French actress [[Brigitte Bardot]] strongly opposed hunting of animals for vanity and the commercial purpose of the skin. From an indigenous point of view, the context must be{{according to whom|date=June 2012}} seen different. An [[Inuit]] hunts the [[Pinniped|seal]] and uses the whole body of the animal as a basic resource for his survival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bambusspiele.de/spiele/nanuuk/e_nunavut.htm – Arctic hunters], Retrieved 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to ethics like this, is the interest for artificial meat production due to reactions against the livestock sector because of health and environmental problems. A 2006 UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO report pointed out the livestock sector as one of the most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems like soil degradation and water pollution. And because of methane, it spews out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than transportation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200908170494.html – All Africa] Retrieved 20.04.2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''We'Moon: Gaia Rhythms for Womyn''''' is an astrological and lunar calendar datebook, featuring art and writing submitted by, for and about women. &lt;ref&gt; Woodward-Smith, www.goddess-pages.co.uk winter 2008 issue&lt;/ref&gt; "Wemoon" means "women," "we of the moon" (for other [[alternative political spelling]]s, see [[Womyn]]). The datebook was founded in 1981 and is published annually in Oregon, USA, by Mother Tongue Ink (d.b.a. We’Moon Company). ''We'Moon'' is a publication focused on “helping women make their daily lives sacred and align themselves with Earth and Moon rhythms.” &lt;ref&gt; Eisenberg, ''Sage Woman Magazine #66''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

''We'Moon'' was inspired by the women’s liberation and emerging people's movements of the 1960s and 1970s, and came to fruition in the 1980s as a vehicle for the creative expression of women's empowerment and [[earth-based spirituality]]. The idea of a special calendar for women—based on lunar, solar and astrological cycles—originated at Kvindelandet, an international [[womyn's land|women’s land]] in Denmark where 50–60 lesbians from different countries lived together in the late 1970s. The first ''We'Moon'' was self-published in France in 1981 under the name of Mother Tongue Ink, as a pocket-sized astrological moon calendar diary, handwritten in five languages. The first five editions were pocket-sized, homemade, and continually evolving in format, design and technology, changing languages every year. During these years, the datebook was created by groups of volunteers in various locations in Europe. &lt;ref&gt; Musawa, ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

''We'Moon '87'' was the first edition created in the U.S., where production has remained. Mother Tongue Ink, d.b.a. We’Moon Company, was incorporated in 1995. &lt;ref&gt; Musawa, ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p.49, p,58&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Mother Tongue Ink published a children’s book, ''The Last Wild Witch'', by [[Starhawk]], illustrated by Lindy Kehoe. ''In the Spirit of We’Moon – Celebrating 30 years – An Anthology of We’Moon Art and Writing'', was released in 2011. ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'' is "an anthology of writing and art originally published in the annual publication ''We'Moon'', with commentary and other new material." &lt;ref&gt; University of Oregon www.libweb.uoregon.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

''We'Moon'' sends out an annual Call for Contributions to women internationally, and publishes approximately 250 pieces of original art and writing in each year’s datebook. ''We'Moon''’s thematic focus includes feminism, goddess and earth-based spirituality, world community, environmentalism, peace and justice. &lt;ref&gt; Woodward-Smith, www.goddess-pages.co.uk winter 2008 issue&lt;/ref&gt;The datebook includes articles by astrologers Gretchen Lawlor, Heather Roan Robbins, [[Susan Levitt]] and Sandra Pastorius. Lunar phase and astrological aspect data are listed for each date. &lt;ref&gt; Sydney L. Murray, ''Vision Magazine'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, ''We'Moon'' has published work by thousands of contributing women, including writings by [[Joanna Macy]], [[Starhawk]], [[Susan Weed]], [[Winona LaDuke]], [[Carolyn Gage]], [[Myshkin (singer)|Myshkin]], [[Vicki Noble]], [[Donna Henes]], [[Alice Walker]], and founding editor Musawa, and art by [[Monica Sjoo]], [[Tee Corinne]], [[Meinrad Craighead]], Toni Truesdale, [[Betty LaDuke]], Sandra Stanton, Leah Dorion, Max Dashu, Sudie Rakusin and Hrana Janto. &lt;ref&gt; ''In the Spirit of We'Moon'', MTInk 2011 p. 242 - 249&lt;/ref&gt;
