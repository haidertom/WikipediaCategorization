The '''1961 F-84 Thunderstreak incident''', occurring on 14 September 1961, was an incident during the [[Cold War (1953–1962)|Cold War]], in which two [[Republic F-84F Thunderstreak]] [[fighter-bomber]]s of [[Jagdbombergeschwader 32|''JaBoG 32'']] of the [[German Air Force]] (''Luftwaffe'') crossed into East German [[airspace]] because of a navigational error, before landing at [[Berlin Tegel Airport]]. The two planes successfully evaded a large number of Soviet fighter planes by finding cover in a heavy layer of clouds,&lt;ref name="Spiegel" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45139958.html STRAUSS-BEFEHL: Bier-Order 61] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 9 May 1962, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; but also by the actions of an airman at the [[United States Air Force]] air route traffic control center at [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] who ordered the planes on to Berlin rather than forcing them to turn around and face the pursuing fighter planes.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; The event came at a historically difficult time in relations between the two Germanies. Only a month before, the [[Berlin Wall]] had been built, which completely cut off West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from [[East Berlin]]. It also came three days before the [[West German federal election, 1961|West German federal election]], held on 17 September 1961.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Background==
At the time, violations of airspace at the border between West and East Germany were common, with, on average, two aircraft a month belonging to members of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) crossing into Eastern airspace while a much larger number of Soviet planes crossed into that of West Germany. There were 38 violations of West Germany's air space by Soviet aircraft in a period of just four weeks between August and September 1961. Some of the violations were deliberate, to determine the opposite side's reaction, while others were by mistake, caused by the difficulty in determining the border line from the air.&lt;ref name="Monat" &gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-45141349.html LUFTZWISCHENFALL: Zweimal monatlich] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', published: 29 August 1962, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the end of the Second World War and the [[German reunification]], West German planes were not permitted to fly to West Berlin, regardless of whether they were civilian or military aircraft. The three existing [[West Berlin Air Corridor|air corridors]] to the city were only open to planes from the three wartime [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]: the United States, France and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Tages" &gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/angriffshoehe-800/394316.html Angriffshöhe 800] {{de icon}} ''[[Der Tagesspiegel]]'', published: 2 March 2003, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incident==
On 14 September 1961, under the code name ''Checkmate'', the [[NATO]] high command mobilised the air forces of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and West Germany for the purpose of an [[military exercise|exercise]]. As part of this exercise, the ''[[Jagdbomber]]''s of ''[[Jagdbombergeschwader 32|Jagdbombergeschwader (JaBoG) 32]]'', based at [[Lechfeld Airbase]], south of [[Augsburg]], were to fly a triangular route from [[Würzburg]] to [[Laon]] and then to [[Memmingen]].&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Two F-84 fighter-bombers, flown by [[Feldwebel]] Peter Pfefferkorn and [[Unteroffizier|Stabsunteroffizier]] Hans Eberl,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n6qRFggA1sMC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=Pfefferkorn+Eberl+14+September+1961&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DmhvySvrU0&amp;sig=fafOuilSu-d-gI-tp-thRCLE1m4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lOL1TKfHN4nprAfn0p32Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Pfefferkorn%20Eberl%2014%20September%201961&amp;f=false Krieg um Berlin?: die sowjetische Militär- und Sicherheitspolitik] {{de icon}} google book review, author: Matthias Uhl, accessed: 1 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; lost their course in the process of flying this route, with the compass on Pfefferkorn's plane misreading by between 40 and 60 degrees. Additionally, a strong westerly wind was greater in strength than had been forecasted. On their way from Würzburg to Laon, the two pilots had become so disoriented that they mistook [[Liège]] in Belgium for [[Reims]] in France.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Shortly after, the pair were picked up by NATO radar stations near [[Warburg]], in southern [[Westphalia]], heading east, in the direction of [[Königs Wusterhausen]], south of Berlin. The two pilots missed a radio call from the radar stations advising them to turn around because they were talking to each other, trying to establish their location.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

It was only when reaching a position north of [[Leipzig]], deep within East German air space, that Pfefferkorn sent a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]] signal, which was picked up, to their surprise, by the French-controlled airport at Tegel in [[West Berlin]], which gave them permission to land. The planes had initially not been noticed by the radar operator at the [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport]] because he was concentrating on an incoming [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] [[Douglas DC-6]]. By the time they were noticed, the pair were being unsuccessfully chased by a large number of Soviet fighter aircraft. An airman in the Berlin Air Route Traffic Control Center ordered the two pilots not to turn around and face the pursuing fighter planes but instead to head for the Tegel airport as it had a longer runway than Tempelhof and was more suitable for jets.&lt;ref name="Fifty"&gt;[http://www.50jahre-jabog32.de/Leseproben_50_Jahre_Jagdbombergeschwader_32.pdf 50 Jahre Jagdbombergeschwader 32] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718193436/http://www.50jahre-jabog32.de/Leseproben_50_Jahre_Jagdbombergeschwader_32.pdf |date=18 July 2011 }} {{de icon}} 50 Years Jagdbombergeschwader 32, accessed; 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the actions of this airman and the heavy cloud cover, which the two pilots used to conceal themselves, Pfefferkorn and Eberl escaped the pursuing Soviet aircraft and successfully landed their planes without further incident at Tegel.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

==Reaction==
===International===
Immediately after the two aircraft landed, the French authorities at Tegel airport explained to the Soviet authorities in East Berlin that, because of technical difficulties, an [[emergency landing]] of the two planes had been absolutely necessary.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The then-West German [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Minister of Defence]], [[Franz-Josef Strauß]], apologised to the Soviet ambassador in [[Bonn]] for the incident, sending his secretary of state, [[Volkmar Hopf]]. The government of the Soviet Union remained silent for a number of days with regards to the incident, before officially protesting against the West German "provocation" and threatening to shoot down any aircraft involved if the incident was repeated.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

The Soviet air command in East Germany was less than impressed with the 'unpunished' flight of two Western fighter planes through their airspace. However, it chose to blame bad weather for the incident rather than the failure of its ground control to guide the Soviet fighter planes on to the West German ones.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RYYuSGcwq5AC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Pfefferkorn+and+Eberl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VHqzsIhtcf&amp;sig=by3WlbzluCGCPMVwWI0WHSU6Fwc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8P70TIfGFsGecfmj4dcE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pfefferkorn%20and%20Eberl&amp;f=false Vor dem Abgrund: die Streitkräfte der USA und der UdSSR] {{de icon}} google book review, author: Dimitrij N. Filippovych, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2005-0033, Josef Kammhuber retusche.jpg|thumb|200px|Josef Kammhuber]]
[[Willy Brandt]], the leader of the opposition [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] in the upcoming federal elections, and the mayor of West Berlin, questioned how the two pilots could be put in a situation where they would be forced to violate international conventions in a time of strained relations between the East and the West. Initially, Strauß announced a stringent investigation into the incident; instead, however, he and [[Josef Kammhuber]], [[Inspector of the Air Force]], transferred the commander of ''JaBoG 32'', [[Oberstleutnant]] [[Siegfried Barth]], and announced that any commander whose unit committed a violation of international borders would be immediately replaced.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

When Kammhuber announced this order at Lechfeld the following day, it was dubbed ''Bier Order 61'' (''Beer Order 61'') because it was formulated late at night over drinks between Kammhuber and Strauß. Barth, commander of ''JaBoG 32'', was not questioned with regard to the incident, and was not allowed to speak during Kammhuber's visit. Instead, [[Generalleutnant]] [[Martin Harlinghausen]], Barth's superior officer, who had once, in 1944, stood up to [[Hermann Göring]], spoke for Barth and demanded a proper investigation.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt;

Two weeks later, Harlinghausen was forced into early retirement. The non-commissioned officers of ''JaBoG 32'' sent a letter to Strauß requesting that Barth should retain his command, without receiving any answer. Eventually, a proper investigation was conducted which found Barth to be innocent, a result unacceptable to Kammhuber, who initiated a second investigation that found the ''Oberstleutnant'' partly at fault. A third investigation followed, which again found Barth to be innocent. Oberstleutnant Barth then lodged an official complaint against Franz-Josef Strauß. Strauß, as minister of defence, ordered all witnesses in the case - Generals Kammhuber, Harlinghausen, [[Werner Panitzki]] and [[Werner Streib]] as well as Lieutenant Colonels [[Walter Krupinski]] and [[Walter Grasemann]] - [[gag order|not to speak]], as they were all military personnel and therefore under his command. Nevertheless, his conduct in dismissing Barth was found to be at fault, and the latter had to be reinstated in his position. Strauß, however, ignored this decision until [[Hellmuth Heye]], [[Ombudsman]] for the Military, forced him to accept it.&lt;ref name="Spiegel" /&gt; Strauß himself was later forced to resign from his post as Minister of Defence, in the wake of the [[Spiegel scandal|''Spiegel'' scandal]] in 1962. Kammhuber retired from his post in the same year.

==Aftermath==
Upon arrival at Tegel, the two planes were immediately hidden in [[hangar]]s and journalists were prohibited from taking pictures of them.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; For years after, it was believed that the two planes had been repainted as aircraft of the [[United States Air Force]] and returned to West Germany by USAF pilots, or that they had been disassembled and transported back to the West in pieces.&lt;ref name="Tages" /&gt; The arrival of two massive [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II|Douglas C-124]] at Tegel from [[Frankfurt am Main]] also fuelled speculations that the two F-84s would be transported back in these aircraft.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt; Another theory (which turned out to be true) held that the two aircraft were hidden by the French authorities at Tegel and, later, buried at the airfield, where they were accidentally rediscovered in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burgmannschaft.info/forum/upload/showthread.php?t=1117 Luftraumverletzungen und -zwischenfälle über dem Gebiet der DDR]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{de icon}}, accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In an exhibition at the ''[[Luftwaffenmuseum der Bundeswehr|Luftwaffenmuseum Berlin-Gatow]]'' in 2006, pictures of the two buried and then rediscovered Thunderstreaks at Tegel were shown, finally clearing up the question of what became of the two planes.&lt;ref name="Fifty" /&gt;

The pilots of the two Thunderstreaks, Pfefferkorn and Eberl, were banned from flying and transferred to the ground crew at Lechfeld.&lt;ref name="Monat" /&gt; The F-84F Thunderstreak, in service with the ''Jagdbombergeschwader 32'' since inception of the unit on 22 July 1958, was phased out of service on 13 July 1966, the ''Geschwader'' having accumulated over 80,000 flight hours with the planes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luftwaffe.de/portal/a/luftwaffe/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLNzKI9zAJBsmB2e5ezvqRcNGglFR9b31fj_zcVP0A_YLciHJHR0VFAN5emug!/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfMjBfT0tD?yw_contentURL=%2F01DB060000000001%2FW27G5DLE422INFODE%2Fcontent.jsp ''Jagdbombergeschwader 32'' website – History] {{de icon}} accessed: 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962 incident===
[[File:Hawker Sea Hawks of the West German Marineflieger in August 1958.jpg|thumb|right|Marineflieger-Geschwader 1]]
Eleven months after the F-84 incident, the Soviet threat of to shooting down any aircraft violating the border materialized when a [[Hawker Sea Hawk]] of the ''[[Bundesmarine]]'', piloted by [[Kapitänleutnant]] Knut Anton Winkler, was shot at by [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] fighters when it accidentally crossed into East German airspace near [[Eisenach]]. Winkler, who had been returning from a training exercise on board {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60|6}} in the Atlantic Ocean, had to carry out an emergency landing at [[Ahlhorn]], 45&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Bremen]].&lt;ref name="Monat" /&gt; The aircraft was eventually written-off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.snafu.de/veith/seahawk.htm  DDR-Luftwaffe.de – Sea Hawk] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winkler himself died less than four years later in a [[F-104 Starfighter]] accident on 10 May 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cactus-starfighter-staffel.de/public/html/in_memoriam.html In Memoriam] List of German pilots killed in F-104 Starfighter accidents, accessed: 2 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''999 phone charging myth''' is an [[urban myth]] which claims that if a [[mobile phone]] has low battery then dialing [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] (or any regional [[emergency number]]) charges the phone so it has more power. This was confirmed as a myth by several British police forces who publicly cited the dangers of making such calls.

== Basis ==
The basis for the myth was a feature of [[BlackBerry]] phones: If the battery level was too low, the phone automatically locked down phone features and shut down the phone radio for all calls except to emergency services. People discovered that if they dialed 999 then immediately hung up, it would override the shutdown for a number of minutes so that phone calls could be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialstudent.co.uk/calling-the-police-doesnt-charge-your-phone-battery/ |title=Calling The Police Doesn't Charge Your Phone Battery |publisher=Social Student |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
The myth is believed to have originated in BlackBerry forums around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/news/crime/derbyshire-ignore-phone-myth-cops-urge-1-5996352/amp |title=Ignore phone myth, cops urge |work=Derbyshire Times |date=30 August 2013 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.crackberry.com/blackberry-bold-9930-9900-f235/battery-too-low-radio-use-warning-694982/ |title="Battery too low for radio use" warning |publisher=BlackBerry Forums |date= |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Derbyshire Constabulary]] released a press release telling people not to believe the myth that calling 999 charges the battery.&lt;ref name=db /&gt; They cited that for every silent or aborted 999 call received, the operators have to call the person back to make sure there is no emergency.&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2014-01-13/police-warning-over-mobile-phone-urban-myth/ |title=Police warning over mobile phone urban myth |publisher=ITV |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[hoax calls]] waste police time that could potentially block responses to real emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Cockerton |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dialling-999-not-charge-mobile-2234973 |title=Dialling 999 does NOT charge mobile battery: Derbyshire Police issue warning over urban myth |work=The Mirror |date=29 August 2013 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bedfordshire Police]] also released information asking people not to call 999 except for an emergency as they stated that in the last six months of 2013 they had an increase in hoax 999 calls from people believing the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2014-01-15/police-dispel-999-myth/ |title=Police dispel 999 myth |publisher=ITV |date=15 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources supplemented these press releases by stating that misusing the 999 number is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/13/999-battery-hoax_n_4588617.html |title=Calling 999 Does NOT Boost Your Mobile Phone Battery, Police Warn As Hoax Persists |work=Huffington Post UK |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the police could cut off telephones being used to abuse the 999 service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutontoday.co.uk/news/you-might-be-charged-yourself-if-you-try-to-power-up-your-mobile-1-5873160/amp |title=You might be charged yourself if you try to power up your mobile |work=The Luton News |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related myth emerged: that when [[Siri]] on an [[iPhone]] is told, "Charge my phone to 100%", the phone would call emergency services as a secret safety code. This was later traced to a bug in [[Apple Inc|Apple]] programming that was fixed within a day. The myth continued to spread on social media as a prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/siri-charge-phone-police/ |title=Telling Siri to 'Charge My Phone to 100%' Summons Police |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abu Salim prison''' ({{lang-ar|سجن أبو سليم}}) is a [[Supermax|maximum security prison]] in [[Tripoli]], [[Libya]]. The prison was notorious during the rule of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] for alleged mistreatment and human rights abuses, including a massacre in 1996 in which [[Human Rights Watch]] estimated that 1,270 prisoners were killed.&lt;ref name="notorious Abu Salim"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison to be emptied|publisher=[[daylife.com]]|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303080553/http://www.daylife.com/article/0gNNdjv7Qq32E?q=Libya|archive-date=2011-03-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|title=Libya's notorious Abu Salim prison|publisher=geneva lunch|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711083553/http://genevalunch.com/blog/2010/03/24/libyas-notorious-abu-salim-prison-to-be-emptied/|archive-date=2011-07-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN libya death"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Nic|first2=Paul|last2=Cruickshank|url=http://www.edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/23/libya.death/index.html|title=Jihadist death threatened Libyan peace deal|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=28 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of human rights abuses==
[[Amnesty International]] has called for an [[Public inquiry|independent inquiry]] into deaths that occurred there on 29 June 1996,&lt;ref name="amnesty 346"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |title=Investigation needed into prison deaths |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317043628/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/346 |archivedate=2015-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an incident which some have referred to as the '''Abu Salim prison massacre'''.&lt;ref name="court celebrates massacre"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|title=Libyan legal court celebrates Abu Salim prison massacre|publisher=[[Arabic News]]|date=24 June 2005|access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227211022/http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/050624/2005062418.html|archive-date=2011-02-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] believes that 1,270 prisoners were killed. HRW also calls the prison a "site of egregious [[human rights violations]]."&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch 1270"&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2009/10/16/libya-free-all-unjustly-detained-prisoners|title=  Libya: Free All Unjustly Detained Prisoners|publisher=  [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human Rights Watch also stated in a report that they were unable to independently verify the allegations of a massacre. The claims cited by Human Rights Watch are based on the testimony of a single former inmate, Hussein Al Shafa’i, who stated that he did not witness a prisoner being killed: "I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot..."&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite web|title=
Libya: June 1996 Killings at Abu Salim Prison |date=June 27, 2006 |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/06/27/libya-june-1996-killings-abu-salim-prison |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of over 1200 killed was arrived at by Al Shafa’i allegedly calculating the number of meals he prepared when he was working in the prison's kitchen. Al Shafa'i stated "I was asked by the prison guards to wash the watches that were taken from the bodies of the dead prisoners..."&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Libyan Government rejected the allegations about a massacre in Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency head of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation on the order of the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate break-outs prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

Journalist Lindsey Hilsum explored the topic in her 2012 book "Sandstorm". She met with a number of families who claimed their family members had been at the prison. She describes the massacre number as an uncertain estimate for several reasons; the main problem being the government's long term silence about the whereabouts of prisoners and their condition. She also describes eyewitness accounts of a mass shooting.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The families of the disappeared and killed formed a loose association and held numerous protests in Benghazi. Lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] helped represent them. He was arrested several times for his trouble. [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] (son of the dictator) tried to resolve the issue via his [[Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations]] circa 2007.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

The Libyan government said in 2009, then controlled by the same people as at the time of the event, that the killings took place amid confrontation between the government and rebels from the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]], and that some 200 guards were killed too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shuaib|title=Libya appoints judge to probe 1996 prison massacre|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/09/06/uk-libya-massacre-idUKTRE5850PJ20090906|accessdate=2 July 2011|date=6 September 2009|work=Reuters UK|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] confirmed that it was carrying out an investigation into the incident along with international investigators.&lt;ref name="ohchr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review: Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/16session/A-HRC-16-15.pdf|work=[[Universal Periodic Review]]|publisher=[[United Nations Human Rights Council]], [[United Nations General Assembly]]|accessdate=26 October 2011|date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statements made in an interview with the BBC by the captured [[Mansour Dhao]], a prominent figure in the Gaddafi regime, provides further evidence for the massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=30 October 2011 | title=Gaddafi: 'He died an angry and disappointed man' | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15516678 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Arab Spring]] occurred in Tunisia and Egypt, lawyer [[Fathi Terbil]] was amongst the first arrested by Libyan authorities trying to stave off a revolution. The Abu Salim families gathered to protest his imprisonment, and this gathering eventually contributed to the revolution in Libya. [[Abdullah Senussi]], Gaddafi's intelligence chief suspected by many to have been involved in the 1996 massacre, reportedly tried to ask Terbil to make the protests stop.&lt;ref name=alternet1/&gt;

On 25 September 2011, soon after the previous government had been overthrown, the governing [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) said that a mass grave had been discovered outside the prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave | work=[[BBC News]] | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid al-Sherif, a military spokesman for the NTC, said that the grave was located based on information from captured former regime officials. He stated: "We have discovered the truth about what the Libyan people have been waiting for many years, and it is the bodies and remains of the Abu Salim massacre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | date=25 September 2011 | title=Mass grave found in Libya with remains of 1,200 | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/mass-grave-found-in-libya-with-remains-of-1200/articleshow/10120042.cms | work=[[The Economic Times]] | accessdate=25 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim Abu Shim, a member of the committee looking for mass graves, said that investigators believed 1,270 people were buried in the grave but the NTC needed help from the international community to find and identify the remains as they lacked the sophisticated equipment needed for DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=More than 1,200 bodies found in Tripoli mass grave| date=25 September 2011 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15055109 | work=[[BBC]] | accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/09/25/world/africa/libya-mass-grave/ | work=CNN | title=Libya hedges mass grave claim | date=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the civil war, the lawyer [[Abdul Hafiz Ghoga]] took the legal representation for the families of people killed in the massacre and negotiated with Gaddafi about compensations.&lt;ref name="HRW_GhogaAbuSalim"&gt;{{cite web|title=Update: Death Toll Up to At Least 233 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] |date=February 2011 |url=https://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xKvZxgit?url=http://www.hrw.org/node/96642 |archivedate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the uprise Ghoga became speaker  of the [[National Transitional Council]], in April 2011 vice president, and held this position until January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Libyan deputy leader steps down after angry protests  |first=Richard |last=Connor |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15683868,00.html |newspaper=Deutche Welle |date=22 January 2012 |accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inmates of Abu Salim prison==
*[[Ahmed al-Senussi]], a current member of the NTC, was held here by Gaddafi until his release in 2001.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite news |last=Stock |first=Johnathan |title=Gaddafi-Opfer Al-Senussi: Gott entscheidet, was mit dir passiert |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,750656,00.html |accessdate=25 August 2011 |newspaper=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=13 March 2011 |agency=SPIEGEL-Verlag |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61DGwSOUj?url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,750656,00.html |archivedate=2011-08-25 |language=German |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Tawfiq Algazwani, a former Libyan citizen who was imprisoned for leading a Human Rights protest in Benghazi. The next day Gaddafi's forces arrested him and took him to Tripoli where he was taken into Abu Salem and imprisoned for 10 years, when he was released he immigrated to Ireland,now in Benghazi and Tripoli. Tawfiq now lives in Dublin, married and has two kids. Tawfiq was released in the 80's and immigrated to Ireland in 1988.

==YouTube videos==
On 24 January 2010, the Libyan authorities [[Censorship of YouTube#By country|blocked access to YouTube]] after it featured videos of demonstrations in the Libyan city of [[Benghazi]] by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] at parties.

==Libyan civil war==
During the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] the prison was captured by the rebels on 24 August and all prisoners were set free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=RAW,Libya, Rebels and citizens setting prisoners free from Abu Salim Priso in Tripoli 24.08.2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWHy2jmVocQ |work=[[YouTube]] |author=FreePressTV }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those confirmed to have been freed was volunteer rebel fighter [[Matthew VanDyke]] from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, a member of a rebel unit captured by the Libyan Army in [[Brega]] in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=American fighting Kadhafi 'lunatics' dreams of free Libya |first=Jay|last=Deshmukh |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=3 October 2011 |work=Google News |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ggq9gizU50QT6TMAe6WPD-7Xytrw?docId=CNG.63f3ecd569de01fd9d60c41e9a017daa.931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2011/US/08/25/libya.freed.american/|title = American held in solitary escapes Tripoli prison|author = Phil Gast|work = CNN|date =25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An international campaign to free VanDyke had described him as a "writer and journalist," but it was later revealed that he was a rebel fighter and prisoner of war.&lt;ref name="Feeed CNN" /&gt;

'''Alternate ending''' ([[British English]]: '''alternative ending''') is a term used (usually in movies) to describe the ending of a story that was planned or debated but ultimately unused in favor of the actual ending. Generally, alternative endings are considered to have no bearing on the [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] narrative. On the internet, amateurs may make their own alternative endings.

==Examples in film==
Alternative endings are often filmed before being scrapped, and may be subsequently included as a special feature in the film's [[DVD]] release. These alternative endings are a special type of [[deleted scene]]. In other cases, ideas that were presented but discarded early on are alluded to by the production team in commentary or interviews.

Some films or movies also present the alternative ending on International releases as well as their international Home media release, with its original region release only showing the alternative ending on certain TV channels.

The following are examples of known alternative endings to movies:
*''[[1408 (film)|1408]]'': An alternative ending is present on the director's cut disc (much like ''The Butterfly Effect'', with a few deleted scenes reinserted) Mike Enslin dies in the fire he causes. At his burial, his wife is approached by the hotel manager, offering his personal belongings. She refuses, and he lets her know that her husband did not die in vain. Back in his vehicle he listens to the tape recorder, and screams in fear as he sees Enslin's burned deformed body in his back seat for only a moment. The film closes with an apparition of Mike Enslin still in 1408, muttering to himself, hears his daughter's voice, and finally exiting the room with her.
*''[[28 Days Later]]'': Several darker alternative endings (filmed, available on the DVD release). The first has Jim gravely injured near the end of the film and he is taken to a hospital, but he dies before he can be given medical attention, and his body is left behind (completing a cycle in the movie; he woke up alone in a hospital and has now died there). Some versions also involve him dreaming of the accident that put him in the hospital at the beginning of the film. Another unfilmed ending picks up after Frank has been infected, where they take him to a research complex and Jim sacrifices his own life to give him a total blood transfusion to restore him, and he is once again left alone in a hospital bed. This was discarded for being too unbelievable.
*''[[3 Ninjas]]'': The American cut originally showed that the boys had won the basketball challenge and effortlessly won Emily's bike back. In an extended international version of this movie, they lose the basketball challenge along with their own bikes, so a scene ends the international version of the film in which they fight the bullies to get them back, as an alternative ending. In the United States, this alternative ending can only be seen on certain television channels such as ''[[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]]'', [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] and [[Showtime MAX]]; international [[DVD]]s have this version, as well.
*''[[Army of Darkness]]'': In an alternative ending after Ash drinks the potion that would make him sleep long enough to wake up in his own time, he inadvertently drinks too much and wakes up in the future. Realizing that the world is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, Ash screams "I slept too long!"
*''[[The Astronaut's Wife]]'': When Spencer is killed, Jillian is not possessed by the alien. Instead, she moves out to the country. Sitting beneath a tree, looking up at the stars, she tunes her radio to the same signals Spencer was receiving while possessed by the alien - her twin babies controlling her movements from inside the womb, listening - and waiting...
*''[[Blade: Trinity]]'': The original ending is far more ambiguous with Dracula and Blade's fates not as determined. The ending only appears in the unrated DVD and was intended by the director [[David S. Goyer]]. Another alternate ending was seen showing Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler confront a werewolf.
*''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'': An alternative ending on the DVD has Bourne collapsing during the search for Marie, waking up with Abbot standing over him, and getting an offer to return to the CIA.
*''[[The Butterfly Effect]]'': Evan watches a home video of his mother pregnant with him and returns to the memory of himself as a fetus. Convinced that his very existence has ruined the lives of those around him, he strangles himself with his [[umbilical cord]] and dies, [[stillbirth|stillborn]]. This "[[Director's Cut]]" ending is much darker than the theatrical ending, where he simply stops himself from becoming friends with Kayleigh.
*''[[Child's Play 2]]'': An extended ending reveals that a chunk of Chucky's skin after his head exploded got mixed in with the Good Guy doll making plaster. A machine is then seen making a new Good Guy Doll head, which then forms a sinister smile.
*''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'': After defeating the Kraken and Hades, Andromeda falls into the sea and Perseus dives in to save her. When he reaches her, he embraces her with a passionate kiss, indicating that he fell in love with her, and she with him. After reaching the shore and regaining consciousness, Andromeda asks Perseus if he will stay and he says there is someone he needs to talk to, before kissing her again, indicating that he will come back. Getting on Pegasus, he flies to Mt. Olympus (although the special effects are incomplete) where he confronts Zeus, stating that he does not wish to be one of them and that any conflict between them has just started. After slamming his sword into the gods' map and shattering the models of every living person, he leaves and is seen flying on Pegasus over the sea, presumably back to Argos (although the special effects are incomplete).
*''[[Clerks]]'': Dante is still inside the Quick Stop after it closes. A customer enters and, without saying a word, shoots Dante after he tells him they are closed, and empties the cash register. The credits then roll, and when they are over a customer comes in and sees the counter empty without noticing Dante's body on the ground behind the counter.
*''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' had four different endings, and each one distributed to theatres had one of ''three'' of them. The video and DVD version had all of these three endings on it. The fourth one has not been included because the director did not approve of it.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088930/alternateversions&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'': In an alternative ending found on the special edition DVD it is presumed that Simon's robbery of the Federal Reserve succeeds, with McClane catching up with Gruber months later in Austria. McClane's police career is in ruins, and he is keen to take it out on Gruber, who he invites to play a game called "McClane Says". This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits. This ending is in the novelization, only McClane fools Gruber into thinking the tube-like launcher is pointed at McClane. Gruber guesses the trick question and shoots himself.
*''[[Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story]]'': The Average Joes lose the game when White Goodman hits Peter with the ball. According to the DVD commentary, this was the writer's original intention for the movie, but the studio insisted it be changed - hence the "real" ending - when test audiences reacted poorly to the unhappy ending. (The antagonist references this right at the end of the movie, by mocking the audience for wanting a happy ending and saying, "You happy now?")
*''[[Ella Enchanted (film)|Ella Enchanted]]'': The movie was originally supposed to end in a scene after the wedding, where Hattie is turned into a frog by Lucinda, Ella's father demands a divorce from Dame Olga, Heston is still alive but suffering torment from the Char Fan Club, Slannen becomes a lawyer, and Dame Olga ends up with Nish. No one knows why, but they cut the scene out and replaced the ending with a musical ending with the entire cast present and they exit like they do on stage.
*''[[Fatal Attraction]]'': Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) was originally scripted to commit suicide at the end of the movie and make it look like Dan (Michael Douglas) had murdered her, for which he was arrested. Test audiences did not respond well to this finale, mainly due to a lack of revenge from Beth and the family, especially when Beth tells Alex "If you ever come near my family again, I'll kill you". This resulted in a three-week re-shoot for the action-filled sequence in the bathroom and Alex's death by shooting. The fact that Beth shoots Alex makes a direct comparison between the two characters, Alex being a victim, and Beth taking control to protect her family.
*''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'': Alex is killed when he grabs the downed power line to save Claire, ending Death's pattern. In the final scene it turns out that Claire is pregnant with Alex's baby.
*''[[Final Destination 2]]'': The original movie was supposed to end with Kimberly and Officer Burke embracing in the hospital after Kimberly is revived. Instead, David Ellis, the director, decided to end the film with a bang and include the barbecue scene.
*''[[Final Destination 3]]'': The film has two alternative endings (based on the viewer's choices on the DVD). In the first ending, Ian is fully crushed by the sign and Wendy, Kevin, and Julie decide what to do next. In the second ending, which involves the subway, the train headed for Wendy actually hits her, instead of being a vision.
*''[[The Final Destination]]'': In one alternative ending, Nick realizes he has to kill himself for the chain to end. So, he puts out the initial fire and then jumps out a window, killing himself. Later, Janet and Lori sadly embrace, as Lori says, "The chain is broken." Suddenly, a piece of the chain holding the A/C unit breaks and lands next to Lori. Lori picks it up, and the unit drops and crushes Lori and Janet, with Lori's hand holding the chain sliding into the audience's face in 3D. In another, Nick is also crushed with Lori in the escalator, instead of it being a vision.
*''[[Final Destination 5]]'': In an alternative ending, which was in the original script, Sam, Molly and Nathan take a walk through memorial park believing they finally cheated Death but Death is still in action after Nathan is crushed by Flight 180's landing gear while Sam and Molly stare at him in horror.
*''[[First Blood]]'': In an alternative ending, Rambo commits suicide rather than be arrested. This alternate ending is included as an extra on the First Blood Ultimate Edition DVD released in 2004.
*''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'': Chris wakes up the morning after killing Jason, only to find he is still alive when she opens the back door of the lake house. Jason then proceeds to cut off Chris's head, and the scene immediately switches to Chris waking up screaming in the back of the police car, revealing her entire death was a dream and Jason remains dead in the barn.
*''[[Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter]]'': An alternative ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother, drowned in the bathtub. At that moment, Mrs. Jarvis' eyes open and Jason appears behind Trish, ready to strike. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film.
*''[[Game of Death]]'': This movie has two alternative endings. In the [[Hong Kong]] [[Cantonese]]  print, after we see Billy defeating Dr. Land, who falls from the rooftop, the police and an ambulance arrives there. The police arrest Billy and the ambulance takes Dr. Land. In the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] print it shows that after defeating Dr. Land, Billy is with Ann at a harbour, saying good-bye to Jim. The next scene shows a ship departing and a picture of [[Bruce Lee]]. This scene of the ship departing is also in the Hong Kong ending.
*''[[Happy Death Day]]'': An alternative ending has Tree recovering in the hospital from her ordeal with Lori, while being visited by her father and Carter. After they leave, a nurse enters to administer pain medication to Tree, with Tree stating that it was against doctor's orders. The nurse later reveals herself as Stephanie Butler, the wife of Dr. Gregory Butler, and she later kills Tree out of revenge for her affair with Gregory.
*''[[Hide and Seek (2005 film)|Hide and Seek]]'': This movie had many different endings on whether [[Dakota Fanning]]'s character, Emily had split personality and whether she ended up at a mental hospital or at a new home.
*''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'': The "Monster Woman" that Robert Neville captures in order to run a "cure" test becomes the key to his survival in the end. As the "Alpha Monster" begins to break into the lab area, he stops, and Robert Neville suddenly realizes that all they want is the "Monster Woman" back. So Robert Neville rolls her out of the lab and awakens her out of her medicated state, and the "Alpha Monster" picks her up and takes her away, leaving Neville alive after his ordeal. (NOTE: The creatures are a mutation from man's cure to cancer)
*''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'': In the alternative ending, Julie receives an invite to a pool party and reads an email that reads "I still know". This scene was used in the trailer for the film.
*''[[Infernal Affairs]]'': In the mainland Chinese version, the police found evidence proving Lau Kin Ming ([[Andy Lau]]) is a triad mole and is arrested and the film end. The sequel, ''[[Infernal Affairs III]]'', follows the original Hong Kong ending where Lau got away with his crime.
*''[[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'': In one of the most famous changed endings, the original conclusion to the off-Broadway musical was filmed and preferred by Frank Oz the director and the majority of the actors. However, test audiences disliked how Audrey and Seymour, the main protagonists, were both killed by the evil alien plant, and the ending had to be re-shot so that their deaths were removed.
*''[[Men in Black II]]'': The original ending for the film featured a scene in which the towers of the World Trade Center opened to release a swarm of UFOS. After the terrorist attacks in 2001, the ending was reshot.
* ''[[Orphan (2009 film)|Orphan]]'': In an alternative ending, Esther is seen hurrying into her room. There, she is shown with a face covered in blood while she re-applies her makeup. She then puts on the dress she wore for her first day of school and greets the police, who arrived after receiving Kate's frantic call before she reached the house, at the top of the stairs by curtsying and introducing herself, and then she is seen descending the stairs into the crowd of police. It is not explained whether or not she has killed Kate or Max in the alternative ending, although the dead body of John can be seen. However, due to the excess blood on Esther's face in the alternative ending and the fact that she is not wet, it is a possibility that she killed both Max and Kate.
*''[[Paranormal Activity]]'': In one version of the film that was shown at only one public viewing, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera, then slits her own throat. There is a third ending in which, after killing Micah, Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Katie's sister comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, and scares Katie's sister out of the house, before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth. The police arrive at the house about 30 minutes later, and Katie comes out of the bedroom with her knife, calling for Micah. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind the officers slams shut, causing the officers to shoot Katie.
*''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'': Jennings and Rachel are wondering what to do next when Jennings spots the kid who stole the engagement ring from him on the subway coming out of a pawn shop. He goes into the shop for a few minutes and when he comes back he asks Rachel "do you believe in fate?" and they kiss. It is assumed he then proposes to her because it fades to black at that point.
*''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]'': Both main characters are killed off by a man they forgot to shoot down.
*''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'': [[Rocky Balboa|Rocky]] defeats [[Mason Dixon (Rocky Balboa character)|Mason "The Line" Dixon]] by split decision. In the actual movie, it is reversed.
*''[[Ronin (film)|Ronin]]'': Deirdre is seen on the stairs next to the café considering joining Sam and Vincent. Deciding against it, she walks up the stairs. As she is getting into her car, she is snatched into a van by men in the IRA who call her a traitor. It is implied that she is later killed. Sam and Vincent finish their conversation and depart, completely unaware of what has just happened.
*''[[Scream 3]]'': When [[Ghostface (Scream)|Ghostface]] enters the screening room, he does not have a white sheet covering him. After Roman notices [[Sidney Prescott]] has disappeared after he supposedly killed her, he searches the screening room for her shouting and telling her all the doors are locked, most of the scene shows Sidney's point of view which was not shown in the actual ending. Also, Kincaid does not enter the screening room in this ending.
*''[[Scary Movie 3]]'': Cindy is told Cody does not exist. After hitting a few people in the face with a shovel, Cindy asks everybody who is not real to stand a specific spot. Cody goes there, and is followed by [[Santa Claus]]. The aliens then begin to invade but George stops them by transforming into [[Hulk (comics)|The Hulk]]. President Harris tries to hulk out, but ends up soiling his pants. Cindy enters the Logan House, where she is attacked by Tabitha. She is teleported away to Aunt Shaneequa, who teaches her how to defeat Tabitha. Cindy must then confront hundreds of Tabithas.

The cast then gets into a car with the President, but are horrified to learn that the driver happens to be [[M. Night Shyamalan]].
*''[[Seven (1995 film)|Seven]]'': Writer, Andrew Kevin Walker, completed two separate drafts of the ending. The first was used in the theatrical edition of the film. In the second, John Doe is killed by Somerset instead of Mills. This alternate ending sequence was storyboarded and is included in the published script, but never filmed, however it does appear on an extra disk on the DVD Release.
*''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'': Sharon Stone and the killer fly over a volcano when the killer suddenly confesses his crimes. He then veers the aircraft into the volcano as the end credits roll and leaves the audience to decide whether they survive.
*''[[Smokin' Aces]]'': Rather than pulling the life support cords of Israel and Sparazza as he does in the used ending, he instead draws his weapon and empties his pistol into them.
*''[[Super Troopers]]'': Another ending was filmed that starts the same way as the real ending; by the police station being closed down. This time, the former officers are now working in a meat packing plant. They talk to their boss saying that bad meat should not be sent out for people to buy, and the boss says to do it any way. At this point the officers take off their jacket to reveal that they are now local police officers and chase him throughout the meat packing plant.
*''[[Swordfish (film)|Swordfish]]'': The DVD version contains an alternative ending wherein Ginger is told in the bank that the account is already empty, alluding to the possibility that Stanley has played one final trick on them and taken the money himself. In a companion scene to the alternative ending, Stanley is shown on a trip with his daughter in a brand new RV. While eating at a diner, Stanley is shown transferring many billion dollars to various charities before continuing his trip.
*''[[The Terminator]]'': The alternative ending, included in some DVD releases, shows the cleanup and police response at the factory shortly after the final battle between Kyle and the terminator. A group of company representatives find the terminator wreckage and decide to hide it from police and have it analyzed. The film then ends by the screen panning out to show that the factory was owned by Cyberdyne Systems. The sequel is based on this alternative ending.
*''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'': The alternative ending shows Sarah Connor alive and well on August 29, 2029. She is by then a grandmother (and John Connor is a Senator) in a world where Skynet was never able to start its war on humanity.
*''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'': Old Rose is seen by her granddaughter dropping the diamond into the ocean.
*''[[Topaz (1969 film)|Topaz]]'': While Nicole and Michèle waiting in front of Stade Charléty, there was a duel between André and Jacques in the French football stadium. Jacques is shot down by a sniper. This ending was poorly received by audiences during test screenings.
*''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'': Not only different endings were intended to use in this film, but nearly a whole different plot, significantly the role of [[Jean Grey]] being more aggressive and disobeying direct orders of [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] several times. The alternative endings are: the re-opening of the Xavier Institute in which [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] is now a professor; [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] coming back to [[Alberta, Canada]], specifically the very same tavern seen in the first ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''; and [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] keeping her powers.
* ''[[Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]'' had two different endings. One had Lady Totington marrying PC Mackintosh and another had Lady Totington visiting Wallace and giving Gromit the golden carrot.
* ''[[Whisper (film)|Whisper]]'': In the alternative ending, the kidnapper Max has chased the demon boy David through the forest David makes him believe the wolves around him are the people who died. When they turn into wolves, they attack Max, but instead of throwing the axe and hitting David, Max holds on to the axe as he falls and the wolves maul him to death. Afterwards, the cops show up and wrap David up in a blanket and take him to safety. As the police van leaves, you can see David smiling.

==Examples in television==
In TV shows, producers may want to keep the ending of an episode a secret, even if it means keeping it from the stars themselves. In such a case, they will usually film more than one ending and not tell the cast which one will be used.
*''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'': To keep the ending to Season 1 a surprise, the crew shot multiple endings to the finale (Teri's death was the one they aired). A second ending had Teri live through the gunshot, and a third had her not being shot at all, with the family embracing each other after the long day was over.
*''[[D.I.E]]'': In original ending, Yue Sir ([[Roger Kwok]]) dies from a car accident and the audience wanted a happier ending so TVB created a new one in the style of [[mo lei tau]] comedy. In the new ending, the cast tries to stop the car accident that would kill Yue Sir from happening.
*''[[E.U. (TV series)|E.U.]]'': Due to the popularity of [[Michael Tse]]'s character Laughing Gor, who died in episode 22, an ending was shot where Laughing changes into his police uniform and talks. The ending never implied whether Laughing is alive or not and leaves it open for the audience to decide.
*''[[Green Wing]]'': In the final [[Green Wing Special|Special]], Guy and Mac are dragged into the air in an attempt to rescue Caroline, who has been dragged into the air by holding too many helium balloons. Whilst in the air, Mac tells Caroline he has something to tell her. After walking into the sea, Alan and Joanna are last seen hanging onto a buoy, waiting to drown. The actors wanted to use this ending but it was turned down. It was thought that this ending would have been used if a third series was being made.
*''[[Sex and the City]]'': In the series finale three endings were shot, in which [[Carrie Bradshaw]]'': (1) becomes engaged to [[Aleksandr Petrovsky]], (2) resumes her relationship with [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]], and (3) turns down both suitors and reaffirms her love for her friends.
*''[[The Simpsons]]'': In the two part episode "[[Who Shot Mr. Burns?]]" there was an alternative ending where it was revealed that the shooter of Mr. Burns was [[Waylon Smithers]] rather than [[Maggie Simpson]]. Shots of other characters shooting Mr. Burns were also fully animated, though no other complete ending scenes were produced. (These alternative shootings were intended to be intentionally 'leaked' as an elaborate practical joke on the media, but the producers could find no journalists who would take the bait.)
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'': At the end of Season 4, the audience learns that one of the main characters will die in the future. To keep the identity of this person a secret, three different versions of the final scene were shot. The canonical ending shows that Locke will die, while the alternative endings had Sawyer and Desmond die.
*''[[Total Drama]]'': For every season of this animated "reality show", 2 endings were filmed in which both finalists would win the competition. Every country Total Drama aired in got to decide which ending to air.
*''[[King of the Hill]]'': Some episodes have alternative endings (including the episode "The Company Man"), which can be found on the DVD Special Features.
*''[[Psych]]'': the episode "100 Clues", a parody of the board game Clue, had alternate endings where the fans decided  who was the culprit of murdering a guest at a party. Also, the episode "Right Turn or Left for Dead" involves the main character, Shawn, playing out an alternative ending to the episode in his head had events in the previous episode been slightly different.
*''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'': In the episode, "The Lady Killer," three endings were shot, each revealing a member of the A-Team. Because the producers wanted to keep this member a secret from everyone (including the cast members), they shot three endings and did not tell anyone who the member of the A-Team was. Out of Paige's alternate ending, Caleb's ending, and Toby's ending, the producers ended up showing Toby's.
*''[[Secrets and Lies (U.S. TV series)|Secrets and Lies]]'': In order to keep the real killer's identity secret until the end, several multiple endings were shot.

==Examples in video games==
{{Main|Types_of_fiction_with_multiple_endings#Video_games|l1=Video games with multiple endings}}
Many video games also have alternative endings. These endings are generally posed after completing the game in a harder difficulty, or taking a different route through the game's storyline.

==Examples in music==
*English rock band [[Marillion]]'s 1994 [[concept album]] ''[[Brave (Marillion album)|Brave]]'' is one of the very few examples of an alternative ending appearing in the medium of music. The vinyl edition of ''Brave'' featured a [[multisided record|double groove]] on side B of the second record, the final side of the album: depending on where the needle was dropped, the record would either play the standard track listing (the songs "The Great Escape" and "Made Again") or would instead play only an alternative version of "The Great Escape" with different lyrics, presenting an alternative, darker ending to the album's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marillion.com/music/albums/brave.htm |title=Marillion – 'Brave' |publisher=marillion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in literature==
* [[Felix Salten]]’s ''[[The Hound of Florence]]'' differs greatly in the original [[German language]] (''Der Hund von Florenz'') and in the [[English language|English]] translation. The German-language version ends in [[tragedy]]: the archduke stabs the dog to death, killing Lukas, and his body is disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=Der Hund von Florenz | location=Wien | publisher=Herz-Verlag | date=1923 | language=German | page=184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the English translation, a wholly new ending of six more pages has been written: Lukas survives, gets medication and is united with the [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Salten | first=Felix | title=The Hound of Florence: A Novel | date=1930 | location=New York | publisher=Simon and Schuster | translator=Huntley Paterson | others=Illustrated by Kurt Wiese | pages=230– }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently it is not known if the alternate ending is authorized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10562">'''Anthrax hoaxes''' involving the use of white powder or labels to falsely suggest the use of [[anthrax]] are frequently reported in the United States and globally. [[Hoax]]es have increased following the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], after which no genuine anthrax attacks have occurred. The [[FBI]] and [[United States Postal Inspection Service|U.S. postal inspectors]] have responded to thousands of "white powder events" and targets have included government offices, US embassies, banks and news organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/08/nation/na-anthrax-threats8|title=Anthrax hoaxes pile up, as does their cost|last=Drogin|first=Bob|date=8 March 2009|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Leonard A.|title=The Anthrax Letters: A Bioterrorism Expert Investigates the Attacks That Shocked America--Case Closed?|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-1-60239-715-6|url=http://leonardcole.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris released what he said was military-grade anthrax but was actually a harmless vaccine strain, but news coverage popularized the idea of anthrax among hoaxers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Jonathan B.|date=July 1999|title=Historical trends related to bioterrorism: An empirical analysis|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|publisher=CDC|volume=5|issue=4|url=http://origin.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol5no4/tucker.htm | pmid = 10458952|doi=10.3201/eid0504.990406|pmc=2627752|pages=498–504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/anthrax/Harris.asp?xpicked=3&amp;item=5|title=The Harris Hoax|work=ADL|accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these hoaxes, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] released guidance for public health authorities for handling bioterrorism threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1999|author1=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|title=Bioterrorism Alleging Use of Anthrax and Interim Guidelines for Management -- United States, 1998|journal=MMWR|publisher=CDC|volume=48|issue=4|pages=69–74|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056353.htm|pmid=10023627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prolific hoaxers was [[Clayton Waagner]], an [[anti-abortion]] activist who mailed hundreds of anthrax hoax letters to abortion clinics in late 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1695140.stm|title=US anthrax hoax suspect arrested|date=6 December 2001|work=BBC News|accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who was convicted in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-12-03-anthrax-hoax_x.htm|title=Man is convicted in anthrax hoax case|work=Associated Press|accessdate=10 December 2009 | date=3 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/12/10/waagner/index.html |title=The quiet fall of an American terrorist |last=Clarkson |first=Frederick |date=10 December 2003 |work=Salon |accessdate=10 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320083801/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/12/10/waagner/index.html |archivedate=20 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Sacramento man, Marc M. Keyser, admitted to sending around 120 packages marked as containing anthrax in October 2008, which he says was to highlight the lack of preparedness of the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] and public for an anthrax attack. He was convicted in September 2009 of five counts of hoaxes and making threats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/ourregion/story/2191521.html|title=Sacramentan convicted for sending anthrax hoax messages|last=Walsh|first=Denny|date=18 September 2009|work=Sacramento Bee|accessdate=10 December 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/wires/ap/us/2009/09/17/D9APEMG81_us_anthrax_scare/ |title=Calif. man convicted in nationwide anthrax scare |date=17 September 2009 |work=Salon |accessdate=10 December 2009 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to four years in prison in late April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsn.nti.org/gsn/nw_20100427_9709.php gsn.nti.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, white powder was mailed to temples of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) in [[Los Angeles California Temple|Los Angeles]] and [[Salt Lake Temple|Salt Lake City]], causing both to be closed temporarily while the mailings were investigated. There was speculation the mailings were in protest of the support by the Church for [[Proposition 8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27707413/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/white-powder-sent-mormon-temples/|title=White powder sent to Mormon temples|work=Associated Press|date=13 November 2008|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable recipients of anthrax hoax letters include journalist [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], author of ''[[Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War]]'', who received one at the ''New York Times'' offices in October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/15/opinion/in-america-living-with-fear.html|title=In America; Living With Fear|last=Herbert|first=Bob|date=15 October 2001|work=New York Times|accessdate=10 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 documentary was originally released in cinemas on 9 May. "Ben Hammott" relating to his alleged discoveries made in the vicinity of [[Rennes-le-Château]] since 1999; Burgess claims Ben Hammott would have found the treasure of [[Bérenger Saunière]]: a mummified corpse, which he believed were [[Mary Magdalene]]. In the film, Burgess interviews several people with alleged connections to the Priory of Sion, including a Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood. A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled ''Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus'' presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Howells, ''Inside The Priory of Sion: Revelations From The World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of The Bloodline of Jesus'' (Watkins Publishing, 2011). {{ISBN|1-78028-017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"In [[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]] Plantard claimed that the key to the mystery of Rennes-le-Château was that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children." Howells, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 March 2012 Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on [[Podcast]] interview (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php ''NightVision Radio'', entry dated Wednesday, March 21, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320110246/http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benhammott.com/hammott-statement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruce Burgess returned to the subject matter with ''The Bloodline of Christ'' that was shown in September 2013 on the [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday]] channel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36109">This is a chronicle of important events that took place under the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1636–1912) in what is now [[China]]. It spans from the death of his predecessor [[Hong Taiji]] (r. 1626–1643) in September 1643, to the emperor's own death on 5 February 1661, seven days into the eighteenth year of the Shunzhi [[Chinese era name|reign period]]. These dates do not correspond perfectly with the Shunzhi era itself, which started on 8 February 1644—on [[Chinese New Year|New Year's Day]] of the [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar year]] following the emperor's accession—and ended on 17 February 1662 (the last day of the 18th year of Shunzhi), more than one [[solar year]] after the emperor's death. The posthumous events related to the Shunzhi Emperor's burial and posthumous cult are also included.

===1643===
*'''September 21''': [[Hong Taiji]] dies after a successful seventeen-year reign during which the [[Qing]] became a major power in northeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975}} (p. 38), {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}} (p. 297), and {{harvnb|Gong|2010}} (p. 51) all place Hong Taiji's death on September 21 (Chongde 崇德 8.8.9). {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002}} (p. 74) gives the date as September 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His death threatens to split the Manchus just as they are preparing to attack the Ming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''September 26''': a [[Deliberative Council]] of princes and high officials is convened and decides that five-year-old Fulin, [[Hong Taiji]]'s ninth son, will succeed his father, but that Hong Taiji's half-brother [[Dorgon]] and [[Jirgalang]] will be his co-regents. This deal is a compromise between those who wanted to keep the throne in Hung Taiji's descent (the main candidate was Hong Taiji's eldest son [[Hooge (prince)|Hooge]]) and those who supported Dorgon.
*'''October 8''': at the age of six ''sui'', [[Fulin]] officially becomes [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fang|1943|p=255}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1644===
*'''February 8''': in [[Xi'an]], [[Li Zicheng]] founds the "[[Shun Dynasty|Great Shun]]" dynasty and proclaims himself King.
*'''February 17''': [[Jirgalang]] willingly yields control of all official matters to his co-regent [[Dorgon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''March 5''': Dorgon sends an amicable letter to Li Zicheng proposing that they "devise a plan in common to unite their forces" against the Ming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=304}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''March 17''': the Shun army occupies [[Taiyuan]] in [[Shanxi]].
*'''April 5''': Seeing the progress of rebel armies in north China, the Chongzhen Emperor issues a call for the immediate help of any military commandant in the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=641}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''April 24''': Li Zicheng enters [[Beijing]], the capital of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming empire]].
*'''April 25''': the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] commits suicide on a hill behind the [[Forbidden City]].
*'''April 26''': [[Wu Sangui]], a powerful Ming general, moves his army through [[Shanhai Pass]] (at the eastern end of the [[Great Wall]]) and marches toward Beijing in response to the emperor's distress call. When he hears that the capital has fallen, Wu returns to fortify Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu's departure from the fortified city of [[Xingcheng|Ningyuan]], where [[Battle of Ningyuan|Ming armies had defeated]] Qing founder [[Nurhaci]] in 1626, leaves all territory outside the Great Wall under Qing control.
*'''April 29''': the victorious Li Zicheng holds an audience with several thousand Ming officials outside the Donghua Gate of the Forbidden City. Assisted by his main [[Grand Secretary]] [[Niu Jinxing]] (牛金星), Li selected 92 officials to serve in the Shun government. The remaining literati are given over to Shun generals for punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=277–79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 5''': Wu Sangui routs an army led by Tang Tong, which Li Zicheng had despatched to attack Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 10''': Tang Tong's defeated army returns toward Shanhai Pass with reinforcements, but is again defeated by Wu Sangui. Wu takes the city of Yongping (永平) on the road to Beijing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"/&gt;
*'''May 13''': words reach the Qing capital of Shengjing that Li Zicheng has been brutalizing former Ming officials and the population of Beijing. Grand Secretary Fan Wencheng uses these news to argue for a Qing intervention in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=304}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon agrees to mount a military expedition to punish the rebels and occupy the Central Plains of China.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 14''': Dorgon leads the Qing "Grand Army" out of Shengjing and starts marching south toward the Great Wall.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt;
*'''May 18''': After the defeat of two of his armies a few days earlier, Li Zicheng decides to take Shanhai Pass himself: he leaves Beijing with an army of 60,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=296}}, note 212.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 20''': two of Wu Sangui's lieutenants arrive at Dorgon's camp at the [[Liao River]] carrying a message from their master asking the Manchus to help Wu defeat Li Zicheng's bandits and restore the Ming dynasty in return for "great profits" (大利).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=297}} (date of arrival at the Manchus' camp) and 300–1 (content of the letter).&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon sends a letter back to Wu Sangui offering.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Later that day the Manchus hear for the first time that the Chongzhen emperor was dead.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Still on that day, but as a result of earlier plans, small groups of Qing troops start to cross the Great Wall to distribute written proclamations announcing that the Qing army will not harm the population and will only kill Li Zicheng's bandits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=306–307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 25''': By that date, Li Zicheng's army was already camping in the outskirts of Shanhai Pass, near the Sha River a few kilometers west of the Shanhai Pass garrison; Wu Sangui sends his troops to confront him there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=309}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon receives a letter confirming that Wu Sangui has accepted to work for the Qing: he takes his army on a forced march toward Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 26''': having covered more than 150 kilometers in 24 hours, Dorgon's troops settle eight kilometers away from the Pass to rest for a few hours. They are awoken at midnight to continue marching.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt;
*'''May 27''': [[Battle of Shanhai Pass]]. At dawn Dorgon's main army reaches the gates of Shanhaiguan, where Dorgon receives Wu Sangui's formal surrender.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt; The armies deploy for battle: placed in the vanguard, Wu's troops are ordered to charge the Shun army, but they are unable to break the rebels' line and suffer heavy casualties. By the late afternoon, they are on the verge of defeat when a sandstorm starts blowing on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon chooses this moment to intervene: galloping around Wu's right flank, Qing bannermen destroys Li's left wing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"/&gt; The Shun army is defeated and retreats chaotically toward Yongping; thousands are massacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 28''': Li Zicheng retreats from Yongping toward Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu Sangui is named Prince Pingxi; his remaining troops shave their heads and join the Qing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}, note 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 31''': Li Zicheng reenters Beijing with his troops, which started to loot the capital.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 313"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 3''': as a "final gesture of defiance" after his decisive defeat at Shanhai Pass, Li Zicheng officially declares himself [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of the Great Shun at the Wuying dian 武英殿.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313}} (citation and date); {{harvnb|Gong|2010|p=74}} (Wuying dian).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 4''': after 42 days in Beijing, Li Zicheng sets the imperial palaces on fire and abandons the capital to flee toward the west.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 313"/&gt; The Beijing population massacres rebels who had not fled; nearly two thousand are killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 5''': led by Dorgon, Qing troops are welcomed into the capital; the Beijing population is shocked because it was expecting Wu Sangui to bring back the Ming heir apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=314–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 7''': Dorgon issues special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepts to cut their hair and to surrender, the officials will be allowed to stay at their post.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=416}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See June 25.)
*'''June 25''': because peasant rebellions quickly erupted around the capital in reaction to the haircutting order of June 7, Dorgon issues an edict saying that people will be allowed to arrange their hair the way they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 420–422. {{harvnb|Gong|2010|p=84}} gives the date as June 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''July 14''': Dorgon declares Beijing (which he calls "Yanjing" 燕京) the new capital of the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naquin|2000|p=289}} (gives the date as Shunzhi 1.6.11).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mukden]] (present-day Shenyang), which had been the Qing capital since 1634, is retained as a secondary capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rawski|1998|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''July 29''': at the request of his superior, German [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]] petitions the Qing throne, claiming that the Jesuit calendar is more accurate than the other ones available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=857}}, note 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''October 19''': the six-year-old Emperor arrives in Beijing through the Zhengyang Gate, where he is welcomed by Dorgon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=857}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''October 31''': the Jesuit Johann Adam Schall von Bell is made Director of the Bureau of Astronomy (欽天監) after a test of the Jesuits' prediction for an eclipse on September 1 proved to be more accurate than those of the court's official astronomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 857–58, note 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''November 8''': a formal ritual of imperial enthronement is held for Fulin, during which the merits of Dorgon as regent are compared to those of the [[Duke of Zhou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 858 and 860.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon's title is raised from "Prince Regent" to "Uncle Prince Regent" (Shufu shezheng wang 叔父攝政王), in which ''shufu'' (''ecike'' in Manchu) represents a rank higher than that of imperial prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 860–61, and p. 861, note 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''November 11''': Hooge is reinstated to the status of [[Prince Su]]; Dorgon's brother Ajige is named Prince Ying; Jirgalang is demoted from "Prince Regent" to "Assistant Uncle Prince Regent" (Fu zheng shuwang 輔政叔王).&lt;ref name="Wakeman 1985 861"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=861}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1645===
*'''January 20''': the court orders that land without owners be reclaimed and given to Bannermen (圈地). In fact even land that has owners and occupants is confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gong|2010|pp=109–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (Say more.)
*'''June 16''': it is declared that all official documents will heretofore refer to Dorgon as "Imperial Uncle Prince Regent" (''Huang shufu shezheng wang'' 皇叔父攝政王).&lt;ref name="Wakeman 1985 861"/&gt; Court ceremonies are also reformed to elevate Dorgon's ritual position even higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=862}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 17''': the Prince of Fu, who had been reigning as the "Hongguang Emperor" since June of the previous year, is captured near Nanjing by Qing forces led by [[Liu Liangzuo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=666}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Perilsofpauline.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1914 ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|Perils of Pauline]]'', which popularized the term '''cliffhanger''' in the medium of film.]]

A '''cliffhanger''', or '''cliffhanger ending''', is a [[plot device]] in [[fiction]] which features a main character in a precarious or difficult dilemma, or confronted with a shocking revelation at the end of an episode&lt;ref&gt;Some are placed before commercial breaks&lt;/ref&gt; of serialized fiction. A cliffhanger is hoped to ensure the audience will return to see how the characters resolve the dilemma.

Some serials end with the caveat "To Be Continued…" or "The End?"  In [[movie serials]] and [[television series]], the following episode sometimes begins with a [[recap sequence]].

==History==
The cliffhanger plot device dates back to the famous medieval [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary]] work, the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. The [[framing device]] has [[Scheherazade]] narrating a [[List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights|series of stories]] to King [[Shahryār]] for 1,001 nights, with each night ending on a cliffhanger, in order to save herself from execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Snodgrass|first1=Mary Ellen|title=Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire.|date=2009|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=1438119062|page=292|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LXyyYs2cRDcC&amp;pg=PT292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry E.|title=Gender in History: Global Perspectives|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444351729|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8tPlht9lyAC&amp;pg=PT86|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers later appeared as an element of the Victorian [[serial (literature)|serial novel]] that emerged in the 1840s, with many associating the form with [[Charles Dickens]], a pioneer of the serial publication of narrative fiction.&lt;ref name="Dickens"&gt;{{cite news|title=The curious staying power of the cliffhanger.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|publisher=The New Yorker|date=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040341/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/07/30/tune-in-next-week|archivedate=1 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"&gt;Grossman, Jonathan H. (2012). Charles Dickens's Networks: Public Transport and the Novel. p. 54. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s it had become a staple part of the sensation serials, while the term itself originated with [[Thomas Hardy]] in 1873 when a protagonist from one of his serials, Henry Knight, was left hanging off a cliff.&lt;ref name="Hardy"/&gt;

===Victorian serials and term origin===

Cliffhangers became prominent with the serial publication of narrative fiction, pioneered by [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grossman"/&gt; Printed episodically in magazines, Dickens’s cliffhangers triggered desperation in his readers. Writing in the ''New Yorker'', Emily Nussbaum captured the anticipation of those waiting for the next installment of Dickens' ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'';

{{quote|In 1841, Dickens fanboys rioted on the dock of New York Harbor, as they waited for a British ship carrying the next installment, screaming, “Is little Nell dead?.&lt;ref name="Dickens"/&gt;}} 

The impact of Dickens' serial publications saw the cliffhanger become a staple part of the sensation serials by the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Rob (2014). "Serialization in Popular Culture". p. 41. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The term "cliffhanger" is considered to have originated with the serialised version of [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'' (which was published in ''[[William Tinsley (publisher)|Tinsley's Magazine]]'' between September 1872 and July 1873) in which Henry Knight, one of the protagonists, is left hanging off a [[cliff]].&lt;ref name="Hardy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diniejko,|first1=Andrzej|title=Thomas Hardy's A Pair of Blue Eyes As a Cliffhanger with a Post-Darwinian Message|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=27 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202032925/http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/hardy/diniejko6.html|archivedate=2 February 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serial media==
Cliffhangers were especially popular in 1920s and 1930s [[Serial film|serials]] when [[movie theater]]s filled the cultural [[niche market|niche]] later primarily occupied by [[television]]. Cliffhangers are often used in [[television series]], especially [[soap opera]]s that end each episode on a cliffhanger. Prior to the early 1980s, season-ending cliffhangers were rare on U.S. television. The first such season-ender on U.S. TV was in the [[comedy]] send-up of soap operas ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' in 1978. Several [[Australia]]n [[soap opera]]s, which went off air over summer, such as ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'', ''[[The Restless Years]]'', and ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'', ended each year with major and much publicized catastrophe, such as a character being shot in the final seconds of the year's closing episode.

Cliffhangers are commonly used in Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]]. In contrast to American [[superhero comics]], Japanese manga are much more frequently written with cliffhangers, often with each volume or issue. This is particularly the case with [[shōnen manga]], especially those published by ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', such as ''[[Dragon Ball]]'', ''[[Shaman King]]'', and ''[[One Piece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mylonas|first1=Eric|title=Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors|date=2004|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0761546758|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cHxLR1C8JBEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brandweek, Volume 47|journal=[[Brandweek]]|date=January 2006|volume=47|page=79|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bplaAAAAYAAJ|publisher=Adweek L.P.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its original run, [[Doctor Who]] was written in a serialised format that usually ended each episode within a serial on a cliffhanger. In the first few years of the show, the final episodes of each serial would have a cliffhanger that would lead into the next serial. [[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire Part One]] is notable for having a cliffhanger that involved [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] literally hanging from a cliff. This has been frequently criticised by fans for being a pointless cliffhanger, but script editor [[Andrew Cartmel]] gave an explanation for the reasoning of it in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|title=A Brief History Of Time (Travel): Dragonfire|author=|date=|website=www.shannonsullivan.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150910200758/http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/7g.html|archivedate=2015-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffhangers were rare on American television before 1980, as television networks preferred the flexibility of airing episodes in any order. The phenomenal success of the 1980 "[[Who shot J.R.?]]" third season-ending cliffhanger of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', and the "[[Who Done It (Dallas)|Who Done It]]" fourth-season episode that finally solved the mystery, contributed to the cliffhanger becoming a common storytelling device on television.&lt;ref name="meisler19950507"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/07/arts/television-when-j-r-was-shot-the-cliffhanger-was-born.html?pagewanted=all | title=TELEVISION; When J.

The two main ways for cliffhangers to keep readers/viewers coming back is to either involve characters in a suspenseful, possibly life-threatening situation, or to feature a sudden shocking revelation. Cliffhangers are also used to leave open the possibility of a character being killed off due to the actor not continuing to play the role.

Cliffhangers are also sometimes deliberately inserted by writers who are uncertain whether a new series or season will be commissioned, in the hope that viewers will demand to know how the situation is resolved. Such was the case with the second season of ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', which ended in a cliffhanger similar to the first season with a high degree of uncertainty about the fate of the protagonist, but the cliffhanger could not save the show from being canceled, resulting in the unresolved ending.

The cliffhanger has become a genre staple (especially in comics, due to the multi-part storylines becoming the norm instead of self-contained stories). To such a degree, in fact, that series writers no longer feel they have to be immediately resolved, or even referenced, when the next episode is shown,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |title=The IT Crowd: Tramps Like Us |publisher=Noise to Signal |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311215959/http://www.noisetosignal.org/2008/12/the-it-crowd-tramps-like-us |archivedate=2013-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; variously because the writer didn't feel it was "a strong enough opener,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |title=…and we like tramps! « Why, That\’s Delightful! |publisher=Whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324010610/http://whythatsdelightful.wordpress.com/2008/12/05/and-we-like-tramps/#comment-9567 |archivedate=2012-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "couldn't be bothered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Falk |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/1014/1014434_one_of_the_it_crowd.html |title=One of the IT Crowd &amp;#124; Manchester Evening News - menmedia.co.uk |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavily serialized television drama ''[[True Blood]]'' has become notorious for cliffhangers. Not only do the seasons conclude with cliffhangers, but almost every episode finishes at a cliffhanger directly after or during a highly dramatic moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |title='True Blood' Finale Sets Up More Cliffhangers |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020081054/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/true-blood/true-blood-finale-sets-up-more-31189.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commercial break]]s can be a nuisance to [[screenwriter|script writer]]s because some sort of incompleteness or minor cliffhanger should be provided before each to stop the viewer from changing channels during the commercial break. Sometimes a series ends with an unintended cliffhanger caused by a very abrupt ending without a satisfactory [[dénouement]], but merely assuming that the viewer will assume that everything sorted itself out.

Sometimes a movie, book, or season of a television show will end with the defeat of the main villain before a second, evidently more powerful villain makes a brief appearance (becoming the villain of the next film). Occasionally an element other than a villain is also used to tease at a sequel.

'''Diminished value''', Diminution in Value, or commonly referred to as "DV" are the terms generally used to describe the economic loss in a property's value as a result of having been damaged. Diminished Value (DV) is often associated with vehicles that have been damaged, however, it is applicable to other property of value including collectibles such as jewelry, artwork, etc. For the purposes herein, reference will involve the loss in value of a damaged automobile where the term is often applied.

Unlike "depreciation", which is an anticipated and predictable loss in value over time, ‘Inherent Diminished Value’ is a loss in value due to a specific, sudden and unexpected negative occurrence. Diminished value of an automobile following an accident may occur in one of three ways (or a combination thereof):

(1) repair-related diminished value;

(2) Immediate diminished value; and

(3) inherent diminished value.

'''Repair-related diminished value''' is the loss of value due to the inability to perfectly repair the vehicle, so it is worth less after repairs than it was before the wreck. '''Immediate Diminished Value''' – The difference in resale value of a vehicle immediately before damage has occurred and immediately after damage has occurred (prior to repair).  As courts are rarely the chosen venue for recovery of property damage, the standard of "Immediate Diminished Value" is rarely employed in resolving Property Damage claims. This also refers to a loss of value caused by the insurer's direct involvement in the claim adjustment in which the insurer exerts control over the repairs and repairs are incomplete, insufficiently performed, or otherwise restore the vehicle to less than the standard condition.

'''Inherent Diminished Value''' - Assumes optimal repair quality has been achieved and is defined as the amount by which the resale value of a repaired vehicle has been reduced simply because the subject vehicle now has a significant damage history. This is the most widely recognized and accepted form of Diminished Value. It is also the basis upon which any supplemental form of Diminished Value would be added. A common "Supplemental" form of Diminished Value is "Repair Related Diminished Value".

Usually, a frame or structurally damaged vehicle cannot be re-sold as a "[[certified pre-owned]] vehicle."

The true measure of a damaged vehicle's inherent loss in value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. The standard rule as to establishing a value on late model vehicles would be: 20-25% behind book (Black Book, KBB, NADA) and utilize actual sales results, and not on advertised prices.

While some may claim Diminished Value (DV) is subjective and based upon perception or speculation, the old adage "perception becomes reality' applies and as such Diminution in Value is real simply because, for the most part, no reasonable and prudent person is willing to pay the same price for a vehicle with a history of damage as they would for one never having been damaged. Retailers often offer discounts for scratches and dents on appliances, electronics and dented canned goods; it is, therefore, reasonable that the value of a damaged motor vehicle will suffer a lessening in value.

Additional factors may be taken into consideration in evaluating the loss in value of a damaged and repaired vehicle and may include, but not be limited to: the vehicle itself (i.e. rare collectible, originality, market desirability etc.), the vehicle’s pre-loss condition, severity of the sustained damages (i.e. frame damage, flood, fire etc.), the subject vehicle’s history (i.e. one owner, prior damage/repair, death of occupants etc.), quality and thoroughness of the performed repairs, (i.e. quality of parts, materials, workmanship, etc.) and additional value considerations including, but not limited to values associated with pre-owned certification programs.etc.

Auto insurance companies may not readily recognize or offer to pay for diminished value. Each state may have differing opinions of DV. Example; The state of Georgia allows the insured party (the first-party Policyholder) to make a claim for their remaining economic loss for DV from their own insurance company while the neighboring state of Florida does not. Most states, however, allow the victim of another's negligence (third-party) to make a DV claim from the at-fault party.

The length of time to collect Diminished Value will vary depending upon each state's statute of limitations for first party (contractual) claims and third-party (restatement of tort) claims.

==Diminished Value Appraisal==
{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}
A diminished value [[wikt:appraisal|appraisal]] evaluates the difference in value of a [[motor vehicle]] after a collision repair. Reports are usually compiled by an Auto Appraisal Expert experienced in the field of DV and who may provide expert testimony for Appraisals, Arbitration, Mediation or Litigation in a court of law. This Assessment report is used when filing or disputing a diminished value claim against another party and/or an [[insurance]] company. The report measures a damaged vehicle’s inherent loss in value. The diminished value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. In most cases even if the repair was done expertly, the value of the automobile will still be considerably less after a loss. When consumers find that a vehicle has been in an accident, most consumers will never pay the same price for a repaired vehicle as compared to one with no loss history.

Some reports include an assessment of the damage done to a motor vehicle, the quality of the performed repair, the market value of the vehicle before and after the accident.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diminishedvalue.law/info-center/how-to-prove-diminished-value-of-a-vehicle/|title=Coffey Trial Law - Diminished Value|website=www.diminishedvalue.law|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are no set rules for measuring diminished value, and since every vehicle loses value differently, a one size fits all formula would be fundamentally inaccurate.

==Regional==
Recognition of concept of diminished value varies from country to country {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===United States===
Some states' statutes acknowledge diminished value and provide the ability for consumers to collect first party claims of DV from their own insurance companies under their own policies. Most states allow the consumer to collect third party claims from the at-fault driver's insurance company. Some states recognize liability for third party claims but not first party claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diminution-of-value-in-all-50-states.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
In Georgia, vehicle owners can collect DV against their own policy.

=== Florida ===
Diminished value is part of the Florida Standard Civil Jury Instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Standard Jury Instructions - Civil|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/civ_jury_instructions/instructions.shtml#500|publisher=State of Florida|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diminished value [[case law]] in Florida is based primarily on two cases.

* Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company, '''819 So.2d 732''' (Florida 2002).
The ability to receive diminished value [[financial compensation]] from an at-fault driver for their negligence was decided by the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in the Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company case.  After Siegle insurance companies are able to exclude responsibility for the payment of diminished value to the vehicle that they insure through the language in the policy.
* McHale vs. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. '''409 So.2d 238''' (1982)
The [[Florida Third District Court of Appeal]], upheld that the correct measure of damages is the cost of repair plus any reduction in the value of the vehicle. The Court also directed that proving the reduction in value is the burden of the [[Plaintiff]] bringing the claim.

=== Louisiana ===
Diminished value is provided in [http://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=408380 Louisiana Revised Statute 9:2800.17].  The vehicle owner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the fair market value would be less than its value before the vehicle was damaged.

===Washington===
On July 15, 2014, a policyholder in Washington state filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of Pierce County seeking diminished value insurance benefits under their automobile insurance policies.  The insurance company filed a notice to remove the lawsuit to federal district court on August 20, 2014.  The case is titled ''Johnston v. United Services Automobile Ass'n''.

===Canada===
The ability to recover damages for accelerated depreciation varies from Province to Province.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In [[British Columbia]], law recognizes this loss as a recoverable damage and quantify the claim based on the diminished value at the time the collision occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20c%20--/court%20rules%20act%20rsbc%201996%20c.%2080/05_regulations/19_168_2009%20supreme%20court%20civil%20rules/168_2009_02.xml Rule 11-2 BC Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rules addressing the admissibility of depreciation reports in court vary by jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  For example, in British Columbia, Canada, [http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20C%20--/Court%20Rules%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%2080/05_Regulations/19_168_2009%20Supreme%20Court%20Civil%20Rules/168_2009_02.xml#part11 the BC Supreme Court requires such reports to comply with Rule 11].

'''''Enigmarelle''''' was a fake humanoid [[automaton]], in fact with a person concealed inside, which was exhibited as a scientific and technical curiosity around 1905 in the US and Europe, chiefly in theaters. Enigmarelle was claimed to be able to perform several extraordinary tasks, which it demonstrated in performances: these included walking, riding a bicycle, and writing its name on a blackboard.

== Presentation==
Enigmarelle was shown in the US and then in parts of Europe, in [[vaudeville]] theaters and circuses. The booking agent, an American named Frederick J. Ireland, was represented at these appearances as the creator and owner of the automaton.

Enigmarelle was a large automaton and was in fact operated by a human concealed within its body, although the precise operating mechanisms are not known. The operator is believed to have been a performer who had had both his legs [[amputation|amputated]] and who went by the name of Alba W. Root, and who also performed as a bicycle acrobat using leg [[prosthesis|prostheses]]. &lt;!-- is believed to be Alba W. Root, who lost both legs in a train accident as a boy. Enigmarelle was designed to exploit this disability, with removable legs to "prove" its mechanical nature. --&gt;

Enigmarelle was the subject of a short documentary film in 1905&lt;ref group="P"&gt;{{cite web |first=Alan |last=Goble |title=Enigmarelle the Wonderful Automaton - Film / Movie |url=http://www.citwf.com/film423590.htm |website=Complete Index To World Film |access-date=2016-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a detailed "scientific" description with three photos in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1906.&lt;ref group="C"&gt;{{cite news |language=en|title=A Clever Mechanical and Electrical Automaton |periodical=Scientific American |volume=94 |issue=2 |date=1906-01-13 |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-clever-mechanical-and-electrical/|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mentioned in some modern publications on automatons.&lt;ref group="P"&gt;{{cite book|language=en|author1=Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume|title=Clockwork Music|location=Australia|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1973|pages=334|isbn=9780047890048|quotation=Another and equally spectacular 'android' was that exhibited at the London Hippodrome in 1905. Called Enigmarelle, this seven-foot high figure possessed incredible abilities. It would walk on to the stage, write its name in somewhat backward-sloping manuscript upon a blackboard, and then ride a bicycle in a circle. Its head was of wax, its feet of steel and its legs of wood and iron. The motive power comprised no less than seven motors-three being spring, and four electric which drew their power from wet-cell batteries concealed in the trunk. Unbuttoning its waistcoat revealed a mass of wheelwork and wires, levers, and cranks. Unfortunately, within all this trumpery there beat no mechanical heart, but that of a real, live man.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name ===
The name ''Enigmarelle'' seems to be a [[portmanteau]] of the French words ''énigme'' (enigma) and ''marelle'' ([[hopscotch]]), but the creators of the machine were English speakers, so there is no reason to suppose a French portmanteau is the true origin of the name.

''' Event management''' is the application of [[project management]] to the creation and development of large-scale events such as [[festival]]s, conferences, ceremonies, weddings, formal parties, concerts, or [[convention (meeting)|conventions]]. It involves studying the brand, identifying its [[target audience]], devising the event concept, and coordinating the technical aspects before actually launching the event.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsborg, G.C.; B Miller, D Breiter, BJ Reed &amp; A Rushing (eds), ''Professional meeting management: Comprehensive strategies for meetings, conventions and events'', 2008, 5th ed, Kendall/Hunt Publishing, Dubuque, Iowa. {{ISBN|0-7575-5212-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of planning and coordinating the event is usually referred to as '''event planning''' and which can include budgeting, scheduling, site selection, acquiring necessary [[License|permit]]s, coordinating transportation and parking, arranging for speakers or entertainers, arranging decor, event security, [[catering]], coordinating with third party vendors, and emergency plans. Each event is different in its nature so process of planning &amp; execution of each event differs on basis of type of event. 

The events industry now includes events of all sizes from the [[Olympics]] down to business breakfast meetings. Many industries, [[charitable organization]]s, and interest groups hold events in order to market themselves, build business relationships, raise money, or celebrate achievement.

==Marketing tool==

Event management might be a tool for [[Marketing strategy|strategic marketing]] and communication, used by companies of every size. Companies can benefit from promotional events as a way to communicate with current and potential customers.  For instance, these advertising-focused events can occur as press conferences, promotional events, or product launches.

Event managers may also use traditional news media in order to target their audience, hoping to generate media coverage which will reach thousands or millions of people. They can also invite their audience to their events and reach them at the actual event.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Event manager==

The '''event manager''' is the person who plans and executes the event, taking responsibility for the creative, technical, and logistical elements.  This includes overall event design, brand building, marketing and communication strategy, [[audio-visual]] production, script writing, logistics, budgeting, negotiation, and client service.

==Event venue==
An event venue may be an onsite or offsite location. The event manager is usually not responsible for operations at rented event or entertainment venues, but will monitor all aspects of the event on site. Some of the tasks listed in the introduction may pass to the venue, but usually at a cost.

Corporate event managers book event venues to host corporate meetings, conferences, networking events, trade shows, product launches, team building retreats or training sessions in a more tailored environment.

== Sustainability ==
[[Sustainable event management]] (also known as event greening) is the process used to produce an event with particular concern for environmental, economic, and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/management-standards/iso20121.htm ISO 20121 - Sustainable events]", ISO (www.iso.org), retrieved 2014-30-05&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability in event management incorporates socially and environmentally responsible decision making into the planning, organization and implementation of, and participation in, an event. It involves including sustainable development principles and practices in all levels of event organization, and aims to ensure that an event is hosted responsibly. It represents the total package of interventions at an event, and needs to be done in an integrated manner. Event greening should start at the inception of the project, and should involve all the key role players, such as clients, organizers, venues, sub-contractors, and suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.panda.org/get_involved/live_green/at_the_office/green_events/|title=Organizing a Green Event|publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

[[Event management software]] companies provide [[event planning|event planners]] with software tools to handle many common activities such as delegate registration, hotel booking, travel booking, or allocation of exhibition floorspace.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

A recent trend in event technology is the use of mobile apps for events. Event mobile apps have a range of uses. They can be used to hold relatively static information such as the agenda, speaker biographies, and general FAQs. They can also encourage audience participation and engagement through interactive tools such as live voting/polling, submitting questions to speakers during Q&amp;A, or building live interactive "word clouds". Mobile event apps can also be used by event organisers as a means of communication. Organisers can communicate with participants through the use of alerts, notifications, and push messages. They can also be used to collect feedback from the participants through the use of surveys in app. Going a step further, some mobile event apps can also help participants to engage with each other, with sponsors, and with the organisers with built-in networking functionality.

==Education==
There are an increasing number of [[universities]] which offer courses in event management, including diplomas and graduate degrees. In addition to these academic courses, there are many associations and societies that provide courses on the various aspects of the [[industry]]. Study includes organizational skills, technical knowledge, [[public relations]], [[marketing]], [[advertising]], [[catering]], [[logistics]], [[Interior design|decor]], glamor identity, human relations, study of law and licenses, risk management, budgeting, and the study of allied industries like television, other media, and several other areas. Certification can be acquired from various sources to obtain designations such as 
*Certified Trade Show Marketer (CTSM)
*Certified in Exhibition Management (CEM)
*Global Certification in Meeting Management (CMM)
*[[Certified Meeting Professional]] (CMP)
*Global Certificate in Event Design (EDC) 
*Certified Special Event Professional (CSEP) 
*Certified Quality Event Planner (CQEP)

A '''false ending''' has two contexts: in literature, film and video games it is a narrative device where the plot seems to be heading to its conclusion, but in reality, there's still more to the story; in a musical composition, however, it is a complete stop of the work or song for one or more seconds before continuing.

The presence of a false ending can be anticipated through a number of ways: the medium itself might betray that it isn't the true ending (i.e. it's only halfway into a book or a song, a film's listed running time hasn't fully elapsed, only half the world has been explored in a video game, etc.), making only stories with indeterminate running length or a multi-story structure able to pull this off effectively; another indicator is the feeling that too much of the story is incomplete when the false ending comes, making it feel like there has to be more.

==Film==

In ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' , it seems like the criminal case that the movie revolves around is completely closed with no loose ends until one of the witnesses admits that she lied about important details to give more importance towards the trial of the people who raped her, exposing a cover-up conspiracy. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', the director keeps using editing techniques that are indicative of endings in scenes that could be used as such, but continues until the movie finally ends. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' has two false endings. Another example is in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', where, at a very climatic stage in the film, the screen fades away and says ''[[Cliffhanger|To be continued]]'', which is then followed by the word "Immediately."

Some movies come to a formal ending, followed by the rolling of the credits, which is almost universally used to indicate that the film has ended, only to have the actors reappear in one or more [[mid-credits scene]]s. In comedy films, these sequences may be [[blooper]]s or [[outtake]]s. In other types of films, the mid-credit scenes may continue the narrative set out in the movie. The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] movies have become notorious for this, in some cases featuring a mid-credits scene and an end-credits scene in the same movie.

In the police comedy ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' (2007), two police officers realize that a cult is controlling their town. After the two officers defeat the head of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance and his members, who have been causing problems in the town, the pair are celebrating their success at the police station, and the movie appears to be wrapping up. Then a surviving member of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance enters the station and shoots an old musket, which triggers an old-fashioned mine.

==Television==

==Video games==
Some examples in video games include ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' and ''[[Wild ARMs]]''. Both involve confrontations with the major antagonists at what seems like their final lairs, but instead a crisis occurs and the story continues. A third is in ''[[Naval Ops: Warship Gunner]]'', upon sinking the ''Druna Skass'' a second time (Which can only happen if the player plays though the game again, as the game resets itself to the beginning if you sink it once), the player is greeted by another supership, that looks just like the ''Druna Skass''. Yet another example is the [[survival horror]] game ''[[Obscure II]]'', in which the player must wait until the credits roll to their conclusion before gameplay resumes.

[[Role-playing video game]]s are notorious for having such plot devices. It usually involves the game's main antagonist being defeated, only for a previously mentioned character to be revealed as the "real" villain. One example is ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', in which the main character is apparently about to have a boss fight with the former villain Zant, but Zant reveals he has been working for another Villain.
Another example is "[[Kid Icarus: Uprising]]" where after you defeat Medusa, credits roll but are quickly interrupted by Hades, the villain for the rest of the game.

In video games, it is difficult to use the false ending device effectively. Nevertheless, in the hands of a skilled designer, there are several methods that allow it to be done. In several video games, such as those with multiple playable characters and story lines, the game may appear to end after defeating a difficult boss, or clearing what appears to be the "Final" level, complete with credits, an [[Closing credits|outro]], and a return to the start screen. These endings are different from bad endings, as everything may appear to be resolved. However, fulfilling conditions such as clearing all the storylines, reloading the save file, or reaching the "ending" in a [[New Game+]] mode may give the player the option to continue on to the real ending.

An example of this is ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', and its sequel ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]''. In the former, while there are six stories to play, only the main character's, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character) | Sonic's]] is the most complete. The other characters' stories are simply side-stories. However, if "all" of the stories are completed, a final story appears that wraps up the game and acts as the "true" ending. In the latter, there are two stories to play, one for the heroes, and one for the villains. Of note is the plot device is hidden in a false [[Chaos Emerald]] being used that would destroy the space colony in which the villain [[Doctor Eggman]] is using as a base. It is at first implied that Eggman took the false Emerald, but in reality, when the last story is played, again, after the two normal stories are completed, a true conclusion is offered.

Another example could be the survival horror game ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', where, depending on your choice, you get to play with one of the two characters and get a certain ending for one of them to later discover, when you finish playing the second path with the second character, you fight the real final boss and the "true" ending (That may vary depending of which character you have chosen first) is shown. The main difference between both of the "true" endings are that places and times are exchanged, as well as the final dialogue from the game.

''The Consequence'', the second Kidman DLC for 2014's ''[[The Evil Within]]'', features a secret false ending in a similar manner to those shown in the ''Resident Evil'' franchise. At one point, Juli Kidman encounters the brain of the game's main antagonist, Ruben Victoriano, sealed [[Brain in a jar|inside a glass container]] hooked up to the STEM system in Beacon Hospital. Should the player choose to shoot the container and break it, the game cuts to black, then begins the credits sequence, cutting short on a postcard depicting Juli, Joseph and Sebastian on a postcard, before promptly returning to the game as Kidman exclaims "What the fuck?!", indicating the whole sequence was a hallucination.

==Music==
False endings are a known device in classical music. [[Josef Haydn]] was fond of them, for example inducing applause at the wrong place in the finales of his [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Fourth_movement|String Quartet, Op. 33 No. 2]] (nicknamed "The Joke")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2009/may/29/haydn-playful-composer-tom-service |title=Haydn composed existential comedy |first=Tom |last=Service |authorlink=Tom Service |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Symphony No. 90 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 90]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sarahhicksconductor.com/web/buzz_details.aspx?ItemId=554184 |title= Haydn’s Head Fake |date=16 May 2010 |first=Sarah |last=Hicks |authorlink=Sarah Hicks |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first movement of [[Prokoviev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] contains false endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/composition/4176 |title=Symphony No. 1 in D major, Op. 25, "Classical" |first=Richard |last=Rodda |website=[[Kennedy Center]] |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unsourced|section|date=February 2018}}
In music, a number of [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] [[song]]s use false endings in which the music is arranged so that the song appears to be coming to its ending (e.g., reaching a final [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] on the [[tonic (music)|chord of the home key]] and then stopping), but then the music recommences. Examples include [[The Rascals]]' "[[Good Lovin']]"; [[The Four Tops]]' "[[Bernadette (Four Tops song)|Bernadette]]", "[[White Room]]" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]; "[[The Peace!]]" by [[Morning Musume]]; "[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]]; "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]" by [[The Beatles]]; "[[Monday, Monday]]" by [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]; and "[[But You Know I Love You]]" by [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]]. Another notable example of a musical false ending is "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]" by [[Bryan Adams]] - because the original song was six and a half minutes long, the false ending became the end of the single/video edit of the song (the album version had a fadeout ending).

In addition, several other songs have also had false endings, such as "[[Angels (Amy Grant song)|Angels]]" by [[Amy Grant]], a #1 Christian hit in 1984. Another example is "[[Keep on Dancing (The Gentrys song)|Keep On Dancing]]", a 1965 Top 10 hit for the group [[The Gentrys]] from Memphis, Tennessee. In both songs, there is a pause of two seconds before the music starts all over again. Also, "[[When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)]]" by [[The Beach Boys]], has a sudden stop and resumes 1 second later as the band counts numbers of years of age until the song fades, counting from 19 to 30. The [[Alice in Chains]] track "Rain When I Die" has a fade-out false ending lasting about 20 seconds, then the music comes back, and then it fades once more, thus providing the real ending. "[[Weather with You]]" by [[Crowded House]] appears to be ending and then another small instrumental is followed by a final chorus.

'''Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga''' was a planned co-headlining [[concert tour]] by American rapper [[Kanye West]] and singer [[Lady Gaga]]. For the tour, which would have supported West's fourth album ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' (2008) and Gaga's ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' EP (2009), the pair conceived a production that would unite their different musical audiences. The tour was scheduled to run from November 2009 to January 2010, but was canceled after public controversy regarding [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards#Kanye West controversy and debated incidents|West's interruption]] of [[Taylor Swift]]'s Best Female Video speech at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Shortly after the cancellation, Gaga embarked on her own tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]], while West took a break from his career.

==Background and development==
[[File:LadyGaga-EqualityMarch-Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaga only agreed to tour with West under the condition that everything "remain gay".]]
In June 2009, West announced on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' he would be touring with Gaga, but she would not perform as an opening act. "She's talented and so incredible that she's not an opening act", he said. "We're doing it together, with no opening act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West To Tour With Lady Gaga|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 9, 2009|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210202610/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618664/20090813/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Promises 'Groundbreaking' Tour With Kanye West|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=August 13, 2009|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her [[gay]] fans. "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine, "my music is gay. My show is gay. And I love that it's gay. And I love my gay fans and they're all going to be coming to our show. And it's going to ''remain'' gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|title=The Lady Is a Vamp|last=Stein|first=Joshua David|author2=Michelson, Noah|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|publisher=Joe Landry|page=2|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=August 9, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309102723/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|archivedate=March 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour's stage was designed by Gaga and West as a [[wiktionary:traverse|traverse]]; "Instead of being on just one end of the arena, the stage traverses the entire arena", Gaga noted. "It's not really in-the-round; it's more of a runway." The concept of the tour was to feature the performers on opposite ends of the stage, with Gaga's end representing "home and humble beginnings" and West's end representing "the fame", with the two fighting for each other's positions throughout the show. West would perform his singles, Gaga would perform hers, and then the duo would perform several duets.&lt;ref name="Aswad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West/ Lady Gaga's Fame Kills Tour Canceled|last=Aswad|first=Jem|author2=Dinh, James|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=MTV News. Viacom|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204025130/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 4, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaga said she enjoyed designing Fame Kills with West, calling themselves "creative kindreds."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"/&gt; She explained that they did not plan to tour for themselves, but rather for "everybody else"; the goal of the tour would have been to bring two different groups of fans and music enthusiasts together. "I make pop music and Kanye's fans love pop music because he has changed what [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] means", she said. "For me, the tour is more about just bringing people together and having a big dance party. The show is a celebration of creativity, art, fashion and choreography." She also noted that West showed her a lot during the creative planning of the show, such as one instance where Gaga wanted to put side panels on the stage that would have obstructed the view for some fans. "He was like, 'I'm not selling a ticket to a fan who can't see the show,' and he's right", she said.&lt;ref name="Aswad"/&gt;

A promotional video for the tour was released in September 2009. West posted the video on his blog accompanied by the text, "What happened to all the rock stars? The fame killed them!" The 30-second clip features slow-motion footage of a topless Gaga being carried by a man presumed to be West. Daniel Kreps from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had "no idea what [the text in the video] has to do with the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out as we approach the tour's launch."&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-gets-nsfw-in-promo-for-joint-tour-with-kanye-west-20090923|title=Lady Gaga Gets NSFW in Promo For Joint Tour With Kanye West|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=September 23, 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|title=Nude Lady GaGa 'Fame Kills' tour promo released|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2014|work=[[NME]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091358/http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanyecolorconcert.jpg|thumb|West ''(pictured)'' was criticized for his interruption of [[Taylor Swift]]'s VMA speech. The incident reportedly put the fate of the Fame Kills tour in question.]]
Following singer [[Taylor Swift]]'s win for the music video "[[You Belong with Me]]" at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]], West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and declared that singer [[Beyoncé]] deserved the award for her "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" video. He declared, "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm going to let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|title=Kanye West interrupts Taylor Swift's VMAs moment: What was he thinking?|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|date=September 13, 2009|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4qjZcIO?url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|archivedate=November 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/09/14/kanye.west.reaction/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Anger over West's disruption at MTV awards|last=France|first=Lisa Respers|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=[[CNN]]. [[Turner Broadcasting System]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from a US urban radio station commented: "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour&amp;nbsp;— urban audiences can be a bit more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I can see him going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|title=Will Kanye West's VMAs Outburst Hurt His Upcoming Tour?|last=Conception|first=Mariel|date=September 16, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=October 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716062129/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|archivedate=July 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.&lt;ref name="Canceled"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West Cancel 'Fame Kills' Tour|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 29, 2009|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202205432/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various rumors circulated as to why the tour was canceled. It was suspected that it was canceled due to poor ticket sales, feuding between Gaga and West's management teams, and Gaga's desire to play in smaller venues. Gaga's choreographer, [[Laurieann Gibson]], said the tour was terminated due to "creative differences" between the singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West's "Fame Kills" Tour Killed By Poor Sales?|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 2, 2010|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109011526/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|archivedate=January 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga claimed that the cancellation was a mutual decision, and added that she would soon embark on her own headlining tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]] in the coming weeks, while West would be taking a break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|title=Lady Gaga Speaks: Solo Tour Soon, Kanye Taking Time Off|last=Prince|first=David J.|author2=Concepcion, Mariel|date=October 2, 2009|work=Billboard|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412053639/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|archivedate=April 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, West claimed that Gaga had been solely responsible for canceling the tour following the MTV incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|title=Kanye West Talks Why His Joint Tour With Lady Gaga Was Canceled (Hint: Taylor Swift)|last=Lee|first=Christina|date=April 11, 2016|work=Idolator|accessdate=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616140319/http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hunchun incident''' (October 2, 1920) was a reported raid on a [[Japan]]ese consulate in Manchuria resulting in the death of thirteen Japanese.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The Japanese government used this incident to justify sending thousands of Imperial Japanese troops into [[Manchuria]] on October 5, 1920. These escalations culminated with the [[Battle of Qingshanli]] (October 21–26, 1920) between [[Japan]] and the Korean Independence Army,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  where [[Koreans|Korean]] rebels fought Japanese soldiers.

==Background==

For more than a decade prior to Korea’s [[March 1st Movement]] (1919) nationalist groups of Korean rebels, many of whom were former soldiers in the Korean army, organized into various pro-independence factions in Manchuria.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Due to its strategic location across the Korean border, guerilla fighters could effectively launch raids on Japanese consular police stations, and then retreat back to the Chinese side of the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 44.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Hong Pomdo (a previous [[Righteous Army]] leader) created the Korean Independence Army and trained so-called independence fighters in [[Yanji]]. Additionally, the Northern Route Military Headquarters was established under the leadership of So Il, with Kim Chwajin commanding more than four hundred independence fighters at its officer training school. Separately, Yi Tonghwi also trained over 3,000 independence fighters in Hunchun and armed them with weapons provided by the Red [[Bolshevik]] army.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to the March 1st Movement’s failure to secure independence and arouse international sentiments toward the Koreans’ plight under Japanese colonial rule, disaffected Koreans came together on April 13, 1919 in Shanghai to form a republican Korean provisional government with the hope of working together with the independence factions in Manchuria to eventually obtain freedom from Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Robinson, 2007, Korea’s Twentieth-Century Odyssey: A Short History (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the momentum behind Korean independence movements in Manchuria increased, Japanese consular police chief Suematsu Kichiji became increasingly concerned about increasing radical Bolshevism among Koreans. To try and suppress these movements, he ordered numerous illegal police raids on suspected radical Jiandao base camps, which were protested by local Chinese leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is clear that some of the Korean guerrilla fighters in Manchuria were influenced by leftist ideologies, the major factions primarily supported the [[Shanghai Provisional Government]] and were focused primarily on Korean independence and self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Angered by the Japanese suppression of the March 1st Movement, Korean independence fighters in Manchuria began increasing their raids against Japanese border posts, killing numerous Japanese guards, with the eventual goal of advancing into Korea to remove the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the early summer months of 1920, Korean rebels fought with Japanese troops in thirty-two battles along the border. After one particular Japanese counterattack, Hong Pomdo’s forces surrounded and killed 120 Japanese soldiers and wounded more than 200.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack and Controversy==

In effort to contain the Korean rebels, Japan petitioned both [[Tokyo]] and the Chinese government to help, but received little assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 45.&lt;/ref&gt;   Subsequently, on October 2, 1920, a Japanese consulate in the Chinese city of [[Hunchun]] in [[Jilin]] Province was attacked and burned to the ground purportedly (according to Japanese sources) by the Korean Independence Army, killing thirteen Japanese people.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Text of Bryce EUlogies and Statement on Siberia |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/24/98975084.pdf |accessdate=June 13, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=January 24, 1922}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was further reported that the “bandits” carrying out this attack “committed indiscriminate acts of murder and pillage” and “looted local shops.”&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many South Korean historians maintain, however, that the attack on Hunchun was not carried out by the Korean rebels, but rather was staged by the Japanese to justify incursion into Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some South Korean sources further believe that the attack was coordinated with Chinese bandit leader Ch'ang-chiang-hao who had been bribed by the Japanese to carry out the attack with several bandits in order to incriminate the Koreans. These sources maintain that Chang went further than the Japanese had requested him to in the scale of his attack.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Other South Korean scholars even maintain that the entire incident was a complete Japanese fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Korea]] is likewise skeptical about the Japanese narrative of the incident, with official sources recently asserting that “the Japanese imperialists cooked up the ‘Hunchun incident’ in which they hurled mounted bandits into attacking their consulate and kicked up a wholesale whirlwind of suppression against Koreans in Northeast China under that pretext.”&lt;ref&gt;"North Korea Criticizes Japan's ‘Punitive Operations’ in 1920." BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific, Oct 02, 2009, http://search.proquest.com/docview/460755521&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it is difficult for historians to determine who was behind the attack, or whether the incident actually took place, this controversial event is historically significant because Japan used it to justify its escalated military intervention in Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Japan petitioned and received permission from China to send 15,000 troops from the 19th Division of the [[Chosen Army]] of Japan to contain the Korean rebel armies in Jilin province.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Aftermath==

In reaction to the Hunchun incident, a Japanese punitive “Jiandao Expedition” was accordingly sent to Manchuria, and used “search and destroy” patrols to suppress the guerrilla fighters by carrying out numerous arrests and executions.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  By December 1920, a Korean Commission report described that Japanese soldiers had burned down thirty-two villages and killed “all the male inhabitants of the [Hunchun] district, and massacred 145 peaceful inhabitants.” One house was reportedly burned down with “women and children inside.”&lt;ref&gt;“Koreans Charge Cruelty,” New York Times, December 24, 1920, https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1920/12/24/103519339.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Korean independence forces in Manchuria were never effectively organized under the leadership of the Shanghai Provisional Government, they did achieve notable military victories against the Japanese brigades.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) pp. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most significant of these was the [[Battle of Qingshanli]], where about 400 Korean rebels were able to defeat the better-trained Japanese after four days of intense combat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/history/independence_army.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  In this battle the Koreans killed about 1,200 Japanese soldiers while losing only 60 of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Kang Man-gil, 1994, A History of Contemporary Korea (United Kingdom: Global Oriental) p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, according to Japanese records, 11 soldiers were [[killed in action]], 24 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;陸軍第十九師團司令部　「間島事件鮮支人死傷者調」　大正十年二月二十五日&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1921, after a series of skirmishes and retreats on both sides, as well as criticism from local Chinese authorities and the international community, most members of the 19th Division withdrew from eastern Manchuria.&lt;ref&gt;Erik W. Esselstrom, 2005, Rethinking the Colonial Conquest of Manchuria: The Japanese Consular Police in Jiandao, Modern Asian Studies 39, (February) vol. 1: 48.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the socialist-leaning Korean rebels were then recruited by the Red Bolshevik army to assist in its civil war prior to the formation of the [[Soviet Union]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

An '''international incident''' is a seemingly relatively small or limited action or clash that results in a wider dispute between two or more [[nation-states]]. International incidents can arise from unanticipated actions involving citizens, government officials, or armed units of one or more nation-states, or out of a deliberate but small provocative action by [[espionage]] agents of one nation-state, or by [[terrorists]], against another nation-state.

An international incident usually arises during a time of relative [[peace]] between nation-states, and in general is, on the surface, an unexpected event. Conflicts that grow out of a series of escalating [[skirmish]]es between nation-states generally are not considered international incidents; however, [[terrorist]] actions can and often do become international incidents. However, historical views of past international incidents often reveal the incident was the flashpoint of a simmering conflict between nation-states, or organizations opposing nation-states.

Wars have often been provoked by international incidents, and [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] efforts to prevent international incidents from growing into full-scale armed conflicts often have been unsuccessful. In the aftermath of the [[First World War]], the [[League of Nations]] was established to help nations who were parties to an international incident achieve a solution to the incident through diplomatic means. Initially, the League of Nations had some success in working to find diplomatic solutions, however the failure of the League of Nations to prevent [[World War II]] resulted in the disbandment of the League of Nations in favor of the [[United Nations]]. As with its predecessor, the United Nations provides a means by which nations involved in an international incident can work to resolve the matter diplomatically rather than through the use of force.

The term is also applied to various incidents that can disrupt international [[commerce]], and to [[celebrities]] or other well-known people who commit [[gaffe]]s or otherwise act inappropriately, causing the [[Mass media|press]] and sometimes governments to criticize their actions.

The [[International Court of Justice]] keeps a list of legal disputes between nation-states, many of which result from international incidents. The [[Royal Mail]] of the [[United Kingdom]] keeps a list on its website of current international incidents that might disrupt mail service.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmail.com/service-update/international Royal Mail – International Incident Bulletin].

On 10 October  2012, at  the [[Mexico–United States border]] near [[Nogales, Arizona]], [[U.S. Border Patrol]] agent Lonnie Swartz fired 16 shots&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23" /&gt; at '''José Antonio Elena Rodríguez''', killing him,&lt;ref name=shots&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/magazine/10-shots-across-the-border.html|title=10 Shots Across the Border|last=Binelli|first=Mark|date=2016-03-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that [[Criminal rock throwing|young men threw rocks]] at him and other law enforcement agents.

After the incident, the law enforcement  agencies stated the Mexican civilians were trying to stop them from confiscating a shipment of contraband drugs  as well as moving immigrants across the border.

Rodriguez was hit 10 times by the patrol officer's shots.&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carranza|first1=Rafael|last2=O'Dell|first2=Rob|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Yuhas|first=Alan|date=31 May 2015|title=Justice for José?

==Incident==
Around 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday 10 October, 2012, John Zuñiga, a police officer in [[Nogales, Arizona]],  received a call reporting "suspicious activity" on International Street, a road running directly along the  border. Getting to the scene, Zuñiga heard from another police officer from Nogales, Quinardo Garci, that  two men carrying "bundles taped to their backs" had climbed the fence into the United States. Identifying the bundles, on the basis of similar incidents in the past, as most probably containing [[marijuana]], they called out for back up.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;

After several [[United States Border Patrol|Border Patrol]] and [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection|Customs]] agents arrived, they saw the two men scaling the fence back into Mexico, empty-handed and with nothing on their backs. They commanded the two men to climb back down. At that time, Garcia and Zuñiga stated in their reports that they saw "rocks flying through the air"&lt;ref name="tucson.com"&gt;{{Cite website|title=Border agent's murder trial postponed|url=http://tucson.com/news/border-agent-s-murder-trial-postponed/article_561ac027-ef47-5d29-8d01-9c073669afff.html|format=|date=2016-01-05|author=Perla Trevizo|publisher=Arizona Daily Star|postscript=|accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the assorted agents and also heard "gunfire," although they were unable to identify its source.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="CarranzaTeen"/&gt; 

In the days following the incident, the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] agency stated that
:After verbal commands from agents to cease [assaulting the agents with rocks] were ignored, one agent then discharged his service firearm. One of the subjects appeared to have been hit.

The person hit was José Antonio Elena Rodríguez, a 16-year old resident of [[Nogales, Sonora|Nogales, Mexico]]. He was unarmed, standing on the Mexican side of the border on a sidewalk on Calle Internacional street, in front of a doctor’s office, below a sign reading "Medical Emergencies" in Spanish. He was hit from behind by 10 bullets.&lt;ref name="GUARDIAN1"/&gt; The [[autopsy]] revealed that gunshot wounds to the head, [[lung]]s, and [[artery|arteries]] killed him.&lt;ref name=shots/&gt;&lt;ref name="NPR1"/&gt; 

==Trial==
U.S. Border Patrol agent Lonnie Ray Swartz was charged with [[second degree murder]] for the killing of José Rodríguez. It was the first time a US law enforcement officer was brought up on charges related to a killing that took part across the US-Mexican border, despite there having been a number of similar incidents in the preceding decade.&lt;ref name=NPR1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis|first=Charles|date=4 January 2015|title=U.S. Customs and Border Protection Has Killed Nearly 50 People in 10 Years.

In the trial, which began in late 2015 at the Evo A. DeConcini U.S. Courthouse, the defendant claimed he had used deadly force because Rodriguez "had been throwing rocks."&lt;ref name=shots/&gt; Although a witness testified that Rodríguez was not throwing rocks at the law enforcement officers, evidence showed that he was, along with other youths and men. Prosecutors acknowledged that Rodríguez was throwing rocks across the border but stated "he did not deserve to die" for this.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mistrial announced for U.S. border agent linked to teenager's fatal shooting|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mistrial-us-border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-manslaughter-charges-today-2018-04-23/|accessdate=24 May 2018|publisher=CBS News|date=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Customs and Border Protection refused to release surveillance-camera footage of the incident.&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

After the testimony by Emma Lew, the director of the medical examiner in [[Miami-Dade County]], Florida, who stated that Swartz's first shot "likely hit the boy in the middle of his back as he was running," the prosecution rested its case in the trial on 5 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/040518_swartz_trial/swartz-trial-defense-struggles-with-first-witness-after-prosecution-rests/|title=

On 23 April 2018, Swartz was acquitted of the charge for second-degree murder; the jury was [[deadlock]]ed on lesser charges.&lt;ref name="azcentral-notguilty-2018-04-23"&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael  |last2=O'Dell |first2=Rob |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/2018/04/23/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-found-not-guilty-cross-border-slaying-mexican-teen/544197002/|title=Border Patrol agent Lonnie Swartz found not guilty in cross-border slaying of Mexican teen|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=24 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
==Aftermath==
The judge presiding on the trial, [[Raner Collins]], declared a [[mistrial]]. The head of the Tucson union for Border Patrol officers, stated, after the jury's decision was announced, that "justice was properly served" and that the union was "pretty happy with it."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt; 

After the jury's decision was reported in the news, protesters gathered outside the federal courthouse in downtown Tucson late Monday afternoon, and blocked off the intersection in front of it. Among those participating in the protest was the mother of Carlos LaMadrid, another Mexican teen who, in 2011, had been shot and killed by Border Patrol agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Carranza |first1=Rafael |url=https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2018/05/11/border-patrol-agent-lonnie-swartz-retried-death-jose-antonio-elena-rodriguez/602687002/|title=Border Patrol agent will be retried in fatal cross-border shooting of teen|date=11 May 2018|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|access-date=20 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar incidents==
A 2015 review by the Border Patrol's [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]] department reviewed 67 shooting incidents that resulted in 19 people dying, during the period from January 2010 through October 2012. The review found agents guilty of criminal conduct in 3 of the incidents. Two agents faced disciplinary action in the form of an "oral reprimand."&lt;ref name="FatalShootingCBS"/&gt;

The campaign resulted in a resolution by the [[United States Senate]] and contributed to the decision to send troops by the [[African Union]]. The film also called for an April 20 world wide canvassing campaign, called "Cover the Night". On April 5, 2012, Invisible Children released a follow-up video, titled ''[[#Kony 2012 Part II|Kony 2012: Part II&amp;nbsp;– Beyond Famous]]'', which failed to repeat the success of the original.

==''Kony 2012''==
The film documents the [[Invisible Children, Inc.|Invisible Children]]'s plans and efforts to capture [[Joseph Kony]]. It describes Kony's actions with his rebel militia group [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA), including [[Impressment|forced recruitment]] of [[child soldiers]], and the regions (northern [[Uganda]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[South Sudan]]) in which they have been active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.altoona.psu.edu/now/news.php?value=3646 |title=KONY 2012, an Invisible Children film, to show on campus March 12 |accessdate=March 7, 2012 |date=March 5, 2012 |publisher=[[Penn State Altoona]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310034444/http://www.altoona.psu.edu/now/news.php?value=3646 |archivedate=March 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main people featured in the film is a young Ugandan named Jacob Avaye, whose brother was killed by the LRA. In response, director and founder of Invisible Children, [[Jason Russell]], promises Jacob that he will help "stop Kony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Celebs Help 'Stop Kony' Trend on Twitter: Who Is Kony? |author=Jenny McGrath |url=http://www.wetpaint.com/network/articles/celebs-help-stop-kony-tweet-on-twitter-who-is-kony |newspaper=[[Wetpaint]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film advocates the restoration of social order and curtailing compelled and coerced [[Military use of children|youth military service]].&lt;ref name=JCTSK/&gt; The video also has clips of Jason Russell's young son reacting to the information about Kony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cunningham |first=Todd |url=http://www.thewrap.com/media/article/kony-2012-part-ii-beyond-famous-takes-warlord-and-critics-36822 |title='Kony 2012: Part II - Beyond Famous' Takes on Warlord and Critics |publisher=Thewrap.com |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the film, a 2011 announcement from U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] is shown authorizing the deployment of 100 [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Forces]] military advisers to provide "information, advice, and assistance to partner nation forces" of [[Central Africa]]n countries to "remove Joseph Kony from the battlefield".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Uganda: Obama Sends U.S. Military Advisers to Help Track LRA's Kony |author=Jim Lobe |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201110150156.html |newspaper=[[AllAfrica]] |date=October 15, 2011 |accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video concludes by urging viewers to join its publicity campaign by putting up posters and helping out in their communities.&lt;ref name=YouTube&gt;{{cite video|year=2012 |title=KONY 2012 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc |medium=Motion picture |publisher=Invisible Children |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invisible Children==
The Invisible Children charity has focused on obtaining the support of a select group of individuals in order to "help bring awareness to the abuse and killing of children in the [[East Africa|East]] and Central African countries at the hands of Kony and his leadership." This list included 20 "celebrity culture makers", such as [[George Clooney]], [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Oprah Winfrey]] (who significantly helped to spread the video&lt;ref name=numbers/&gt;), [[Taylor Swift]] and [[Ryan Seacrest]].&lt;ref name="E!"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012: George Clooney, Angelina Jolie and You Asked to Save Africa's Invisible Children From Torture |author=Rebecca Macatee |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/kony_2012_george_clooney_angelina_jolie/299424 |publisher=[[E!]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Basulto |first=Dominic |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/post/clooney-kony-soldiers-spy-satellites-celebrity-philanthropy-goes-high-tech/2012/03/30/gIQADM0MlS_blog.html |title=Clooney, Kony, soldier, spy: Celebrity activism goes high-tech&amp;nbsp;– Ideas@Innovations |work=The Washington Post |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list also featured 12 "policy makers" that have "the power to keep U.S. government officials in Africa" in order to work toward the capture of Kony. This list includes former U.S. President [[George W.

As part of the campaign, American supporters were asked to put up posters in their hometowns in an action named "Cover the Night", which took place on April 20, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Harris in New York |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/13/kony-2012-invisble-children-day-of-action |title=Kony 2012 organisers plan massive day of action across US cities |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invisible Children website offers posters and T-shirts in an attempt to gain wider recognition. They also created action kits to help spread awareness that include campaign buttons, posters, bracelets and stickers.&lt;ref name="Lees0307"/&gt;

The "Cover the Night" event took place worldwide on April 20, 2012, and was to be conducted by supporters who were encouraged to perform some sort of charity work that morning in their local community. Then, that evening, they were to post flyers and posters throughout their city for the Kony 2012 campaign. The turnout for the event worldwide was much smaller than initially expected, with no organized spots officially announced and much fewer people attending than had pledged to attend. A tweet from Invisible Children stated, "There is no official meet-up as we are asking people to act locally with friends+family {{sic}} in their neighborhoods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Catch Kony campaign loses couch potatoes |author=Nick Miller |url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/catch-kony-campaign-loses-couch-potatoes-20120421-1xdqc.html |newspaper=The Age |date=April 22, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One gathering in [[Vancouver]] had only 17 people; another in [[Brisbane]] had fewer than 50 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 campaign fails to go offline in Vancouver |author=Mike Hager |url=http://www.globaltvbc.com/kony+2012+campaign+fails+to+go+offline+in+vancouver/6442625789/story.html |newspaper=[[Global BC]] |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=KONY 2012's struggle to remain visible |author=Chris Paine |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/kony-2012-how-the-phenomenon-faded/story-e6freuzr-1226334893369 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]], several signs and posters were put up, including two large banners that were "placed on both sides of the pedestrian overpass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kelowna makes Kony famous|url=http://www.kelownacapnews.com/news/148386225.html |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canberra]], several [[Facebook]] groups resulted in a few gatherings of two or three people each; [[Pierre Johannessen]], a "law firm partner who runs a charity for disadvantaged children", distributed around 3,000 posters to the groups to be put up throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 poster boy for Civic unrest |author=Douglas Fry |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/kony-2012-poster-boy-for-civic-unrest-20120421-1xebl.html |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=April 22, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], 200 posters were put up by "college students and other people in their teens and 20s", along with a number of chalk and stencil messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 supporters 'cover the night' in downtown Phoenix |url=http://downtowndevil.com/2012/04/21/26874/kony-2012-phoenix-uganda/ |newspaper=Downtown Devil |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear left}}

The film sparked a heated controversy regarding its merits, with very differing opinions being expressed by various [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] workers, government and international officials, journalists, and other groups and individuals.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/efforts-arrest-joseph-kony-must-respect-human-rights-2012-03-08 |title=Efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights |publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WTF Was Kony 2012?

=== Social Media Response ===
After the video was released, various social media outlets went into a frenzy and exploded the Kony 2012 movement into the world-wide news.  The video, directed by [[Jason Russell]], began to generate a tremendous amount of social media attention.  After being the quickest video to reach 100 million views within 6 days,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kony 2012 took over social media with hashtags like #Kony2012. The social media impact was so relevant that, on March 6 and 7, more people were talking about Kony 2012 through Facebook posts than the newly released Apple iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.notothequo.com/kony-2012-social-media-case-study-stats-and-insights/|title=Kony 2012 Social Media Case Study {{!}} Stats and Insights - N2Q Consulting|date=2012-03-08|work=N2Q Consulting|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with [[Facebook]], nearly 66% of Twitter conversations during March 5&amp;nbsp;– March 12 were about the Anti-Kony movement.  Social media outlets, such as Facebook, were responsible for informing 27% of young adults of the Kony 2012 video, compared to 10% who learned about it through other traditional platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/03/15/the-viral-kony-2012-video/|title=The Viral Kony 2012 Video|date=2012-03-15|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Kony 2012 made a significant impact throughout social media platforms. During that short period of time, it became YouTube's number one video of reaching a certain number of views within a short period of time, along with over 5 million related tweets occurring over just a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2012/The_Viral_Kony_2012_Video.pdf|title=The Viral Kony 2012 Video|last=Rainie|first=Lee|date=|website=Pew Research|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Virality of the Movement ===

[[File:2012 Kony cumulative video views.png|thumb|Cumulative views on YouTube, showing a lower, though steady, view growth rate after its first ten days.&lt;ref name=WaybackKony/&gt;]]
In under a week, the video created by Invisible Children, Kony 2012 had been viewed over 100 million times.&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"&gt;http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/12/kony-2012-documentary-becomes-most-viral-video-in-history/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine credits Invisible Children's strong base of followers on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Unlike other videos that accidentally "go viral", Kony 2012 was created to elicit emotional responses and encourage viewers to share the footage and spread the hashtag. This attracted the attention of celebrities like [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Rihanna]], [[Bill Gates]], [[Ryan Seacrest]], [[Justin Bieber]], and [[Kim Kardashian-West]].&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2014/06/14/321853244/the-kony-2012-effect-recovering-from-a-viral-sensation&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the video's popularity, not all interactions were positive. But the more criticism the video drew, the more people watched it and shared it so that they could be a part of the conversation. Their Public Relations team was not ready for the over night fame and failed to control the narrative of the fall out.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

Forbes gives a breakdown of 12 reasons why the video went so viral. They cite that the video invoked positive feelings, grabbed viewers attention, made it personal, referenced mainstream media, pulled on the heartstrings, conveyed immediacy, made it simple, made it real, gave it a scale, used celebrities, created events, and made it easy to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/03/09/12-lessons-from-kony-2012-from-social-media-power-users/#45f979dd4328&lt;/ref&gt; These 12 basic tactics affected viewers so much so that the Kony 2012 campaign sold out of merchandise when their two interns could not keep up with the hundreds of thousands of action kits supporters could buy. Jason Russel told Business Insider, "We sourced every single red T-shirt in the entire US.

Erwin van der Borght, the organization's Africa director, wrote in a statement: "Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest for far too long and this campaign is a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial," but added: "Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect [[human rights]]", especially because "many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment", and ensure the protection of civilians.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

Opinions on the film were mixed in [[Gulu]], one of former centers of rebel activities in northern Uganda, during a showing of the film, with several of the leaders expressing support and criticism. One of the attendees, State Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Henry Oryem Okello]], said that the criticisms directed at the film and Invisible Children were "unfounded", going on to state, "Invisible Children has done visible things in [[Acholi]][land], for example offering scholarships to thousands of children and anyone against them is our enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 video divides opinion in Gulu |author1=Sam Lawino |author2=Moses Akena |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1369072/-/ax98g6z/-/ |newspaper=Saturday Monitor |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Betty Bigombe]], a Ugandan cabinet minister and former peace negotiator, said, "I do not know whether it makes any difference as far as taking [Kony] out is concerned.

He also said that complexity had long been "a leading excuse for inaction during atrocities" and that Kony remains a threat in Uganda's neighbour countries, so the simplicity of the film "has left the American public more informed" than it would be otherwise, and that if he "were a Congolese villager", he would "welcome these uncertain efforts over the sneering scorn of do-nothing armchair cynics."&lt;ref name=Kristof&gt;{{cite news |title=Viral Video, Vicious Warlord |author=[[Nicholas D.

Mikaela Luttrell-Rowland from [[Clark University]]'s Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies stated that it was "irresponsible to prize feel good, simplistic messages over complex history and to treat [[consumerism|consumerist]]-consciousness raising as interchangeable with education."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mikaela-luttrellrowland/consumerism-trumps-educat_b_1337067.html Consumerism Trumps Education: The Kony 2012 Campaign], ''Huffington Post'', November 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Africa researcher [[Alex de Waal]] accused the film of "peddling dangerous and patronizing falsehoods," criticized the campaign as "naive" for "elevating Kony to a global celebrity, the embodiment of evil," that might only help him as a terrorist and cult leader, and called for instead "demystifying Kony—reducing him to a common criminal and a failed provincial politician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2012/03/10/dont-elevate-kony/ |title=Don't Elevate Kony &amp;#124; Reinventing Peace |publisher=Sites.tufts.edu |date=March 10, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One point of criticism is that the film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only in the hundreds, and Kony himself was believed to be in the Central African Republic rather than Uganda—a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video.&lt;ref name="Keating20120307"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/03/07/guest_post_joseph_kony_is_not_in_uganda_and_other_complicated_things |title=Guest post: Joseph Kony is not in Uganda (and other complicated things) |accessdate=March 8, 2012|date=March 7, 2012|work=Foreign Policy|author=Keating, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem raised questions about the plausibility of Ugandan army intervention, which the video advocates. Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the Ugandan army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of the other countries where the LRA is active.&lt;ref name=infamous&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/08/148239201/joseph-kony-is-now-a-star-but-will-he-be-caught | title=Joseph Kony is Infamous&amp;nbsp;– But will he be caught? | publisher=NPR | accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dinaw Mengestu]], an [[Ethiopian American]] writer and Africa researcher, wrote that the real world Kony is "not a click away", and a simple solution of raising popular awareness, "a beautiful equation that can only work so long as we believe that nothing in the world happens unless we know about it&amp;nbsp;... only works in the [[Myopia|myopic]] reality of the film, a reality that deliberately eschews depth and complexity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warscapes.com/reportage/not-click-away-joseph-kony-real-world |title=Not a Click Away: Joseph Kony in the Real World |publisher=Warscapes |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Amanda Weisbaum of the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] said that "just getting rid of one person does not solve the problem" and the film's focus should have been rather on helping ex-child soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/blogs/technotalk/not-enough-focus-on-child-soldiers-lives-in-kony-2012-war-child/ |title=Not enough focus on child soldiers’ lives in "Kony 2012" -War Child&amp;nbsp;– AlertNet |publisher=Trust.org |date=April 4, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705072012/http://www.trust.org/alertnet/blogs/technotalk/not-enough-focus-on-child-soldiers-lives-in-kony-2012-war-child |archivedate=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Goddard, president and CEO of [[ChildFund|ChildFund International]], wrote that "by narrowing the focus on Kony, by defining success so singularly, it gives people a greater sense that the issue [of globally widespread conscription of young children] can be resolved.

After the film's release, there was criticism in Uganda of its failure to state more clearly that Kony and his forces fled northern Uganda in 2006 and were dispersed across the jungles of three neighbouring countries.

Margaret Aciro, whose picture appears in the video showing her face mutilated by the LRA, said she "became sad" after seeing it being "used to profit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1387926/-/aw2cd3z/-/index.html |title=Kony 2012 video makers using us to make profit, war victim says - National |publisher=monitor.co.ug |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Ernest Sugule, national coordinator of the Congolese non-governmental organization SAIPD in [[Dungu, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Dungu, DRC]], claimed that the few people there "who have succeeded in watching [''Kony 2012''] are very critical on the film," as is he himself.&lt;ref name=next/&gt; Charlie Beckett, a media communications expert at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE), said Invisible Children, "haven't got the capacity for is to take that beyond another action. What are they going to do with all this energy and interest? It's going to dissipate.&amp;nbsp;... I think this will crash and die, I don't think they will catch Kony. People will say they bought the bracelet and stuck posters on lamppost but that could have negative effects when it doesn't actually lead anywhere."&lt;ref name=next/&gt;

===Decline of the Movement===



The fame of director [[Jason Russell]]'s 30-minute documentary was short-lived. After becoming the fastest video in history to have reached 100 million views,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wasserman|first1=Todd|title='KONY 2012' Tops 100 Million Views, Becomes the Most Viral Video in History [STUDY]|url=http://mashable.com/2012/03/12/kony-most-viral/#0IHt2sGJXEqF|accessdate=18 October 2017|agency=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt; the popularity of the video dwindled&amp;nbsp;– in 5&amp;nbsp;years it had added less than 1/50 of its views it had garnered in its first 144 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KONY 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4MnpzG5Sqc|website=YouTube|publisher=Invisible Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Occupy Wall Street]], the climb toward the most popular peak of the movement lasted 3 months&amp;nbsp;– from August 2011 to October 2011&lt;ref&gt;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2010-10-03%202017-11-03&amp;q=%23occupywallstreet&lt;/ref&gt;. There is much speculation on how the movement died off. Rick Cohen suggests that the video "sucked the energy out of the organizing"&amp;nbsp;– people already knew what Kony 2012 was so there was no need to create awareness about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Rick|title=Why Did “Kony 2012” Fizzle Out?|url=https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2012/04/26/why-did-kony-2012-fizzle-out/|publisher=nonprofitquarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen also makes reference to a "counter-narrative" that arose in Uganda.

The Visible Children also criticized the Kony 2012 movement for making Joseph Kony "famous", citing Ugandan opinions that even more supporters rallied behind Kony for publicity. Delinquent acts of graffiti from the movement's followers and lewd acts by creator Jason Russell led to further criticism of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holt|first1=Mytheos|title=‘Kony 2012’: Viral Video’s Filmmaker Arrested for Lewd Acts|url=http://www.theblaze.com/news/2012/03/16/scandals-dog-kony-2012-graffiti-appears-in-texas-originator-arrested-for-lewd-acts/|accessdate=18 October 2017|agency=The Blaze|date=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the movement's nature as a meme transformed it to be unattractive platform for some to donate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Katie|title=Think Twice Before Donating to Kony 2012, the Charitable Meme du Jour|url=https://jezebel.com/5891269/think-twice-before-donating-to-kony-2012-the-meme-du-jour|accessdate=18 October 2017|agency=jezebel|publisher=gizmodo|date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A statement purported to be released by Kony's Lord's Resistance Army rebels and signed by the group's spokesman&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/06/world/africa/kony2012-lra-reaction/index.html |title=LRA slams Kony video as act of deception |publisher=CNN |date=April 6, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and negotiator Justine Nyeko ("The Leader, LRA Peace Team")&lt;ref name=sequel&gt;{{cite news|last=Gabbatt |first=Adam |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2012/apr/05/kony-2012-sequel-video-live |title=Kony 2012 sequel video&amp;nbsp;– does it answer the questions? |work=The Guardian |date=April 5, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; condemned the film as "a cheap and banal panic act of mass trickery to make the unsuspecting peoples of the world complicit in the US rogue and murderous activities in Central Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rebelweb.me/lra-reacts-to-kony-2012-video/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411050508/http://rebelweb.me/lra-reacts-to-kony-2012-video/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 11, 2012 |title=» Blog Archive » Ugandan LRA rebels react to KONY 2012 Video |publisher=Rebelweb.me |accessdate=April 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was obtained by Ugandan journalist Frank Nyakairu, received from Nairobi, Kenya-based LRA representatives.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; It was also reported that the LRA abduction rate sharply increased in the weeks since the film was released, although it was impossible to confirm the link between the rise in LRA attacks and Kony's global notoriety.&lt;ref name=cover/&gt;

===Invisible Children's response===
On March 8, 2012, Invisible Children released an official response addressing the criticisms directed at ''Kony 2012''. As an explanation for the simplicity of the movie, they stated that "in [their] quest to garner wide public support of nuanced policy, [they] sought to explain the conflict in an easily understandable format." Jedidiah Jenkins, the director of idea development for Invisible Children, responded to the new criticisms by saying that they were "myopic" and that the video itself was a "tipping point" that "got young people to care about an issue on the other side of the planet that doesn't affect them."&lt;ref name="Post1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Invisible Children responds to criticism about 'Stop Kony' campaign |author=Elizabeth Flock |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/invisible-childrens-stop-kony-campaign/2012/03/07/gIQA7B31wR_blog.html?wprss=blogpost |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to concerns about working with the Ugandan government, Invisible Children explained that they "do not defend any of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Ugandan government or the Ugandan army". They added that the reason why they are working with the Ugandan army even though Kony is no longer in Uganda is that the army is "more organized and better equipped than that of any of the other affected countries (DRC, South Sudan, CAR) to track down Joseph Kony" and that they want all of the governments in the region to work together to arrest Kony.&lt;ref name="Invisible Children Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Invisible Children Critiques |url=http://www.invisiblechildren.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/critiques.html |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308102109/http://www.invisiblechildren.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/critiques.html |archivedate=March 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins stated, "There is a huge problem with [[political corruption]] in Africa. If we had the purity to say we will not partner with anyone corrupt, we couldn't partner with anyone."&lt;ref name="Post1"/&gt;

A video titled ''Thank you, KONY 2012 Supporters'' was released on March 12, 2012 to address the criticisms directed at the film and to be "fully transparent", according to Invisible Children CEO Ben Keesey. The film begins with Keesey discussing the three things that the charity focuses on, which are to "create films with compelling narratives, promote international advocacy and run on-the-ground initiatives." He also points out that "overhead and travel costs are essential to those efforts", as a part of the group's management expenses, along with going toward "thousands of free screenings of the group's films worldwide, as well as toward bringing survivors of the Lord's Resistance Army&amp;nbsp;... to speak at these events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Invisible Children Releases New Video in Response to ‘Kony 2012’ Criticism |author=Samantha Grossman |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/12/invisible-children-releases-new-video-in-response-to-kony-2012-criticism/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 12, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keesey explains the way the charity's annual expenditures are made, with "80.5 percent to 85.7 percent of total annual spending from fiscal 2007 to 2011" going toward {{"'}}program expenses'—money that directly benefits their cause",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Kony 2012: Invisible Children release new film responding to criticism |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/joseph-kony/9139970/Joseph-Kony-2012-Invisible-Children-release-new-film-responding-to-criticism.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finished by urging interested parties to make inquires to the group via [[Twitter]], using the account @invisible and hashtag #AskICAnything.

The website Kickstriker, a parody of [[Kickstarter]], contains a fake appeal to crowdsource the "hiring private military contractors from [[Academi]] (formerly Blackwater), who will be immediately deployed to central Africa" with a mission to capture or kill Kony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kickstriker.com/kony |title=Capture Kony: Bring Joseph Kony to Justice |publisher=Kickstriker |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Invisible Children sent the Kickstriker team a [[cease and desist]] warning to take down the parody page, accusing them of "causing public confusion through your use of Invisible Children's copyrighted and trademarked property" and threatening a legal action. According to [[Wired.com]], the legal threats "[had] Kickstriker's founders rolling their eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ackerman |first=Spencer |url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/06/kony-2012-lawsuit/ |title='Kony 2012' Threatens Lawsuit Against Online Parody &amp;#124; Danger Room |publisher=Wired.com |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
In a pre-release comment, [[popular culture]] expert [[Robert Thompson (professor)|Robert Thompson]] said: "The fact is, the story has developed in so many odd ways with all the controversy, and the sequel can't really promise the bang of that first video—which is informing people of something they did not know before. Now we're getting into the details, which is never that thrilling."&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite news|author=Julie Watson Associated Press |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1156866--kony-2012-new-video-on-african-warlord-tackles-criticisms-fired-at-invisible-children |title=Kony 2012: New video on African warlord tackles criticisms fired at Invisible Children&amp;nbsp;– |work=Toronto Star |date=April 5, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LRA researcher Craig Valters of the LSE's department of International Development said that the second video "overwhelmingly" failed to answer criticisms raised by the first film.&lt;ref name=sequel/&gt; On the other hand, Mike Pflanz, East Africa correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', said that the sequel was "a more solid, moving and, finally, accurate presentation of the ongoing battle to capture Joseph Kony" and that, in comparison to the original video, the "new video is couched in nuance and deploys dialogue more commonly heard in a United Nations workshop&amp;nbsp;– displacement, rehabilitation, post-conflict&amp;nbsp;– than in a YouTube smash."&lt;ref name=part2&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony2012: Part II more solid, moving and accurate presentation than first film |author=Mike Pflanz |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/joseph-kony/9188955/Kony2012-Part-II-more-solid-moving-and-accurate-presentation-than-first-film.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=April 5, 2012 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the sequel "does not seem to have captured the public's imagination in quite the same way as Invisible Children's earlier video did, failing to significantly trend on social media websites."&lt;ref name=sequel/&gt; By April 16, 2012, it had received 1.7 million views in 11 days, less than 2% of what the first video had in its first five days. Matt Fiorentino, director of marketing at video measurement firm Visible Measures, considered the first campaign a never-seen-before anomaly, and despite being dwarfed by its predecessor, the number of views ''Beyond Famous'' received was "pretty good" when compared to a regular social campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Todd Wasserman|url=http://mashable.com/2012/04/16/kony-sequel-traffic/ |title=KONY Sequel Got 2% of the Traffic of Its Predecessor |publisher=Mashable.com |date=April 16, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' nevertheless described ''Beyond Famous'' as "one of the top 25 non-profit campaigns ever."&lt;ref name=numbers&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 in numbers |author=Antonia Kanczula |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/apr/20/kony-2012-facts-numbers?newsfeed=true |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 20, 2012 |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===United States===
On March 21, 2012, a resolution "condemning Joseph Kony and his ruthless guerrilla group for a 26-year campaign of terror" was put forward by [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[Jim Inhofe]] and [[Chris Coons]]. The resolution stated that it would back "the effort of Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and the newest country, South Sudan, to stop Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army", along with an official statement of support "for the U.S. effort to help regional forces pursue commanders of the militia group." Overall, the resolution received support from 34 senators, both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate pushes measure condemning Kony |author=Donna Cassata |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2012/03/21/senate_pushes_measure_condemning_kony/|date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 2, 2015 |work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Politico"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Kony captures Congress' attention |author=Scott Wong |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74355.html |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=March 22, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support among senators for the resolution came about after the release of the ''Kony 2012'' video and its subsequent popularity. One of the resolution leaders, Senator Chris Coons, became aware of the situation after his daughters asked him what he was doing to stop Kony and Senator [[Roy Blunt]] was informed "at a Missouri caucus in St. Louis when a constituent quizzed him about Kony". One of the co-sponsors of the resolution, Senator [[Lindsey Graham]], stated that, "When you get 100 million Americans looking at something, you will get our attention. This YouTube sensation is gonna help the Congress be more aggressive and will do more to lead to his demise than all other action combined."&lt;ref name="Politico"/&gt;

===Africa===
{{see also|Lord's Resistance Army insurgency}}

On March 23, 2012, the [[African Union]] (AU) announced its intentions to send an international brigade of 5,000 military troops "from Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Congo, countries where Kony's reign of terror has been felt over the years ... to join the hunt for rebel leader Joseph Kony" and to "neutralize" him. According to the statement, the mission commenced on March 24, 2012, and the search "will last until Kony is caught",&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012: African Union ramps up hunt for Uganda rebel leader in wake of viral video |author=Rodney Muhumuza |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1150843--kony-2012-african-union-ramps-up-hunt-for-uganda-rebel-leader-in-wake-of-viral-video |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=March 23, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2012 |work=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the task force will be disbanded.

The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said the agency welcomed the "unprecedented" initiative to "end the atrocities in the region" and urged all involved to respect human rights and minimize risk to civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/03/kony-lords-resistance-army-increased-attacks.html |title=Kony militia steps up attacks in Congo, Central African Republic |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; AU [[counter-terrorism]] envoy Francisco Madeira said, "We need to stop Kony." The ICC chief prosecutor [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] voiced confidence that the video will "produce the arrest of Joseph Kony this year," adding: "That is the impact of the campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/01/204536.html |title=Viral video will spur Kony arrest this year: ICC&amp;nbsp;– Yahoo!

A '''latent human error''' is a [[human error]] which is likely to be made due to systems or routines that are formed in such a way that humans are disposed to making these errors. Latent human error is a term used in safety work and accident prevention, especially in [[aviation]].

By gathering data about errors made, then collating, grouping and analyzing them, it can be determined whether a disproportionate amount of similar errors are being made. If this is the case, a contributing factor may be disharmony between the respective systems/routines and human nature or [[Propensity probability|propensities]]. The routines or systems can then be analyzed, potential problems identified, and amendments made if necessary, in order to prevent future errors, incidents or accidents.

[[File:Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One Logo.jpg|thumb|Logo of the cancelled tour]]

'''Led Zeppelin – The 1980s, Part One''' was a planned autumn 1980 concert tour of North America by the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. It was scheduled to take place from 17 October through 15 November of that year and cover much of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. The band cancelled the tour when drummer [[John Bonham]] died on 25 September, one day after the group's initial rehearsal for the tour.

==Background==
In the wake of Led Zeppelin's turmoil-plagued [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|1977 American tour]], which ended abruptly with the sudden death of his son Karac, singer [[Robert Plant]] had become averse to touring America with the band. His reluctance to do so persisted despite the success of the ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'' album and the band's return to the stage at the [[Knebworth Festival 1979|1979 Knebworth Festival]] after a two-year absence. Following the conclusion of Led Zeppelin's successful [[Tour Over Europe 1980]], however, Plant had a change of heart and informed Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] that he was willing to undertake an American tour with the band in the autumn of 1980. According to writer [[Mick Wall]], though,

{{cquote|Plant did, however, lay down some strict deal-breaker conditions: no tour should take him away from his family for longer than a month; the band would play a maximum of two shows back-to-back followed by a day off; and, as with the European tour, Superdomes were out, more modest venues in; the aim to re-establish 'contact' with the audience (and, by definition, themselves). Grant and the others wearily complied.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 410.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grant had been concerned about the band's lengthy absence from one of its primary markets, and had correctly viewed the European tour as a way of rekindling Plant's interest in performing in America.  Relieved by Plant's change of heart and mindful of the singer's conditions, Grant began planning a nineteen-date tour covering the American East Coast and Midwest, and envisioned Led Zeppelin undertaking additional West Coast and UK tours in early 1981. The band began preparations for the tour with renewed optimism about Led Zeppelin's future, with [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] in particular commenting that the band had "new energy"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and was "almost in a rebirth situation."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; John Bonham's death, however, resulted in the scuttling of the band's touring plans, and ultimately in the demise of Led Zeppelin itself, with the breakup of the band officially announced on 4 December 1980.

While Jones's view of the state of Led Zeppelin on the eve of the 1980 North American tour was a positive one, writer [[Chris Welch]] saw things differently. In his biography of Peter Grant, Welch questioned the wisdom of the band undertaking a U.S. tour at that point in time:

{{cquote|It seems strange that Grant was quite so determined to get the band back to America, given all they had been through and the musicians' state of health. Was it just for the money? They already had an avalanche of income from record sales and publishing royalties. How many more cars, houses, farms, and antiques could they buy?&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002) p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Welch and writers Dave Lewis and Mick Wall particularly questioned John Bonham's physical and emotional fitness to tour North America at that stage. They note that by the fall of 1980 Bonham's dislike of touring, which had been steadily growing over the years, was virtually as strong as Plant's. He was particularly nervous about the potential backlash he might experience in the U.S. from his involvement in the backstage brawl at the Oakland Coliseum during Led Zeppelin's 1977 tour.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 219; Welch (2009), p. 140-141.&lt;/ref&gt; As Bonham grew older, moreover, the demands of touring—along with the effects of his alcohol and drug use—took an increasing toll on his energy and stamina, and by 1980 he was struggling with fatigue. He had already permanently dropped his lengthy drum solos from the band's onstage performances.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2009), p. 142-143.&lt;/ref&gt; While he came across to Lewis at the time as "delighted"&lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; about the upcoming trek, Bonham privately confided on the eve of the ill-fated rehearsals for ''Led Zeppelin - The 1980s, Part One'' that he felt depressed and uneasy about going on tour, and that he felt his drumming was no longer up to scratch.&lt;ref&gt;Welch (2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly told Plant, "I've had it with playing drums. Everybody plays better than me. I'll tell you what, when we get to the rehearsal, you play the drums and I'll sing." &lt;ref&gt;Wall, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; After that initial rehearsal on 24 September, he complained again about going on tour while engaging in a drinking binge that would prove to be fatal.

Ironically, on 25 September, at the same time the rest of the band and its entourage were learning of Bonham's death, thousands of Led Zeppelin fans in Chicago were eagerly obtaining copies of that day's ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' containing mail order applications for the upcoming November concerts. This proved to be fruitless since the tour was immediately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis &amp; Pallett, p. 329-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the concerts on this tour, the band intended to use a scaled-down approach similar to the one they used for the European tour, which entailed fewer lighting effects, less improvisation, and fewer extended solos than their 1970s concerts. The previously rehearsed but unperformed ''In Through the Out Door'' track "[[Carouselambra]]" was included in the tentative set-list.

'''Let's do it 2008''' ({{lang-et|Teeme ära 2008}}) is the largest campaign to activate civic society in [[Estonia]] since the [[Singing Revolution]] in 1988.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} '''[[Let's Do It! World]]''' is a global campaign for cleaning all countries that grew out of Let's do it 2008. 

Over 50,000 people, or approximately 4% of the population of 1.3 million, participated in the cleanup of the forests and countryside, which would be proportionally equal to 15.3 million people in the United States, or 57 million people in India. Momentum for the event was built up with a media campaign from October 2007 to April 2008. The action was carried out during one day on 3 May 2008. More than 10,000 tons of garbage were removed from the country's forest in about 5 hours for less than 500,000 euros. Under normal circumstances it would have taken the government 3 years and 22.5 million euros to accomplish a similar feat.

==Organizers==
The initial team was:
* [[Rainer Nõlvak]]
* [[Toomas Trapido]]
* [[Kadri Allikmäe]]
* [[Henri Laupmaa]]

The group met at 29 August 2007 as recorded in the first protocol.

Other people of the main team:
* [[Ahti Heinla]]
* [[Eva Truuverk]]
* [[Tiina Urm]]
* [[Anneli Ohvril]]
* [[Jüri-Ott Salm]]

==Spreading the model==
* Since then Latvia has copied the event in September 2008 with 40,000 volunteers. Lithuania and Latvia did larger scale actions in April 2009 with 150,000 volunteers.
* The international cleanup action was announced in March 2009 and the city of Bengaluru (Bangalore) in India did similar action on 16 August 2009.
* On 17 April 2010 a similar event was organized in Slovenia - ''[[Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day!]]'' (''Očistimo slovenijo v enem dnevu'') with 12% of population participating (250.000 volunteers).
* In 2010 it is planned by Portugal (20 March), Romania (September), Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Moldova, Italy, France, Indian city of Delhi, capital of Ukraine Kyiv and some other Ukrainian towns.

This has led to the international action "[[Let's Do It! World]]" and the creation of [[World Cleanup Day]].

[[File:Cuba-Florida map.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Cuba]] is 90 miles (145 kilometres) south of Florida in the United States]]
[[Aircraft hijacking]] incidents between the United States and [[Cuba]] were at their height between 1968 and 1972. These incidents have variously been attributed to [[terrorism]], extortion, flight for political asylum, mental illness, and transportation between the two countries as a result of the ongoing antagonistic [[Cuba-United States relations]] and the Communist government restrictions against Cubans attempting to leave Cuba.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.start.umd.edu/publications/lafree_dugan_aerial_hijackings.pdf Testing a rational choice model of airline hijackings] Study of data  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822080601/http://www.start.umd.edu/publications/lafree_dugan_aerial_hijackings.pdf |date=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent measures by both governments contributed to a gradual reduction of reported incidents towards the mid-1970s. Governmental measures included an amendment to [[Cuban law]] which made hijacking a crime in 1970, the introduction of metal detectors in U.S. airports in 1973, and a joint agreement between the U.S. and Cuba signed in Sweden to return or prosecute hijackers.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

Below is a non-comprehensive list of hijacking incidents of aircraft between Cuba and the United States.

== 1950s ==
Before the Cuban Revolution:
* '''April 9, 1958''' A Douglas DC-3, ( CU-T266) piloted by Capt. Armando Piedra, Co-piloted by Ramon J. Vazquez (el Niño). [[Cubana de Aviación]] is hijacked en route from [[José Martí International Airport]], [[Havana]] to [[Abel Santa Maria Airport|Santa Clara Airport]]. The aircraft landed at [[Manuel Crescencio Rejón International Airport|Mérida-Rejón Airport]], [[Mexico]] where the hijack ended. This is considered first hijacking to take place in the Western Hemisphere and likely orchestrated by Fidel Castro.&lt;ref name=ASN090458&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19580409-0 |title=Hijacking description |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''April 12, 1958''' The crew of a [[Cuban Airlines]] [[DC-3]] with 12 passengers on board, diverted their flight from [[Havana]] to [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]] in Central Cuba, and flew, instead, to [[Miami, Florida]]. One of the passengers, [[United Press]] reporter Harold Lidin, said that the decision to defect was apparently made after take off.&lt;ref&gt;United Press, "Plane Commandeered, Flown Out of Cuba", ''The Washington Post and Times Herald'', Washington, D.C., Monday April 14, 1958, Volume 81, Number 130, page A5&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''November 1, 1958''' A [[Cubana de Aviación]] Flight 495, a [[Vickers Viscount]], en route from Miami to [[Varadero]] to [[Havana]] is hijacked by Cuban  militants. The hijackers were trying to land at Sierra Cristal in Eastern Cuba to deliver weapons to [[Fidel Castro]]'s rebels. As night approached, the plane ran out of fuel and tried an emergency landing at the Preston sugar mill.  It did not make it and instead landed in the ocean and broke apart, killing most passengers and crew. There were six survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/19/usa-cuba|title=Relatives claim passenger in 1958 plane crash off Cuba was a hijacker|first=McClatchy|last=newspapers|date=November 19, 2008|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:En route, Flight 696 landed in Denver to take on more fuel. While waiting for the fuel truck, the crew escaped the cockpit by jumping from the open cockpit windows. Without hostages, Thomas quickly surrendered to the FBI.

:The Seattle-based crew, which included Captain Alan Grout, First Officer Jack Bard, and Second Officer Luke Warfield were all injured during the escape. They subsequently recovered and returned to flight duty during the following months.

{{Campaignbox Pakistan–United States skirmishes}}
On 21 September 2008 at 10 pm local time, in the [[Ghulam Khan]] district of [[North Waziristan]] Pakistani soldiers fired on two American helicopter gunships that entered Pakistani airspace with 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm [[heavy machine gun]]s. The helicopters stopped and hovered for a while, before returning over the border to Afghanistan without retaliation. It is unknown if any of the helicopters sustained any damage in this first incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jqhY55584EVVKxIIbOeHrLWeoPvA Pakistani troops twice repel US choppers: officials] AFP, 23 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7628890.stm Pakistan troops 'repel US raid'] -''BBC News'', 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty minutes later, two gunships attempted to cross the border again at the same place. Pakistani regular and [[Frontier Corps]] troops fired warning shots into the air and away from the helicopters, causing the helicopters to turn back without attacking any targets in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Pak-troops-fire-at-US-helicopters-in-N-Waziristan/364409/ Pak troops fire at US helicopters in N Waziristan] – ''ExpressIndia.com'', 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
An Eric Trump Foundation staff biography of Patton states that she was involved in casting the 2012 and 2014 seasons of ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice]]''.&lt;ref name="ETFBIO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kirkland|first1=Allegra|title=Trump's Onetime Rivals Resurface For RNC's 'Make America First Again' Night|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/speakers-convention-make-america-first-again-night|work=[[Talking Points Memo]]|accessdate=November 16, 2017|date=July 20, 2016|quote=played a key role in casting the 2012 and 2014 seasons of "The Celebrity Apprentice."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the AP questioned the campaign's citation of her as a Trump Organization executive, her title on the Eric Trump Foundation's website and her profile on the LinkedIn service was changed to "vice president of the Eric Trump Foundation." That position did not appear on the foundation's most recent tax filing for 2014, which said Patton was one of 16 unpaid directors who devote approximately one hour per week to the charity. |title=Few if any minority senior execs in Trump's empire |first=Jeff |last=Horwitz |first2=Jake |last2=Pearson |date=June 16, 2016 |url=https://apnews.com/426e763d7a38472d9c1df8b799725084/few-if-any-minority-senior-execs-trumps-empire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her HUD financial disclosures stated that she had been a vice president and a board member at the Eric Trump Foundation from January 2009 to January 2017, and she speaks of being with the Trump family since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trump|first=Donald J.|date=February 1, 2017|title=Remarks at an African American History Month Listening Session|url=|journal=Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents|publisher=Superintendent of Documents|volume=|page=5|pages=|issn=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=10 Must Reads for the CRE Industry Today (June 14, 2017)|last=|first=|date=June 14, 2017|work=National Real Estate Investor|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|quote=Eric Trump Foundation Probe Casts Shadow Over HUD "The New York State Attorney General's investigation into possible misuse of funds at the Eric Trump Foundation is casting a shadow over the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where a former foundation vice president now works as a key adviser to Secretary Ben Carson.

In May 2016, during Donald Trump's 2016 Presidential campaign, Patton narrated a [[YouTube]] video called "The Trump Family I Know – A Black Female Trump Executive Speaks Out," in which she defended Trump against accusations that he was racist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention; the official convention program listed her position as "Vice President of The Eric Trump Foundation and Senior Assistant to Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump, Jr."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=2016 GOP Convention Program for Wednesday, July 20|last=|first=|date=July 20, 2016|work=U.S. Newswire|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|quote=Lynne Patton, The Eric Trump Foundation  Lynne Patton is Vice President of The Eric Trump Foundation and Senior Assistant to Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump, Jr. As VP, Lynne works in tandem with the Executive Director/President of the Foundation to oversee all operations, volunteers, events, outreach, social media, vendors, and corporate partnerships.

{{tone|date=November 2018}}

The '''Marlboro M Hoax''' was a false rumor originating from satire news website ''Abril Uno'' on April 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abriluno.com/phillip-morris-introduces-marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=Phillip Morris Introduces ‘Marlboro M’ Marijuana Cigarettes|last=RapidxHTML|work=Abril Uno|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was an [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] joke.

== Hoax ==
The article claims that Philip Morris, owner of the Marlboro tobacco company, is introducing a new line of marijuana cigarettes called Marlboro M in Colorado and the state of Washington. While fake, the article does have some factual basis, as tobacco companies have shown interest in marijuana since the 1970's.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BARRY|first=RACHEL ANN|last2=HIILAMO|first2=HEIKKI|last3=GLANTZ|first3=STANTON A.|date=2014-06|title=Waiting for the Opportune Moment: The Tobacco Industry and Marijuana Legalization|url=https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/waiting-for-the-opportune-moment-the-tobacco-industry-and-marijuana-legalization/|journal=Milbank Quarterly|language=en-US|volume=92|issue=2|pages=207–242|doi=10.1111/1468-0009.12055|issn=0887-378X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the article was quite obviously satire, it's intriguing title was able to make it around the internet before it could be disproved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/marlboro-marijuana-cigarettes/|title=FACT CHECK: Has Phillip Morris Introduced 'Marlboro M' Marijuana Cigarettes?|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/no-philip-morris-not-introduced-marlboro-m-cannabis-cigarette|title=False: Marlboro Marijuana Cigarettes from Phillip Morris {{!}} Leafly|date=2016-10-10|work=Leafly|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users, upon discovering that there were no 'Marlboro M' cigarettes at their local dispensary, claimed that they would be in stock by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Cannettes/comments/63jxuv/what_are_marijuana_cigarettes_called_cannettes/|title=r/Cannettes - What are Marijuana Cigarettes Called? (Cannettes)|website=reddit|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis ==
While the article was proven fake, its claims were able gain widespread belief because of past and current events in cannabis culture,{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} which themselves were true. For example, it is true that tobacco companies, including Phillip Morris, were interested in marijuana as a competing product and potentially an addition to their company, long before rapid legalization came about.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/big-tobacco-pot-weed-cannabis-industry-727407/|title=Big Tobacco Is Already Eyeing Pot|last=Benson|first=Thor|date=2018-09-25|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legalization is also a contributing factor to the blind acceptance these claims received, as societal views on marijuana use have largely shifted in recent years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/marycarreon/2018/05/17/new-study-highlights-the-social-impacts-of-cannabis-legalization-in-california/#1836c73e2194|title=New Study Highlights The Social Impacts Of Cannabis Legalization In California|last=Carreon|first=Mary|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tobacco companies have actually began investing in medical marijuana research, as well as joining with marijuana seed investment firms, though they haven't gone as far is to introduce cannabis cigarettes into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/07/22/big-tobacco-makes-its-first-investment-in-the-mari.aspx|title=Big Tobacco Makes Its First Investment in the Marijuana Industry --  The Motley Fool|last=Williams|first=Sean|date=2018-07-22|work=The Motley Fool|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, it would be illegal for such a large company, such as Philip Morris, to introduce cannabis cigarettes, as its use is still illegal on the federal level (in the US).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12202">A '''media monitoring service''', a '''press clipping service''' or a '''clipping service''' as known in earlier times, provides clients with copies of media content, which is of specific interest to them and subject to changing demand; what they provide may include documentation, content, analysis, or editorial opinion, specifically or widely. These services tend to specialize their coverage by subject, industry, size, geography, publication, journalist, or editor.  The printed sources, which could be readily monitored, greatly expanded with the advent of [[telegraphy]] and [[submarine communication cable|submarine cables]] in the mid- to late-19th century; the various types of media now available proliferated in the 20th century, with the development of [[radio]], [[television]], the [[photocopier]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. Though media monitoring is generally used for capturing content or editorial opinion, it also may be used to capture advertising content.

Media monitoring services have been variously termed over time, as new players entered the market, new forms of media were created, and as new uses from available content developed.  An existing group may provide such a monitoring service, as it relates to their main purpose, while a monitoring agency generally provides such as their main business.  Alternative terms for these monitoring services as well as the information they provide include:

*Press clipping service or agency
*Media cutting service or agency
*[[Information logistics]] service
*[[Media intelligence]]
*Media information services

==History==
{{See also|Imprimatur}}
Since [[mass media]] traditionally was limited solely to print media, naturally the monitoring was also limited to these media. The world's first press clipping agency was established in [[London]] in 1852 by a Polish newsagent named Romeike. Actors, writers, musicians and artists would visit his shop to look for articles about themselves in his Continental stock. It was then that Romeike realised that he could turn this into a profitable business. 

An agency named "L'Argus de la presse" was established in Paris in 1879 by Alfred Cherie, who offered a press-clipping service to Parisian actors, enabling them to buy reviews of their work rather than purchasing the whole newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamonitorsgroup.com/about-us/history Media Monitors Interactive history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430192851/http://mediamonitorsgroup.com/about-us/history |date=2010-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[radio]] and later [[television]] broadcasting were introduced in the 20th century, press clipping agencies began to expand their services into the monitoring of these broadcast media, and this task was greatly facilitated by the development of commercial audio and video tape recording systems in the 1950s and 1960s. With the growth of the [[Internet]] in the 1990s, media monitoring service extended their services to the monitoring of online information sources using new digital search and scan technologies to provide output of interest to their clients.

Then, in 1998, the now defunct WebClipping&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webclipping.com WebClipping website]&lt;/ref&gt; website was the first firm to start monitoring Internet based news media, moving the industry toward tracking digital news quickly.

Typically, individual or organisational clients &amp;ndash; e. g. private companies and corporations, charities, government departments and ministries &amp;ndash; will subscribe to a media monitoring service to keep track of what is being said about them, their field of operations, their competitors, or other specified topics of interest.

==Industry==
The news monitoring industry provides government agencies, corporations, public relations professionals, and other organizations access to news information created by the media. Generally monitoring print, broadcast, and internet [[digital content|content]] for any mention of specific subjects of interest, a news monitoring company will analyze and provide feedback to their client in the form of press clippings, monitoring reports, and media analysis.

==Evolution==

From a cut &amp; clip service, media clipping today has expanded to incorporate technology with information.  Media monitoring clients can now opt to include print, broadcast and online to capture all their media exposure.  While this technology has allowed some of the process to be automated, many media monitoring agencies still offer the services of trained professionals to review and validate results.

Service delivery happens at three fronts. Clients may get their original hard copy clips through traditional means (mail/overnight delivery) or may opt for digital delivery.  Digital delivery allows the end user to receive via email all the relevant news of the company, competition and industry daily, with updates as they break.  The same news may also be indexed (as allowed by copyright laws) in a searchable database to be accessed by subscribers. Another option of this service is auto-analysis, wherein the data can be viewed &amp; compared in different formats.

Every organization that uses PR invariably uses news monitoring as well. In addition to tracking their own publicity, self-generated or otherwise, news monitoring clients also use the service to track competition or industry specific trends or legislation, to build a contact base of reporters, experts, leaders for future reference, to audit the effectiveness of their [[PR campaign]]s, to verify that PR, [[marketing]] and sales messages are in sync, and to measure impact on their target market. City, State, and Federal agencies use news monitoring services to stay informed in regions they otherwise would not be able to monitor themselves and to verify that the public information disseminated is accurate, accessible in multiple formats and available to the public. Some monitoring services specialize in one or more areas of press clipping, TV and radio monitoring, or [[internet tracking]]. Media analysis is also offered by most news monitoring services.

Television news monitoring companies, especially in the United States, capture and index [[closed captioning]] text and search it for client references. Some TV monitoring companies employ human monitors who review and abstract program content; other services rely on automated search programs to search and index stories.

Online media monitoring services utilize automated software called [[web spider|spiders]] or robots (bots) to automatically monitor the content of free online news sources including newspapers, magazines, trade journals, TV station and news syndication services.  Online services generally provide links but may also provide text versions of the articles.  Results may or may not be verified for accuracy by the online monitoring service.  Most newspapers do not include all of their print content online and some have web content that does not appear in print.

In the United States, there are trade associations formed to share best practices which include the North American Conference of Press Clipping Services and the International Association of Broadcast Monitors.

==Language and media – the big challenges==

In English speaking countries, the service of media monitoring, [[collation]] &amp; [[dissemination]] is fairly simple and most organizations which use [[Public Relations]] also use media monitoring. However, in multi-language &amp; multi-dialect countries the challenge of collating data locally and disseminating in a [[language translation|translated]] language of business (usually English) is a daunting task. The situation in other multi-language countries is no different.

The second large challenge for Information Logistics is the growing number of media and the media types. For example, in a country like [[media in India|India]] there are over 50,000 registered print publications, 250+ TV channels, a growing number of relevant internet sites and several hundred new blogs that need to be captured every day. Several of these need to be translated for a 'heads-up' and analysis needs to be constant and real-time.

An author that recently published a book and who has a strong interest in tracking how well the book is received by [[critic]]s may hire a media monitoring service. The service will have a method by which they extract any information about the author and their book from newly printed [[magazine]]s, radio programs, television programs and so on. The author will receive a printed bundle of ''clippings'', i.e., the pages of the magazines and [[newspaper]]s relating to them and their book.  They may also receive recordings of any radio reviews, television programs and so on, which refer to his book.

Most major companies and corporations subscribe to media monitoring services to keep track of any reports or comments in the media. A fast food company, for example, would receive summaries of coverage and/or copies of material drawn from a wide range of sources, including TV and radio news reports, commentaries on TV and radio shows, newspaper opinion/commentary columns, magazine articles and internet [[blog]]s.

The material collected would include any media items that relate to the company's commercial operations, its corporate [[reputation management|reputation]] or its media image. This would include reports about or discussions of the [[fast food industry]] in general, and any media item that specifically mentions the company, its clients and suppliers, its competitors or related interest groups or other specified subjects of interest, such as food/health regulations.

===Trade groups===
The [[International Association of Broadcast Monitors]] (IABM) is a worldwide [[trade association]] made up of news retrieval services which record, monitor and archive broadcast news sources including television, radio and internet.  It acts as a "clearinghouse" or "forum" for discussion on topics of collective concerns and acts as a united voice for the news monitoring industry.

===Professional organization===
[[FIBEP]] (Federation Internationale des Bureaux d’Extraits de Presse/International Federation of the Press Clipping Services) is a professional media monitoring organization. The FIBEP was established in 1953 in [[Paris]] and has close to 100 members from 44 countries. Every 18 months, the members of FIBEP members organize a three-day FIBEP-Congress. In work groups, workshops, reports and discussion circles, members discuss market trends.

==Law cases==
{{main|Associated Press v. Meltwater|Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA) v The Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA)}}
Two parallel cases developed in 2012, [[Associated Press v. Meltwater|one in the United States]], and [[Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA) v The Newspaper Licensing Agency (NLA)|one in the United Kingdom]]. In each case, the legality of temporary copies and the online media monitoring service offered to clients, was in dispute. Essentially the two cases covered the same issue (media clippings shown to clients online) and with the same defendant, [[Meltwater Group]]. The plaintiff differed, being [[List of copyright collection societies|a UK copyright collection society]] (UK) rather than [[Associated Press]] (US), but upon parallel grounds.

The activity was ruled unlawful in the US (under the "[[fair use]]" doctrine) and lawful in the UK (under UK and EU copyright law, in summary on the basis that mere viewing is never an infringement, and temporary copies to enable a lawful purpose are themselves lawful).

It was the subject of a hoax article published in 2011 by ''The White Pine Series of Architectural Monographs'', which described the community as being a flourishing [[Victorian-era]] village in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] during the early 20th century. According to the article, New Milford had been incorporated in 1852 by working-class quarry workers, had enjoyed prosperity for many years, and then declined in the early 20th century, following a succession of unfortunate disasters at the quarry site, the decline of rail-based tourism, the [[Great Depression]], and the outbreak of World Wars. Research by the [[Milford, New Hampshire]], Historical Society and the New Hampshire State Library following the publication of the article led to the discovery that the article was fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cabinet.com/cabinetcabinetnews/914158-308/tale-of-milford-history.html| title=Tale of Milford History| author=Kathy Cleveland| publisher=''The Milford Cabinet''| date=March 31, 2011| accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''news bureau''' is an office for gathering or distributing [[news]]. Similar terms are used for specialized bureaux, often to indicate geographic location or scope of coverage: a ‘Tokyo bureau’ refers to a given news operation's office in [[Tokyo]]; 'foreign bureau' is a generic term for a news office set up in a country other than the primary operations center; a ‘Washington bureau’ is an office, typically located in [[Washington, D.C.]], that covers news related to national politics in the [[United States]]. The person in charge of a news bureau is often called the bureau chief.

The term is distinct from a news desk, which refers to the editorial function of assigning reporters and other staff, and otherwise coordinating, news stories, and sometimes the physical desk where that occurs, but without regard to the geographic location or overall operation of the news organization.  For example, a foreign bureau is located in a foreign country and refers to all creative and administrative operations that take place there, whereas a foreign desk describes only editorial functions and may be located anywhere, possibly as an organizational unit within the news organization's home office.

==Operation of news bureaux==
A news bureau is traditionally operated out of an office by a single news outlet such as a radio, television, or newspaper news program.  A single news company such as [[CNN]] or [[NPR]] may use a single bureau and office staff for all of its programs, and even those of [[subsidiary]] or other affiliated companies.  For convenience, to save money and space, and to ensure the availability of necessary services (such as video feeds and studios), different companies may share an office space or co-locate at a single office building.  [[News agencies]] may also operate news bureaux, and major public relations sources (such as governments, large companies, or advocacy groups) may operate news bureaux of their own to create, rather than simply report, news stories.

==History of news bureaux==
&lt;!--
===Origin===
insert content here
--&gt;

===Decline===

Traditional [[news media]], particularly [[television news]] and [[newspapers]], have cut the number and size of news bureaux in recent decades for several reasons.  They face declining profitability due to increasing competition from Internet news sources, and therefore have less money to spend on news-gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2007-11-12|title=NBC Says Viewers Won’t Notice Cuts in News Staff|author=Jaques Steinberg|date=October 20, 2006|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/20/business/media/20nbc.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers rely increasingly on cooperative arrangements with counterparts elsewhere, and often will accept stories from their sister organizations rather than investigating stories themselves.  Similarly, smaller newspapers may formally affiliate to sponsor cooperative bureaux that operate as [[press pool]]s to serve more than one news organization (and sometimes a large number of organizations) from a single office.  When news sources combine operations following a [[merger]] or other [[Consolidation (business)|business consolidation]], the surviving company often combines or eliminates redundant bureaux.  Growing [[multiculturalism]] has facilitated this process: rather than demanding a reporter from their own country or locale who has been sent on assignment, news audiences have come to tolerate or even expect to see stories in remote locations covered by people who live locally; this empowers the audience to make their own judgments about any apparent cultural difference between themselves and the news subjects, rather than leaving the function of cultural interpretation entirely up to the reporter.

The often-criticized practice of [[parachute journalism]] allows [[News media]] to cover stories remotely using journalists who are generalists rather than more specialized field experts.  Rather than leaving journalists in place waiting for breaking news to occur, smaller staff can be assigned as needed to wherever there are breaking stories, either by commuting to the physical location or by synthesizing reports from remote sources.  An even more controversial practice, sometimes described as a reaction to declining resources rather than a legitimate cost-saving measure, is to rely on and reprint information from [[press release]]s written by [[public relations]] professionals working for people or companies that are the subject of an article, or have an interest in an article, without spending the resources to verify or conduct independent research on the matter.  Another practice that limits news bureaux is [[embedded reporter|embedded reporting]], whereby [[war correspondent]]s travel under the care of military units rather than at their own direction.  The ability to quickly and safely travel throughout a war zone, and to obtain interviews with soldiers and coverage of important conflicts, appeals to news media, but at the cost of journalistic independence and, according to some, objectivity.

==Nontraditional bureaux==

The interaction between professional journalists, witnesses, and news subjects has evolved considerably.  Whereas news subjects and bystanders were once treated simply as [[witnesses]] to be interviewed for a [[news story]], media have now accepted them as part of the news process.  There are many antecedents to [[Citizen journalism]].  For example, meteorologists would count on amateurs to gather weather data to report, or interview willing subjects unrelated to a news story for "[[man on the street]]" interviews.  As early as the 1930s the [[Soviet Union]] encouraged millions of amateur [[People's correspondent]]s to expose corruption and otherwise report on news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=Moscow Times|date= July 3, 2006|title=Proletarian Bloggers Celebrate a Milestone|author=Carl Schreck|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/07/03/002.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, media, unable to respond quickly enough to obtain compelling coverage of natural disasters and weather phenomena such as [[tornadoes]] would count on hobbyists for photographs and film footage.  With improvements in technology and as [[video camera]]s and [[Videophone|video-equipped cell phone]]s became widely available, they set up formal programs to gather material from nonprofessionals.  For example, in August, 2006, [[CNN]] launched "CNN Exchange", by which the public is encouraged to submit "I-Reports" comprising photographs, videos, or news accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-13|publisher=C/Net|title=CNN snatching page out of YouTube's book|author=Greg Sandoval|date=July 30, 2006|url=http://www.news.com/2100-1025-6100139.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel|accessdate=2007-11-14|title=CNN welcoming citizen journalists|author=Scott Leith|date=August 1, 2006|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=478319}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently newspapers have incorporated [[blogs]], once seen as a threat to conventional news practice, either by creating blogs of their own (and deputizing local or field-specific bloggers as a second, lower-paid tier among their recognized staff of [[independent contractor]]s) or by covering blogs as news sources.

In 2006 [[Reuters]] opened its first virtual news Bureau, staffing real-life reporters in a virtual office in [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14|publisher=USA Today|title=Reuters opens virtual news bureau in 'Second Life'|date=October 10, 2006|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/gaming/2006-10-16-reuters-second-life_x.htm?POE=TECISVA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[CNN]] followed suit in October 2007, but took a citizen journalism approach, allowing residents of Second Life to submit their own reportage.&lt;ref name="mw"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2007-11-14 |publisher=Media Week |title=CNN To Launch Bureau in Second Life Virtual World |author=Mike Shields |date=October 29, 2007 |url=http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031060212/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/news/recent_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003664297 |archivedate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the news audience of Second World is relatively small, and declining, media consider it a training ground for themselves and participants, applicable to future virtual news projects.&lt;ref name="mw"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13141">[[Image:Manuscript Thet Oera Linda Bok, pagina 48.jpg|thumb|280px|Page 48 of the Oera Linda manuscript]]
The '''Oera Linda Book''' is a manuscript written in a form of [[Old Frisian]], purporting to cover historical, mythological, and religious themes of remote antiquity, from 2194 BCE to 803 CE. Among academics in [[Germanic philology]], the document is widely considered to be a [[hoax]] or [[forgery]].

The manuscript first came to public awareness in the 1860s. In 1872, Jan Gerhardus Ottema published a Dutch translation and defended it as genuine. Over the next few years there was a heated public controversy, but by 1879 it was universally accepted that the text was a recent composition. Nevertheless, a public controversy was revived in the context of 1930s [[Nazi occultism]], and the book is still occasionally brought up in esotericism and [[Atlantis]] literature. The manuscript's author is not known with certainty, hence it is unknown whether the intention was to produce a [[hoax]], a [[parody]] or simply an exercise in poetic fantasy.

Historian Goffe Jensma published a monograph on the manuscript in 2004, ''De gemaskerde god'' ("The Masked God"), including a new translation and a discussion of the history of its reception. Jensma concludes that it was probably intended as a "hoax to fool some nationalist [[Frisia|Frisians]] and orthodox Christians", as well as an "experiential exemplary exercise" by Dutch theologian and poet [[Piet Paaltjens|François Haverschmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://historischhuis.nl/recensiebank/review/show/414] {{ISBN|90-6550-841-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zeker ook nieuw aan mijn boek is wat ik op grond van het handschrift zelf kon concluderen over de tijd van ontstaan en over de wijze waarop het is gemaakt, namelijk in een aantal fases en niet door één auteur, maar zeker door twee en vermoedelijk door drie auteurs.'' [http://www.semafoor.net/Jensmareactie.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of reception==

===19th century===
The Oera Linda Book, known in [[Old Frisian]] as ''Thet Oera Linda Bok'', came to light in 1867 when Cornelis Over de Linden (1811&amp;ndash;1874) handed the manuscript, which he claimed to have inherited from his grandfather, via his aunt, over to Eelco Verwijs (1830&amp;ndash;1880), the provincial librarian of Friesland, for translation and publication. Verwijs rejected the manuscript, but in 1872 Jan Gerhardus Ottema (1804&amp;ndash;1879), a prominent member of the Frisian Society for History and Culture, published a Dutch translation. Ottema believed it to be written in authentic [[Old Frisian]]. The book was subsequently translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876, and published by Trübner &amp; Co. of London.

Within the first few years after the appearance of the Oera Linda Book, its recent origin was established not only based on the exceptional claims being made, but also because of a number of anachronisms it contained. The text was nevertheless a source of inspiration for a number of occultists and speculative historians. While there was some debate among Dutch academics and in a number of newspapers about the book's authenticity during the 1870s, by 1879 it was widely recognized as a forgery.

===Nazi Germany===
More than forty years later, beginning in 1922, Dutch ''[[völkisch]]'' philologist [[Herman Wirth]] revived the issue. Wirth published a German translation of what he dubbed the "Nordic Bible" in 1933, as ''Die Ura Linda Chronik''.

A panel discussion on Wirth's book at the University of Berlin on 4 May 1934 was the immediate impulse for the foundation of the [[Ahnenerbe]] Nazi "[[think tank]]" by [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] and Wirth, together with [[Richard Walther Darré]]. Because of the infatuation of Himmler with the Oera Linda Book and its consequent association with Nazi occultism, it became known as "Himmler's Bible". Wirth's book was by no means universally acclaimed among the Nazi-era Nordicist academics, and the 1934 panel discussion was steeped in heated controversy. [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and his circle rejected it. [[Gustav Neckel]] had praised Wirth's work before publication, but upon seeing its content published a dismayed recension.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Tag'', Berlin,  31. December 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in defense of the book's authenticity were [[Walther Wüst]] and [[Otto Huth]], besides Wirth himself. Speaking against its authenticity were Neckel, Karl Hermann Jacob-Friesen (who identified it as a satirical hoax by Linden) and [[Arthur Hübner]]. Hübner was one of the most respected Germanists of his generation, and his verdict of the Oera Linda being a falsification settled the defeat of Wirth's party. The public defeat of Himmler's scholarly brand of "esoteric Nordicism" resulted in the foundation of Ahnenerbe, which attracted occultists such as [[Karl Maria Wiligut]] and was viewed with suspicion by the mainstream National Socialist ideologues of [[Amt Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Simon, [http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/gerd.simon/himmlerbibel.pdf Himmlers Bibel und die öffentlichkeitswirksamste Podiumsdiskussion in der Geschichte der Germanistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern esotericism===
The book experienced a revival of popularity in the English-speaking world with the writings of Robert Scrutton. In ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) he reproduced the full text of Sandbach's 1876 English translation, interspersed with his own commentaries on history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) {{ISBN|0-72217-665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) he became the first to link the book with the concept of [[earth mysteries]], and, in particular, [[ley lines]] and [[telluric current|telluric energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) {{ISBN|0-72217-667-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Scrutton's example, English language accounts of the Oera Linda Book tend to place it within the [[New Age]] or [[alternate history]] genres, and do not associate it with National Socialism, as is the case in Germany.

Another figure to formulate a contemporary [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan]] tradition influenced by the Oera Linda Book was Tony Steele, who considered the book to reveal the genuine truth about the ancient European [[megalith|megalithic culture]]. In ''Water Witches'' (1998) he examined the book's use as a cultural identity marker by the Frisian-descended canal folk of the [[The Midlands|English Midlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''Water Witches'' (1998) {{ISBN|1-86163-049-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) he connected the religious practices of the priestesses described in the book with later medieval [[witchcraft]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) {{ISBN|1-86163-140-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
Among those who doubt the book's authenticity, the most popular candidates for the author of the manuscript are Cornelis Over de Linden or Eelco Verwijs. A recent third choice is the Protestant preacher François Haverschmidt (1835&amp;ndash;1894), well known for writing poetry under the pseudonym Piet Paaltjens. Haverschmidt lived in Friesland and was an acquaintance of Verwijs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepsis.nl/oeralinda/ Skepsis.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goffe Jensma (2004) argued that Haverschmidt was the main writer of the book, with the help of Over de Linden and Verwijs. According to Jensma, Haverschmidt intended the Oera Linda Book as a parody of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]]. An article in late 2007 by Jensma&lt;ref&gt;Extraordinary professor of Frisian Language and Culture, in particular the literary-historical aspects of Frisian, at the Faculty of Humanities of the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]]&lt;/ref&gt; says that the three authors of the translation intended it "to be a temporary hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians and as an experiential exemplary exercise in reading the Holy Bible in a non-fundamentalist, symbolical way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/news/2004/11/122_00?lang=en ''Oera Linda-boek was poging van Haverschmidt om bijbel te ontkrachten''] [[Rijks Universiteit Groningen]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring clues that it was a forgery, J. G. Ottema took it seriously, and it achieved popularity for the reasons given above. Its creators felt unable to admit that they had written it, and it became the foundation for new occult beliefs. Jensma concludes his article by saying "It is a perfect irony that a book written to unmask the Holy Bible as a book of human making was to become a bible itself."&lt;ref name="Jensma"&gt;{{Citation|title=How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science.

==Contents==
Themes running through the Oera Linda Book include [[catastrophism]], [[nationalism]], [[matriarchy]], and [[mythology]]. The text alleges that Europe and other lands were, for a large part of their history, ruled by a succession of folk-mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess [[Frijjo|Frya]], daughter of the creator god Wr-alda and Jrtha, the earth mother. The claim is also made that this Frisian civilization possessed an alphabet that was the ancestor of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Phoenician alphabet]]s. Modern [[historiography]] is essentially ignored, particularly in the area of basic chronology of known events in the recent and distant past of Europe. Geological as well as geographical evidence that was readily available even as far back as Over de Linden's time is also mostly absent from the manuscript.

The earliest portion of the Oera Linda Book, namely ''Frya’s Tex'', was supposedly composed in 2194 BC, whereas the most recent part, the letter of Hidde Oera Linda, dates to AD 1256. Almost half of the entire book comprises ''The Book of Adela’s Followers'', the original text around which the rest grew. It is purported to have been compiled in the 6th century BC from a mixture of contemporary writings and ancient inscriptions. The last two sections of the Oera Linda Book contain a number of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] and the book itself breaks off in mid-sentence.

It also describes a lost land called [[Atlantis|Atland]] (the name given to Atlantis by the 17th century scholar [[Olof Rudbeck]]), which was supposedly submerged in 2194 BC, the same year as 19th century Dutch and Frisian almanacs, following traditional Biblical chronology given for [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="Jensma"/&gt;

===Sections===

The Oera Linda Book is divided into six sections, further subdivided into a total of 53 chapters.

* Letters
* The Book of Adela's Followers 
* The Writings of Adelbrost and Apollonia 
* The Writings of Frêthorik and Wiljow
* The Writing of Konerêd
* Fragments

'''Sustainable event management''' (also known as '''event greening''') is the process used to produce an [[wikt:event|event]] with particular concern for environmental, economic and social issues. [[Sustainability]] in event management incorporates socially and [[environmentally responsible]] decision making into the planning, organisation and implementation of, and participation in, an event. It involves including sustainable development principles and practices in all levels of event organisation, and aims to ensure that an event is hosted responsibly. It represents the total package of interventions at an event, and needs to be done in an integrated manner. Event greening should start at the inception of the project, and should involve all the key role players, such as clients, organisers, venues, sub-contractors and suppliers.

== History ==
The first time that environmental concerns were raised by the public was at the [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Albertville Winter Olympics]] in France, which led to the first ‘green Games’ in [[1994 Winter Olympics|Lillehammer, Norway]], in 1994. The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee received the [http://www.unep.org/sport_env/about.aspx UNEP Global 500 Award] for setting environmental standards which were absent from previous Olympic games.

The Centennial Olympic Congress, Congress of Unity, held in Paris in 1994, recognised the importance of the environment and sustainable development, which led to the inclusion of a paragraph in Rule 2 of the Olympic Charter. The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) has acknowledged its particular responsibility in terms of promoting sustainable development, and regards the environment as the third dimension of Olympism, alongside sport and culture. This led to its decision in 1995 to create an [http://www.olympic.org/sport-environment-commission IOC Sport and Environment Commission].&lt;ref&gt;International Olympic Committee, Sport and Environment Commission, http://www.olympic.org/sport-environment-commission&lt;/ref&gt; 

Environmental Guidelines for the Summer Olympics were developed to guide Olympic hosts to ensure that facilities are constructed in a more environmentally friendly manner. The Guidelines were successfully used in the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. As a result, the organizers of the Sydney Games were honoured with the Global 500 Award in 2001 for organizing the greenest games ever. Since then, other major sports events have also considered their environmental impact. 

A major aspect of [http://www.unep.org/sport_env/ UNEP]’s work is with the IOC. A cooperative agreement was signed in 1994 with IOC and an Agenda 21 for Sport and Environment developed. Since 2002, UNEP has participated in a task force of the UN Secretary-General on the use of sport for the implementation of the United Nations Development Goals.  UNEP also supports the IOC in organizing world conferences and regional seminars on sport and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, Sport and Environment, http://www.unep.org/sport_env/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2006 FIFA World CupTM in Germany, Green Goal was launched, which was also implemented in South Africa for the 2010 FIFA World CupTM.  The Host City [https://web.archive.org/web/20100608185533/http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/greengoal/Pages/default.aspx Cape Town Green Goal] programme had been awarded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Sport and Environment Award. Nominated by [https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/southafrica2010/news/newsid=1476740/index.html FIFA], the award recognised the efforts of the Host City [[Cape Town]] to mitigate negative environmental impacts of the FIFA World Cup and to maximise a positive environmental and social legacy.&lt;ref&gt;City of Cape Town, Green Goal Programme, {{cite web |url=http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/GreenGoal/Pages/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608185533/http://www.capetown.gov.za/en/greengoal/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=2010-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Event greening is however not only limited to sports events, and other examples include the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD), [[Johannesburg]] 2002, and [[COP15|UNFCCC 15th Conference of the Parties]] (COP15) held in [[Copenhagen]] in 2010.



==Monitoring and evaluation ==
[[Monitoring and Evaluation|Monitoring and evaluation]] is an essential component of event greening, and should be used to make continuous improvement. A detailed plan needs to be in place to ensure that information is gathered on all aspects of the event – before, during, and also after the event. This ensures that information is available to understand the effects of greening interventions (e.g. to what extent was water used, and how did water-saving measures reduce water use), as well as the potential improvements to future event-greening initiatives.

With large events it is best to ensure an independent report, which complies with international standards, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalreporting.org/reporting/sector-guidance/event-organizers/Pages/default.as&lt;/ref&gt; The GRI Event Organizers Supplement provides organizations in the sector with a tailored version of GRI’s Reporting Guidelines. It includes the original Guidelines, which set out the Reporting Principles, Disclosures on Management Approach and Performance Indicators for economic, environmental and social issues. The Event Organizers Supplement’s capture the issues that matter most for event organizers to be reported on:
* Site selection
* Transport of attendees
* Recruiting and training of the event workforce, participants and volunteers
* Sourcing of materials, supplies and services
* Managing impacts on communities, natural environments, and local and global economies.
* Planning and managing potential legacies
* Accessibility of an event

The British Standard ([http://www.bsigroup.co.uk/en/Assessment-and-Certification-services/Management-systems/Standards-and-Schemes/BS-8901/ BS 8901]) has been developed specifically for the events industry with a purpose of helping the industry to operate in a more sustainable manner. The standard defines the requirements for a sustainability event management system to ensure an enduring and balanced approach to economic activity, environmental responsibility and social progress relating to events.

It requires organizations to identify and understand the effects that their activities have on the environment, on society and on the economy both within the organization and the wider economy; and put measures in place to minimize the negative effects.  These standards will however be replaced by the International Standard ([http://www.iso.org/iso/pressrelease.htm?refid=Ref1281 ISO 20121]) for Sustainability Management Systems.

'''The Fifth Column Podcast''' is an American politics, news and humor podcast founded in April, 2016.  The show is hosted by [[Kmele Foster]], with co-hosts [[Michael C. Moynihan]], [[Matt Welch]] and produced by contributor [https://www.anthonylfisher.com/ Anthony L. Fisher] and Daniel Bier.  The podcast is described as in each episode as an “...almost weekly thoughtful commentary on the news, those who make it and occasionally ourselves”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wethefifth.com/episodes/2018/3/12/stormy-social-media-q-mdf8t-gwmfc-mlw4s-dlwdt-xxtzd-psbc3-xmyrf-6ml8a-bgcn4-ns82z-ny8yb-ww44l-sr9ce-2zhfh-3zbfs-ez68r-zsjyw-ymsts-glnfc-p77pw-mwa47-hb2fy-85b74|title=116 w/ Harry Siegel "Soros' Paid Protest Mobs, Team Woke vs Team Resentment"|last=|first=|date=|website=wethefifth.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The show is closely associated with independent-leaning, libertarian and anarcho-capitalist ideology as presented by the show hosts and guests, but is not explicitly so. 

=== Background and Format ===
'''[http://wethefifth.com/ The Fifth Column Podcast]''' first aired on iTunes April 2, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fifth-column-analysis-commentary-sedition/id1097696129?mt=2|title=The Fifth Column Podcast - iTunes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show markets itself as “Analysis. Commentary. Sedition” on Instagram&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/we.the.fifth/|title=The Fifth Column Podcast - Instagram|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as “@MattWelch @mcmoynihan @Kmele pick apart the news, interrogate their guests and question just about everything #someidiotwrotethis” on Twitter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/wethefifth|title=wethefifth - Twitter|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The introduction to the podcast typically describes itself as:  “…your almost weekly rhetorical assault on the news cycle, the people who make it and occasionally ourselves…”.  Credit for the shows creation has been attributed to the encouragement of [[Kennedy (commentator)|Kennedy]] (Lisa Kennedy Montgomery) and her husband Dave Lee, who are associates of the hosts.  The name of the podcast has been attributed to a suggestion by [[Katherine Mangu-Ward]] as revealed in Episode 13 (3:05 mark)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-fifth-column-analysis-commentary-sedition/id1097696129?mt=2|title="Islamic [REDACTED] and OJ Simpson"|last=|first=|date=June 21, 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The original music that opens and closes the podcast includes a soundbite of F.D.R.’s speech given 1940/05/27 warning prejudices exploited by Fifth [[iarchive:1940-05-27_FDR_Warns_of_Fifth_Column|Columnists]].

'''''The Sound of Music Live!''''' is a [[television special]] that was originally broadcast by NBC on December 5, 2013. Produced by [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]], the special was an adaptation of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. The television special starred [[country music|country]] singer and ''[[American Idol]]'' winner [[Carrie Underwood]] as [[Maria von Trapp]], and was performed and televised [[live television|live]] from [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]].

Spearheaded by NBC chairman [[Robert Greenblatt|Bob Greenblatt]], the network positioned the special as being a live [[event television|television "event"]]. In preparing for the broadcast, Meron and Zadan emphasized the logistical challenges that they would face due to the live aspects of the special, and the fact that ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was an adaptation based on the musical itself and not the [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]]. Meron felt that if the telecast were successful, the concept could become "another kind of entertainment that can exist on TV." By her request, Underwood's casting as Maria was personally endorsed by [[Julie Andrews]], who starred in the 1965 film.

The production was met with mixed reviews; much of its criticism was directed towards the casting of Carrie Underwood to play Maria, whom critics (including the real-life [[von Trapp family]]) believed was not experienced enough in theatre to portray such an iconic role. While her vocal performance was praised, her acting was described by critics as "amateur", "lifeless" and lacking emotion. The production was a ratings success for NBC; with a total of 18.62 million live viewers, ''The Sound of Music Live!'' brought the network its highest Thursday night viewership for an entertainment program since the [[Goodnight, Seattle|series finale]] of ''[[Frasier (TV series)|Frasier]]'' in 2004, and prompted NBC to sign Zadan and Meron on to produce more live musicals for the network in the future.

==Plot==
Maria Rainer, a [[postulant]] at [[Nonnberg Abbey]] in [[Salzburg]], is contemplating the day she has spent in the mountains ("The Sound of Music").  When she returns to the Abbey, she learns from the Mother Abbess that she is to be the new governess for the von Trappe children.  Before she leaves the Abbey, Mother Abbess asks her to teach her the song that she's always singing ("My Favorite Things"). When Maria arrives at the von Trappe house, she is greeted coldly by the Captain and introduced to the children, who enter with military precision. Maria  finds that the Captain has emotionally closed himself off since the death of his wife and decides to teach his children the basics of singing to gain their trust and acceptance.

A month, later the captain returns home with Elsa Schraeder, whom he is courting, and their friend Max Detweiler, who is looking for the perfect local singing group to perform at the annual Kaltzberg Festival. When his children arrive dressed in clothes Maria had made from her old bedroom curtains he is outraged and embarrassed. Maria then confronts him and tells him how he does not know or understand his children and that they need him but this only upsets him more and he orders her to return to Nonnberg Abbey. However, upon hearing his children sing to Schraeder, his eyes are open to the truth Maria had been speaking and he embraces his children and ask Maria to stay on as governess.

He then throws a grand party for Schraeder and when the band plays the [[Ländler]], the captain's youngest son asks Maria to teach him the dance and the captain steps in to help. As the two dance an unspoken attraction begins to arise in the two and Maria puts a stop to the dancing. However, this unspoken attraction did not go unnoticed by Brigitta who confronts Maria on this. Though Maria strongly denies it she begins to realize that Brigitta is telling the truth. Then, Schraeder calls the children out to say good night to the guests and Max is instantly smitten with the idea to have the children sing in the festival and during all the hustle and bustle Maria sneaks off unnoticed and returns to the Abbey, where she confides in the Mother Abbess that she has fallen in love with the captain but that she is ready to take the orders of [[poverty, obedience and chastity]]. The Mother Abbess denies her this and encourages her to take face her problem head-on and to find the life she was born to live.

Maria then returns to the von Trapp home and is warmly greeted by the children, who no longer feel the joys of singing due to her sudden departure. When she finds out that the captain intends to marry Schraeder she decides to see her duties through until arrangements can be made for a new governess. However, the political differences between Schraeder and the captain cause the two to realize that they have no future together and she leaves. Meanwhile, the captain confronts Maria and the two admit their feelings for each other. The two agree to marry at the Abbey and while the two are on honeymoon, [[Anschluss|Germany invades Austria]].

When they return, the captain is ordered to accept a commission in the German Navy and report immediately to [[Bremerhaven]]. Maria, thinking quickly, hands the Admiral the program for the Kaltzberg Festival showing that the von Trapp Family Singers are scheduled to perform, so the captain couldn’t possibly leave right away. They are granted permission to perform. During the finale, Max announces that a guard of honor is waiting to escort the captain away as soon as the concert is over. Maria leads the family in one more song to which they escape to one by one and flee to the Abbey. The Nazi soldiers search the Abbey for the von Trapps to no avail, as the family decides to flee Austria over the mountains with Maria's help.&lt;ref name="Synopsis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/music/the-sound-of-music-%E2%80%93-music-from-the-nbc-television-event-2013|title=The Sound of Music – Music from the NBC Television Event 2013|work=[[Masterworks Broadway]]|publisher=[[Sony Music Entertainment]]|accessdate=2014-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and promotion==
On June 30, 2012, NBC's chairman [[Robert Greenblatt|Bob Greenblatt]] announced the network's plans to broadcast a live adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Breaking-News-NBC-Craig-ZadanNeil-Meron-to-Present-Live-Broadcast-of-THE-SOUND-OF-MUSIC-20120629#ixzz2CoUEezC5|title=NBC &amp; Craig Zadan/Neil Meron to Present Live Broadcast of THE SOUND OF MUSIC!|author=BWW News Desk|date=June 30, 2012|work=''broadwayworld.com''|publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, 2012, the network announced that [[country music]] and [[American Idol (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'', winner performer Carrie Underwood would star as Maria von Trapp in the production. In a statement, Greenblatt justified Underwood's involvement, saying that "[Maria] was an iconic woman who will now be played by an iconic artist."&lt;ref name=Bricker/&gt;&lt;ref name="NBC musical"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carrie Underwood to Star as Maria von Trapp on TV's The Sound of Music|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20652388,00.html|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=November 30, 2012|accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 16, 2013, NBC revealed the full cast of the special, and released a promotional image depicting Underwood as Maria von Trapp, wearing blond braids and a [[dirndl]], referencing one of [[Julie Andrews]]' "most iconic moments" from the [[The Sound of Music (film)|film adaptation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strecker|first=Erin|title=NBC to re-air 'Sound of Music Live!' on Saturday|journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=Time Inc.|date=December 10, 2013|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/12/10/sound-of-music-live-encore/|accessdate=December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eby&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/carrie-underwood-stars-maria-sound-music-live-poster-article-1.1458571|title=Carrie Underwood dons dirndl for NBC's 'The Sound of Music Live!' poster|first=Margaret|last=Eby|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|accessdate=September 17, 2013|date=September 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to being cast, Underwood personally asked Andrews for her endorsement of the role and the production, stating that "whenever I do a cover of somebody's song or whatever, I always get permission of the artist first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/134782/Carrie-Underwood-Reveals-Julie-Andrews-Gave-Sound-Of-Music-Live-TV-Special-Her-Seal-Of-Approval|title=Carrie Underwood Reveals Julie Andrews Gave 'Sound Of Music Live!'

Produced on a budget of around $9 million, ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was broadcast live from a soundstage built at Grumman Studios in [[Bethpage, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/carrie-underwood-s-sound-of-music-special-to-air-live-from-bethpage-1.6528060|title=Carrie Underwood's 'Sound of Music' special to air live from Bethpage|last1=Amodio|first1=Joseph|date=December 2, 2013|website=[[Newsday]]|publisher=[[Cablevision]]|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC, as well as producers [[Craig Zadan]] and [[Neil Meron]], emphasized that the production was not a remake of the film, but an adaptation of the musical itself; Meron iterated that "the audience will discover, within the first few minutes of watching the show, that they are not seeing a TV version of the movie. They'll know right away it's ''The Sound of Music'', but it's a different ''Sound of Music'' than they are accustomed to seeing on film." Meron felt that if successful, the broadcast could "open the door to another kind of entertainment that can exist on TV." He also praised the involvement of Underwood as the star of the production, believing that she was a quick learner, and "has all of the qualities of Maria." Greenblatt was highly supportive of the project, as he was, in the words of Zadan, a "passionate devotee of theater". Zadan considered the production to be "one of the profoundly complicated, amazing experiences we’ve ever had", noting the additional challenges created by the live broadcast.&lt;ref name=variety-smlcomplex&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Sound of Music Live’: Producers Call It a ‘Profoundly Complicated, Amazing Experience’|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/sound-of-music-live-a-profoundly-complicated-amazing-experience-1200925997/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|last=Littleton|first=Cynthia|date=December 6, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thq-somliveproduction&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC's 'Sound of Music' Producers on Live Show Fears and Big Expectations (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nbcs-sound-music-producers-live-661941|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]| last=Ng|first=Philiana|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promoted by NBC as a "three-hour holiday event",&lt;ref name="Bricker"/&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live!'' was aired as part of a push by NBC to air more live entertainment specials. Among its most popular programs in recent years have been those with live components (such as ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' and ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''); NBC's Jennifer Salke believed that the increased level of [[social networking service|social network]] interaction possible in a live broadcast, along with the feeling of being part of an "event", would encourage viewers to watch the special live instead of [[Video on-demand|on-demand]] or from a recording. NBC's previous attempt at event television, ''[[The Million Second Quiz]]'', was met with mixed reviews and viewership, but NBC did indicate that [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]'s advertising throughout the series brought a higher level of [[Brand awareness|awareness]] to the brand.&lt;ref name=adage-nbclive&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Plots Aggressive Live Programming Strategy|url=http://adage.com/article/media/nbc-plots-aggressive-live-programming-strategy/245473/|work=[[AdAge]]|publisher=[[Crain Communications]]|last=Poggi|first=Jeanine|date=December 2, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The television special was also the first live musical special in almost fifty years on NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=The Sound of Music: Music from the NBC Television Event|type=[[Compact disc]] [[liner notes]]|year=2013|publisher=[[Sony Masterworks|Masterworks]]|page=7|id=88843 79814 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail chain [[Walmart]] served as the presenting sponsor for ''The Sound of Music Live!''. NBC also produced five themed Walmart commercials to air throughout the special, featuring scenes of a family using products from the store set to songs from ''The Sound of Music''. The five ads were timed to air during the commercial break following the scene where the song was featured; NBC's advertising chief Dan Lovinger considered the ads to be a way to "enhance the excitement" of the presentation for families.&lt;ref name=variety-walmartads&gt;{{cite web|title=Walmart Ads for NBC’s "Sound of Music" Will Sound Just Like the Show|url=https://variety.com/2013/tv/news/walmart-ads-for-nbcs-sound-of-music-will-sound-just-like-the-show-1200922060/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Prior to the broadcast, members of the real-life von Trapp family were critical of casting Underwood to play Maria, agreeing with the notion that she would be a good singer but a poor actor. They suggested that [[Anne Hathaway]], who played [[Fantine]] in the [[Les Misérables (2012 film)|2012 film adaptation]] of ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'' for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]], would have been a better choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothman|first=Michael|title=Who the Von Trapps Wish Could Replace Carrie Underwood in ‘The Sound of Music Live’|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/12/who-the-von-trapps-wish-could-replace-carrie-underwood-in-the-sound-of-music-live/|work=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=December 6, 2013|date=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Sound of Music Live!'' received mixed reviews from entertainment critics, commending the show for its scope and supporting cast while questioning Underwood's acting capabilities.

Kevin Fallon of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' wrote: "Naturally, Underwood sounded astounding, as alive as those damned hills, every time she was asked to stand on top of things and belt.

He also panned Moyer, criticizing his vocal performance and describing "his attempt at conveying an emotional hollowness" as "mildly constipated" and "clenched." However, he lauded Benanti, Borle and McDonald's "strong" performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/sound-music-live-tv-review-663346|title = The Sound of Music Live!: TV Review|date =December 5, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013|work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|last = Bernardin|first = Marc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBC's Bob Greenblatt considered the production to be a success, and signed Meron and Zadan to produce another live musical for the 2014 holiday season. Greenblatt felt that there were enough recognizable, family-friendly musicals to make events like ''The Sound of Music Live!'' an annual tradition, and he indicated that NBC received e-mails and phone calls from various theatrical rightsholders, expressing interest in having their musicals adapted in a similar fashion, In January 2014, NBC announced that it would broadcast a live version of ''[[Peter Pan Live!|Peter Pan]]'' in December 2014, and at NBC's [[upfronts]] in May 2014, Greenblatt announced that NBC had also obtained rights to produce an adaptation of ''[[The Music Man]]'', although the network did not announce any timeframe for the production.&lt;ref name=nyt-morelive&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Says It Will Put On a Show, Again| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/10/arts/television/a-network-is-buoyed-by-sound-of-music-ratings.html?ref=television&amp;_r=0|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Carter|first=Bill|date=December 9, 2013|accessdate=December 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billboard-nbcmusicman&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC Announces 'Music Man' Live TV Production|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6084818/nbc-announces-music-man-live-tv-production|website=Billboard|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frizell |first=Sam |date=January 19, 2014 |title=NBC Announces ''Peter Pan'' for Next Live Production |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2014/01/19/nbc-announces-peter-pan-for-next-live-production/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=November 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that ''The Music Man'' project was put on hold for a live performance of ''[[The Wiz Live!|The Wiz]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/30/wiz-nbc The Wiz is NBC's next live musical] Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved October 4, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the concept also spread to competing networks: in April 2014, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] announced that it would produce a [[Grease: Live|live production]] of ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'', which aired in January 2016.&lt;ref name=billboard-foxgrease&gt;{{cite web|title='Grease' Live Coming to Fox TV|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6070137/grease-live-coming-to-fox-tv|website=Billboard|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC aired ''[[Hairspray Live!]]'' later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Gans, Andrew.

The special also had an influence on viewership for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s annual broadcast of the [[The Sound of Music (film)|1965 film version]] of ''The Sound of Music''; with 6.5 million viewers and a 1.3 share, it was ABC's highest-rated airing of the film since 2007, although it was beaten by NBC's ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]''.&lt;ref name=deadline-ratings/&gt;

'''This Is It''' was a planned [[concert residency]] by [[Michael Jackson]] which was scheduled to begin in July 2009 and end September 29, 2009 with a second leg which was scheduled to run from January 2010 through March 2010 with a total of 50 shows.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jacksons-this-is-it-tour-balloons-to-50-show-run-stretching-into-2010-20090312&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson announced This Is It at a press conference in the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]], stating that it would be his final series of concerts in London. [[AEG Live]], the concert promoters, released a promotional video that took up an entire commercial break, setting a record for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. Initially, only 10 concerts were announced, but following public demand, 40 more concerts were added. Ticket sales broke several records and Jackson's album sales increased following the announcement; AEG Live estimated that the first 10&amp;nbsp;dates alone would have earned Jackson approximately £50 million. 

In preparation for the concert series, Jackson had been collaborating with high-profile figures including fashion designer [[Christian Audigier]], choreographer [[Kenny Ortega]] and bodybuilder [[Lou Ferrigno]]. Prior to Jackson's death in 2009, Allgood Entertainment sued Jackson for $40 million, claiming that he had breached an exclusivity agreement with them by agreeing to the This Is It concerts; the case was dismissed.

After Jackson's death, AEG Live offered either refunds to ticket holders or a special "souvenir" ticket designed by Jackson.

According to Jermaine Jackson's 2011 book ''You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes'', after the London concerts were finished, Jackson was planning to extend his deal with AEG Live which included new music, a potential three-picture movie deal, a series of one-off concert dates starting in China, a halftime slot at one of the future [[Super Bowl]] games to surpass his own halftime show at the [[Super Bowl XXVII]] in January 1993 and two more tours (one of which was to be a final reunion with his brothers based on a promise made to their [[Katherine Jackson|mother]] to see her sons perform together one last time before she passed away). After the deal was completed, he planned to take time off from musical entertainment and move on to (possibly) directing his own film ideas, such as making a feature-length motion picture based on his 1982 song "Thriller" and [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|the music video of the same name]]. It was also later revealed that [http://www.damienshields.com/michael-jacksons-halloween-special-that-never-was/ a yearly Halloween television special] based on his horror-themed songs, such as "Thriller" and "Ghosts", was part of Jackson's deal with AEG Live.

In [[Trial of Conrad Murray|Conrad Murray's manslaughter trial]], David Walgren stated another one of Jackson's future plans was to open a children's hospital. This was heard in an audio tape Conrad Murray played of Jackson under the influence of propofol on May 10, 2009. His voice is barely recognisable in the recording, but he can be clearly heard saying that he wanted to build the greatest children's hospital in the world and name it after himself: The ''Michael Jackson's Children's Hospital''. Walgren also stated that while the tour was happening, Jackson wanted to buy an estate with streams, horses and animals so his three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket could live normal lives as their father performed the concerts, as he was photographed looking for a house in the United Kingdom with his children. Walgren also said that the tour would begin that summer, and Jackson could take his children out of school and bring them with him so they could see him perform in London.

===Songs prepared===
As shown in ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]'', songs prepared for the concerts included "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]", "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]", "[[They Don't Care About Us]]", "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]", "[[Smooth Criminal]]", "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]", a medley of songs by [[The Jackson 5]] consisting of "[[I Want You Back]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" and "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", "[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]", "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", "[[Beat It]]", "[[Black or White]]", "[[Earth Song]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", and "[[Man in the Mirror]]". Later on, "[[Stranger in Moscow]]", "[[You Are Not Alone]]", "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]", "[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock with You]]", "[[Dirty Diana]]" ,"[[You Rock My World]]", "[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson song)|Dangerous]]", "[[We Are the World]]", "[[Heal the World]]" and "[[Will You Be There]]" were also confirmed to have been planned for the shows. Due to the larger than usual roster of songs, as well as time constraints, Jackson would perform some songs with one verse less than he did in previous tours (such as "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", "Jam", "The Way You Make Me Feel" and "Black or White"). "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" was rumored to have been reserved for select concerts. On the final dates, Jackson wanted to perform a ballad called "River Ripple", written by him, with an African choir and his children. During the final concert before "Man in the Mirror", Michael was slated to premiere a song called "Best of Joy", written and recorded in 2009 prior to Jackson's death. As of 2018, the full version of "River Ripple" remains unreleased (although snippets of the song have leaked on YouTube), while "Best of Joy" was officially released in 2010 on Jackson's first posthumous album of unreleased songs, ''[[Michael (album)|Michael]]''.

==Litigation==
In June 2009, concert promoter Allgood Entertainment, represented by Ira Meyerowitz and Jon Kekielek of MJlawfirm, sued Jackson for $40 million. He claimed that Jackson, through his manager [[Frank DiLeo]], had agreed to a single and a $30 million reunion concert with [[The Jackson 5]] and his sister [[Janet Jackson]]. According to the concert promoter, the alleged contractual agreement prevented Jackson from performing elsewhere before the reunion concert and for a three-month period after it. Thus, agreeing to a 50 date residency at the O2 arena was an alleged breach of the Allgood Entertainment contract. The filing company stated that AEG Live knew of the alleged agreement with Jackson and used their dominance in the industry to coerce Jackson into agreeing to the residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8094537.stm |title=Jackson sued over reunion concert |publisher=BBC |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/12/michael-jackson-sued-o2-arena|title=Michael Jackson sued for O2 arena residency|publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/12/michael-jackson-comeback-concerts |title=Michael Jackson comeback concerts in jeopardy? |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the judge dismissed the case, stating that there was no evidence of a binding agreement, no contracts were signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11038050 | work=BBC News | title=Judge dismisses Jackson reunion claim | date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was in limbo as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.recapthelaw.org/nysd/347380/ |title=AllGood Entertainment, Inc. et al v.

==Jackson's death and refunds==
{{Further|Death of Michael Jackson}}

On June 25, 2009, Jackson died after going into [[cardiac arrest]] which was caused by an overdose of [[Propofol]] and [[Benzodiazepine|benzodiazepines]], eighteen days before his planned first show. AEG Live, who persuaded Jackson to sign up for the shows, faced a liability of up to £300 million and an empty venue for the next nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|title=O2 arena counts cost as curtain closes on the greatest show of all|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6580748.ece|publisher=The Times|date=June 26, 2009|accessdate=June 26, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The O2 arena stated that full refunds, including all ticket service charges, would be available to those who purchased tickets through authorized agents, but that "fans will have the option to be sent the actual tickets they would have received to attend the shows in lieu of the full refunds which are being offered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCLA Statement&amp;nbsp;— Michael Jackson|url=http://www.theo2.co.uk/inside/ucla-statement-michael-jackson.html |publisher=[[The O2 Arena]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans who bought their tickets from private sellers potentially faced difficulties. eBay recommended that purchasers contact their sellers for refunds and stated that those who used PayPal can get their money back if the purchase was made during the last 45 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8120412.stm |title=Refund issues over Jackson gigs |publisher=''BBC News'' |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; then later stated that "all buyers on the site will receive a full refund for their ticket purchase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8122580.stm |title=eBay will refund Jackson tickets |publisher=BBC News |date=June 27, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous film and album==
{{Further|Michael Jackson's This Is It|Michael Jackson's This Is It (album)}}

Following Jackson's death, AEG stated that they had over "100 hours of footage of preparations and rehearsals for the shows".&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32360110 |title=Judge OKs Jackson performance film deal |agency=Associated Press |work=[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]] |date=August 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2009, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff approved a deal between film distributor [[Columbia Pictures]] and AEG Live for the former company to purchase and distribute rehearsal footage of Jackson for a film entitled ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]''.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/showbiz/2009-08/06/content_8532737.htm |title=Michael Jackson film deal outlined in court papers |work=ChinaDaily.com |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-jackson11-2009aug11,0,2938755.story |author=Christopher Smith |work=[[LA Times|LA Times.com]] |title=Sony Pictures to produce Michael Jackson film |accessdate=September 21, 2009 | date=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court documents, Columbia paid $60 million (£35 million) for rights to the rehearsal footage.&lt;ref name="deal6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filmdeal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/michael_jackson/news/13441 |title=Michael jackson This Is It film deal agreed |work=Uncut.co.uk |date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papers filed in court had reportedly stated that Jackson's estate will get 90% of the profits and that AEG Live will get the remaining 10% from the film's revenue.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal4"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/11/michael-jackson-film-october-release |author=Rosie Swash |title=Michael Jackson film gets October release date |work=[[Guardian.co.uk]] |date=August 11, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Kenny Ortega]] who was also the director of the live concert. It was compiled mostly from footage that was shot as reference for production discussions and was never meant to be shown publicly.  Some of the music and vocals in the film were added from previous recordings, though most were from the live performance. The film was released on October 28, 2009.&lt;ref name="This Is It Worldwide Release Dates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/michaeljacksonthisisit/international/ |title=This Is It Worldwide Release Dates |work=[[Sony Pictures|Sony Pictures.com]] |accessdate=September 21, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922214515/http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/michaeljacksonthisisit/international/ |archivedate=September 22, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An accompanying album to the film was also released. Titled ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It (album)|This Is It]]'', the compilation was distributed internationally on October 26, and to North America the following day. The two-disc album features music "inspired from the documentary of the same name".&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/09/the-michael-jackson-new-musical-onslaught-begins.html |author=Chris Lee |title=The Michael Jackson new-music onslaught begins [Updated] |work=[[The LA Times|TheLATimes.com]] |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the album, Sony said, "Disc one will feature the original album masters of some of Michael's biggest hits arranged in the same sequence as they appear in the film" and stated that "the disc ends with two versions of the 'never-released' '[[This Is It (Michael Jackson song)|This Is It]]' [...] This song is featured in the film's closing sequence and includes backing vocals by Michael's brothers, [[The Jacksons]] and Alvin Chea of Take 6."&lt;ref name="digitalspy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/music/a178845/new-jackson-single-lp-to-be-released.html?imdb |title=New Jackson single, LP to be released |author=Tim Parks |date=September 23, 2009 |work=[[Digital Spy|Digital Spy.com]] |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony added that the second disc will feature previously unreleased versions from Jackson's "catalogue of hits", along with a spoken word [[poem]] entitled "Planet Earth" and a 36-page commemorative booklet with "exclusive photos of Michael from his last rehearsal".&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="theinsidersonginfo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/2870440_Unreleased_Michael_Jackson_Song_to_be_Revealed|author=The Insider Staff |work=[[The Insider (TV series)|TheInsider.com]] |title=Unreleased Michael Jackson Song to be Revealed |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tim Soar''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[fashion designer]], [[graphic designer]], [[event planner]] and [[DJ]].

==Career==
Soar began his creative career working with designer [[Neville Brody]] on an interiors project POST Design.  This was followed by independent practice as a graphic designer, and then in the design company STAC collaborating with photographer [[Andrew Catlin]]. His work was focussed in music, producing artwork for numerous international record sleeves, publications and campaigns.

==Career as a DJ==
While working with Neville Brody, Soar became involved in the music industry and began working as a DJ. Soar had residencies at a number of venues and clubs across London. He was also involved in the writing and arrangement of [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]]'s song ''Just Like Everybody''. He was also part of the band called Toll, which released the album ''Christ Knows'' in 2006.

==Design label==
In 2005, Soar launched the Tim Soar design label and this was described as “really well-made menswear that mixes minimalism, sportswear, tailoring, and unusual fabrications.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://londonfashionweek.co.uk/designers_profile.aspx?DesignerID=1162|title=London Fashion Week - Tim Soar|website=londonfashionweek.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Soar described his foray from music to fashion design with these words:&lt;blockquote&gt;I felt that I had something to say about modern menswear and that it was time to move on from the flippant to something more serious. I was tired of seeing gimmicky menswear that was badly made and did not fit correctly. I set out to produce clothes that are a synthesis of minimalism and the avant garde made to the highest possible standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.notjustalabel.com/designer/soar|title=Soar {{!}} NOT JUST A LABEL|website=www.notjustalabel.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The first collection was presented by the London-based B-Store, the second collection by [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]], and has continued with packed shows at each [[London Fashion Week]] since Spring/Summer 09. His women's wear line debuted in 2011 with a capsule collection for Browns 24. Soar told [[Vogue (British magazine)|British Vogue]] that the concept is womenswear for boyish women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/tim-soar-launches-womenswear|title=Girls Who Like Boys|last=Alexander|first=Ella|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soar's collections are now available in numerous countries worldwide.

==Music Concrete==
Soar is also creative head of Music Concrete, a music consultancy that was established in 1987. It initially catered to the boutique hotel market but has since expanded into launches, fashion, and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musicconcrete.com/about-music-consultancy/|title=Music Concrete: Music consultant for hotels, spas and bars|website=musicconcrete.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked with many of the leading UK and international fashion designers and design houses, including [[Donna Karen]] [[Prada]], [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Levi's]], [[Fendi]], [[LVMH]], Mathew Williamson, Fendi and Adidas. Through Music Concrete, Soar also collaborated with luxury hotels groups including Schrager Hotels,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; St. Martin's Lane Hotel, Sanderson, Columbus and Great Eastern.

'''Unintentional discharge''' is the event of a [[firearm]] discharging (firing) at a time not intended by the user. An unintended discharge may be produced by an incompatibility between firearm design and usage, such as the phenomenon of [[cooking off]] a round in a closed bolt machine gun, a mechanical malfunction as in the case of [[slamfire]] in an automatic weapon, user induced due to training issues or negligence, or a simple accident. The phenomenon has also been defined in the scientific literature as ''an activation of the trigger mechanism that results in an unplanned discharge that is outside of the firearm’s prescribed use''. Where prescribed use refers to departmental policies and laws related to the operation of firearms (O'Neill, 2018).

==Accidental discharge==

An '''accidental discharge''' ('''AD''') may occur when the trigger of the firearm is deliberately pulled for a purpose other than shooting—dry-fire practice, demonstration, or function testing—but ammunition is unintentionally left in the chamber.  Unintentionally leaving a firearm loaded is more likely to occur when the individual handling the gun is poorly trained, and perhaps also with removable-magazine-fed firearms (as the magazine may be removed, giving an unloaded appearance even when a round remains chambered—see discussion of magazine-safeties below).

A second common cause of negligent discharges is when the gun-handler places their finger on the trigger before they have decided to shoot.  With the finger so positioned, many activities may cause the finger to compress the trigger unintentionally.  For example, if one attempts to holster the firearm with finger on trigger, the holster edge will drive the finger onto the trigger, and discharge is likely.  If one stumbles or struggles (with an adversary) with finger on trigger, the grasping motion of both hands will likely cause the trigger finger to compress the trigger.

[[Gun safety]] rules recognize the above possibilities, and aim to prevent them. The primary firearm safety rule usually listed by any source is a version of "Always keep the gun pointed in safe direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Izak|first1=Shultz|title=Gun Safe Reviews|url=http://www.shootingandsafety.com/best-gun-safe-reviews/|website=Shooting &amp; Safety|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this rule ensures that, should an accidental discharge occur, no harm will be done.  Second, one's finger should remain outside the trigger guard until the decision has been made to fire the weapon; even if (some would say especially if) one is facing a hostile adversary and has to be prepared to fire at a moment's notice, keeping the finger out of the trigger-guard until one has decided to shoot will prevent an accidental shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob103.html|title=The subtleties of safe firearms handling|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|date=February 2007|website=Issue #103|publisher=Backwoods Home Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a firearm is not in use, storing it unloaded and in a separate container from ammunition may also help prevent accidental discharges, especially if the stored firearm is "accessed" by an unauthorized user.

On occasion, an accidental discharge can occur by means other than the finger pulling the [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]], such as dropping a loaded weapon.  Because of this possibility, most currently produced pistols are designed with a "drop-safety" or [[Safety (firearms)#Firing pin block|firing pin block]], a mechanism inhibiting or isolating the firing pin, preventing accidental discharge if the firearm is dropped.  However, most long guns do not have drop-safeties.

Prevention of dropped-firearm ADs with long guns therefore depends on the user being familiar with the precautions needed for that particular gun: it is standard practice for all long-gun users to unload the firearm's chamber before any activity that might foreseeably result in a dropped firearm (e.g., climbing a fence while hunting), and before placing the firearm in a vehicle (where sudden deceleration may cause the firearm to act as if dropped).

Accidental discharges not involving trigger-pull can also occur if the firearm is mechanically unsound: poor maintenance, abuse, inept "gunsmithing," or the use of substandard materials or defective [[ammunition]] in the gun may all lead to breakage.

In World War II, early versions of the British [[Sten gun]] were notorious for accidentally discharging when dropped. While dropping any long gun with loaded chamber can be dangerous, the use of a soft bronze bolt in early Stens—allowing the [[Sear (firearm)|sear]] contact area to wear down quickly—made ADs even more likely.

As the early Sten gun illustrates, "poor design," including the specification of unsuitable component materials, is sometimes cited as a cause for some firearms being "unsafe."  Surely, any firearm that can discharge by itself when loaded is unsafe, and no user would want to handle a firearm that has a high likelihood of accidental discharge when employed for its intended use.  But, firearm designs incorporating fewer safeties are not intrinsically unsafe—see discussion of long-guns above—even if they do require competence and proper training for safe use.

A relevant discussion attends the use of [[Safety (firearms)#Magazine Interlocks|magazine-safeties]] in semi-automatic pistols.  Such safeties prevent the pistol from firing if there is a round in the chamber, but the magazine is removed.  Some self-defense experts dislike this feature, as it may allow the pistol to be "disabled" unexpectedly during a struggle, so that the pistol fails when needed.  Others feel that it may improve user safety and prevent some accidental discharges.  Both semi-auto pistol designs, with and without magazine-safeties, are currently manufactured.

One last form of accidental discharge, known as ''[[cooking off]],'' occurs when a weapon becomes overheated, with the firing chamber hot enough to ignite the propellant charge in the ammunition round, causing the cartridge to fire.  As recently as 1979, this problem doomed the innovative [[Heckler &amp; Koch G11]] during NATO trials.

"Cooking off" is typically encountered only in [[fully automatic]] weapons, such as [[machine gun]]s, when they are fired for long periods of time without allowing the barrel and chamber of the weapon to cool down to safe temperatures.  For this reason, modern crew-served machine guns are equipped with spare [[Gun barrel|barrel]]s to allow a machine gun crew to replace an overheated barrel with a cool one, thus restoring the weapon to action while the overheated barrel is allowed to cool. Also, the majority of machine guns fire from an [[open bolt]], so the round is chambered only after pressing the trigger, just before firing.

==Negligent discharge==

A '''negligent discharge''' ('''ND''') is a discharge of a [[firearm]] involving [[Culpability|culpable]] carelessness. In judicial and military technical terms, a negligent discharge is a chargeable offence. A number of [[armed force]]s automatically consider any [[accidental discharge]] to be negligent discharge, under the assumption that a trained soldier has control of his firearm at all times. This is the case in the [[United States Army]],&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, Abel. "Proper Weapons Practices Key to Ending Negligent Discharge Incidents in Iraq." ''army.mil''. United States Army. 1 March 2007. [http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/03/01/2065-proper-weapons-practices-key-to-ending-negligent-discharge-incidents-in-iraq/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Army]], the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[British Army]] and various Police Forces within the United Kingdom.

'''World news''' or '''international news''' or even '''foreign coverage''' is the [[news media]] jargon for news from abroad, about a  country or a global subject. For [[journalism]], it is a branch that deals with news either sent by [[foreign correspondent]]s or [[news agency|news agencies]], or – more recently – information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as [[telephone]], [[Satellite television|satellite TV]] or the [[internet]].

Although in most of the [[English-speaking world]] this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and "national" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member.

At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the [[Newspaper|courants]] of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the ''Daily Courant'' (England), the ''Nieuwe Tijudinger'' ([[Antwerp]]), the ''Relation'' ([[Strasbourg]]), the ''Avisa Relation oder Zeitung'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and the ''Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland &amp; C.'' ([[Amsterdam]]). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that [[nation-state]]s were still incipient in 17th-century Europe.

From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the [[telegraph]] made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] (France), [[Reuters]] (UK), Wolff (currently [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|DPA]], Germany) and the [[Associated Press|AP]] (US).

[[War journalism]] is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).

== Foreign correspondents ==
{{Main|Correspondent}}

There are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the '''foreign correspondent''' (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the '''special envoy''' (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location).

The correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information.

The number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone).[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/network_tv_news_investment.php] Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India: 

35 – ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, São Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich

24 – ''[[New York Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, São Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo

19 – ''[[Financial Times]]'' (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

17 – ''[[Washington Post]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogotá, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo

15 – ''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo

13 – ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington

13 – ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul

12 – ''[[The Hindu]]'' (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington  

When reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called '''stringers'''. Since they have no salary, stringers usually produce material for several different companies at once.

== News agencies ==
{{Main|News agency}}
A '''news agency''' is an organization of [[journalist]]s established to supply [[news]] reports to news organizations: [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. Such an agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire or news service. The bulk of major news agency services contains foreign news.

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.
