==Context==

The [[Natural history|naturalist]], explorer, geographer, anthropologist and biologist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (born 8 January 1823) died on 7 November 1913. He is principally remembered now for having independently conceived the theory of [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]], which prompted [[Charles Darwin]] to publish ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Some of his books such as ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]'' remain in print; it is considered one of the best accounts of scientific exploration published during the 19th century. Wallace is also remembered for recognizing the presence of a [[biogeography|biogeographical]] boundary, now known as the [[Wallace Line]], that divides the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago into two distinct parts: a [[Indomalaya ecozone|western portion]] in which the animals are almost entirely of Asian origin, and an [[Wallacea|eastern portion]] where the fauna reflect the influence of [[Australasia]].&lt;ref name=Kewmag/&gt;

==Events==

Baines]]', showing men from [[Timor]] holding palm leaf umbrellas, plant artefacts like one he gave to the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]&lt;ref name=Kewmag/&gt;]]

The South Kensington [[Natural History Museum, London]], co-ordinating commemorative events for the Wallace centenary worldwide in the 'Wallace100' project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jan/20/alfred-russel-wallace-forgotten-man-evolution | title=Alfred Russel Wallace, the forgotten man of evolution, gets his moment | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=20 January 2013 | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=McKie, Robin}}&lt;/ref&gt; created a website to celebrate Wallace's centenary.&lt;ref name=NHM&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/science-of-natural-history/wallace/index.html | title=Wallace100 - celebrating Alfred Russel Wallace's life and legacy | publisher=Natural History Museum | year=2013 | accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum holds the Wallace Collection of memorabilia including letters, Wallace's notebooks and other documents, and 28 drawers of insects and other specimens that he collected on his expeditions to the [[Malay Archipelago]] and to South America.&lt;ref name=NHM/&gt; The museum describes Wallace as "Father of [[biogeography]]", as a committed [[socialist]], and as a [[spiritualist]].&lt;ref name=NHM/&gt;

The Royal Societyplanned a two-day discussion meeting in October 2013 for researchers on "Alfred Russel Wallace and his legacy", with speakers including George Beccaloni, Steve Jones, Lynne Parenti, Tim Caro and [[Martin Rees]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://royalsociety.org/events/2013/wallace-legacy/ | title=Alfred Russel Wallace and his legacy | publisher=[[The Royal Society]] | accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cardiff University's School of Earth &amp; Ocean Sciences has planned a lecture series in 2013-2014 as part of the centenary commemoration of Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/earth/news/2013/08/29/the-wallace-legacy-lecture-series-updated/ | title=The Wallace Legacy Lecture Series Updated | publisher=[[Cardiff University]] | date=29 August 2013 | accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hertford Museum held several events including an evening of illustrated talks on 15 January 2014 at Hertford Theatre. Errol Fuller will discuss Wallace and the curious 19th century social phenomenon that guided his life and Dr Sandra Knapp will talk about Wallace’s life and explorations in the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hertfordmuseum.org/wallace-events.asp | title=World of Wallace events at Hertford Museum | publisher=Hertford Museum | accessdate=8 October 2013 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20131008090051/http://hertfordmuseum.org/wallace-events.asp | archive-date=2013-10-08 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Linnean Society held a two-day celebration of Wallace's centenary in [[Bournemouth]] on 7 and 8 June 2013, together with the Society for the History of Natural History, Bournemouth University and Bournemouth Natural Sciences Society. The event included talks about Wallace, his thoughts on [[natural selection]], his [[evolution]]ary insights, and his notebooks and letters. A theatrical performance, 'You Should Ask Wallace', was put on by Theatre na n'Og. On the second day the group visited Wallace's grave and went on a nature walk in Wallace's memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linnean.org/The-Society/societynews/Wallace+Centenary+Event+in+Bournemouth | title=Unremitting passion for the beauty and mystery of the natural world - Alfred Russel Wallace Centenary | publisher=The Linnean Society of London | accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biogenic substance''' is a product made by or of life forms. The term encompasses constituents, secretions, and metabolites of [[plants]] or [[animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biomedical Applications of Polymeric Materials and Composites|last1=Raju Francis|first1= D. |last2=Sakthi |first2=Kumar|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In context of [[molecular biology]], biogenic substances are referred to as [[biomolecule|biomolecules]]. 

==Examples==
*[[Coal]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] are possible examples of constituents which may have undergone changes over [[geologic time]] periods.
*[[Chalk]] and [[limestone]] are examples of secretions (marine [[animal shell]]s) which are of geologic age.
*[[grass]] and [[wood]] are biogenic constituents of contemporary origin.
*[[Pearls]], [[silk]] and [[ambergris]] are examples of secretions of contemporary origin.
*Biogenic [[neurotransmitters]].

== Abiogenic (opposite) ==
An '''abiogenic''' substance or process does not result from the present or past activity of living [[organism]]s. Abiogenic products may, e.g., be [[mineral]]s, other [[inorganic compound]]s, as well as simple [[organic compound]]s (e.g. [[Methane#Extraterrestrial_methane|extraterrestrial methane]], see also [[abiogenesis]]).

'''Coastal Hazards''' are physical phenomena that expose a coastal area to risk of property damage, loss of life and environmental degradation. Rapid-onset hazards last over periods of minutes to several days and examples include major cyclones accompanied by high winds, waves and surges or tsunamis created by [[submarine earthquake]]s and landslides. Slow-onset hazards develop incrementally over longer time periods and examples include erosion and gradual inundation.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, M. (2005) Encyclopaedia of Coastal Science, Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Since early civilisation, coastal areas have been attractive settling grounds for human population as they provided abundant marine resources, fertile agricultural land and possibilities for trade and transport. This has led to high population densities and high levels of development in many coastal areas and this trend is continuing into the 21st century. At present, about 1,2 billion people live in coastal areas globally, and this number is  predicted to increase to 1,8–5,2 billion by the 2080s due to a combination of population growth and coastal migration.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2007: http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg2/en/contents.html&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this increase follows major investments in infrastructure and the build environment.

The characteristics of coastal environments, however, pose some great challenges to human habitation. Coastlines are highly dynamic natural systems that interact with terrestrial, marine and atmospheric processes and undergo continuous change in response to these processes. Over the years, human society has often failed to recognize the hazards related to these dynamics &lt;ref&gt;Masselink &amp; Hughes, Coastal processes &amp; geomorphology, Arnold, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and this has led to major disasters and societal disruption to various degrees. Even today, coastal development is often taking place with little regard to the hazards present in these environments, although climate change is likely to increase the general hazard levels.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2014: http://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/&lt;/ref&gt; Societal activities in coastal areas can also pose a hazard to the natural balance of coastal systems, thereby disrupting e.g. sensitive ecosystems and subsequently human livelihood.

Coastal hazard management has become an increasingly important aspect of coastal planning in order to improve the resilience of society to coastal hazards. Possible management options include hard engineering structures, soft protection measures, various accommodation approaches as well as a managed retreat from the coastline. For addressing coastal hazards, it is also important to have early warning systems and emergency management plans in place to be able to address sudden and potential disastrous hazards i.e. major flooding events. Events as the Hurricane Katrina affecting the southern USA in 2005 and the cyclone Nargis affecting Myanmar in 2008 provides clear examples of the importance of timely coastal hazard management.

== Coastal environments of the USA ==
There are many different types of environments along the coasts of the United States with very diverse features that affect, influence, and mold the near-shore processes that are involved.  Understanding these ecosystems and environments can further advance the mitigating techniques and policy-making efforts against natural and man-made coastal hazards in these vulnerable areas.  The five most common types of [[coastal zone]]s range from the northern ice-pushing, mountainous coastline of Alaska and Maine, the barrier island coasts facing the Atlantic, the steep, cliff-back [[Headlands and bays|headlands]] along the pacific coast, the marginal-sea type coastline of the Gulf region, and the coral reef coasts bordering Southern Florida and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;Inman, Douglas L. "ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE IN THE COASTAL ZONE." Environmental Science in the Coastal Zone: Issues for Further Research. The National Academic Press. Web. 09 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2249&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ice-pushing/mountainous coastline'''

These coastal regions along the northernmost part of the nation were affected predominantly by, along with the rest of the Pacific Coast, continuous tectonic activity, forming a very long, irregular, ridged, steep and mostly mountainous coastline.  These environments are heavily occupied with permafrost and glaciers, which are the two major conditions affecting Alaska's Coastal Development.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Eric C. "Chapter 1.1 Alaska". ''Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barrier island coastline'''

[[Barrier island]]s are a land form system that consists of fairly narrow strips of sand running parallel to the mainland and play a significant role in mitigating storm surges and oceans swells as natural storm events occur. The morphology of the various types and sizes of barrier islands depend on the wave energy, tidal range, basement controls, and sea level trends.  The islands create multiple unique environments of wetland systems including marshes, estuaries, and lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;"BarrierIslnd." Smithsonian Marine Station (SMS) at Fort Pierce. Web. 30 April 2012. &lt;http://www.sms.si.edu/IRLSpec/BarrierIslnd.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Steep, cliff-backing abrasion coastline'''

The coastline along the western part of the nation consists of very steep, cliffed rock formations generally with vegetative slopes descending down and a fringing beach below.  The various sedimentary, metamorphic, and volcanic rock formations assembled along a tectonically disturbed environment, all with altering resistances running perpendicular, cause the ridged, extensive stretch of uplifted cliffs that form the peninsulas, lagoons, and valleys.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, B., and N. Sitar. "Processes of Coastal Bluff Erosion in Weakly Lithified Sands, Pacifica, California, USA." Geomorphology 97.3–4 (2008): 483–501. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marginal-sea type coastline'''

The southern banks of the United States border the Gulf of Mexico, intersecting numerous rivers, forming many inlets bays, and lagoons along its coast, consisting of vast areas of marsh and wetlands.  This region of landform is prone to natural disasters yet highly and continuously developed, with man-made structures attaining to water flow and control.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Eric C. "Chapter 1.1 Alaska". ''Encyclopedia of the World's Coastal Landforms''. Dordrecht: Springer, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coral reef coastline'''

[[Coral reef]]s are located off the shores of the southern Florida and Hawaii consisting of rough and complex natural structures along the bottom of the ocean floor with extremely diverse ecosystems, absorbing up to ninety percent of the energy dissipated from wind-generated waves.  This process is a significant buffer for the inner-lying coastlines, naturally protecting and minimizing the impact of storm surge and direct wave damage.  Because of the highly diverse ecosystems, these coral reefs not only provide for the shoreline protection, but also deliver an abundant amount of services to fisheries and  tourism, increasing its economic value.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, John. "Coral Reefs". Nature 40.1030 (1889): 294. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes of Coastal Hazards ==

[[File:Hurricane Flooding.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane Surge]]

'''Natural VS Human disasters'''

The population that lives along or near our coastlines are an extremely vulnerable population.  There are numerous issues facing our coastlines and there are two main categories that these hazards can be placed under, [[Natural disasters]] and Human disasters.  Both of these issues cause great damage to our coastlines and discussion is still ongoing regarding what standards or responses need to be met to help both the individuals who want to continue living along the coastline, while keeping them safe and not eroding more coastline away.  Natural disasters are disasters that are out of human control and are usually caused by the weather.  Disasters that include but are not limited to; [[storms]], [[tsunamis]], [[typhoons]], [[flooding]], [[tides]], [[waterspouts]], [[nor'easters]], and [[storm surge]].  Human disasters occur when humans are the main culprit behind why the disaster happened.  Some human disasters are but are not limited to; [[pollution]], [[trawling]], and human development. Natural and human disasters continue to harm the coastlines severely and they need to be researched in order to prepare/stop the hazards if possible.&lt;ref&gt;"Coastal hazards- natural," 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The populations that live near or along the coast experience many hazards and it affects millions of people.  Around ten million people globally feel the effects of coastal problems yearly and most are due to certain natural hazards like coastal flooding with storm surges and typhoons.&lt;ref&gt;Adger, N., &amp; Hughes, T.2005&lt;/ref&gt;  A major problem related to coastal regions deals with how the entire global environment is changing and in response, the coastal regions are easily affected.

[[File:Hurricane Diana.jpg|thumb|left|Hurricane Diana]]

'''Storms, Flooding and Erosion'''

Storms are one of the major hazards that are associated to coastal regions.  Storms, flooding, and erosion are closely associated and can happen simultaneously.  Tropical storms or Hurricanes especially can devastate coastal regions.  For example, Florida during [[Hurricane Andrew]] occurred in 1992 that caused extreme damage.  It was a category five hurricane that caused $26.5 billion in damages and even 23 individuals lost their lives from the storm.&lt;ref&gt;Adger, N., &amp; Hughes, T.2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Hurricane Katrina also caused havoc along the coast to show the extreme force a hurricane can do in a certain region.&lt;ref&gt;Burby, R. (n.d.). Hurricane katrina . Sage journals, Retrieved from http://ann.sagepub.com/content/604/1/171.short&lt;/ref&gt; The Chennai Floods of 2015, which affected many people, is an example of flooding due to cyclones. People across the whole state of Tamil Nadu felt its impact and even parts of Andhra Pradesh got affected. There was a loss of Rs.900 crore and 280 people died. Many cyclones like this happen across Asia but the media reports only minor hurricanes which hit the United States.

  In almost all cases, storms are the major culprit that causes flooding and erosion.  Flash flooding is caused by storms that occurs when a massive amount of rainfall comes down into an area over a short period of time.  Where as a storm surge, which is closely related to tropical storms, is when the wind collects and pushes water towards low pressure or inland and can rise rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;(2009).  Coastal hazards- natural disasters. Ocean science and stewardship, Retrieved from http://dels-old.nas.edu/oceans/coastal_hazards_part_2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  It is an offshore rise of water and overall creates a higher sea level that rises and is pushed inland.  The amount of rise or fall of storm surge depends greatly on the amount and duration of wind and water in a specific location.  Also if it occurs during a high tide it can have an even greater effect on the coast.

Almost all storms with high wind and water cause erosion along the coast.  Erosion occurs when but not limited to; along shore currents, tides, sea level rise and fall, and high winds.  Larger amounts of erosion cause the coastline to erode away at a faster rate and can leave people homeless and leave less land to develop or keep for environmental reasons.  Coastal erosion has been increasing over the past few years and it is still on the rise which makes it a major coastline hazard.  In the United States, 45 percent of its coast line is along the Atlantic or Gulf coast and the erosion rate per year along the Gulf coast is at six feet a year.  The average rate of erosion along the Atlantic is around two to three feet a year.  Even with these findings, erosion rates in specific locations vary because of various environmental factors such as major storms that can cause major erosion upwards to 100 feet or more in only one day.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Homeland Security, FEMA or Federal Emergency Management Agency.

'''Pollution, Trawling and Human Development'''
[[File:Loss of Property due to storms.jpg|thumb|right|North Carolina Homes being taken by the Atlantic Ocean 08-23-2011]]
Pollution, trawling, and human development are major human disasters that affect coastal regions.  There are two main categories related to pollution, [[point source pollution]], and [[nonpoint source pollution]].  Point source pollution is when there is an exact location such as a pipeline or a body of water that leads into the rivers and oceans.  Known dumping into the ocean is also another point source of pollution.  Nonpoint source pollution would pertain more to fertilizer runoff, and industrial waste.  Examples of pollution that affect the coastal regions are but are not limited to; fertilizer runoff, oil spills, and dumping of hazardous materials into the oceans.  More human acts that hurt the coastline are as follows; waste discharge, fishing, dredging, mining, and drilling.&lt;ref&gt;Inman, D. (n.d.). Types of coastal zones: similarities and differences. Retrieved from http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2249&amp;page=67&lt;/ref&gt;  Oil spills are one of the most hazardous dangers towards coastal communities.  They are hard to contain, difficult to clean up, and devastate everything.  The fish, animals such as birds, the water, and especially the coastline near the spill.  The most recent oil spill that had everybody concerned with oil spill was the [[BP oil spill]].

Trawling hurts the normal ecosystems in the water around the coastline.  It depletes all ecosystems on the ocean floor such as, flounder, shellfish, marsh etc.. It is simply a giant net that is drug across the ocean floor and destroys and catches anything in its path.  Human development is one of the major problems when facing coastal hazards.  The overall construction of buildings and houses on the coast line takes away the natural occurrences to handle the fluctuation in water and sea level rise.  Building houses in pre-flood areas or high risk areas that are extremely vulnerable to flooding are major concerns towards human development in coastal regions.  Having houses and buildings in areas that are known to have powerful storms that will create people to be in risk by living there.  Also pertaining to barrier islands, where land is at risk for erosion but they still continue to build there anyway.  More and more houses today are being taken by the ocean; look at picture above.

'''Coastal hazards &amp; climate change'''

The predicted climate change is adding an extra risk factor to human settlement in coastal areas. Whereas the natural dynamics that shape our coastlines have been relatively stable and predictable over the last centuries, much more rapid change is now expected in processes as sea level rise, ocean temperature and acidity, tropical storm intensity and precipitation/runoff patterns.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, 2013: Summary for Policymakers. In: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [Stocker, T.F., D. Qin, G.-K. Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. 
Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA. http://www.climatechange2013.org/images/report/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The world's coastlines will respond to these changes in different ways and at different pace depending on their bio-geophysical characteristics, but generally society will have to recognize that past coastal trends cannot be directly projected into the future. Instead, it is necessary to consider how different coastal environments will respond to the predicted climate change and take the expected future hazards into account in the coastal planning processes.

== Policies ==

'''National Flood Insurance Program'''

The National Flood Insurance Program or [[NFIP]] was instituted in 1968 and offers home owners in qualifying communities an opportunity to rebuild and recover after flooding events following the decision by insurance companies to discontinue providing flood insurance. This decision was made on behalf of the private insurers after continually high and widespread flood losses. The goals of this program are to not only better protect individuals from flood, but to reduce property losses, and reduce the total amount disbursed for flood loses by the government. Only communities which have adopted and implemented mitigation policies that are compliant with or exceed federal regulations. The regulatory policies reduce risk to life and property located within floodplains. The NFIP also comprehensively mapped domestic floodplains increasing public awareness of risk.  The majority of structures were constructed after the mapping was completed and risk could be assessed. To reduce the cost to these owners, which constitute roughly 25% of the total policies the rates for insurance are subsidized.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration. National Flood Insurance Program: Program Description. U.S. Government Press, August 1, 2002 Retrieved from website: http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=1480&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal States Organization'''

The [[Coastal States Organization]] or COS was established in 1970 to represent 35 U.S. sub-federal governments on issues of coastal policies. CSO lobbies Congress on issues pertaining to Coastal Policy allowing states input on federal policy decisions. Funding, support, water quality, coastal hazards, and coastal zone management are the primary issues COS promotes. The strategic goals of COS are to provide information and assistance to members,evaluate and manage coastal needs, and secure long term funding for member states initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;About COS. (2012). Retrieved from http://www.coastalstates.org/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coastal Zone Management Act'''

In 1972 the [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] or CZMA works to streamline the policies which states create to a minimum federal standard for environmental protection. CZMA establishes the national policy for the development and implementation of regulatory programs for coastal land usage, which is supposed to be reflected in state legislation such as CAMA. CZMA also provides minimum building requirements to make the insurance provided through the NFIP less expensive for the government to operate by mitigating losses. Congress found that it was necessary to establish the minimum which programs should provide for. Each coastal state is required to have a program with 7 distinct parts: Identifying land uses,Identifying critical coastal areas, Management measures,Technical assistance, Public participation, Administrative coordination, State coastal zone boundary modification.&lt;ref&gt;(1972). 16 usc chapter 33 – coastal zone management.

'''The Coastal Area Management Act'''

The Coastal Area Management Act or CAMA is policy that was implemented by the state of North Carolina in 1974 to work in-tandem with the CZMA. It creates a cooperative program between the state and local governments. The State government operates in an advisory capacity and reviews decisions made by local government planners. The goal of this legislation was to create a management system capable of preserving the coastal environment, insure the preservation of land and water resources, balance the use of coastal resources and establish guidelines and standards for conservations, economic development, tourism, transportation, and the protection of common law.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural Resources, Division of Coastal Management.

== Management and planning ==

Due to the increasing urbanization along the coastlines, planning and management are essential to protecting the ecosystems and environment from depleting. [[Coastal management]] is becoming implemented more because of the movement of people to the shore and the hazards that come with the territory. Some of the hazards include movement of [[barrier island]]s, [[sea level rise]], [[hurricane]]s, [[nor'easter]]s, [[earthquake]]s, [[flooding]], [[erosion]], [[pollution]] and human development along the coast. The [[Coastal Zone Management Act]] (CZMA)  was created in 1972 because of the continued growth along the coast, this act introduced better management practices such as [[integrated coastal zone management]], [[adaptive management]] and the use [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]] strategies when planning. According to the Coastal Zone Management Act, the objectives are to remain balanced to "preserve, protect, develop, and where possible, to restore or enhance the resources of the nation's coastal zone".&lt;ref&gt;National oceanic and atmospheric administration. (2011). Retrieved from http://coastalmanagement.noaa.gov/czm/czm_act.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The development of the land can strongly affect the sea,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. Coastal zone management handbook. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ZHvKDJSg1PEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=management of coastal hazards&amp;ots=bwKAk06AoG&amp;sig=b9_iBP7OykljD0qtF9BkJutiEUw&lt;/ref&gt; for example the engineering of structures versus non-structures and the effects of erosion along the shore.

'''Integrated coastal zone management'''

Integrated coastal zone management means the integration of all aspects of the coastal zone; this includes environmentally, socially, culturally politically and economically to meet a sustainable balance all around. Sustainability is the goal to allow development yet protect the environment in which we develop. Coastal zones are fragile and do not do well with change so it is important to acquire sustainable development. The integration from all views will entitle a holistic view for the best implementation and management of that country, region and local scales. The five types of integration&lt;ref&gt;CICIN-SAIN, B. 1993. Sustainable Development and Integrated Coastal Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 11–43.&lt;/ref&gt; include integration among sectors, integration between land and water elements of the coastal zone, integration amount levels of government, integration between nations and integration among disciplines are all essential to meet the needs for implementation.
Management practices include
#maintaining the functional integrity of the coastal resource systems,without disrupting the environment
#reducing resource-use conflicts, by making sure resources are used adequately and sustainably,
#maintaining the health of the environment, which means to protect the ecosystems and natural cycle,
#facilitating the progress of multisectoral development, which means allowing developers to develop within standards.&lt;ref&gt;THIA-ENG, C. 1993. Essential Elements of Integrated Coastal Zone Management. Ocean and Coastal Management, 21, 81–108.&lt;/ref&gt;
These four management practices should be based on a bottom-up approach, meaning the approach starts from a local level which is more intimate to the specific environment of that area. After assessment from the local level, the state and federal input can be implemented. The bottom-up approach is key for protecting the local environments because there is a diversity of environments that have specific needs all over the world.

'''Adaptive management'''
[[File:Managing Coastal Hazards.gif|thumb|left| Managing Coastal Hazards Chart]]
Adaptive management is another practice of development adaptation with the environment. Resources are the major factor when managing  adaptively to a certain environment to accommodate all the needs of development and ecosystems. Strategies used must be flexible by either passive or active adaptive management include these key features:&lt;ref&gt;Elzinga, C.L., D. W. Salzer, J. W. Willoughby (1998). Measuring and Monitoring Plant Populations. Denver, CO: Bureau of Land Management. BLM Technical Reference 1730-1.&lt;/ref&gt;
*AIterative decision-making (evaluating results and adjusting actions on the basis of what has been learned)
*Feedback between monitoring and decisions (learning process)
*Explicit characterization of system uncertainty through multi-model inference (experimentation)
*Embracing risk and uncertainty as a way of building understanding (trial and error)
To achieve adaptive management is testing the assumptions to achieve a desired outcome, such as trial and error, find the best known strategy then monitoring it to adapt to the environment, and learning the outcomes of success and failures of a project.

'''Mitigation'''
[[File:Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Relocation due to high energy wave activity.jpg|thumb|right|Relocation of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, NC, Failure of groin to protect the coast]]
The purpose of [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]] is not only to minimize the loss of property damage, but minimize environmental damages due to development. To avoid impacts by not taking or limiting actions, to reduce or rectify impacts by rehabilitation or restoring the affected environments or instituting long-term maintenance operations and compensating for impacts by replacing or providing substitute environments for resources&lt;ref&gt;Race, Margret. , &amp; Christie, Donna, (n.d.). Coastal zone development: Mitigation and decision-making. 6(4), 317–328. Retrieved from http://www.springerlink.com/content/r078478127573341/fulltext.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Structural mitigation is the current solution to eroding beaches and movement of sand is the use of engineered structures along the coast have been short lived and are only an illusion of safety to the public that result in long term damage of the coastline.  Structural management deals with the use of the following: groins which are man-made solution to [[longshore drift|longshore current]] movements up and down the coast. The use of groins are efficient to some extent yet cause erosion and sand build up further down the beaches. Bulkheads are man-made structures that help protect the homes built along the coast and other bodies of water that actually induce erosion in the long run. Jetties are structures built to protect sand movement into the inlets where boats for fishing and recreation move through.
The use of nonstructural mitigation is the practice of using organic and soft structures for solutions to protect against coastal hazards. These include: artificial dunes, which are used to create dunes that have been either developed on or eroded. There needs to be at least two lines of dunes before any development can occur. Beach Nourishment is a major source of nonstructural mitigation to ensure that beaches are present for the communities and for the protection of the coastline. Vegetation is a key factor when protecting from erosion, specifically for to help stabilize dune erosion.

[[Romanticism]] grew largely out of an attempt to understand not just inert nature, but also vital nature. Romantic works in the realm of art and [[medicine|Romantic medicine]] were a response to the general failure of the application of method of inertial science to reveal the foundational laws and operant principles of vital nature. German romantic science and medicine sought to understand the nature of the life principle identified by John Hunter as distinct from matter itself via [[Blumenbach|Johan Friedrich Blumenbach]]'s ''Bildungstrieb'' and [[Hahnemann|Romantic medicine]]'s ''Lebenskraft'', as well as Röschlaub's development of the [[Brunonian|Brunonian system of medicine]] system of John Brown, in his ''excitation theory'' of life (German:''Erregbarkeit theorie''), working also with  Schelling's ''Naturphilosophie'', the work of [[Goethe]] regarding morphology, and the first dynamic conception of physiology of [[Richard Saumarez]]. But it is in [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] that we find the question of life and vital nature most intensely and comprehensively examined, particularly in his '''''Hints towards the Formation of a more Comprehensive Theory of Life'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (1818), providing the foundation for [[Romanticism and epistemology|Romantic philosophy]], science and medicine.&lt;ref name=Levere&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levere|first1=Trevor H.|title=Coleridge and the Sciences|journal=CUP Archive|date=June 28, 1990|pages=295–306|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=0jc4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=Owen+Barfield+Hints+Towards+a+More+Comprehensive+Theory+of+Life&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Owen%20Barfield%20Hints%20Towards%20a%20More%20Comprehensive%20Theory%20of%20Life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is key to understanding the relationship of Romantic literature and science.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Male|first1=Roy R. Jr|title=The Background of Coleridge's Theory of Life|journal=|date=1954|volume=33|issue=The University of Texas Studies in English|page=60|jstor=20776075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The Enlightenment had developed a philosophy and science supported by formidable twin pillars: the first the Cartesian split of mind and matter, the second Newtonian physics, with its conquest of inert nature, both of which focused the mind's gaze on things or objects. For Cartesian philosophy, life existed on the side of matter, not mind; and for the physical sciences, the method that had been so productive for revealing the secrets of inert nature, should be equally productive in examining vital nature. The initial attempt to seek the cause and principle of life in matter was challenged by John Hunter, who held that the principle of life was not to be found nor confined within matter, but existed independently of matter itself, and informed or animated it, that is, he implied, it was the unifying or antecedent cause of the things or what Aristotelean philosophy termed ''natura naturata'' (the outer appearances of nature).
 
This reduction of the question of life to matter, and the corollary, that the method of the inertial sciences was the way to understand the very phenomenon of life, that is, its very nature and essence as a power (''natura naturans''), not as manifestations through sense-perceptible appearances (''natura naturata''), also reduced the individual to a material-mechanical 'thing' and seemed to render human freedom an untenable concept. It was this that Romanticism challenged, seeking instead to find an approach to the essence of nature as being also vital not simply inert, through a systematic method involving not just physics, but physiology (living functions). For Coleridge, quantitative analysis was anti-realist and needed to be grounded in qualitative analysis ('-ologies') (as was the case with Goethe's approach).&lt;ref name=Dyssebeia&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Metaphors In Coleridge's Theory of Life|url=http://dyssebeia.wordpress.com/2013/10/17/two-metaphors-in-coleridges-theory-of-life/|website=Dyssebeia|publisher=[[Wordpress]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
At the same time, the Romantics had to deal with the idealistic view that life was a 'somewhat' outside of things, such that the things themselves lost any real existence, a stream coming through Hume and Kant, and also infusing the German natural philosophical stream, German idealism, and in particular ''naturphilosophie'', eventuating scientifically in the doctrine of 'vitalism'. For the Romantics, life is independent of and antecedent to nature, but also infused and suspended in nature, not apart from it, As David Bohm expresses it in more modern terms "In nature nothing remains constant…everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is…at the foundation of the possibility of our understanding nature in a rational way."&lt;ref name=Bohm&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bohm|first1=David|title=Causality and Chance in Modern Physics|publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]]|location=1957|page=1|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=nweG_wrUHuAC&amp;q=foundation#v=snippet&amp;q=foundation&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And as Coleridge explained, 'this antecedent unity, or cause and principle of each union, it has since the time of Bacon and Kepler been customary to call a law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|location=Middletown, CT|page=44, note 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as law, "we derive from it a progressive insight into the necessity and generation of the phenomena of which it is the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=45, fn 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coleridge’s theory of life ==

Coleridge's was the dominant mind on many issues involving the philosophy and science in his time, as John Stuart Mill acknowledged, along with others since who have studied the history of Romanticism.

:The name of Coleridge is one of the few English names of our time which are likely to be oftener pronounced, and to become symbolical of more important things, in proportion as the inward workings of the age manifest themselves more and more in outward facts.&lt;ref name=Mill&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mill|first1=John Stuart|title=Collected Works of John Stuart Mill|edition=Vol. 10|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=241&amp;chapter=21494&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]

For Coleridge, as for many of his romantic contemporaries, the idea that matter itself can begat life only dealt with the various changes in the arrangement of particles and did not explain life itself as a principle or power that lay behind the material manifestations, ''natura naturans'' or "the productive power suspended and, as it were, quenched in the product" Until this were addressed, according to Coleridge, "we have not yet attained to a science of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This productive power is above sense experience, but not above nature herself, that is, supersensible, but not supernatural, and, thus, not 'occult' as was the case with vitalism. Vitalism failed to distinguish between spirit and nature, and then within nature, between the visible appearances and the invisible, yet very real and not simply hypothesized notion, essence or motivating principle (''natura naturans''). Even Newton spoke of things invisible in themselves (though not in their manifestations), such as force, though Comte, the thorough materialist, complained of the use of such terms as the 'force of gravity' as being relics of animism.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matter was not a 'datum' or thing in and of itself, but rather a product or effect, and for Coleridge, looking at life in its broadest sense, it was the product of a polarity of forces and energies, but derived from a unity which is itself a power, not an abstract or nominal concept, that is Life, and this polar nature of forces within the power of Life is the very law or 'Idea' (in the Platonic sense) of Creation.&lt;ref name="What Coleridge Thought"/&gt;

== Life as polarity/function/motion ==

For Coleridge the essence of the universe is motion and motion is driven by a dynamic polarity of forces that is both inherent in the world as potential and acting inherently in all manifestations. This polarity is the very dynamic that acts throughout all of nature, including into the more particular form of 'life biological', as well as of mind and consciousness.
 
:The tendency having been ascertained, what is its most general law? I answer—polarity, or the essential dualism of Nature, arising out of its productive unity, and still tending to reaffirm it, either as equilibrium, indifference, or identity.&lt;ref name="Theory of Life"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Hints Towards a More Comprehensive Theory of Life|date=1848|publisher=Lea and Blanchard|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=AXcNAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge+theory+of+life&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vGNTVLG8E8OogwSsvoCgDw&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And this polarity is dynamic, that is real, though not visible, and not simply logical or abstract. Thus, the polarity results in manifestations that are real, as the opposite powers are not contradictory, but counteracting and inter-penetrating.

:...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and in the process of our own self-consciousness.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleridge|first1=Samuel Taylor|title=Biographia Literaria|date=1834|publisher=Leavitt, Lord &amp; Company|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=QHdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=coleridge+biographia+literaria&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2RTVMaCA4aeNtPPgMAN&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=biographia%20literaria&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, then, Life itself is not a thing—a self-subsistent hypostasis—but an act and process...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

And in that sense Coleridge re-phrases the question "What is Life?" to "What is not Life that really is?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dynamic polar essence of nature in all its functions and manifestations is a universal law in the order of the law of gravity and other physical laws of inert nature. And, critically, this dynamic polarity of constituent powers of life at all levels is not outside or above nature, but is within nature (''natura naturans''), not as a part of the visible product, but as the ulterior natural functions that produce such products or things.

:a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function…

:The first product of its energy is the thing itself… Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=34, fn 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is these functions that provided the bridge being sought by Romantic science and medicine, in particular by Andreas Röschlaub and the [[Brunonian system|Brunonian system of medicine]], between the inertial science of inert nature (physics) and the vital science of vital nature (physiology) and its therapeutic application or physic (the domain of the physician).

=== Romanticism and vitalism ===

Coleridge was influenced by German philosophy, in particular Kant, Fichte and Schelling (Naturphilosophie), as well as the physiology of Blumenbach and the dynamic excitation theory of life of the Brunonian system. He sought a path that was neither the mystical tendency of the earlier vitalists nor the materialistic reductionist approach to natural science, but a dynamic one.

:What Coleridge was after was definitely not animism or naive vitalism based on vital substance, or mechanical philosophy based on material substance. He was trying to find a general law...that explicates its self-regulating internal power.&lt;ref name=Hawk&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawk|first1=Byron|title=A Counter-history of Composition: Toward Methodologies of Complexity|date=2007|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=142–144|url=https://books.google.bs/books?id=dnHFgu43x1oC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=Coleridge%27s+theory+of+life&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UljAqrEoxP&amp;sig=ojuS_BPEC--PNpfZVQ15yb1PUIs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tfpTVODlMsebNpTGgsgE&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Coleridge%27s%20theory%20of%20life&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's challenge was to describe something that was dynamic neither in mystical terms not materialistic ones, but via analogy, drawing from the examples of inertial science. As one writer explains, he uses the examples of electricity, magnetism and gravity not because they are like life, but because they offer a way of understanding powers, forces and energies, which lie at the heart of life. And using these analogies, Coleridge seeks to demonstrate that life is not a material force, but a product of relations amongst forces. Life is not linear and static, but dynamic process of self-regulation and [[emergence|Emergent evolution]] that results in increasing complexity and individuation.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt; This spiral, upward movement (cf. Goethe's ideas) creates a force for organization that unifies, and is most intense and powerful in that which is most complex and most individual - the self-regulating, enlightened, developed individual mind. But at the same time, this process of life increases interdependence (like the law of comparative advantage in economics) and associational powers of the mind. Thus, he is not talking about an isolated, individual subjective mind, but about the evolution of a higher level of consciousness and thought at the core of the process of life.&lt;ref name=Hawk/&gt;

== Life and liberty ==

And the direction of this motion is towards increasing individuation, that is the creation of specific, individual units of things. At the same time, given the dynamic polarity of the world, there must always be an equal and opposite tendency, in this case, that of connection. So, a given of our experience is that man is both an individual, tending in each life and in history generally to greater and greater individualization, and a social creature seeking interaction and connection. It is the dynamic interplay between the individuation and connecting forces that leads to higher and higher individuation.
 
:By Life I everywhere mean the true Idea of Life,… the tendency to individuation… [which] cannot be conceived without the opposite tendency to connect, even as the centrifugal power supposes the centripetal, or as the two opposite poles constitute each other, and are the constituent acts of one and the same power in the magnet…. Again, if the tendency be at once to individuate and to connect, to detach, but so as either to retain or to reproduce attachment, the individuation itself must be a tendency to the ultimate production of the highest and most comprehensive individuality. This must be the one great end of Nature, her ultimate object, or by whatever other word we may designate that something which bears to a final cause the same relation that Nature herself bears to the Supreme Intelligence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Creative life and vital nature ==

Coleridge makes a further distinction between mathematics and life, the latter being productive or creative, that is, living, and the former ideal. Thus, the mathematical approach that works so well with inert nature, is not suitable for vital nature.

:In its productive power, of which the product is the only measure, consists its incompatibility with mathematical calculus. For the full applicability of an abstract science ceases, the moment reality begins.

:This productive or generative power of life exists in all manifestations of life. These manifestations are the finite product of the dynamic interaction of infinite and non-destructible forces, but the forces are not extinguished in the product - they take on a different role, namely that of functions. Thus, the very nature of the “given” is contained in its manifestations such that the whole is contained in all the parts. 
The counteraction then of the two assumed forces does not depend on their meeting from opposite directions; the power which acts in them is indestructible; it is therefore inexhaustibly re-ebullient; and as something must be the result of these two forces, both alike infinite, and both alike indestructible; and as rest or neutralization cannot be this result; no other conception is possible, but that the product must be a tertium aliquid, [a third thing] or finite generation. Consequently this conception is necessary. Now this tertium aliquid can be no other than an inter-penetration of the counteracting powers, partaking of both… Consequently the 'constituent powers', that have given rise to a body, may then reappear in it as its function: "a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function...the first product of its energy is the thing itself: ''ipsa se posuit et iam facta est ens positum''. Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces, properties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body...The vital functions are consequents of the ''Vis Vitae Principium Vitale'', and presuppose the Organs, as the Functionaries.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Life, that is, the essential polarity in unity (multeity in unity) in Coleridge’s sense also has a four beat cycle, different from the arid dialectics of abstraction - namely the tension of the polar forces themselves, the charge of their synthesis, the discharge of their product (indifference) and the resting state of this new form (predominance). The product is not a neutralization, but a new form of the essential forces, these forces remaining within, though now as the functions of the form.

:But as little can we conceive the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. (BL)
To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Life and matter ==

This dynamic polarity that is Life is expressed at different levels. At its most basic it is Space-Time, with its product - motion. The interplay of both gives us either a line or a circle, and then there are different degrees possible within a given form or “predominance” of forces. Geometry is not conceivable except as the dynamic interplay of space (periphery) and time (point). Space, time and motion are also geometrically represented by width, length (breadth) and depth. And this correspondence is repeated throughout the scale of Life.

:We have been thus full and express on this subject, because these simple ideas of time, space, and motion, of length, breadth, and depth, are not only the simplest and universal, but the necessary symbols of all philosophic construction. They will be found the primary factors and elementary forms of every calculus and of every diagram in the algebra and geometry of a scientific physiology. Accordingly, we shall recognise the same forms under other names; but at each return more specific and intense; and the whole process repeated with ascending gradations of reality, exempli gratiâ: Time + space = motion; Tm + space = line + breadth = depth; depth + motion = force; Lf + Bf = Df; LDf + BDf = attraction + repulsion = gravitation; and so on, even till they pass into outward phenomena, and form the intermediate link between productive powers and fixed products in light, heat, and electricity.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Matter, then, is the product of the dynamic forces - repulsion (centrifugal), and attraction (centripetal); it is not itself a productive power. It is also the mass of a given body.
 
:If we pass to the construction of matter, we find it as the product, or tertium aliquid, of antagonist powers of repulsion and attraction. Remove these powers, and the conception of matter vanishes into space—conceive repulsion only, and you have the same result. For infinite repulsion, uncounteracted and alone, is tantamount to infinite, dimensionless diffusion, and this again to infinite weakness; viz., to space. Conceive attraction alone, and as an infinite contraction, its product amounts to the absolute point, viz., to time. Conceive the synthesis of both, and you have matter as a fluxional antecedent, which, in the very act of formation, passes into body by its gravity, and yet in all bodies it still remains as their mass...&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

Coleridge’s understanding of life is contrasted with the materialist view which is essentially reduced to defining life as that which is the opposite of not-life, or that which resists death, that is, that which is life.

:By an easy logic, each of the two divisions has been made to define the others by a mere assertion of their assumed contrariety. The theorist has explained Y+X by informing us that it is the opposite of Y-X: and if we ask, what then is Y-X, we are told that it is the opposite of Y+X! A reciprocation of good services....I turn to a work by the eminent French physiologist, Bichat, where I find this definition: Life is the sum of all the functions by which death is resisted....that is, that life consists in being able to live!...as if four more inveterate abstractions could be brought together than the words life, death, function, and resistance.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;

== Cognition and life ==

The problem for Coleridge and the Romantics was that the intellect, 'left to itself' as Bacon stated, was capable of apprehending only the outer forms of nature (natura naturata) and not the inmost, living functions (natura naturans) giving rise to these forms. Thus, effects can only be 'explained' in terms of other effects, not causes. It takes a different capacity to 'see' these living functions, which is an imaginative activity. For Coleridge, there is an innate, primitive or 'primary' imagination that configures invisibly sense-experience into perception, but a rational perception, that is, one raised into consciousness and awareness and then rationally presentable, requires a higher level, what he termed 'secondary imagination', which is able to connect with the thing being experienced, penetrate to its essence in terms of the living dynamics upholding its outer form, and then present the phenomena as and within its natural law, and further, using reason, develop the various principles of its operation.

This cognitive capacity involved what Coleridge termed the 'inmost sense' or what Goethe termed the '''Gemüt'''. It also involved the reactivation of the old Greek noetic capacity, and the ability to 'see' or produce the theory (Greek ''theoria'' from the verb 'to see') dynamic polarities, or natural Laws, the dynamic transcendent (foundational) entities that Plato termed 'Ideas' (''eidos'').

Since ''natura naturata'' is sustained by ''natura naturans'', and the creative power of ''natura naturans'' is one of a kind with the human mind, itself creative, then there must be a correspondence or connection between the mind and the things we perceive, such that we can overcome the apparent separation between the object and the representation in the mind of the object that came to bedevil Enlightenment thought (Hume, Kant). As one commentator noted "to speak at all of the unity of intelligence and nature is of course flatly to contradict Descartes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and evolution ==

For Coleridge the power of life lies in every seed as a potential to be unfolded as a result of interaction with the environment (heat, light, air, moisture, etc.), an insight which allowed him to see in the Brunonian system a dynamic polarity in excitation theory.
 
Coleridge also saw that there was a progressive movement through time and space of life or the law of polarity, from the level of physics (space and time) and the mineral or inert nature (law of gravity, operating through forces of attraction and repulsion), up to man, with his law of resonance in terms of his innate desire to be himself (force of individuation) and to also connect with like-minded (force of connection), as Goethe expressed in his novel ''Elective Affinities'' (''Wahlverwandschaften'') as well as in his own life's experience.
 
Evolution occurred because the original polarity of creation, the very 'Law of Creation', itself gives birth to subsequent polarities, as each pole is itself a unity that can be further polarized (what Wilhelm Reich later termed 'orgonomic functionalism' and what at the biological level constitutes physiology),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insight that would later be taken up by the concept of emergent evolution, including the emergence of mind and consciousness.

:the productive power, or ''vis naturans'', which in the sensible world, or n''atura naturata'', is what we mean by the word, nature, when we speak of the same as an agent, is essentially one (that is, of one kind) with the intelligence, which is in the human mind above nature."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And that this is so, is also an intimate and shared experience of all humans, as is set out in Reid's Common Sense philosophy. As Coleridge states

:but for the confidence which we place in the assertions of our reason and our conscience, we could have no certainty of the reality and actual outness of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That nature evolves towards a purpose, and that is the unfolding of the human mind and consciousness in all its levels and degrees, is not teleological but a function of the very nature of the law of polarity or creation itself, namely that of increasing individuation of an original unity, what Coleridge termed 'multeity in unity'. As he states, "without assigning to nature as nature, a conscious purpose" we must still "distinguish her agency from a blind and lifeless mechanism."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

While man contains and is subject to the various laws of nature, man as a self-conscious being is also the summa of a process of creation leading to greater mind and consciousness, that is, a creative capacity of imagination. Instead of being a creature of circumstance, man is the creator of them, or at least has that potential.
 
:Naked and helpless cometh man into the world. Such has been the complaint from eldest time; but we complain of our chief privilege, our ornament, and the connate mark of our sovereignty. Porphyrigeniti summus! …Henceforth he is referred to himself, delivered up to his own charge…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Owen|title=What Coleridge Thought|date=1971|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=29, fn 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deep time''' is the concept of [[Geologic time scale|geologic time]]. The modern philosophical concept was developed in the 18th century by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] geologist [[James Hutton]] (1726–1797).{{sfn|Palmer|Zen}}{{sfn|Kubicek|2008}} The [[age of the Earth]] has been determined to be, after a long and complex history of developments, around 4.55&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-science-figured-out-the-age-of-the-earth/|title=How Science Figured Out the Age of Earth|last=Braterman|first=Paul S.|website=Scientific American|access-date=2016-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Life timeline}}
Hutton based his view of deep time on a form of geochemistry that had developed in Scotland and Scandinavia from the 1750s onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Eddy |first = Matthew Daniel |title = The Language of Mineralogy: John Walker, Chemistry and the Edinburgh Medical School 1750-1800 |date = 2008 |publisher = [[Ashgate]] |location = London |page = Ch. 5 |url = https://www.academia.edu/1112014/The_Language_of_Mineralogy_John_Walker_Chemistry_and_the_Edinburgh_Medical_School_1750-1800_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[mathematician]] [[John Playfair]], one of Hutton's friends and colleagues in the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], remarked upon seeing the [[stratum|strata]] of the [[Unconformity|angular unconformity]] at [[Siccar Point]] with Hutton and [[Sir James Hall, 4th Baronet|James Hall]] in June 1788, "the mind seemed to grow giddy by looking so far into the abyss of time".{{sfn|Playfair|1805}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= McPhee |first= John |date= 1981 |title= Book 1: Basin and Range, in [[Annals of the Former World]] |url= |location= New York |publisher= [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |page= 79 |isbn= 0-374-10520-0 |author-link= John McPhee }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[geologists]] such as [[Nicolas Steno]] (1638-1686) and [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]] (1740-1799) had developed ideas of [[Stratum|geological strata]] forming from water through chemical processes, which [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] (1749–1817) developed into a theory known as [[Neptunism]], envisaging the slow crystallisation of minerals in the ancient oceans of the Earth to form [[rock (geology)|rock]].  Hutton's innovative 1785 theory, based on [[Plutonism]], visualised an endless cyclical process of rocks forming under the sea, being uplifted and tilted, then eroded to form new strata under the sea. In 1788 the sight of [[Hutton's Unconformity]] at Siccar Point convinced Playfair and Hall of this extremely slow cycle, and in that same year Hutton memorably wrote "we find no vestige of a beginning, no prospect of an end".{{sfn|Montgomery|2003}}{{sfn|Rance|1999}}

Other scientists such as [[Georges Cuvier]] (1769-1832) put forward ideas of past ages, and geologists such as [[Adam Sedgwick]] (1785-1873) incorporated Werner's ideas into concepts of [[catastrophism]]; Sedgwick inspired his university student [[Charles Darwin]] to exclaim "What a capital hand is Sedgewick [sic] for drawing large cheques upon the Bank of Time!".{{sfn|Darwin|1831}}  In a competing theory, [[Charles Lyell]] in his ''Principles of Geology'' (1830–1833) developed Hutton's comprehension of endless deep time as a crucial [[Science|scientific]] concept  into [[uniformitarianism]].  As a young [[Natural history|naturalist]] and geological theorist, Darwin studied the successive volumes of Lyell's book exhaustively during the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|''Beagle'' survey voyage]] in the 1830s, before beginning to theorise about [[evolution]].

[[Physicist]] [[Gregory Benford]] addresses the concept in ''Deep Time: How Humanity Communicates Across Millennia'' (1999), as does [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] and ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' editor [[Henry Gee]] in ''In Search of Deep Time:  Beyond the Fossil Record to a New History of Life'' (2001){{sfn|Korthof|2000}}{{sfn|Campbell|2001}}  [[Stephen Jay Gould]]'s ''[[Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle]]'' (1987) also deals in large part with the evolution of the concept.

[[John McPhee]] discussed "deep time" at length with the layperson in mind in ''Basin and Range'' (1981), parts of which originally appeared in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine.{{sfn|McPhee|1998|p=77}} In ''Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle'', Gould cited one of the metaphors McPhee used in explaining the concept of deep time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Consider the Earth's history as the old measure of the English yard, the distance from the King's nose to the tip of his outstretched hand. One stroke of a nail file on his middle finger erases human history.{{sfn|McPhee|1998|p=77}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concepts similar to geologic time were recognized in the 11th century by the [[Islamic geography|Persian geologist]] and [[polymath]] [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina, 973–1037),{{sfn|Toulmin|Goodfield|1965|p=64}} and by the [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese naturalist]] and polymath [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095).{{sfn|Sivin|1995|pp=iii,23-24}}

The [[Roman Catholic]] [[theologian]] [[Thomas Berry]] (1914–2009) explored [[spirituality|spiritual]] implications of the concept of deep time.  Berry proposes that a deep understanding of the history and functioning of the evolving universe is a necessary inspiration and guide for our own effective functioning as individuals and as a species. This view has greatly influenced the development of [[deep ecology]] and [[ecophilosophy]]. The experiential nature of the experience of deep time has also greatly influenced the work of [[Joanna Macy]] and [[John Seed]].

[[H.G. Wells]] and [[Julian Huxley]] regarded the difficulties of coping with the concept of deep time as exaggerated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The use of different scales is simply a matter of practice", they said in ''[[The Science of Life]]'' (1929).  "We very soon get used to maps, though they are constructed on scales down to a hundred-millionth of natural size. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp; to grasp geological time all that is needed is to stick tight to some magnitude which shall be the unit on the new and magnified scale—a million years is probably the most convenient—to grasp its meaning once and for all by an effort of imagination, and then to think of all passage of geological time in terms of this unit."&lt;ref&gt;
H.G. Wells, Julian S. Huxley, and G.P. Wells, ''The Science of Life'' (New York: The Literary Guild, 1934; orig. publ. 1929), p. 326.

[[File:Earth's shadow and Belt of Venus.jpg|thumb|220px|Earth's shadow (blue) and the [[Belt of Venus]] (pink) at [[dawn]], seen above the horizon where the sky meets the sea, looking west from [[Twin Peaks (San Francisco, California)|Twin Peaks]], [[San Francisco]].&lt;br/&gt;
{{small|(Note: The lowest blue-grey area is the surface of the [[Pacific Ocean]], not the sky.)}}]]

'''Earth's shadow''' or '''Earth shadow''' is the [[shadow]] that [[Earth]] itself casts onto [[Earth's atmosphere|its atmosphere]] and into [[outer space]], toward the [[antisolar point]]. During [[Twilight#Civil twilight|twilight]] (both early [[dusk]] and late [[dawn]]), the shadow's visible fringe (sometimes called the '''dark segment''' or '''twilight wedge'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weatherscapes.com/album.php?cat=optics&amp;subcat=twilight_wedge&lt;/ref&gt;) appears in a clear [[sky]] as a dark and [[diffuse]]d band low above the [[horizon]].

==Appearance==
[[File:Golden Gate Bridge, the Belt of Venus and the Earth's shadow.jpg|thumb|250px|Earth's shadow and the [[Belt of Venus]] at [[dusk]], looking east from the [[Marin Headlands]] just north of [[San Francisco]] in October 2010.&lt;br/&gt;{{small|(Note: A thin layer of greyish cloud partially obscures the horizon in this image.)}}]]

Earth's shadow cast onto the atmosphere can be viewed during the "civil" stage of [[twilight]], assuming the sky is clear and the [[horizon]] is relatively unobstructed. The shadow's fringe appears as a dark bluish to purplish band that stretches over [[azimuth|180°]] of the horizon&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt; opposite the [[Sun]], i.e. in the eastern sky at [[dusk]] and in the western sky at [[dawn]]. Before [[sunrise]], Earth's shadow appears to recede as the Sun rises; after [[sunset]], the shadow appears to rise as the Sun sets.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;

Earth's shadow is best seen when the horizon is low, such as over the sea, and when the sky conditions are clear. In addition, the higher the observer's [[elevation]] is to view the horizon, the sharper the shadow appears.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

==Belt of Venus==
{{main|Belt of Venus}}
[[File:Moon and red blue haze.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Full moon]] rising, as seen through the Belt of Venus. A very small part of the Earth's shadow (dark blue) is also visible in this image, but the horizon here is too high for more of the Earth's shadow to be seen.]]

A related phenomenon in the same part of the sky is the [[Belt of Venus]], or anti-twilight arch, a pinkish band visible above the bluish shade of Earth's shadow, named after the [[planet]] [[Venus]] which, when visible, is typically located in this region of the sky.
No [[terminator (solar)|defined line]] divides the Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus; one colored band blends into the other in the sky.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

The Belt of Venus is quite a different phenomenon from the [[afterglow]], which appears in the geometrically opposite part of the sky.

===Color===
When the Sun is near the horizon around [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]], the sunlight appears reddish. This is because the light rays are penetrating an especially [[air mass (astronomy)|thick layer]] of the atmosphere, which works as a filter, [[light scattering by particles|scattering]] all but the longer (redder) wavelengths. 

From the observer's perspective, the red sunlight directly illuminates [[particulates|small particles]] in the lower atmosphere in the sky opposite of the Sun. The red light is [[backscatter]]ed to the observer, which is the reason why the [[Belt of Venus]] appears pink. 

The lower the setting Sun descends, the less defined the boundary between Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus appears. This is because the setting Sun now illuminates a thinner part of the upper atmosphere. There the red light is not scattered because fewer particles are present, and the eye only sees the "normal" (usual) blue sky, which is due to [[Rayleigh scattering]] from air molecules. Eventually, both Earth's shadow and the Belt of Venus dissolve into the darkness of the [[night sky]].&lt;ref name="earth's shadow"/&gt;

==Color of lunar eclipses==
{{main|Lunar eclipse}}
[[File:Near Greatest Eclipse 20101221 0011-crop.jpg|thumb|200px|A total [[lunar eclipse]] on [[December 2010 lunar eclipse|December 21, 2010]], shows the reddish light falling on the Moon's surface.]]

Earth's shadow is as curved as the planet is, and its [[umbra]] extends {{cvt|1,400,000|km|mi}} into outer space. (The [[antumbra]], however, extends indefinitely.) When the [[Sun]], Earth, and the [[Moon]] are [[syzygy (astronomy)|aligned perfectly]] (or nearly so), with Earth between the Sun and the Moon, Earth's shadow falls onto the lunar surface facing the night side of the planet, such that the shadow gradually darkens the [[full Moon]], causing a [[lunar eclipse]]. 

Even during a total lunar eclipse, a small amount of sunlight however still reaches the Moon. This indirect sunlight has been [[atmospheric refraction|refracted]] as it passed through [[Earth's atmosphere]]. The air molecules and [[particulates]] in Earth's atmosphere [[Raleigh scattering|scatter]] the shorter wavelengths of this sunlight; thus, the longer wavelengths of reddish light reaches the Moon, in the same way that light at [[sunset]] or [[sunrise]] appears reddish. This weak red illumination gives the eclipsed Moon a dimly reddish or [[copper]] color.&lt;ref name=earth-shadow/&gt;

'''Earth mass''' ({{Earth mass}}, where ⊕ is the standard [[astronomical symbol]] for planet [[Earth]]) is the unit of [[mass]] equal to that of Earth. 
The current best estimate for Earth mass is {{math|{{Earth mass}} {{=}} {{val|5.9722|e=24|u=kg}}}}, with a [[standard uncertainty]] of 
{{val|6|e=20|u=kg}} (relative uncertainty 10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;"[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/static/files/2016/Astronomical_Constants_2016.pdf 2016 Selected Astronomical Constants]" in {{citation | title = The Astronomical Almanac Online | url = http://asa.usno.navy.mil/ | publisher = [[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]]–[[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|UKHO]]}}.

It is equivalent to an [[average density]] of {{val|5,515|u=kg⋅m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

The Earth mass is a standard [[units of mass|unit of mass]] in [[astronomy]] that is used to indicate the masses of other [[planet]]s, including rocky [[terrestrial planet]]s and [[exoplanet]]s. One [[Solar mass]] is close to 333,000 Earth masses.
The Earth mass excludes the mass of the [[Moon]]. The mass of the Moon is about 1.2% of that of the Earth, so that the mass of the Earth+Moon system is close to {{val|6.0456|e=24|u=kg}}.

Most of the mass is accounted for by  [[iron]] and [[oxygen]] (c. 32% each), [[magnesium]] and [[silicon]] (c. 15% each), [[calcium]], [[aluminium]] and [[nickel]] (c. 1.5% each).

Precise measurement of the Earth mass is difficult, as it is equivalent to measuring the [[gravitational constant]], which is the fundamental [[physical constant]] known with least accuracy, due to the relative weakness of the [[gravitational force]].
The mass of the Earth was measured accurately in the [[Schiehallion experiment]] in the 1770s, and within 1% of the modern value in the [[Cavendish experiment]] of 1798.

== Unit of mass in astronomy==
{{see|Solar mass|Standard gravitational parameter|Gaussian gravitational constant}}
The mass of Earth is estimated to be:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\oplus=(5.9722\;\pm\;0.0006)\times10^{24}\;\mathrm{kg}&lt;/math&gt;,
which can be expressed in terms of [[solar mass]] as:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\oplus=\frac{1}{332\;946.0487\;\pm\;0.0007}\;\mathrm{M_\odot} \approx 3.003\times10^{-6}\;\mathrm{M_\odot} &lt;/math&gt;.

These methods are less precise than observations of artificial satellites.

The relative uncertainty of the geocentric gravitational constant is just  {{val|2|e=-9}}, however, {{Earth mass}} (the mass of the Earth in kilograms) can be found out only by dividing the ''G''{{Earth mass}} product by ''G'', and ''G'' is known only to a relative uncertainty of 
{{val|4|e=-5}} at best, so {{Earth mass}} will have the same uncertainty. 
For this reason and others, astronomers prefer to use the un-reduced ''G''{{Earth mass}} product, or mass ratios
(masses expressed in units of Earth mass or [[Solar mass]])  rather than mass in kilograms when referencing and comparing planetary objects.

== History of measurement ==
{{main|Gravitational_constant#History_of_measurement}}
[[File:Mendenhall gravimeter pendulums.jpg|thumb|Pendulums used in Mendenhall [[gravimeter]] apparatus, from 1897 scientific journal. The portable gravimeter developed in 1890 by [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall|Thomas C. Mendenhall]] provided the most accurate relative measurements of the local gravitational field of the Earth.]]
The mass of Earth is measured indirectly by determining other quantities such as Earth's density, gravity, or gravitational constant.
The first measurement in the 1770s [[Schiehallion experiment]] resulted in a value about 20% too low.
The [[Cavendish experiment]] of 1798 found the correct value within 1%.
Uncertainty was reduced to about 0.2% by the 1890s,&lt;ref name="Poynting_p50-56"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Poynting|first=J.H.|title=The Earth: its shape, size, weight and spin|publisher=Cambridge|date=1913 |pages=50–56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whA9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
to 0.1% by 1930,&lt;ref&gt;P. R. Heyl, [https://archive.org/details/redeterminationo56124heyl A redetermination of the constant of gravitation], ''National Bureau of Standards Journal of Research''  5 (1930), 1243&amp;ndash;1290.&lt;/ref&gt;
and to 0.01% (10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;4&lt;/sup&gt;) by the 2000s.
The [[figure of the Earth]] has been known to better than four significant digits since the 1960s ([[World Geodetic System|WGS66]]), so that since that time, the uncertainty of the Earth mass is determined essentially by the uncertainty in measuring the [[gravitational constant]].

===Early estimates===
Before the direct measurement of the [[gravitational constant]],
estimates of the Earth mass were limited to estimating Earth's mean density from observation of the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and estimates on Earth's volume. Estimates on the volume of the earth in the 17th century were based on a circumference estimate of 60 miles to the degree of latitude, corresponding to a radius of about 5,500&amp;nbsp;km, resulting in an estimated volume of about one third smaller than the correct value.&lt;ref name="Mackenzie2"&gt;Mackenzie, A. Stanley, ''[https://archive.org/stream/lawsgravitation01newtgoog#page/n6/mode/2up The laws of gravitation; memoirs by Newton, Bouguer and Cavendish, together with abstracts of other important memoirs]'', American Book Company (1900 [1899]), p. 2.
&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=-3JkAAAAcAAJ&amp;hl=sl&amp;pg=RA3-PT186 
Zedler, Universal-Lexicon (1747) gives "26625660000 cubic miles" [2.66e+10] as the volume of the Earth
based on a diameter of 1720 miles. These are German miles, 1 mile = 7,532.5 m.
This corresponds to a radius of 6,478 km, overestimated by about 1.7%, for an overestimation of the volume by some 5%,
as "2.66e+9 cubic miles", but the volume calculation is off by a factor of ten, probably just an additional zero.
--&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
The average density of the Earth was not accurately known. Earth was assumed to consist either mostly of water ([[Neptunism]]) or mostly of [[igneous rock]] ([[Plutonism]]), both suggesting average densities too low by several orders of magnitude,
consistent with a total mass of the order of {{val|e=24|u=kg}}.
[[Isaac Newton]] estimated, without access to reliable measurement,  that the density of Earth would be five or six times as great as the density of water,&lt;ref&gt;"Sir Isaac Newton thought it probable, that the mean density of the earth might be five or six times as great as the density of water; and we have now found, by experiment, that it is very little less than what he had  thought it to be: so much justness was even in the surmises of this wonderful man!" Hutton (1778), p. 783&lt;/ref&gt; which is surprisingly accurate (the modern value is 5.515).
Newton under-estimated the Earth's volume by about 30%, so that his estimate would be roughly equivalent to {{val|4.2|0.5|e=24|u=kg}}.
 
In the 18th century, knowledge of  [[Newton's law of gravitation]] permitted indirect estimates on the mean density of the Earth, 
via estimates of (what in modern terminology is known as) the [[gravitational constant]].
Early estimates on the mean density of the Earth were made by observing  the slight deflection of a pendulum near a mountain, as in the [[Schiehallion experiment]].  Newton considered the experiment in ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', but pessimistically concluded that the effect would be too small to be measurable.

An expedition from 1737 to 1740 by   [[Pierre Bouguer]] and [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] attempted to determine the density of Earth by measuring the period of a pendulum (and therefore the strength of gravity) as a function of elevation.  The experiments were carried out in Ecuador and Peru, on [[Pichincha Volcano]] and mount [[Chimborazo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferreiro|first=Larrie|title=Measure of the Earth: The Enlightenment Expedition that Reshaped Our World|year=2011|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-01723-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bouguer wrote in a 1749 paper that they had been able to detect a deflection of 8&amp;nbsp;[[second of arc|seconds of arc]],
The accuracy was not enough for a definite estimate on the mean density of the Earth, but Bouguer stated that it was at least sufficient to prove that the Earth was not [[hollow Earth|hollow]].&lt;ref name="Poynting_p50-56"/&gt;

===Schiehallion experiment===
{{main|Schiehallion experiment}}
That a further attempt should be made on the experiment was proposed to the [[Royal Society]] in 1772 by [[Nevil Maskelyne]], [[Astronomer Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maskelyne|first=N.|date=1772|title=A proposal for measuring the attraction of some hill in this Kingdom |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=65|pages=495–499 |bibcode=1775RSPT...65..495M|doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the experiment would "do honour to the nation where it was made" and proposed [[Whernside]] in [[Yorkshire]], or the [[Blencathra]]-[[Skiddaw]] massif in [[Cumberland]] as suitable targets. The Royal Society formed the Committee of Attraction to consider the matter, appointing Maskelyne, [[Joseph Banks]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] amongst its members.&lt;ref name="Danson_p115"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Danson|first=Edwin |title=Weighing the World |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|pages=115–116|isbn=978-0-19-518169-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UNH_Y7ERFeoC&amp;pg=PA146}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee despatched the astronomer and surveyor [[Charles Mason]] to find a suitable mountain.

After a lengthy search over the summer of 1773, Mason reported that the best candidate was [[Schiehallion]], a peak in the central [[Scottish Highlands]].&lt;ref name="Danson_p115" /&gt; The mountain stood in isolation from any nearby hills, which would reduce their gravitational influence, and its symmetrical east–west ridge would simplify the calculations. Its steep northern and southern slopes would allow the experiment to be sited close to its [[centre of mass]], maximising the deflection effect.
[[Nevil Maskelyne]], [[Charles Hutton]] and [[Reuben Burrow]] performed the experiment, completed by 1776.
Hutton (1778) reported that the mean density of the Earth was estimated at 
&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{9}{5}&lt;/math&gt; that of Schiehallion mountain.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutton|first=C. |date=1778 |title=An Account of the Calculations Made from the Survey and Measures Taken at Schehallien |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=68 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1778.0034|issue=0 |url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/68/689.citation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This corresponds to a mean density about 4{{frac|1|2}} higher than that of water (i.e., about {{val|4.5|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}), about 20% below the modern value,  but still significantly larger than the mean density of normal rock, suggesting for the first time that the interior of the Earth might be substantially 
composed of metal.
Hutton estimated  this metallic portion to occupy some {{frac|20|31}} (or 65%) of the diameter of the Earth (modern value 55%).&lt;ref name=Hutton783&gt;Hutton (1778), p. 783.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With a value for the mean density of the Earth, Hutton was able to set some values to [[Jérôme Lalande]]'s planetary tables, which had previously only been able to express the densities of the major solar system objects in relative terms.&lt;ref name="Hutton" /&gt;

===Cavendish experiment===
{{main|Cavendish experiment}}
The [[Henry Cavendish]] (1798) was the first to attempt to measure the gravitational attraction between two bodies directly in the laboratory.
Earth's mass could be then found by combining two equations; [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]], and [[Newton's law of universal gravitation#Modern form|Newton's law of universal gravitation]].

In modern notation, the mass of the Earth is derived from the [[gravitational constant]] and the mean [[Earth radius]] by
: &lt;math&gt; M_\oplus =\frac{ GM_\oplus}{ G } = \frac{ g R_\oplus^2}{G}.&lt;/math&gt;
Where "[[little g]]":
:&lt;math&gt;g = G\frac{M_\oplus}{R_\oplus^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Cavendish found a mean density of {{val|5.45|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, about 1% below the modern value.

===19th century===
[[File:Room in Which Mr. Baily Weighed the Earth.jpg|thumb|Experimental setup by [[Francis Baily]] and [[Henry Foster (scientist)|Henry Foster]] to determine the density of Earth using the Cavendish method.]]

While the mass of the Earth is implied by stating the Earth's radius and density, it was not usual to state the absolute mass explicitly 
prior to the introduction of  [[scientific notation]] using [[Power of 10|powers of 10]] in the later 19th century, &lt;!--reference for this? no history in [[scientific notation]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=i-1MAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA404  this] suggests that it wasn't common in the 1860s.--&gt; 
because the absolute numbers would have been too awkward. Ritchie (1850) gives the mass of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] as "11,456,688,186,392,473,000 lbs."&lt;!--5,114,592,940,535,782 tons--&gt; ({{val|1.1|e=19|u=lb}} = {{val|5.0|e=18|u=kg}}, modern value is {{val|5.15|e=18|u=kg}}) and states that "compared with the weight of the globe this mighty sum dwindles to insignificance".&lt;ref&gt;
Archibald Tucker Ritchie, ''The Dynamical Theory of the Formation of the Earth'' vol. 2 (1850), Longman, Brown, Green and Longmans, 1850, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EGdDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA280  p. 280].&lt;/ref&gt;

Absolute figures for the mass of the Earth are cited only beginning in the second half of the 19th century, mostly in popular rather than expert literature.
An early such figure was given as "14 [[1e24|quadrillion]] pounds" (''14 Quadrillionen Pfund'') [{{val|6.5|e=24|u=kg}}] in Masius (1859).

[[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Beckett]] (1871) cites the "weight of the earth" as "5842 [[1e18|quintillion]] [[long ton|tons]]" [{{val|5.936|e=24|u=kg}}].&lt;ref&gt;

Max Eyth, ''Der Kampf um die Cheopspyramide: Erster Band'' (1906), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VoE5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA417  p. 417]
cites the "weight of the globe" (''Das Gewicht des Erdballs'') as "5273 quintillion tons".&lt;/ref&gt;
The "mass of the earth in gravitational measure" is stated as "9.81996×6370980&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;" in ''The New Volumes of the Encyclopaedia Britannica'' (Vol. 25, 1902) with a "logarithm of earth's mass" given as "14.600522" [{{val|3.98586|e=14}}]. This is the [[standard gravitational parameter|gravitational parameter]] in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt; (modern value {{val|3.98600|e=14}}) and not the absolute mass.

Experiments involving pendulums continued to be performed in the first half of the 19th century. By the second half of the century, these were outperformed by repetitions of the Cavendish experiment, and the modern value of ''G'' (and hence, of the Earth mass) is still derived from high-precision repetitions of the Cavendish experiment.

In 1821, [[Francesco Carlini]] determined a density value of ρ = {{val|4.39|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}  through measurements made with pendulums in the [[Milan]] area. This value was refined in 1827 by [[Edward Sabine]] to {{val|4.77|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and then in 1841 by Carlo Ignazio Giulio to {{val|4.95|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. On the other hand, [[George Biddell Airy]] sought to determine ρ by measuring the difference in the period of a pendulum between the surface and the bottom of a mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The first tests took place in Cornwall between 1826 and 1828. The experiment was a failure due to a fire and a flood. Finally, in 1854, Airy got the value {{val|6.6|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}} by measurements in a coal mine in Harton, Sunderland. Airy's method assumed that the Earth had a spherical stratification. Later, in 1883, the experiments conducted by Robert von Sterneck (1839 to 1910) at different depths in mines of Saxony and Bohemia provided the average density values ρ between 5.0 and {{val|6.3|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This led to the concept of isostasy, which limits the ability to accurately measure ρ, by either the deviation from vertical of a plumb line or using pendulums. Despite the little chance of an accurate estimate of the average density of the Earth in this way, [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]] in 1880 realized a gravimetry experiment in Tokyo and at the top of [[Mount Fuji]]. The result was ρ = {{val|5.77|u=g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

===Modern value===

The uncertainty in the modern value for the Earth's mass has been entirely due to the uncertainty in the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' since at least the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"Since the geocentric gravitational constant [...] is now 
determined to a relative accuracy of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;, our knowledge
of the mass of the earth is entirely limited by the low accuracy
of our knowledge of the Cavendish gravitational constant."
Sagitov (1970 [1969]), p. 718.&lt;/ref&gt;
''G'' is notoriously difficult to measure, and some high-precision measurements during the 1980s to 2010s have yielded mutually exclusive results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schlamminger|first1=Stephan|title=Fundamental constants: A cool way to measure big G|journal=Nature|date=18 June 2014|doi=10.1038/nature13507|bibcode = 2014Natur.510..478S|volume=510|pages=478–480|pmid=24965646}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sagitov (1969) based on the measurement of ''G'' by Heyl and Chrzanowski (1942) cited a value of  {{earth mass}} {{=}} {{val|5.973|(3)|e=24|u=kg}} (relative uncertainty {{val|5|e=-4|}}).

Accuracy has improved only slightly since then. Most modern measurements are repetitions of the Cavendish experiment, with results (within standard uncertainty) ranging between  6.672 and 6.676 ×10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;  m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1 &lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; (relative uncertainty 3×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;) in results reported since the 1980s, although the  2014 [[NIST]] recommended value is close to 6.674×10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;  m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1 &lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; with a relative uncertainty below  10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;.
The ''Astronomical Almanach Online'' as of 2016 recommends a standard uncertainty of {{val|1|e=-4|}} for Earth mass, {{Earth mass}} {{val|5.9722|(6)|e=24|u=kg}}&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt;

== Variation ==
Earth's mass is variable, subject to both gain and loss due to the accretion of micrometeorites and cosmic dust 
and the loss of hydrogen and helium gas, respectively.
The combined effect is a net loss of material, estimated at {{val|5.5e7|u=kg}} (54,000 tons) per year. This amount is {{val|e=-17}} of the total earth mass.&lt;ref name="IJSRP" /&gt; The {{val|5.5e7|u=kg}} annual net loss is essentially due to 100,000 tons lost due to [[atmospheric escape]], and an average of 45,000 tons gained from in-falling dust and meteorites. This is well within the mass uncertainty of 0.01% ({{val|6|e=20|u=kg}}), so the estimated value of earth's mass is unaffected by this factor.

Mass loss is due to atmospheric escape of gases. About 95,000 tons of hydrogen per year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2013/pmpd1301.htm|title=Fantasy and Science Fiction: Science by Pat Murphy &amp; Paul Doherty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{val|3|u=kg|up=s}}) and 1,600 tons of helium per year&lt;ref name="techdaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scitechdaily.com/earth-loses-50000-tonnes-of-mass-every-year/|title=Earth Loses 50,000 Tonnes of Mass Every Year|work=SciTech Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; are lost through atmospheric escape.
The main factor in mass gain is in-falling material, [[cosmic dust]], [[meteors]], etc. are the most significant contributors to Earth's increase in mass.  The sum of material is estimated to be 37,000 to 78,000 tons annually.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-8694-8_5 Spacecraft Measurements of the Cosmic Dust Flux]", Herbert A.

Additional changes in mass are due to the [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass–energy equivalence principal]], although these changes are relatively negligible. An increase in mass has been ascribed to rising temperatures ([[global warming]]), estimated at 160 tonnes per years as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McDonald|first1=Charlotte|title=Who, What, Why: Is the Earth getting lighter?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16787636|website=BBC Magazine|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=9 February 2016|date=31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another 16 tons per year are lost in the form of [[Rotational energy|rotational kinetic energy]] due to the deceleration of the rotation of Earth's inner core.{{citation needed|reason=needs reliable source to back up claim|date=February 2016}} This energy is transferred to the rotational energy of the solar system, and the trend might also be reversible, as rotation speed has been shown to fluctuate over decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tkalčić |first1=Hrvoje |last2=Young |first2=Mallory |last3=Bodin |first3=Thomas |last4=Ngo |first4=Silvie |last5=Sambridge |first5=Malcolm |title=The shuffling rotation of the Earth’s inner core revealed by earthquake doublets |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=6 |pages=497–502 |date=12 May 2013 |doi=10.1038/ngeo1813 |bibcode = 2013NatGe...6..497T }}&lt;!--|accessdate=7 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mass loss due to [[nuclear fission]] is estimated to amount to 16 tons per year.&lt;ref name="IJSRP" /&gt;

'''Ecosystem health''' is a metaphor used to describe the condition of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=rapport1998&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Defining ecosystem health." Pages 18-33 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health.'' Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem condition can vary as a result of fire, [[flooding]], [[drought]], [[extinction]]s, [[invasive species]], [[climate change]], [[mining]], [[overexploitation]] in [[fishing]], [[farming]] or [[logging]], [[chemical spill]]s, and a host of other reasons. There is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1992). "Evaluating ecosystem health." ''Journal of aquatic ecosystem health'' 1:15-24&lt;/ref&gt; rather the apparent health status of an ecosystem can vary depending upon which health metrics are employed in judging it&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment. Advocates of the health metaphor argue for its simplicity as a communication tool. "Policy-makers and the public need simple, understandable concepts like health."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Judy L. (1997). "Stream health: incorporating the human dimension to advance stream ecology." ''Journal of the North American Benthological Society'' 16:439^447&lt;/ref&gt; Critics worry that ecosystem health, a "value-laden construct", is often "passed off as science to unsuspecting policy makers and the public."&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2007). "Science, scientists, and policy advocacy." ''Conservation Biology.'' 21(1): 12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
== History of the concept ==

The health metaphor applied to the environment has been in use at least since the early 1800s&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1816). "Rural economy, agricultur
" ''[[Encyclopaedia Perthensis]]'' Volume 19, 391-497. Edinburgh: John Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1839). "On the culture of potatoes". ''Framer's Magazine, '' 2(5):337-338.&lt;/ref&gt; and the great American conservationist [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1948) spoke metaphorically of land health, land sickness, mutilation, and violence when describing land use practices.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo (1946). "The land health concept and conservation." Pages 218-226 in Callicott, J. Baird, and Eric T.Freyfogle. (1999) ''For the Health of the Land. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem management" has been in use at least since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, H.J. (1957). "Applications of ecology in forest management." ''Ecology'' 38:46-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem health" has become widespread in the ecological literature, as a general metaphor meaning something good,&lt;ref name=Jax2010&gt;Jax, Kurt. (2010). ''Ecosystem Functioning.'' Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and as an environmental quality goal in field assessments of rivers,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P.E. et al. (2010). "The Sustainable Rivers Audit: assessing river ecosystem health in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia." ''Marine and Freshwater Research'' 61:764–777.&lt;/ref&gt; lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Xu, F, ZF Yang, B. Chen, and Y.W. Zhao. (2012). "Ecosystem Health Assessment of Baiyangdian Lake Based on Thermodynamic Indicators."

''Journal of Forestry'' 95:23-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently however this metaphor has been subject of quantitative formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramírez-Carrillo|first=Elvia|last2=López-Corona|first2=Oliver|last3=Toledo-Roy|first3=Juan C.|last4=Lovett|first4=Jon C.|last5=León-González|first5=Fernando de|last6=Osorio-Olvera|first6=Luis|last7=Equihua|first7=Julian|last8=Robredo|first8=Everardo|last9=Frank|first9=Alejandro|date=2018-07-16|title=Assessing sustainability in North America’s ecosystems using criticality and information theory|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=7|pages=e0200382|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; using complex systems concepts such as criticality, meaning that a healthy ecosystem is in some sort of balance between adaptability (randomness) and robustness (order) . Nevertheless the universality of criticality is still under examination and is known as the Criticality Hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamic regime shifting between order and disorder, attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cell and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have great interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasizing its role as a viable candidate general law in the realm of adaptive complex systems (see &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roli|first=Andrea|last2=Villani|first2=Marco|last3=Filisetti|first3=Alessandro|last4=Serra|first4=Roberto|date=2017-11-17|title=Dynamical Criticality: Overview and Open Questions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|journal=Journal of Systems Science and Complexity|volume=31|issue=3|pages=647–663|doi=10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|issn=1009-6124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and references therein).

== Meaning ==

The term ecosystem health has been employed to embrace some suite of environmental goals deemed desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, D. Scott (1998). "Defining Goals and Criteria for Ecosystem-Based Management." ''Environmental Management'' 22:483–493&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Grumbine's highly cited paper&lt;ref name=grumbine1994&gt;Grumbine, R. Edward (1994). "What is ecosystem management?" ''Conservation Biology'' 8:27-38&lt;/ref&gt; "What is ecosystem management?" surveyed ecosystem management and ecosystem health literature and summarized frequently encountered goal statements:
* Conserving [[viable population]]s of [[native species]]
* Conserving [[ecosystem diversity]]
* Maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes
* Managing over long time frames to maintain evolutionary potential
* Accommodating human use and occupancy within these constraints

Grumbine describes each of these goals as a "value statement" and stresses the role of human [[values]] in setting ecosystem management goals.

It is the last goal mentioned in the survey, accommodating humans, that is most contentious. "We have observed that when groups of stakeholders work to define … visions, this leads to debate over whether to emphasize ecosystem health or human well-being … Whether the priority is ecosystems or people greatly influences stakeholders' assessment of desirable ecological and social states."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, heather M. and Karen L. McLeod (2007). "Confronting the challenges of implementing marine ecosystem-based management." ''Frontiers of Ecology and the Environment'' 5:540-548.&lt;/ref&gt; and, for example, "For some, [[wolves]] are critical to ecosystem health and an essential part of nature, for others they are a symbol of government overreach threatening their livelihoods and cultural values."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Andrew (2015). Which wolf, which trap? Socially constructing wolves and trapping in western Montana. ''Scholar Works'', University of Montana, Oral Presentations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring ecosystem health requires extensive goal-driven environmental sampling. For example, a vision for ecosystem health of [[Lake Superior]] was developed by a public forum and a series of objectives were prepared for [[habitat protection|protection of habitat]] and maintenance of populations of some 70 indigenous fish species.&lt;ref name=horns2003&gt;Horns, W.H., et al. (2003). '' Fish-community objectives for Lake Superior. '' Great Lakes Fish. Commission Special Publication. 03-01. 78 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; A suite of 80 lake health indicators was developed for the Great Lakes Basin including monitoring native fish species, exotic species, water levels, phosphorus levels, toxic chemicals, [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], fish tissue contaminants, etc.&lt;ref name=Shear2003&gt;Shear, Harvey et al. (2003). "The development and implementation of indicators of ecosystem health in the Great Lakes Basin." ''Journal of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment'' 88:119–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have attempted broad definitions of ecosystem health, such as benchmarking as healthy the historical ecosystem state "prior to the onset of [[anthropocene|anthropogenic stress]]."&lt;ref name=rapport2011&gt;Rapport, David J. and • Luisa Maffi  (2011). "Eco-cultural health, global health, and sustainability." ''Ecological Research'' 26:1039-1049&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty is that the historical composition of many human-altered ecosystems is unknown or unknowable. Also, [[fossil record|fossil]] and [[pollen]] records indicate that the species that occupy an ecosystem [[ecologic succession|reshuffle]] through time, so it is difficult to identify one snapshot in time as optimum or "healthy.".&lt;ref name=wicklum1995&gt;Wicklum, D. and Ronald W. Davies (1995). "Ecosystem health and integrity?" ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 73:997-1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly cited broad definition states that a healthy ecosystem has three attributes:
# [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]],
# [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]], and
# "organization" (including [[biodiversity]]).&lt;ref name=rapport2011 /&gt;

While this captures significant ecosystem properties, a generalization is elusive as those properties do not necessarily co-vary in nature. For example, there is not necessarily a clear or consistent relationship between productivity and species richness.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Peter et al. (2011). "Productivity is a poor predictor of plant species richness." ''Science'' 333:1750-1752.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the relationship between  [[System resilience|resilience]] and diversity is complex, and [[ecosystem stability]] may depend upon one or a few species rather than overall diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, Anthony R. and Stephen R. Carpenter (2007). "Stability and Diversity of Ecosystems." ''Science'' 317:58-62.&lt;/ref&gt; And some undesirable ecosystems are highly productive.&lt;ref&gt;Asanova, Umut (2002). "Philosophy of ecological ethics education, considering the Issyk-Kul Lake reediation mechanisms." Jean Klerkx and Beishen Imanakanov (2002). Lake Issk-Kul: Its natural Environment Springer Science&lt;/ref&gt;

"Resilience is not desirable per se. There can be highly resilient states of ecosystems which are very undesirable from some human perspectives , such as algal-dominated [[coral reef]]s."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; Ecological [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] is a "capacity" that varies depending upon which properties of the ecosystem are to be studied and depending upon what kinds of disturbances are considered and how they are to be quantified.  Approaches to assessing it "face high uncertainties and still require a considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Other authors have sought a numerical index of ecosystem health that would permit quantitative comparisons among ecosystems and within ecosystems over time.  One such system employs ratings of the three properties mentioned above: Health = system vigor x system organization x [[system resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. 1992. "Toward an operational definition of ecosystem health." Pp 239-256 in Costanza, R., B. Norton, and B. Haskell. ''Ecosystem health. New Goals for Environmental Management. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologist Glenn Suter argues that such indices employ "nonsense units," the indices have "no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects of one component are eclipsed by responses of other components, and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown."&lt;ref name=suter1993&gt;Suter, Glenn W. (1993). "A critique of ecosystem health concepts and indexes." ''Environmental toxicology and chemistry'' 12:1533-1539.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health indicators ==

Health [[Performance metric|metrics]] are determined by stakeholder goals, which drive ecosystem definition. An ecosystem is an abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2007). "Can we define ecosystems? On the confusion between definition and description of ecological concepts." ''Acta Biotheor'' 55:341–355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oneill2001&gt;O'Neill, Robert V. (2001). "Is it time to bury the ecosystem concept? (with full military honors, of course!)" ''Ecology'' 82:3275–3284&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ecosystems cannot be identified or found in nature. Instead, they must be delimited by an observer. This can be done in many different ways for the same chunk of nature, depending on the specific perspectives of interest."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Ecosystem definition determines the acceptable range of variability (reference conditions) and determines measurement variables. The latter are used as indicators of ecosystem structure and function, and can be used as indicators of "health".

An [[Environmental indicator|indicator]] is a variable, such as a chemical or biological property, that when measured, is used to infer trends in another (unmeasured) environmental variable or cluster of unmeasured variables (the indicandum). For example, rising [[mortality rate]] of canaries in a coal mine is an indicator of rising [[carbon monoxide]] levels. Rising [[chlorophyll-a]] levels in a lake may signal [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David A. and Pamela Welbourne (2002) ''Environmental Toxicology''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem assessments employ two kinds of indicators, descriptive indicators and normative indicators. "Indicators can be used descriptively for a scientific purpose or normatively for a political purpose."&lt;ref name=heink2010&gt;Heink, Ulrich and Ingo Kowarik (2010) "What are indicators? On the definition of indicators in ecology and environmental planning." ''Ecological Indicators'' 10:584–593&lt;/ref&gt;

Used descriptively, high chlorophyll-a is an indicator of eutrophication, but it may also be used as an ecosystem health indicator. When used as a normative (health) indicator, it indicates a rank on a health scale, a rank that can vary widely depending on societal preferences as to what is desirable. A high chlorophyll-a level in a natural [[ecological succession|successional]] [[wetland]] might be viewed as healthy whereas a human-impacted wetland with the ''same'' indicator value may be judged unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza,  Robert, and Michael Mageau (1999). "What is a healthy ecosystem?" ''Aquatic Ecology'' 33: 105–115&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimation of ecosystem health has been criticized for intermingling the two types of environmental indicators.&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael (2006). "The values and vulnerabilities of metaphors within the environmental sciences." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:921–930&lt;/ref&gt; A health indicator is a normative indicator, and if conflated with descriptive indicators "implies that normative values can be measured objectively, which is certainly not true. Thus, implicit values are insinuated to the reader, a situation which has to be avoided."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

It can be argued that the very act of selecting indicators of any kind is [[bias]]ed by the observer's perspective&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2005). "Function and 'functioning' in ecology: what does it mean?" ''Oikos'' 111:3&lt;/ref&gt; but separation of goals from descriptions has been advocated as a step toward transparency:  "A separation of descriptive and normative indicators is essential from the perspective of the philosophy of science … Goals and values cannot be deduced directly from descriptions … a fact that is emphasized repeatedly in the literature of environmental ethics … Hence, we advise always specifying the definition of indicators and propose clearly distinguishing ecological indicators in science from policy indicators used for decision-making processes."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

And integration of multiple, possibly conflicting, normative indicators into a single measure of "ecosystem health" is problematic. Using 56 indicators, "determining environmental status and assessing [[marine ecosystem]]s health in an integrative way is still one of the grand challenges in marine ecosystems ecology, research and management"&lt;ref&gt;Borja A, et al. (2014). "Tales from a thousand and one ways to integrate marine ecosystem components when assessing the environmental status." ''Frontiers in Marine Science''. 1:72&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue with indicators is validity. Good indicators must have an independently validated high [[Predictive value of tests|predictive value]], that is high [[sensitivity (control systems)|sensitivity]] (high probability of indicating a significant change in the indicandum) and high [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]] (low probability of wrongly indicating a change). The reliability of various health metrics has been questioned&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Guy, et al. (2012). Continental-wide effects of nutrient pollution on stream ecosystem functioning. ''Science'', 336:1448-1440.&lt;/ref&gt; and "what combination of measurements should be used to evaluate ecosystems is a matter of current scientific debate."&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; Most attempts to identify ecological indicators have been [[correlation|correlative]] rather than derived from prospective testing of their predictive value&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Philip S. et al. (2015). "Learning from clinical medicine to improve the use of surrogates in ecology." ''Oikos'' 124:391-398.&lt;/ref&gt; and the selection process for many indicators has been based upon weak evidence or has been lacking in evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed A.H. et al. (2016). "How do ecologists select and use indicator species to monitor ecological change? Insights from 14 years of publication in ''Ecological Indicators''." ''Ecological Indicator''s 60:223-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases no reliable indicators are known: "We found no examples of [[invertebrates]] successfully used in [forest] monitoring programs. Their richness and abundance ensure that they play significant roles in ecosystem function but thwart focus on a few key species." And, "Reviews of species-based monitoring approaches reveal that no single species, nor even a group of species, accurately reflects entire communities. Understanding the response of a single species may not provide reliable predictions about a group of species even when the group is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a few very similar species."&lt;ref&gt;Kremsater, Laurie L. and Fred L. Bunnell (2009). "Sustaining forest-dwelling species." Pages 173-218 in Bunnell, Fred L. and Glen B. Dunsworth (2009). ''Forestry and Biodiversity''. Learning how to Sustain Biodiversity in Managed Forests. UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to human health: the health paradox ==

A trade-off between human health and the "health" of nature has been termed the "health paradox"&lt;ref&gt;C. Max Finlayson and Pierre Horwitz (2015). "Wetlands as settings for human health – the benefits and the paradox."  Pages 1-13 in Finlayson, C.M. et al. 2015. ''Wetlands and Human Health''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and it illuminates how human values drive perceptions of ecosystem health.

Human health has benefited by sacrificing the "health" of wild ecosystems, such as dismantling and [[dam]]ming of wild valleys, destruction of [[mosquito]]-bearing [[wetlands]], diversion of water for [[irrigation]], conversion of wilderness to [[farmland]], [[timber]] removal, and [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of [[tiger]]s, whales, ferrets, and [[wolves]].

There has been an acrimonious schism among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] and resource managers&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Heather and  &amp; Jane Lubchenco  (2014) "Working together: A call for inclusive conservation." ''Nature'' 515, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tudela, Sergi and Katherine Short (2005). "Paradigm shifts, gaps, inertia, and political agendas in ecosystem-based fisheries management." ''Marine Ecology Progress Series'' 300:282-286.&lt;/ref&gt; over the question of whether to "ratchet back human domination of the biosphere" or whether to embrace it.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, Redd et al. (2013). "Humanity's domination of nature is part of the problem: a response to Kareiva and Marvier." ''BioScience'' 63:241-242&lt;/ref&gt; These two perspectives have been characterized as utilitarian vs protectionist.&lt;ref&gt;Nijhius, Michelle (2014). "Bridging the conservation divide."  New Yorker, December 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[utilitarian]] view treats [[human health]] and [[well-being]] as criteria of ecosystem health.&lt;ref&gt;Su, Meirong et al. (2010)."Urban ecosystem health assessment: A review." ''Science of the Total Environment'' 408:2425–2434&lt;/ref&gt; For example, destruction of wetlands to control malaria mosquitoes "resulted in an improvement in ecosystem health."&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1998). "Some distinctions worth making." ''Ecosystem Health'' 4:193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;
The protectionist view treats humans as an invasive species: "If there was ever a species that qualified as an invasive pest, it is ''Homo sapiens'',"&lt;ref name=Oneill2001 /&gt;

Proponents of the utilitarian view argue that "healthy ecosystems are characterized by their capability to sustain healthy human populations,"&lt;ref name=rapport1998 /&gt; and "healthy ecosystems must be economically viable," as it is "unhealthy" ecosystems that are likely to result in increases in [[contamination]], [[infectious disease]]s, fires, floods, [[crop failure]]s and fishery collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Dimensions of ecosystem health." Pages 34-40 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health''. Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protectionist]]s argue that privileging of human health is a [[conflict of interest]] as humans have [[ecosystem destruction|demolished]] massive numbers of ecosystems to maintain their welfare, also disease and [[parasitism]] are historically normal in pre-industrial nature.&lt;ref name=wilkins1999&gt;Wilkins, D.A. (1999). "Assessing ecosystem health."  ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 14:70&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases and parasites promote ecosystem functioning, driving biodiversity and productivity,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Peter J., Andrew P. Dobson and Kevin D. Lafferty (2006). "Is a healthy ecosystem one that is rich in parasites?" ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 21:381-385.&lt;/ref&gt; and parasites may constitute a significant fraction of ecosystem biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Kuris, Armand M. et al. (2008). "Ecosystem energetic implications of parasite and free-living biomass in three estuaries." ''Nature'' 454:515-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very choice of the word "health" applied to ecology has been questioned as lacking in neutrality in a BioScience article on responsible use of scientific language: "Some conservationists fear that these terms could endorse human domination of the planet … and could exacerbate the shifting cognitive baseline whereby humans tend to become accustomed to new and often degraded ecosystems and thus forget the nature of the past."&lt;ref&gt;Kueffer, Christoph and Brendon M. H. Larson (2014). "Responsible Use of Language in Scientific Writing and Science Communication." ''BioScience'' 64(8): 719–724.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept and proposed alternatives ==

Criticism of ecosystem health largely targets the failure of proponents to explicitly distinguish the normative dimension from the descriptive dimension, and has included the following:
* Ecosystem health is in the eye of the beholder. It is an economic, political or ethical judgement rather than a scientific measure of environmental quality. Health ratings are shaped by the goals and preferences of environmental stakeholders.&lt;ref name=lancaster2000&gt;Lancaster, Jill (2000). "The Ridiculous Notion of Assessing Ecological Health and Identifying the Useful Concepts Underneath."''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' 6: 213-222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael S. (2006). "Science, Expertise, and the Democratization of the Decision-Making Process." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:661–668&lt;/ref&gt; "At the core of debates over the utility of ecosystem health is a struggle over which societal preferences will take precedence."&lt;ref name=lackey2003&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2003). "Appropriate use of ecosystem health and normative science in ecological policy" Pages. 175-186 in: Rapport, David J. et al. (2003)  ''Managing for Healthy Ecosystems ''  Boca Raton, Florida: Lewis Publishers, , 1510 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Health is a metaphor, not a property of an ecosystem. Health is an abstraction. It implies "good", an optimum condition, but in nature ecosystems are ever-changing transitory assemblages with no identifiable optimum.&lt;ref name=wicklum1995 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calow, P. (1992)." Can ecosystems be healthy? Critical consideration of concepts." ''Journal of Aquatic Ecosystem Health'' 1:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of human health and well-being as a criterion of ecosystem health introduces an arrogance and a conflict of interest into environmental assessment, as human population growth has caused much [[environmental damage]].&lt;ref name=wilkins1999 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Thomas R. Jr. (1995). "Ecosystem management and the arrogance of humanism." ''Conservation Biology'' 9:255-262&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ecosystem health masquerades as an operational goal because environmental managers "may be reluctant to define their goals clearly."&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt;
* It is a vague concept.&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, Carlos M. et al. (2015). "Paradigms in the recovery of estuarine and coastal ecosystems." ''Estuaries and Coasts'' 38:1202-1212&lt;/ref&gt; "Currently there are many, often contradictory, definitions of ecosystem health,"&lt;ref name=lackey2001&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2001). "Values, Policy, and Ecosystem Health." ''BioScience'' 51(6):437-443&lt;/ref&gt; that "are open to so much abuse and misuse that they represent a threat to the environment."&lt;ref name=lancaster2000 /&gt;
* "There are in general no clear definitions of what proponents of the concept mean by 'ecosystem'."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;
* The public can be deceived by the term ecosystem health which may camouflage the ramifications of a policy goal and be employed to pejoratively rank policy choices.&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt; "The most pervasive misuse of ecosystem health and similar normative notions is insertion of personal values under the guise of 'scientific' impartiality."&lt;ref name=lackey2003 /&gt;

Alternatives have been proposed for the term ecosystem health, including more neutral language such as ecosystem status,&lt;ref&gt;Link, Jason S. (2002) "What Does Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management Mean?" ''Fisheries'' 27:18-21&lt;/ref&gt; ecosystem prognosis, and ecosystem sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker, Ted (1995) Synthesis of Discussion.pp 118-125 in  Hodge, Tony et al. ''Pathways to Sustainability: Assessing Our Progress''. Ottawa: National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy.&lt;/ref&gt; Another alternative to the use of a health metaphor is  to "express exactly and clearly the public policy and the management objective", to employ habitat descriptors and real properties of ecosystems.&lt;ref name=suter1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lancaster2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt; An example of a policy statement is "The maintenance of viable natural populations of wildlife and ecological functions always takes precedence over any human use of wildlife."&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1995). ''Wildlife policy for Prince Edward Island. Government of Prince Edward Island'', 18 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a goal is "Maintain viable populations of all native species in situ."&lt;ref name=grumbine1994 /&gt; An example of a management objective is "Maintain self-sustaining populations of lake whitefish within the range of abundance observed during 1990-99."&lt;ref name=horns2003 /&gt;

Kurt Jax&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; presented an ecosystem assessment format that avoids imposing a preconceived notion of normality, that avoids the muddling of normative and descriptive, and that gives serious attention to ecosystem definition. (1) Societal purposes for the ecosystem are negotiated by stakeholders, (2) a functioning ecosystem is defined with emphasis on phenomena relevant to stakeholder goals, (3) benchmark reference conditions and permissible variation of the system are established, (4) measurement variables are chosen for use as indicators, and (5) the time scale and spatial scale of assessment are decided.

In [[ecology]], '''energy flow''', also called the '''calorific flow''', refers to the flow of [[energy]] through a [[food chain]], and is the focus of study in '''ecological energetics'''. In an [[ecosystem]], [[ecologist]]s seek to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] the relative importance of different component [[species]] and feeding relationships.

A general energy flow scenario follows:
*[[Solar energy]] is fixed by the [[photoautotroph]]s, called primary producers, like green [[plant]]s. [[Primary consumers]] absorb most of the stored energy in the plant through [[digestion]], and transform it into the form of energy they need, such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), through [[cellular respiration|respiration]]. A part of the energy received by primary consumers, [[herbivore]]s, is converted to [[thermoregulation|body heat]] (an effect of respiration), which is [[radiant energy|radiated]] away and lost from the system. The loss of energy through body heat is far greater in [[warm-blooded]] animals, which must eat much more frequently than those that are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]. Energy loss also occurs in the expulsion of [[digestion|undigested]] food (egesta) by [[excrement|excretion]] or [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]].
*Secondary consumers, [[carnivore]]s, then consume the primary consumers, although [[omnivore]]s also consume primary producers. Energy that had been used by the primary consumers for growth and storage is thus absorbed into the secondary consumers through the process of digestion. As with primary consumers, secondary consumers convert this energy into a more suitable form (ATP) during respiration. Again, some energy is lost from the system, since energy which the primary consumers had used for respiration and regulation of body temperature cannot be utilized by the secondary consumers.
*Tertiary consumers, which may or may not be [[apex predator]]s, then consume the secondary consumers, with some energy passed on and some lost, as with the lower levels of the food chain.
*A final link in the food chain are [[decomposer]]s which break down the [[organic matter]] of the tertiary consumers (or whichever consumer is at the top of the chain) and release [[nutrient]]s into the [[soil]]. They also break down plants, herbivores and carnivores that were not eaten by organisms higher on the food chain, as well as the undigested food that is excreted by herbivores and carnivores. [[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprotrophic]] [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are decomposers, and play a pivotal role in the [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[carbon cycle]]s.

The energy is passed on from [[trophic level]] to trophic level and each time about 90% of the energy is lost, with some being lost as heat into the environment (an effect of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]) and some being lost as incompletely digested food (egesta). Therefore, primary consumers get about 10% of the energy produced by autotrophs, while secondary consumers get 1% and tertiary consumers get 0.1%. This means the top consumer of a [[food chain]] receives the least energy, as a lot of the food chain's energy has been lost between trophic levels. This loss of energy at each level limits typical food chains to only four to six links.

== History of ecological energetics ==
Ecological energetics appears to have grown out of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the concerns of the [[Physiocrats]]. It began in the works of [[Sergei Podolinsky]] in the late 1800s, and subsequently was developed by the Soviet ecologist [[Vladmir Stanchinsky]], the Austro-American [[Alfred J. Lotka]], and American limnologists, [[Raymond Lindeman]] and [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]. It underwent substantial development by [[Howard T. Odum]] and was applied by [[systems ecology|systems ecologists]], and [[radiation ecology|radiation ecologists]].

'''Exertion''' is the [[Action (physics)|physical]] or perceived use of [[energy]].&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;Newton's Third Law, Elert, Glenn. “Forces.” ''Viscosity – The Physics Hypertextbook'', physics.info/newton-first/.&lt;/ref&gt; Exertion traditionally connotes a strenuous or costly ''effort,''resulting in generation of force, initiation of motion,&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; or in the performance of [[Mechanical work|work]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; It often relates to [[Exercise physiology|muscular]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;activity and can be quantified, empirically and by measurable metabolic response.

==Physical==
In [[physics]], ''exertion'' is the expenditure of [[energy]] against, or inductive of, [[inertia]] as described by [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton.27s third law|third law of motion]]. In physics, '''force''' exerted equivocates '''work''' done.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Perceived Exertion, Barry, A. J. (1967). Physical activity and psychic stress/strain. ''Canadian Medical Association Journal'', ''96''(12), 848–853.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to do work can be either positive or negative depending on the direction of exertion relative to gravity. For example, a force exerted upwards, like lifting an object, creates positive work done on that object.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/py105/Energy.html|title=Work and energy|website=physics.bu.edu|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exertion often results in force generated, a contributing dynamic of general motion.&lt;ref name=":07" /&gt; In [[mechanics]] it describes the use of [[force]] against a [[Physical body|body]] in the direction of its [[Motion (physics)|motion]] (see [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]).

==Physiological==
Exertion, physiologically, can be described by the initiation of exercise, or, intensive and exhaustive physical activity that causes cardiovascular stress or a sympathetic nervous response. This can be continuous or intermittent exertion.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Exertion requires, of the body, modified oxygen uptake, increased heart rate, and autonomic monitoring of blood [[Lactate dehydrogenase|lactate]] concentrations. Mediators of physical exertion include cardio-respiratory and [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] strength, as well as metabolic capability.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Kumar, Shrawan. “Theories of Occupational Musculoskeletal Injury Causation.” ''Biomechanics in Ergonomics, Second Edition'', July 2007, doi:10.1201/9780849379093.sec1.&lt;/ref&gt; This often correlates to an output of force followed by a [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] of recovery. Exertion is limited by cumulative load and repetitive motions.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Muscular energy reserves, or stores for [[Biomechanics|biomechanical]] exertion, stem from metabolic, immediate production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and increased O2 consumption.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Muscular exertion generated depends on the muscle length and the velocity at which it is able to shorten, or contract.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;“Golgi Tendon Organ.” ''Egyptian Journal of Medical Human Genetics'', Elsevier, www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/golgi-tendon-organ.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perceived exertion can be explained as subjective, perceived experience that mediates response to somatic sensations and mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; A [[rating of perceived exertion]], as measured by the ''RPE-scale'', or [[Borg scale]], is a quantitative measure of physical exertion.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borg|first=Gunnar A.V|date=|title=Psychophysical bases of perceived exertion|url=http://fcesoftware.com/images/15_Perceived_Exertion.pdf|journal=Symposium|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often in health, exertion of oneself resulting in cardiovascular stress showed reduced physiological responses, like cortisol levels and mood, to stressors. Therefore, biological exertion is effective in mediating psychological exertion, responsive to environmental stress.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Gröpel, Peter, et al. “Endurance- and Resistance-Trained Men Exhibit Lower Cardiovascular Responses to Psychosocial Stress Than Untrained Men.” ''Frontiers in Psychology'', vol. 9, Jan. 2018, doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00852.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overexertion causes more than 3.5 million injuries a year.{{Clarify|reason=when, where|date=November 2018}} An overexertion injury can include sprains or strains, the stretching and tear of ligaments, tendons, or muscles caused by a load that exceeds the human ability to perform the work.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;“Indications Of Physical Overexertion.” ''JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association'', vol. 71, no. 18, Feb. 1918, p. 1488., doi:10.1001/jama.1918.02600440040013.&lt;/ref&gt; Overexertion, besides causing acute injury, implies physical exertion beyond the person's capacity which leads to symptoms such as dizziness, irregular breathing and heart rate, and fatigue.&lt;ref name=":92"/&gt; Preventative measures can be taken based on biomechanical knowledge to limit possible overexertion injuries.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;“The Understated Injury: Overexertion.” ''Healthline'', Healthline Media, www.healthline.com/health/understated-injury-overexertion.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''foreline''' is a [[vacuum]] line between the [[pump]]s of a [[wikt:multistage|multistage]] vacuum system. No longer exclusively used by [[scientist]]s in [[research]], vacuum systems are used in numerous industries that include [[food production]] and the [[manufacture|manufacturing]] of [[electronic component]]s. A classic foreline is a [[hose]] or [[Pneumatic tube|tube]] that connects a [[rotary vane pump]] to the [[wikt:outlet|outlet]] of an [[oil diffusion pump]], although vacuum [[technology]] now uses a vast array of [[roughing pump]]s and high [[vacuum pump]]s.

Although the term has been used for many [[decade]]s in the high vacuum system [[industry]] and in [[literature]] concerning vacuum systems, the word foreline has not yet been added to any [[dictionary]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1037">The '''Fowkes hypothesis''' (after F. M. Fowkes) is a first order approximation for surface energy. It states the surface energy is the sum of each component's forces:
 
γ=γ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;+γ&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;+γ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;+...
where γ&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; is the dispersion component, γ&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; is the polar, γ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; is the dipole and so on.

The Fowkes hypothesis goes further making the approximation that the interface between an apolar liquid and apolar solid where there are only dispersive interactions acting across the interface can be estimated using the [[geometric mean]] of the contributions from each surface i.e.

γ&lt;sub&gt;SL&lt;/sub&gt;=γ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;+γ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;-2(γ&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; x γ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;

'''George-ericksenite''' is a mineral with the chemical formula Na&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;CaMg(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. It is vitreous, pale yellow to bright lemon yellow, brittle, and features a prismatic to acicular [[crystal habit]] along [001] and somewhat flattened crystal habit on {110}. It was first encountered in 1984 at the Pinch Mineralogical Museum. One specimen of dietzeite from Oficina Chacabuco, [[Chile]] had bright lemon-yellow micronodules on it. These crystals produced an [[X-Ray Powder Diffraction|X-ray powder diffraction]] pattern that did not match any XRD data listed for inorganic compounds. The X-ray diffraction pattern and powder mount were set aside until 1994. By then, the entire mineral collection from the Pinch Mineralogical Museum had been purchased by the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]]. The specimen was then retrieved and studied further. This study was successful and the new mineral george-ericksenite was discovered. The mineral was named for George E. Ericksen who was a research [[Economic geology|economic geologist]] with the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] for fifty years. The mineral and name have been approved by Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names (IMA).  The specimen, polished thin section, and the actual crystal used for the structure determination are kept in the Display Series of the National Mineral Collection of Canada at the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]], [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]].

== Description ==

=== Occurrence and paragenesis ===
George-ericksonite is commonly found as isolated bright lemon-yellow micronodules of crystals that are concentrated on the surface of one part of the mineral specimen. However, in some cases the micronodules occur as groupings instead of isolated occurrences. The average size of these micronodules is approximately 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm and each consists of numerous individual crystals in random orientation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.minsocam.org/msa/ammin/TOC/Articles_Free/1998/Cooper_p390-399_98.pdf|title = Georgeericksenite, Na&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;CaMg(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;|last = Cooper|first = Mark A.|date = 1998|journal = American Mineralogist|doi = |pmid = |access-date = October 15, 2015|last2 = Hawthorne|first2 = Frank C.|last3 = Roberts|first3 = Andrew C.|last4 = Grice|first4 = Joel D.|last5 = Stirling|first5 = John A.R.|last6 = Moffatt|first6 = Elizabeth A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electron microprobe examination ===
This examination was carried out by attaching two [[Acicular (crystal habit)|acicular]] crystals to the surface of a disk with [[epoxy]] and then examining them with a CAMECA SX-50 [[electron microprobe]]. One of the crystals had the (100) surface facing up, and the other crystal had a growth face of the form (110) facing up. The microprobe was operating in wavelength-dispersive mode at 15 kV and ran various currents from 20 nA to 0.5 nA. The CAMECA SX-50 has three [[Optical spectrometer|spectrometers]] and the samples were examined in the sequence ([[Sodium|Na]], [[Chlorine|Cl]], [[Iodine|I]]), then ([[Magnesium|Mg]], [[Sulfur|S]], [[Calcium|Ca]]). When the [[crystal]] was exposed to the electron beam for the first 200 seconds, the counts per second on each element varied greatly which indicates that the crystals are extremely unstable in the electron beam. The counts per second for each element were also dependent on the surface of the crystal [(100) or (110)] analyzed. Over shorter counting times (&lt;10 s) at 15 kV and 5 nA, there is a gain in I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and a drop in Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O relative to ideal values. However, a significant orientation effect exists for SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CaO values for the (100) and (110) surfaces on either side of the ideal values. With increasing exposure to the electron beam, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O increases and all other oxides decrease. This behavior is also more rapid on the (100) surface than on the (110) crystal face. The (100) surface is overall more reactive to the electron beam than the (110) surface, but both surfaces seem to approach equilibrium with the beam and give similar oxides weight percentages after 200 seconds.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Even at low currents and short counting times george-ericksenite is extremely unstable under the electron beam. After examination, the crystal faces are stained brown from the reaction with I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the decrease in analyzed I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with increasing time. The crystallographic orientation of the material analyzed has a large impact on the analytical values at any given time. The overall quantitative behavior of george-ericksenite in the electron beam is consistent with the chemical composition derived (ideally I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; 59.13, CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 9.92. SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; 1.51, MgO 2.38, CaO 3.31, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 10.98, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 12.77 weight %).&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Crystal structure ==

=== Data collection ===
A 0.046 X 0.059 X 0.060&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; crystal was mounted on a Siemans ''P''4 four-circle diffractometer. The crystal was aligned using 42 reflections automatically centered following measurement from a rotation photograph. The orientation matrix and unit-cell dimensions were determined from the setting angles of least-squares refinement. 3872 reflections were recorded out to 60&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; 2θ with a fixed scan speed of 1.33° 2θ/min. Corrections for absorption by [[Gaussian quadrature]] integration were applied. Corrections for Lorentz, [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], and background effects were also applied as well as reduction of intensities to structure factors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Structure solution and refinement ===
The SHELXTL PC Plus system of programs were used for the calculations. The ''R'' and ''Rw'' indices are of the conventional form. The structure was solved by direct methods. The structure is centrosymmetric as indicated by the E statistics. Systematic absences also indicate the presence of a ''c'' glide for the C-centered cell. The result was placing george-ericksenite in the C2/c space group. The structure was refined by a combination of least-squares refinement and difference-Fourier synthesis to an ''R'' index of 3.5% and ''Rw'' equal to 3.5%. Site occupancies were determined by the basis of site-scattering refinement and crystal-chemical criteria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Description of the structure ==

=== Cation coordination ===
There is one [[Chromium|chromium (Cr)]] site that is symmetrically distinct and is tetrahedrally coordinated by four [[Oxygen|oxygen (O)]] atoms. The average length of the bonds is 1.61 Å which indicates that the Cr [[cation]] is [[Valence (chemistry)|hexavalent]]. The average bond length at the Cr site is less than would be expected for complete occupancy by Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;. This difference can be accounted for by partial substitution of [[Sulfur|sulfur (S)]] atoms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are three [[Iodine|iodine (I)]] sites that are coordinated by three [[Oxygen|oxygen (O)]] atoms arranged in a triangle to one side of the cation. The distances of the bonds between the I and O atoms is 1.81 Å. This results in the IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; group forming a [[Pyramid (geometry)|triangular pyramid]] with the I site at the top of the pyramid. At each I sites there are also three additional [[ligand]]s that causes the iodine atoms to have a distorted octahedral coordination. This also causes the I atom to occupy off centered positions within each [[octahedron]]. The long bonds between the atoms at the I sites contributes significant bond valence to the bonded [[anions]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are three [[Sodium|sodium (Na)]] sites that are each unique. Each site has a different type of coordination. The Na1 site is encompassed by two [[Oxygen|O]] atoms and four [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] groups in a distorted [[Octahedral symmetry|octahedral]] arrangement with a Na1-Φ distance (where Φ=unspecified ligand) of 2.41 Å. The Na2 site is surrounded by five O atoms and 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O groups in an augmented octahedral arrangement with a Na2-Φ distance of 2.54 Å. The Na3 site is surrounded by five O atoms and three H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O atoms in a triangular [[Dodecahedron|dodecahedral]] arrangement with a Na3-Φ distance of 2.64 Å.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is only one [[Magnesium|magnesium (Mg)]] site which is coordinated by six O atoms in an octahedral arrangement with a Mg-O distance of 2.09 Å. This bond length is in accord with this site being entirely occupied by Mg with not substitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The one [[Calcium|calcium (Ca)]] site is coordinated by six O atoms and two H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O groups in a square-antiprismatic arrangement with a Ca-Φ distance of 2.50 Å. This bond length is in accord with this site being entirely occupied by Ca with not substitution.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Structure topology ===
George-ericksenite features a structural arrangement that is composed of slabs of polyhedra orthogonal to [100]. These slabs feature the same composition as the mineral itself and are a half of a unit thick in the [100] direction. These are connected to adjacent slabs solely by [[hydrogen bond]]ing. The edges of each slab are bounded by near-planar layers of anions. The slabs themselves are composed of three planar layers of cations. There are also three planar layers of cations parallel to the edges of the slabs. This indicates that each slab consists of three layers of polyhedra. The ''c''-glide symmetry relates the top and bottom of the slab which means the slab may be broken into two unique sheets of polyhedra.

There is a prominent [[zigzag]] pattern of chains of Na polyhedra extending in the ''c'' direction on the outer layer of the slab. The Na1 octahedron shares an edge with the Na2 augmented octahedron which shares a face with the Na3 triangular dodecahedron. This forms a linear [[Trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] that extends in the [011] direction. This [[Trimer (chemistry)|trimer]] is then links by edge-sharing between the Na3 and a1 polyhedra to another trimer extending in the [0-11] direction. This [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]] continues to form a [Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Φ&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;] [[zigzag]] chain extending in the ''c'' direction. In each embayment of this chain the polyhedra are accented by two (IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;) groups. Identical chains run parallel to the ''c'' axis that are linked only by one weak I-O bond.

The inner layer of the slab is composed of one Mg octahedron that shares corners with two Cr tetrahedra. This forms a [MT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Φ&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] cluster. The other two anions of the Mg octahedron link by corner-sharing to two (IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;) groups. These [Mg(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(IO&lt;sub&gt;3+3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] clusters link together two (CaΦ&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;) polyhedra. This forms chains parallel to the ''b'' axis. Weak I-O bonds link these chains to form the central layer of the slab.

=== Relation to other minerals ===
The only other chromate-iodate mineral is dietzeite, Ca(IO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Dietzeite and george-ericksenite have no structural relationship.  Fuenzalidaite and carlosruizite are sulphate-iodate minerals found in the Chilean nitrate fields and contain small amounts of Cr substituting for S. They are also sheet structures, but the sheets are vastly different in terms of connectivity than in george-ericksenite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30218">'''Homochirality''' is a uniformity of [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]], or handedness. Objects are ''chiral'' when they cannot be superposed on their mirror images. For example, the left and right hands of a human are approximately mirror images of each other but are not their own mirror images, so they are ''chiral''. In [[biology]], 19 of the 20 natural [[amino acid]]s are homochiral, being &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (left-handed), while [[sugar]]s are &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-chiral (right-handed).&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson, Lehninger et al |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homochirality'' can also refer to ''enantiomerically pure'' substances in which all the constituents are the same [[enantiomer]] (a right-handed or left-handed version of an atom or molecule), but some sources discourage this use of the term.

It is unclear whether homochirality has a purpose, however, it appears to be a form of information storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=James D.|title=A new definition of life|journal=Chirality|date=March 2009|volume=21|issue=3|pages=354–358|doi=10.1002/chir.20590|pmid=18571800}}&lt;/ref&gt; One suggestion is that it reduces [[entropy]] barriers in the formation of large organized molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Julian|first1=Ryan R.|last2=Myung|first2=Sunnie|last3=Clemmer|first3=David E.|title=Do Homochiral Aggregates Have an Entropic Advantage?|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry B|date=January 2005|volume=109|issue=1|pages=440–444|doi=10.1021/jp046478x|pmid=16851034}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been experimentally verified that amino acids form large aggregates in larger abundance from [[enantiopure]] substrates than from [[racemic]] ones.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

It is not clear whether homochirality emerged before or after life, and many mechanisms for its origin have been proposed.&lt;ref name=jafarpour2017 /&gt; Some of these models propose three distinct steps: ''mirror-symmetry breaking'' creates a minute enantiomeric imbalance, ''chiral amplification'' builds on this imbalance, and ''chiral transmission'' is the transfer of chirality from one set of molecules to another.

Amino acids are the building blocks of [[peptide]]s and [[enzyme]]s while sugar-peptide chains are the backbone of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reusch|first1=William|title=Peptides &amp; Proteins|url=https://www2.chemistry.msu.edu/faculty/reusch/virttxtjml/protein2.htm|website=Natural Products|publisher=Michigan State University|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lam|first1=Eric|chapter=Nucleic acids and proteins|editor-last1=Dey|editor-first1=P.M.|editor-last2=Harborne|editor-first2=J.B.|title=Plant Biochemistry.|date=1997|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington|isbn=9780080525723|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biological organisms, amino acids appear almost exclusively in the left-handed form (&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids) and sugars in the right-handed form (R-sugars).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zubay |first1=Geoffrey |title=Origins of Life: On Earth and in the Cosmos |date=2000 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780080497617 |page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=August 2018}} Since the enzymes catalyze reactions, they enforce homochirality on a great variety of other chemicals, including [[hormone]]s, toxins, fragrances and food flavors.&lt;ref name=Seckbach&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seckbach|first1=edited by Joseph|title=Genesis - in the beginning : precursors of life, chemical models and early biological evolution|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=9789400729407}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|493&amp;ndash;494}} [[Glycine]] is achiral, as are some other non-[[proteinogenic]] amino acids are either achiral (such as [[dimethylglycine]]) or of the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomeric form.

==Origins==
===Symmetry breaking===
Known mechanisms for the production of non-racemic mixtures from racemic starting materials include: asymmetric physical laws, such as the [[electroweak interaction]]; asymmetric environments, such as those caused by [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized]] light, [[Quartz|quartz crystal]]s, or the Earth's rotation; and statistical fluctuations during racemic synthesis.&lt;ref name="Plasson2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plasson |first1=Raphaël |last2=Kondepudi |first2=Dilip K. |last3=Bersini |first3=Hugues |last4=Commeyras |first4=Auguste |last5=Asakura |first5=Kouichi |display-authors=3 |date=August 2007 |title=Emergence of homochirality in far-from-equilibrium systems: Mechanisms and role in prebiotic chemistry |journal=[[Chirality (journal)|Chirality]] |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=589–600 |doi=10.1002/chir.20440 |issn=0899-0042 |pmid=17559107}} "Special Issue: Proceedings from the Eighteenth International Symposium on Chirality (ISCD-18), Busan, Korea, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, chirality would be selected for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=Stuart |authorlink=Stuart Clark (author) |date=July–August 1999 |title=Polarized Starlight and the Handedness of Life |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=87 |issue=4 |page=336 |bibcode=1999AmSci..87..336C |doi=10.1511/1999.4.336 |issn=0003-0996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small [[enantiomeric excess]] can be amplified into a large one by [[Autocatalysis#Asymmetric autocatalysis|asymmetric autocatalysis]], such as in the [[Soai reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shibata |first1=Takanori |last2=Morioka |first2=Hiroshi |last3=Hayase |first3=Tadakatsu |last4=Choji |first4=Kaori |last5=Soai |first5=Kenso |display-authors=3 |date=17 January 1996 |title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=118 |issue=2 |pages=471–472 |doi=10.1021/ja953066g |issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; In asymmetric autocatalysis, the catalyst is a chiral molecule, which means that a chiral molecule is catalysing its own production. An initial enantiomeric excess, such as can be produced by polarized light, then allows the more abundant enantiomer to outcompete the other.&lt;ref name="Soai2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soai |first1=Kenso |last2=Sato |first2=Itaru |last3=Shibata |first3=Takanori |year=2001 |title=Asymmetric autocatalysis and the origin of chiral homogeneity in organic compounds |journal=The Chemical Record |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=321–332 |doi=10.1002/tcr.1017 |issn=1528-0691 |pmid=11893072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One supposition is that the discovery of an enantiomeric imbalance in molecules in the [[Murchison meteorite]] supports an extraterrestrial origin of homochirality: there is evidence for the existence of [[Circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] originating from [[Mie scattering]] on aligned interstellar dust particles which may trigger the formation of an [[enantiomeric excess]] within chiral material in space.&lt;ref name=Meierhenrich/&gt;{{rp|123&amp;ndash;124}} Interstellar and near-stellar magnetic fields can align dust particles in this fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Helman |first=Daniel S |date=6 July 2018 |title=Galactic Distribution of Chirality Sources of Organic Molecules |journal=Acta Astronautica |volume=151 |pages=595–602 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2018.07.008 |issn=0094-5765|bibcode=2018AcAau.151..595H |arxiv=1612.06720 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another speculation (the Vester-Ulbricht hypothesis) suggests that fundamental chirality of physical processes such as that of the beta decay (see [[Parity (physics)|Parity violation]]) leads to slightly different half-lives of biologically relevant molecules. Homochirality may also result from [[spontaneous absolute asymmetric synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guava.physics.uiuc.edu/~nigel/courses/569/Essays_Fall2006/files/Rajan.pdf|title=How did protein amino acids get left-handed while sugars got right-handed?|first=Aruna|last=Rajan|publisher=Term Paper for Physics 569*|accessdate=June 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soai_interview&gt;{{cite journal | journal= Highlights in Chemical Science |year= 2008 |issue= 5 |url= http://www.rsc.org/Publishing/ChemScience/Volume/2008/05/Kenso_Soai_interview.asp |title= Interview: In the beginning... |accessdate=June 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible that homochirality is simply a result of the natural autoamplification process of life—that either the formation of life as preferring one chirality or the other was a chance rare event which happened to occur with the chiralities we observe, or that all chiralities of life emerged rapidly but due to catastrophic events and strong competition, the other unobserved chiral preferences were wiped out by the preponderance and metabolic, enantiomeric enrichment from the 'winning' chirality choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ermann |first1=L |title=Homochirality: the key to unlocking the origin of life? |journal=Applied Theoretical Biology |date=2013 |volume=7 |issue=10 |pages=21–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of chirality consensus as a natural autoamplification process has been associated with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cause of chirality consensus | author= Jaakkola, S., Sharma, V. and Annila, A.| journal = Curr.

===Amplification===
====Theory====
[[File:Frank's model phase portrait.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Phase portrait of Frank's model: starting from almost everywhere in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; plane (except &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; = &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; line), the system approaches to one of the homochiral states]]
In 1953, [[Frederick Charles Frank|Charles Frank]] proposed a model to demonstrate that homochirality is a consequence of [[autocatalysis]].&lt;ref name="frank1953"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frank |first1=F.C. |year=1953 |title=On spontaneous asymmetric synthesis |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=11 |pages=459–463 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(53)90082-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his model the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; enantiomers of a chiral molecule are autocatalytically produced from an achiral molecule A

:A + &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;,{{pad}}A + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → 2&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;

while suppressing each other through a reaction that he called ''mutual antagonism''

:&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; + &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; → ∅.
In this model the racemic state is unstable in the sense that the slightest enantiomeric excess will be amplified to a completely homochiral state. This can be shown by computing the reaction rates from the [[law of mass action]]:
:&lt;math chem&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d[\ce L]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce L] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]}\\
\frac{d[\ce D]}{dt}  &amp;= k_a [\ce D] - k_d \ce{[L] [D]},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_a&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for the autocatalytic reactions, &lt;math&gt;k_d&lt;/math&gt; is the rate constant for mutual antagonism reaction, and the concentration of A is kept constant for simplicity. By defining the enantiomeric excess &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math chem&gt;\Phi = \frac{[\ce D] - [\ce L]}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]},&lt;/math&gt;
we can compute the rate of change of enatiomeric excess using [[chain rule]] from the rate of change of the concentrations of enantiomeres &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.
:&lt;math chem&gt;
\frac{d\Phi}{dt} = \left(\frac{2k_d \ce{[L] [D]}}{[\ce D] + [\ce L]}\right)\Phi.
&lt;/math&gt;
Linear stability analysis of this equation shows that the racemic state &lt;math&gt;\Phi = 0&lt;/math&gt; is unstable. Starting from [[almost everywhere]] in the concentration space, the system evolves to a homochiral state.

It is generally understood that autocatalysis alone does not yield to homochirality, and the presence of the mutually antagonistic relationship between the two enantiomers is necessary for the instability of the racemic mixture. However, recent studies show that homochirality could be achieved from autocatalysis in the absence of the mutually antagonistic relationship, but the underlying mechanism for symmetry-breaking is different.&lt;ref name="jafarpour2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2017 |title=Noise-induced symmetry breaking far from equilibrium and the emergence of biological homochirality |journal=Physical Review E |volume=95 |issue=3 |pages=032407 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.95.032407|pmid=28415353 |bibcode=2017PhRvE..95c2407J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jafarpour2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jafarpour |first1=Farshid |last2=Biancalani |first2=Tommaso |last3=Goldenfeld |first3=Nigel |year=2015 |title=Noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life self-replicators |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=115 |issue=15 |pages=158101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.158101|pmid=26550754 |arxiv=1507.00044 |bibcode=2015PhRvL.115o8101J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Experiments====
There are several laboratory experiments that demonstrate how a small amount of one enantiomer at the start of a reaction can lead to a large excess of a single enantiomer as the product. For example, the Soai reaction is [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic]]. If the reaction is started with some of one of the product enantiomers already present, the product acts as an [[Enantioselective synthesis|enantioselective]] catalyst for production of more of that same enantiomer.&lt;ref name=shibata&gt;{{cite journal|title=Highly Enantioselective Catalytic Asymmetric Automultiplication of Chiral Pyrimidyl Alcohol|author1=Takanori Shibata |author2=Hiroshi Morioka |author3=Tadakatsu Hayase |author4=Kaori Choji |author5=Kenso Soai | journal = [[J.

A high asymmetric amplification of the [[enantiomeric excess]] of sugars are also present in the [[amino acid]] catalyzed asymmetric formation of [[carbohydrates]]&lt;ref name=Engqvist&gt;{{cite journal| title=Plausible origins of homochirality in the amino acid catalyzed neogenesis of carbohydrates|author1=Armando Córdova |author2=Magnus Engqvist |author3=Ismail Ibrahem |author4=Jesús Casas |author5=Henrik Sundén | journal=[[Chem.

One classic study involves an experiment that takes place in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=kondepudi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Chiral Symmetry Breaking in Sodium Chlorate Crystallization| author= Kondepudi, D. K., Kaufman, R. J. &amp; Singh, N.| journal= [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 250 | pages = 975–976|year=1990|doi=10.1126/science.250.4983.975|pmid=17746924|issue=4983|bibcode = 1990Sci...250..975K }}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[sodium chlorate]] is allowed to [[crystallization|crystallize]] from water and the collected crystals examined in a [[polarimeter]], each crystal turns out to be chiral and either the [[Levorotation|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;]] form or the [[Dextrorotation|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;]] form. In an ordinary experiment the amount of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; crystals collected equals the amount of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt; crystals (corrected for statistical effects). However, when the sodium chlorate solution is stirred during the crystallization process the crystals are either exclusively &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; or exclusively &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;. In 32 consecutive crystallization experiments 14 experiments deliver &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-crystals and 18 others &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-crystals. The explanation for this symmetry breaking is unclear but is related to [[autocatalysis]] taking place in the [[nucleation]] process.

In a related experiment, a crystal suspension of a racemic [[amino acid]] derivative continuously stirred, results in a 100% crystal phase of one of the enantiomers because the enantiomeric pair is able to equilibrate in solution  (compare with [[dynamic kinetic resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noorduin|first1=Wim L.|last2=Izumi|first2=Toshiko|last3=Millemaggi|first3=Alessia|last4=Leeman|first4=Michel|last5=Meekes|first5=Hugo|last6=Van Enckevort|first6=Willem J.

===Transmission===
Many strategies in [[asymmetric synthesis]] are built on chiral transmission. Especially important is the so-called [[organocatalysis]] of organic reactions by proline for example in [[Mannich reaction]]s.

==Optical resolution in racemic amino acids==
There exists no theory elucidating correlations among &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. If one takes, for example, [[alanine]], which has a small [[methyl]] group, and [[phenylalanine]], which has a larger [[benzyl]] group, a simple question is in what aspect, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-alanine resembles &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine more than &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-phenylalanine, and what kind of mechanism causes the selection of all &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids. Because it might be possible that alanine was &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt; and phenylalanine was &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;.

It was reported&lt;ref name=kojo&gt;{{cite journal|author1=S. Kojo |author2=H. Uchino |author3=M. Yoshimura |author4=K. Tanaka |title = Racemic D,L-asparagine causes enantiomeric excess of other coexisting racemic D,L-amino acids during recrystallization: a hypothesis accounting for the origin of L-amino acids in the biosphere.| journal = [[Chem.

The [[enantiomeric excess]] {{math|ee {{=}} 100 &amp;times;(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)/(&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;+&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;)}} of these amino acids was correlated almost linearly with that of the inducer, i.e., Asn. When recrystallizations from a mixture of 12 &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-amino acids (Ala, Asp, Arg, Glu, Gln, His, Leu, Met, Ser, Val, Phe, and Tyr) and excess &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;,&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-Asn were made, all amino acids with the same configuration with Asn were preferentially co-crystallized.&lt;ref name=kojo/&gt; It was incidental whether the enrichment took place in &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;- or &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-Asn, however, once the selection was made, the co-existing amino acid with the same configuration at the α-carbon was preferentially involved because of thermodynamic stability in the crystal formation. The maximal ee was reported to be 100%. Based on these results, it is proposed that a mixture of racemic amino acids causes spontaneous and effective optical resolution, even if asymmetric synthesis of a single amino acid does not occur without an aid of an optically active molecule.

This is the first study elucidating reasonably the formation of chirality from racemic amino acids with experimental evidences.

==History of term==
This term was introduced by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin]] in 1904, the year that he published his Baltimore Lecture of 1884. Kelvin used the term homochirality as a relationship between two molecules, i.e. two molecule are homochiral if they have the same chirality.&lt;ref name=Engqvist/&gt;&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=David G.|title=Stereochemistry|date=2001|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-84755-194-8|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, however, homochiral has been used in the same sense as [[enantiomer]]ically pure.

The '''Faculty of Natural Sciences''' is one of the three main faculties of [[Imperial College London]] in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imperial.ac.uk/Faculties-and-departments/|publisher=[[Imperial College London]]|location=London, United Kingdom|title=Faculties, departments and institutes |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed in 2001 from the former [[Royal College of Science]], a constituent college of Imperial College which dated back to 1848, and the faculty largely consists of the original departments of the college. Undergraduate teaching occurs for all departments at the [[South Kensington]] campus, with research being split between South Kensington and the new innovation campus at [[White City, London|White City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk/white-city-campus/research/molecular-sciences-hub/|title=The Molecular Sciences Research Hub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students who study at the departments of the faulty are represented by the [[Royal College of Science Union]], a constituent union of the [[Imperial College Union|college union]] which caters specifically to students on natural science courses. Graduates who obtain an undergraduate degree, either [[BSc]] or [[MSci]], from the faculty are awarded the [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|Associateship of the Royal College of Science]] (ARCS) as an additional degree.

== History ==
{{See also|Royal College of Science}}
[[File:Blackett Laboratory Front-On, Prince Consort Road.png|thumb|160px|The [[Blackett Laboratory]] is home to the Department of Physics]]

The origins of the faculty lie in the Royal College of Chemistry, which, after being founded in 1845, moved to a new site in South Kensington in the early 1870s. Incorporated into the Normal School of Science, the college was later renamed the Royal College of Science in 1890, and in 1907 became a constituent college of the newly formed [[Imperial College London|Imperial College of Science and Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol38/pp233-247#h2-0004|title=CHAPTER XVIII - Imperial College ｜ British History Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Imperial College was restructured to form four new faculties, including the faculties of Physical Sciences and Life Sciences, which took over the role of the Royal College of Science. These faculties were later re-merged over the course of 2005-2006 to form the Faculty of Natural Sciences, which comprises the same departments as the original Royal College of Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://live.cgcu.net/news/?id=1138  Live! – News: Science Faculties to Re-Merge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231052851/http://live.cgcu.net/news/?id=1138 |date=31 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Departments ==

The faculty includes five academic departments:

* [[Department of Chemistry, Imperial College London|Chemistry]]
* Mathematics
* Physics, The [[Blackett Laboratory]]&lt;ref name="Imperial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_1-5-2014-14-26-39|title=Imperial's Blackett Lab recognised as an historic site in physics research|publisher=Imperial College|date=2014–2016|accessdate=1 October 2016|author=Jon Narcross}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Certified [https://web.archive.org/web/20140109045424/http://www.hort.vt.edu/mastergardener/ Virginia Master Gardener],&lt;ref name="poets_writers"&gt;[http://www.pw.org/content/janet_lembke_2 Janet Lembke entry in ''Poets &amp; Writers'' directory]&lt;/ref&gt; she lived in Virginia and North Carolina, drawing inspiration from both locales. She was recognized for her creative view of natural cycles, agriculture and of animals, both domestic and wild, with whom we share the natural environment. Referred to as an "acclaimed Southern naturalist,"&lt;ref name="barnes_touching"&gt;[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/touching-earth-janet-lembke/1004542082?ean=9781580800884 Barnes &amp; Noble review of ''Touching Earth'' by Janet Lembke]&lt;/ref&gt; she was equally (as [[The Chicago Tribune]] described her) a "classicist, a noted Oxford University Press translator of the works of Sophocles, Euripides and Aeschylus".&lt;ref name="chicago_tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-26/features/9501260188_1_skinny-dipping-essay-water-flows|title=Janet Lembke's Essays Get The Skinny On Essentials|last=Leardi|first=Jeanette|date=26 January 1995|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a grant from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] to translate [[Virgil]]'s [[Georgics]],&lt;ref name="poets_writers" /&gt; having already translated [[Euripides]]' ''Electra'' and ''Hecuba'', and [[Aeschylus]]'s ''Persians'' and ''Suppliants''.

Janet Lembke's first book was ''Bronze and Iron: Old Latin Poetry from Its Beginnings to 100 B.C.'' (1973), but beyond  translations and essays about classics, there were more than a dozen books on nature, works for which the author acquired a base of admirers. Her articles were printed in [[The New York Times]], ''[http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/ Sierra Magazine]'' ([[The Sierra Club]]), [[Oxford American]], [[Audubon (magazine)|Audubon]], [[Raleigh News and Observer]], [[Southern Review]] and other publications. The writing style was eclectic and personal, meditative and detailed, and though she was at least once accused of "taking poetic license too far"&lt;ref name="bryn_mawr"&gt;[http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2005/2005-08-06.html Criticism of Lembke's translation of ''The Georgics'']. ''Bryn Mawr Classical Review'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; in her translation of ''Georgics'', readers were often charmed and seduced by her way of weaving scientific fact, history and culture, with personal anecdote, mythological allusion and poetic feeling. "The author's ability to pull together disparate elements in her writing is impressive, and her passionate connection with the natural world is displayed in line after line," wrote [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref name="skinnydipping_nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/books/in-short-nonfiction-040029.html|title=SKINNY DIPPING And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human. By Janet Lembke.|last=Hanson|first=Elizabeth|date=18 December 1994|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Annie Proulx]] expressed a similar perception, observing that "Lembke's writing tacks between three points: the stuff of her late-twentieth-century life; the tangle of creature and plant in every dimension of tide and river flow; and the haunting, connecting wires of mythos that still knot us  to the ancient beginnings."&lt;ref name="Lembke2003"&gt;Annie Proulx on Lembke: {{cite book|author=Janet Lembke|title=The Quality of Life: Living Well, Dying Well|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDNtM_f1tdEC&amp;pg=PA214|year=2003|publisher=[[Lyons Press]]|isbn=978-1-59228-128-2|pages=214–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Janet Lembke's noted titles were ''Because the Cat Purrs: How We Relate to Other Species and Why It Matters'' (2008); ''Skinny Dipping: And Other Immersions in Water, Myth, and Being Human'' (2004); ''Dangerous Birds'' (1996); ''River Time'' (1997); ''Despicable Species: On Cowbirds, Kudzu, Hornworms, and Other Scourges'' (1999); and ''The Quality of Life: Living Well, Dying Well'' (2004)-- a sober and unflinching account of the death of the author's mother. At the time of her own death at age 80 in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]], [[Virginia (state)|Virginia]], Janet Lembke was working on a memoir, ''I Married an Arsonist''. She had married twice, and had four children and six grandchildren.&lt;ref name="janet_obit"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsleader.com/article/20130905/OBITUARIES/309050008 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140110102633/http://www.newsleader.com/article/20130905/OBITUARIES/309050008 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 January 2014 |title=Obituary: Janet N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="662">'''Levant bole''' is an earthy [[clay]] brought from the [[Levant]], and historically used in [[medicine]] for the same purposes as [[Armenian bole]]. It was indeed so similar to Armenian bole that some believed them both to be the same, or at least mixtures of each other. Levant bole was used in several compositions, particularly [[diascodium]], to give it color.

Chambers discusses two other similar boles: 
* Lemnian or Terra Lemia from the island of Lemnos, also called Sigillata
* Samnian or Terra Samia from the island of Samos

[[File:Das Jüngste Gericht (Memling).jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[The Last Judgment (Memling)|The Last Judgment]]'' by painter [[Hans Memling]]. In Christian belief, the [[Last Judgement]] is an apocalyptic event where God makes a final judgement of all people on Earth.|alt=A three paneled colour painting. The centre panel shows Jesus sitting in judgment on the world, while St Michael is weighing souls. On the left hand panel, the saved are being guided into heaven, while on the right-hand panel, the damned are being dragged to hell]]

Predictions of [[apocalypse|apocalyptic events]] that would result in the [[Human extinction|extinction of humanity]], a [[Global catastrophic risk|collapse of civilization]], or the destruction of the planet have been made since at least the beginning of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref name=zygon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole-Turner |first=Ronald |date=2012 |title=The singularity and the rapture: Transhumanist and popular Christian views of the future |journal=[[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=777–796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most predictions are related to [[Abrahamic religions]], often standing for or similar to the [[eschatological]] events described in their scriptures. Christian predictions typically refer to events like the [[Rapture]], [[Great Tribulation]], [[Last Judgment]], and the [[Second Coming of Christ]].

| [[WR 104#Effects on Earth|Peter Tuthill]]
| In approximately 300,000 years, [[WR 104]], a [[triple star]], is expected to explode in a [[supernova]]. It has been suggested that it may produce a [[gamma ray burst]] that could pose a threat to life on Earth should its poles be aligned 12° or lower towards Earth. However spectroscopic observations now strongly suggest that it is tilted at an angle of 30°-40° and so any gamma ray burst should not hit Earth.

| The [[Sun]]'s increasing brightness causes the rate of [[weathering]] of the planet's [[crust (geology)|crust]] to increase. This will cause the level of [[carbon dioxide]] in the [[atmosphere]] to drop dramatically, making [[photosynthesis]] in [[plants]] impossible. This will very likely cause a mega [[mass extinction]] of the Earth's [[vegetation]]. The lack of [[oxygen]]-producing plants will cause [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere to disappear as well as the [[ozone layer]], making [[animal]] life impossible. Even if photosynthesis was still possible, rising surface tempatures from the brighter sun will make complex life (plants and animals) impossible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44733">This is a '''list of herbaria''', organized first by continent where the herbarium is located, then within each continent by size of the collection. A [[herbarium]] (''plural'' "herbaria") is a collection of preserved [[plant]] specimens. These specimens may be whole plants or plant parts: these will usually be in a dried form, mounted on a sheet, but depending upon the material may also be kept in alcohol or other preservative. The same term is often used in [[mycology]] to describe an equivalent collection of preserved [[fungi]] and in [[phycology]] to describe a collection of [[algae]].

To preserve their form and color, plants collected in the field are spread flat on sheets of newsprint and dried, usually in a plant press, between blotters or absorbent paper. The specimens, which are then mounted on sheets of stiff white paper, are labeled with all essential data, such as date and place found, description of the plant, altitude, and special habitat conditions. The sheet is then placed in a protective case. As a precaution against insect attack, the pressed plant is frozen or poisoned and the case disinfected.

Most herbaria utilize a standard system of organizing their specimens into herbarium cases. Specimen sheets are stacked in groups by the [[species]] to which they belong and placed into a large lightweight [[File folder|folder]] that is labelled on the bottom edge. Groups of species folders are then placed together into larger, heavier folders by [[genus]]. The genus folders are then sorted by taxonomic [[family (biology)|family]] according to the standard system selected for use by the herbarium and placed into pigeonholes in herbarium cabinets. Herbaria are essential for the study of [[plant taxonomy]], the study of geographic distributions, and the stabilizing of nomenclature. Herbaria also preserve an historical record of change in [[vegetation]] over time. In some cases, plants become [[Extinction|extinct]] in one area, or may become extinct altogether. In such cases, specimens preserved in an herbarium can represent the only record of the plant's original distribution. Environmental scientists make use of such data to track changes in [[climate]] and human impact.

'''Loren Eiseley''' (September 3, 1907 – July 9, 1977) was an American [[anthropologist]], [[educator]], [[philosopher]], and [[natural science]] writer, who taught and published books from the 1950s through the 1970s. He received many [[honorary degree]]s and was a fellow of multiple professional societies. At his death, he was Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

He was a "scholar and writer of imagination and grace," whose reputation and accomplishments extended far beyond the campus where he taught for 30 years. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' referred to him as "the modern [[Thoreau]]." The broad scope of his writing reflected upon such topics as the mind of [[Sir Francis Bacon]], the [[prehistoric]] origins of man, and the contributions of [[Charles Darwin]].

Eiseley's reputation was established primarily through his books, including ''The Immense Journey'' (1957), ''Darwin's Century'' (1958), ''The Unexpected Universe'' (1969), ''The Night Country'' (1971), and his memoir, ''All the Strange Hours'' (1975). Science author [[Orville Prescott]] praised him as a scientist who "can write with poetic sensibility and with a fine sense of wonder and of reverence before the mysteries of life and nature." Naturalist author Mary Ellen Pitts saw his combination of literary and nature writings as his "quest, not simply for bringing together science and literature... but a continuation of what the 18th and 19th century British naturalists and Thoreau had done." In praise of "The Unexpected Universe", [[Ray Bradbury]] remarked, "[Eiseley] is every writer's writer, and every human's human... One of us, yet most uncommon..."  
 
According to his obituary in the ''[[New York Times]]'', the feeling and philosophical motivation of the entire body of Eiseley's work was best expressed in one of his essays, ''The Enchanted Glass:'' "The anthropologist wrote of the need for the contemplative [[naturalist]], a man who, in a less frenzied era, had time to observe, to speculate, and to dream."&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Blum, Howard. ''Loren Eiseley, Anthropologist, 69; Eloquent Writer on Man and Nature'', ''New York Times'', (Obituary) July 11, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death he received an award from the [[Boston Museum of Science]] for his "outstanding contribution to the public understanding of science" and another from the U.S. [[Humane Society]] for his "significant contribution for the improvement of life and environment in this country."

==Early life==
Born in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]], Eiseley lived his childhood with a hardworking father and deaf mother who may have suffered from [[mental illness]]. Their home was located on the outskirts of town where, as author Naomi Brill writes, it was "removed from the people and the community from which they felt set apart through poverty and family misfortune."&lt;ref name=Brill&gt;Brill, Naomi. [http://www.eiseley.org/biography.php Loren Eiseley Society (LES)]&lt;/ref&gt; His autobiography, ''All the Strange Hours'', begins with his "childhood experiences as a sickly afterthought, weighed down by the loveless union of his parents."&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt;

His father, Clyde, was a hardware salesman who worked long hours for little pay, writes Brill. However, as an amateur [[Shakespearean]] actor, he was able to give his son a "love for beautiful language and writing."&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; His mother, Daisey Corey, was a self-taught prairie artist who was considered a beautiful woman. She lost her hearing as a child and sometimes exhibited irrational and destructive behavior. This left Eiseley feeling distant from her and may have contributed to his parents' unhappy marriage.

Living at the edge of town, however, led to Eiseley's early interest in the natural world, to which he turned when being at home was too difficult. There, he would play in the caves and creek banks nearby.&lt;ref name=Minn&gt;[[Minnesota State University, Mankato|Minnesota State University]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20100603182329/https://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/abcde/eiseley_loren.html EMuseum's Eiseley biography] ([[Internet Archive]] of website defunct since 2011), Retrieved 2015-10-16&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, there were others who opened the door to a happier life. His half-brother, Leo, for instance, gave him a copy of ''[[Robinson Crusoe (novel)|Robinson Crusoe]]'', with which he taught himself to read. Thereafter, he managed to find ways to get to the public library and became a voracious reader.&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;

Eiseley later attended the Lincoln Public Schools; in high school, he wrote that he wanted to be a [[nature writer]]. He would later describe the lands around Lincoln as "flat and grass-covered and smiling so serenely up at the sun that they seemed forever youthful, untouched by mind or time&amp;mdash;a sunlit, timeless prairie over which nothing passed but antelope or wandering bird."&lt;ref name=Strange/&gt; But, disturbed by his home situation and the illness and recent death of his father, he dropped out of school and worked at menial jobs.

Eiseley enrolled in the [[University of Nebraska]], where he wrote for the newly formed journal, ''[[Prairie Schooner]]'', and went on [[archaeology]] digs for the school's [[natural history]] [[museum]], [[University of Nebraska State Museum|Morrill Hall]].&lt;ref name=Brill/&gt;  In 1927, however, he was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and left the university to move to the western [[desert]], believing the drier air would improve his condition. While there, he soon became restless and unhappy, which led him to hoboing around the country by hopping on freight trains (as many did during the [[Great Depression]]).&lt;ref name=Strange&gt;Eiseley, Loren. ''All the Strange Hours'', (1975) Scribner&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor of religion, Richard Wentz, writes about this period:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Loren Eiseley had been a drifter in his youth. From the plains of Nebraska he had wandered across the American West. Sometimes sickly, at other times testing his strength with that curious band of roving exiles who searched the land above the rippling railroad ties, he explored his soul as he sought to touch the distant past. He became a naturalist and a bone hunter because something about the landscape had linked his mind to the birth and death of life itself.&lt;ref name=Wentz&gt;Wentz, Richard E., [http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1391 The American Spirituality of Loren Eiseley] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007182240/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1391 |date=2009-10-07 }} ''Christian Century'', April 25, 1984,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Academic career==
Eiseley eventually returned to the University of Nebraska and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[English studies|English]] and a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[Geology]]/[[Anthropology]]. While at the university, he served as editor of the literary magazine ''The Prairie Schooner'', and published his poetry and short stories. Undergraduate expeditions to western Nebraska and the southwest to hunt for fossils and human artifacts provided the inspiration for much of his early work. He later noted that he came to anthropology from paleontology, preferring to leave human burial sites undisturbed unless destruction threatened them.

Eiseley received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1937 and wrote his dissertation entitled "Three Indices of Quaternary Time and Their Bearing Upon Pre-History: a Critique", which launched his academic career.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; He began teaching at the [[University of Kansas]] that same year. During [[World War II]], Eiseley taught anatomy to reservist pre-med students at Kansas.

In 1944 he left the University of Kansas to assume the role of head of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at [[Oberlin College]] in [[Ohio]]. In 1947 he returned to the University of Pennsylvania to head its Anthropology Department. He was elected president of the American Institute of Human [[Paleontology]] in 1949. From 1959 to 1961, he was [[Provost (education)|provost]] at the University of Pennsylvania, and in 1961 the University of Pennsylvania created a special interdisciplinary professorial chair for him.

Eiseley was also a fellow of many distinguished professional societies, including the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

At the time of his death in 1977, he was Benjamin Franklin Professor of Anthropology and History of Science, and the curator of the Early Man section at the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum]].&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;University of Pennsylvania Almanac, [http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/volumes/v54/n10/eiseley.html Loren Eiseley’s 100th Birthday Celebration at the Penn Museum] October 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  He had received thirty-six [[honorary degrees]] over a period of twenty years, and was the most honored member of the University of Pennsylvania since [[Benjamin Franklin]]. In 1976 he won the [[Bradford Washburn]] Award of the [[Boston Museum of Science]] for his "outstanding contribution to the public understanding of science" and the [[Joseph Wood Krutch]] Medal from the [[Humane Society of the United States]] for his "significant contribution for the improvement of life and the environment in this country."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Books==
In addition to his scientific and academic work, Eiseley began in the mid-1940s to publish the essays which brought him to the attention of a wider audience. Anthropologist Pat Shipman writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;the words that flowed from his pen... the images and insights he revealed, the genius of the man as a writer, outweigh his social disability. The words were what kept him in various honored posts; the words were what caused the students to flock to his often aborted courses; the words were what earned him esteemed lectureships and prizes. His contemporaries failed to see the duality of the man, confusing the deep, wise voice of Eiseley's writings with his own personal voice. He was a natural fugitive, a fox at the wood's edge (in his own metaphor)...&lt;ref name=Shipman&gt;Shipman, Pat. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE0D7113EF93AA2575BC0A966958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print An Anthropologist With Bite]''New York Times'', August 19, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eiseley published works in a number of different genres including poetry, autobiography, history of science, biography, and nonfictional essays. In each piece of writing, he consistently used a poetic writing style. Eiseley's style mirrors what he called the concealed essay—a piece of writing that unites the personal dimension with more scientific thoughts.&lt;ref name=Wisner&gt;Wisner, William. "The Perilous Self: Loren Eiseley And The Reticence Of Autobiography." Sewanee Review 113.1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; His writing was unique in that it could convey complex ideas about human origin and the relationship between humans and the natural world to a nonscientific audience. Robert G. Franke describes Eiseley's essays as theatrical and dramatic. He also notes the influence his father's hobby as an amateur [[Shakespearean]] actor may have had on Eiseley's writing, pointing out that his essays often contain dramatic elements that are usually present in plays.&lt;ref name=Franke&gt;Franke, Robert. Journal of American Culture. "A Great Stage, A Great Play: The Theatrical And Tragic In Loren Eiseley's Essays.", 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing Eiseley's writing, Richard Wentz wrote, "As the works of any naturalist might, Eiseley's essays and poems deal with the flora and fauna of [[North America]]. They probe the concept of evolution, which consumed so much of his scholarly attention, examining the bones and shards, the arrowpoints and buried treasures. Every scientific observation leads to reflection." &lt;ref name=Wentz /&gt;

In an interview on [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), author [[Michael Lind]] said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the rise of a self-conscious intelligentsia, most educated people &amp;ndash; as well as the unlettered majority &amp;ndash; spent most of their time in the countryside or, if they lived in cities, were a few blocks away from farmland or wilderness... At the risk of sounding countercultural, I suspect that thinkers who live in sealed, air-conditioned boxes and work by artificial light (I am one) are as unnatural as apes in cages at zoos. Naturalists like Eiseley in that sense are the most normal human beings to be found among intellectuals, because they spend a lot of time outdoors and know the names of the plants and animals they see... For all of his scientific erudition, Eiseley has a poetic, even cinematic, imagination.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;Lind, Michael. [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5634196&amp;live=1 NPR radio interview], October 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Purposes of his writings===
Richard Wentz describes what he feels are the significance and purposes of Eiseley's writings:&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;"For Loren Eiseley, writing itself becomes a form of contemplation. Contemplation is a kind of human activity in which the mind, spirit and body are directed in solitude toward some other. Scholars and critics have not yet taken the full measure of contemplation as an art that is related to the purpose of all scholarly activity &amp;ndash; to see things as they really are... Using narrative, parable and exposition, Eiseley has the uncanny ability to make us feel that we are accompanying him on a journey into the very heart of the universe. Whether he is explicating history or commenting on the ideas of a philosopher, a scientist or a theologian, he takes us with him on a personal visit."

However, because of Eiseley's intense and poetic writing style and his focus on nature and [[cosmology]], he was not accepted or understood by most of his colleagues. "You," a friend told him, "are a freak, you know. A God-damned freak, and life is never going to be easy for you. You like scholarship, but the scholars, some of them, anyhow, are not going to like you because you don't stay in the hole where God supposedly put you. You keep sticking your head out and looking around. In a university that's inadvisable." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===1950s===
;''The Immense Journey'' (1957)
His first book, ''The Immense Journey'', was a collection of writings about the history of humanity, and it proved to be that rare science book that appealed to a mass audience. It has sold over a million copies and has been published in at least 16 languages.&lt;ref name=proclamation/&gt; Besides being his first book, ''The Immense Journey'' was also Eiseley's most well known book and established him as a writer with the ability to combine science and humanity in a poetic way.&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; This book was originally published in 1946.&lt;ref name=Brill /&gt; Then, it was published again in 1957, a few years after the [[Piltdown Man]] hoax discovery.

In the book Eiseley conveys his sense of wonder at the depth of time and the vastness of the universe. He uses his own experiences, reactions to the paleontological record, and wonderment at the world to address the topic of evolution. More specifically, the text concentrates on human evolution and human ignorance. In ''The Immense Journey'', Eiseley follows the journey from human ignorance at the beginning of life to his own wonderment about the future of mankind. [[Marston Bates]] writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It seems to me... that Eiseley is looking at man in a quite hard-headed fashion, because he is willing to sketch problems for which he has no present and sure solution. We are not going to find the answers in human evolution until we have framed the right questions, and the questions are difficult because they involve both body and mind, physique and culture—tools and symbols as well as cerebral configurations.&lt;ref name=Bates&gt;Bates, Marston. "Science", 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Author Orville Prescott wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Consider the case of Loren Eiseley, author of ''The Immense Journey'', who can sit on a mountain slope beside a prairie-dog town and imagine himself back in the dawn of the [[Age of mammals]] eighty million years ago:  'There by a tree root I could almost make him out, that shabby little [[Paleocene]] rat, eternal tramp and world wanderer, father of all mankind.' ... his prose is often lyrically beautiful, something that considerable reading in the works of anthropologists had not led me to expect. ... The subjects discussed here include the human ancestral tree, water and its significance to life, the mysteries of cellular life, 'the secret and remote abysses' of the sea, the riddle of why human beings alone among living creatures have brains capable of abstract thought and are far superior to their mere needs for survival, the reasons why Dr. Eiseley is convinced that there are no men or man-like animals on other planets, ....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He offers an example of Eiseley's style: "There is no logical reason for the existence of a snowflake any more than there is for evolution. It is an apparition from that mysterious shadow world beyond nature, that final world which contains&amp;mdash;if anything contains&amp;mdash;the explanation of men and catfish and green leaves."&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;Prescott, Orville. "Books of the Times," ''New York Times'', December 27, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

;''Darwin's Century'' (1958)
This book's subtitle is, "Evolution and the Men Who Discovered It." Eiseley documented that animal variation, extinction, and a lengthy history of the earth were observed from the 1600s onward. Scientists groped towards a theory with increasingly detailed observations. They became aware that evolution had occurred without knowing how. Evolution was "in the air" and part of the intellectual discourse both before and after ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' was published. The publisher describes it thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the heart of the account is Charles Darwin, but the story neither begins nor ends with him. Starting with the seventeenth-century notion of the [[Great Chain of Being]], Dr. Eiseley traces the achievements and discoveries of men in many fields of science who paved the way for Darwin; and the book concludes with an extensive discussion of the ways in which Darwin's work has been challenged, improved upon, and occasionally refuted during the past hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century,'' back cover&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Persons whose contributions are discussed include [[Sir Thomas Browne]], [[Sir Francis Bacon]], [[Carl Linnaeus]],  [[Benoît de Maillet]], the [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]], [[Erasmus Darwin]], [[Louis Agassiz]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], [[James Hutton]], [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]], [[Sir Charles Lyell]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]], [[William Charles Wells|William Wells]], [[Patrick Matthew]], [[Karl von Baer]], [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], [[John Richardson (naturalist)|Sir John Richardson]], [[Alexander Humboldt]], [[Gregor Mendel]], [[Hugo De Vries]], [[Wilhelm Johannsen|W. L. Johannsen]], [[Adolphe Quetelet|Lambert Quételet]], and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]. Critics discussed include [[Fleeming Jenkin]], [[Alfred William Bennett|A.W. Bennett]], [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]], and [[Adam Sedgwick]], both a mentor and a critic.&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century'' as a whole&lt;/ref&gt;

According to naturalist author Mary Ellen Pitts, in the "seminal" ''Darwin's Century'', Eiseley was studying the history of evolutionary thinking, and he came to see that "as a result of scientific studies, nature has become externalized, particularized, mechanized, separated from the human and fragmented, reduced to conflict without consideration of cooperation, confined to [[reductionist]] and [[positivist]] study." The results for humankind, "as part of the '[[Biota (ecology)|biota]]' &amp;ndash; Eiseley's concern as a writer &amp;ndash; are far reaching." In the book, his unique impact as a thinker and a literary figure emerges as he reexamines science and the way man understands science. She concludes that, for Eiseley, "Nature emerges as a [[metonym]] for a view of the physical world, of the 'biota,' and of humankind that must be reexamined if life is to survive."&lt;ref name=Pitts&gt;Pitts, Mary Ellen. ''Toward a Dialogue of Understandings: Loren Eiseley and the Critique of Science'', Lehigh University Press (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his conclusion, Eiseley quotes Darwin: "If we choose to let conjecture run wild, then animals, our fellow brethren in pain, disease, suffering and famine&amp;mdash;our slaves in the most laborious works, our companions in our amusements&amp;mdash;they may partake of our origin in one common ancestor&amp;mdash;we may be all melted together." Eiseley adds, "If he had never conceived of natural selection, if he had never written the ''Origin,'' it would still stand as a statement of almost clairvoyant perception."&lt;ref&gt;''Darwin's Century,'' page 352.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book won the [[Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science|Phi Beta Kappa prize for best book in science]] in 1958.

===1960s===
;''The Firmament of Time'' (1960) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2UaKo_vGjRAC Read excerpts online]
In discussing ''The Firmament of Time'', Professor of Zoology Leslie Dunn wrote, "How can man of 1960, burdened with the knowledge of the world external to him, and with the consciousness that scientific knowledge is attained through continually interfering with nature, 'bear his part' and gain the hope and confidence to live in the new world to which natural science has given birth? ... The answer comes in the eloquent, moving central essay of his new book."&lt;ref name=Dunn&gt;Dunn, Leslie C. "Natural Law and Science," ''The New York Times'', August 7, 1960&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New Yorker'' wrote, "Dr. Eiseley describes with zest and admiration the giant steps that have led man, in a scant three hundred years, to grasp the nature of his extraordinary past and to substitute a natural world for a world of divine creation and intervention... An irresistible inducement to partake of the almost forgotten excitements of reflection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0803267398|title=The Firmament of Time|first1=Loren|last1=Eiseley|first2=Gary|last2=Holthaus|date=1 May 1999|publisher=Bison Books|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in ''The Chicago Tribune'' added, "[This book] has a warm feeling for all natural phenomena; it has a rapport with man and his world and his problems; ... it has hope and belief. And it has the beauty of prose that characterizes Eiseley's philosophical moods."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0803267398  ''Chicago Sunday Tribune'']&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Firmament of Time'' was awarded the 1961 [[John Burroughs]] Medal for the best publication in the field of Nature Writing.

{{see also|The Star Thrower}}

Poet [[W.H. Auden]] wrote, "The main theme of ''The Unexpected Universe'' is Man as the Quest Hero, the wanderer, the voyager, the seeker after adventure, knowledge, power, meaning, and righteousness."&lt;ref name=Auden&gt;Auden, W.H.[http://southerncrossreview.org/44/auden-eiseley.htm Introduction to ''The Star Thrower'']&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes from the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every time we walk along a beach some ancient urge disturbs us so that we find ourselves shedding shoes and garments or scavenging among seaweed and whitened timbers like the homesick refugees of a long war... Mostly the animals understand their roles, but man, by comparison, seems troubled by a message that, it is often said, he cannot quite remember or has gotten wrong... Bereft of instinct, he must search continually for meanings... Man was a reader before he became a writer, a reader of what [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] once called the mighty alphabet of the universe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Evolutionary biologist [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] described Dr. Eiseley as

{{quote|...a [[Proust]] miraculously turned into an evolutionary anthropologist...", and science fiction novelist [[Ray Bradbury]] wrote glowing reviews of many of his books including this one. ... "Here he writes from a naturalist's perspective on the unexpected and symbolic aspects of the universe. Read about seeds, [[hieroglyphs]] on shells, the [[Ice Age]], lost tombs, city dumps and primitive Man. The underlying theme is the desolation and renewal of our planet's history and experience.

Loren Eiseley's dark, brooding prose is unique in the annals of nature writing. ''The Unexpected Universe'' features some of what are considered Eiseley's best essays. Heavily autobiographical and deeply personal, these essays are not cheerful ramblings on the joy of communing with nature. They are bleak, lonely musings on the human condition.}}

===1970s===
;''The Invisible Pyramid (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ukuhJFtLugcC Read excerpts online]
Gregory McNamee of Amazon.com writes, "In 1910 young Loren Eiseley watched the passage of [[Halley's Comet]] with his father. The boy who became a famous naturalist was never again to see the spectacle except in his imagination. That childhood event contributed to the profound sense of time and space that marks ''The Invisible Pyramid''. This collection of essays, first published shortly after Americans landed on the moon, explores inner and outer space, the vastness of the cosmos, and the limits of what can be known. Bringing poetic insight to scientific discipline, Eiseley makes connections between civilizations past and present, multiple universes, humankind, and nature.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eiseley took the occasion of the lunar landing to consider how far humans had to go in understanding their own small corner of the universe, their home planet, much less what he called the 'cosmic prison' of space. Likening humans to the microscopic phagocytes that dwell within our bodies, he grumpily remarks, 'We know only a little more extended reality than the hypothetical creature below us. Above us may lie realms it is beyond our power to grasp.' Science, he suggests, would be better put to examining that which lies immediately before us, although he allows that the quest to explore space is so firmly rooted in Western technological culture that it was unlikely to be abandoned simply because of his urging. Eiseley's opinion continues to be influential among certain environmentalists, and these graceful essays show why that should be so.&lt;ref&gt;McNamee, Gregory [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/080326738X Amazon.com book description]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Book excerpt:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Man would not be man if his dreams did not exceed his grasp. ... Like [[John Donne]], man lies in a close prison, yet it is dear to him. Like Donne's, his thoughts at times overleap the sun and pace beyond the body. If I term humanity a [[slime mold]] organism it is because our present environment suggest it. If I remember the sunflower forest it is because from its hidden reaches man arose. The green world is his sacred center. In moments of sanity he must still seek refuge there. ... If I dream by contrast of the eventual drift of the star voyagers through the dilated time of the universe, it is because I have seen [[thistle]]down off to new worlds and am at heart a voyager who, in this modern time, still yearns for the lost country of his birth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;''The Night Country (1971) [https://books.google.com/books?id=hsf0wbVJz8wC Read excerpts online]
[[Kirkus Reviews]] wrote,

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;like the medievalists, Eiseley reads nature as the second book of God's revelation, mysterious and heavy with latent, lurking fertility. His sizable audience should welcome the latest voyage in search of the secret springs of creativity - evolutionary, cosmic, mental - as a muted adumbration of temporal mortality." Other reviews: "Eiseley has met strange creatures in the night country, and he tells marvelous stories about them ... For Eiseley, storytelling is never pure entertainment.

In a published essay, University of Pennsylvania alumnus Carl Hoffman wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;An old man who had done almost all of his writing late, late at night, was speaking to a younger man who liked to read in those same dark hours. In a chapter entitled 'One Night's Dying,' Eiseley said to me: 'It is thus that one day and the next are welded together, and that one night's dying becomes tomorrow's birth. I, who do not sleep, can tell you this.' Today, well into my fifties, in the midst of a lifetime of almost compulsive reading, I still regard ''The Night Country'' as my all-time favorite book.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Carl.

;''All the Strange Hours: The Excavation of a Life'' (1975) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6vQ2WZQJoQ8C&amp;output=html Read excerpts online]
"In ''All the Strange Hours''," states Amazon.com,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Eiseley turns his considerable powers of reflection and discovery on his own life to weave a compelling story, related with the modesty, grace, and keen eye for a telling anecdote that distinguish his work. His story begins with his childhood experiences as a sickly afterthought, weighed down by the loveless union of his parents. From there he traces the odyssey that led to his search for early postglacial man—and into inspiriting philosophical territory—culminating in his uneasy achievement of world renown. Eiseley crafts an absorbing self-portrait of a man who has thought deeply about his place in society as well as humanity's place in the natural world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Posthumous===
;''The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley'' (1987) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NfmoHi4-M-cC&amp;output=html Read excerpts online]
Just before his death Eiseley asked his wife to destroy the personal notebooks which he had kept since 1953. However, she compromised by disassembling them so they couldn't be used. Later, after great effort, his good friend Kenneth Heuer managed to reassemble most of his notebooks into readable form. ''The Lost Notebooks of Loren Eiseley'' includes a variety of Eiseley's writings including childhood stories, sketches while he was a vagabond, old family pictures, unpublished poems, portions of unfinished novels, and letters to and from literary admirers like [[W.H. Auden]], [[Howard Nemerov]], [[Lewis Mumford]] and [[Ray Bradbury]].

In a review of the book, author Robert Finch writes, "Like [[Herman Melville|Melville]], Eiseley thought of himself, and by extension all mankind, as 'an orphan, a wood child, a changeling,' a cosmic outcast born into a world that afforded him no true home." He adds that his "distinctive gift as a writer was to take powerfully formative personal influences of family and place and fuse them with his intellectual meditations on universal topics such as evolution, human consciousness and the weight of time. ... he found metaphors that released a powerful view of man's fate in the modern world." As Kenneth Heuer writes, "there are countless examples of Eiseley's empathy with life in all its forms, and particularly with its lost outcasts...the love that transcends the boundaries of species was the highest spiritual expression he knew.&lt;ref name=Notebook&gt;Finch, Robert. ''New York Times'', September 20, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Finch adds, "We are grateful for a life and a sensibility that would be welcome in any age, but never more so than in our increasingly depersonalized world. ... he made a generation of readers 'see the world through his eyes.' In an undated passage, circa 1959, Eiseley wrote, 'Man is alone in the universe...Only in the act of love, in rare and hidden communion with nature, does man escape himself.'" ''The Lost Notebooks'' contains numerous examples of his "creative and sympathetic imagination, even when that creation takes place in the solitude of journals never meant for public eyes."&lt;ref name=Notebook/&gt;

From other reviews: "Eiseley has rightly been called 'the modern [[Thoreau]].'" –''Publishers Weekly;'' "[an] extensive and enlightening glimpses ... into the intellectual and emotional workshop of one of the most original and influential American essayists of this century." –''New York Times Book Review;''  "Eiseley's great genius for the art of the word coupled with a poetic insight into the connection between science and humanism shines through in page after page... This is a book that will be read and quoted and whose pages will grow thin with wear from hands in continued search of new meaning within its words and images." –''Los Angeles Times;''  "it will enhance any dedicated reader's knowledge of this most remarkable literary naturalist... They provide more than a glimpse into Eiseley's mind and imagination." –''The Bloomsbury Review;''   "It is a joy, like finding a lost Rembrandt in the attic, to discover that Eiseley left behind a legacy." –''San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle.''&lt;ref&gt;Book review of ''The Lost Notebooks'' [http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/catalog/productinfo.aspx?id=672121&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 University of Nebraska Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612073946/http://www.nebraskapress.unl.edu/catalog/productinfo.aspx?id=672121&amp;AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1 |date=2011-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical significance ==

===Religion ===
Richard Wentz, professor of religious studies, noted that ''The Christian Century'' magazine called attention to a study of Loren Eiseley by saying: "The religious chord did not sound in him, but he vibrated to many of the concerns historically related to religion." Wentz adds, "Although Eiseley may not have considered his writing as an expression of American spiritually, one feels that he was quite mindful of its religious character. As an heir of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Thoreau]], he is at home among the poets and [[philosopher]]s and among those scientists whose observations also were a form of contemplation of the universe."

But Wentz considered the inherent contradictions in the statements: "We do not really know what to do with religiousness when it expresses itself outside those enclosures which historians and social scientists have carefully labeled religions. What, after all, does it mean to say, "the religious chord does not sound in someone," but that the person vibrates to the concerns historically related to religion? If the person vibrates to such concerns, the chord is religious whether or not it manages to resound in the temples and prayer houses of the devout."&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

Wentz quotes Eiseley, from ''All the Strange Hours'' and ''The Star Thrower'', to indicate that he was, in fact, a religious thinker:

{{quote|I am treading deeper and deeper into leaves and silence. I see more faces watching, non-human faces. Ironically, I who profess no religion find the whole of my life a religious pilgrimage.

The religious forms of the present leave me unmoved. My eye is round, open, and undomesticated as an owl's in a primeval forest -- a world that for me has never truly departed.

Like the toad in my shirt we were in the hands of God, but we could not feel him; he was beyond us, totally and terribly beyond our limited- senses.

Man is not as other creatures and. . . without the sense of the holy, without compassion, his brain can become a gray stalking horror -- the deviser of [[Belsen]].}}

Wentz encompasses such quotes in his partial conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He was indeed a scientist – a bone hunter, he called himself. [[Archaeologist]], [[anthropologist]] and naturalist, he devoted a great deal of time and reflection to the detective work of scientific observation. However, if we are to take seriously his essays, we cannot ignore the evidence of his constant meditation on matters of ultimate order and meaning.&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt; Science writer Connie Barlow says Eiseley wrote eloquent books from a perspective that today would be called [[Religious Naturalism]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metanexus.net/blog/ritualizing-big-history  |title=Ritualizing Big History March 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Evolution===
Wentz writes, "Loren Eiseley is very much in the tradition of [[Henry David Thoreau]]. He takes the circumstances of whatever "business" he is about as the occasion for new questioning, new searching for some sign, some glimpse into the meaning of the unknown that confronts him at every center of existence." He quotes Eiseley from ''The Star Thrower'', "We are, in actuality, students of that greater order known as nature. It is into nature that man vanishes." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

In comparing Eiseley with Thoreau, he discusses clear similarities in their life and philosophies. He notes that Eiseley was, like Thoreau, a 'spiritual wanderer through the deserts of the modern world.' However, notes Wentz, "Thoreau had left the seclusion of [[Walden Pond]] in order to pace the fields of history, sorting out the artifacts that people had dropped along the way." But "it was those 'fossil thoughts' and 'mindprints' that Eiseley himself explored in his wanderings. These explorations gave depth, a tragic dimension and catharsis to what he called the 'one great drama that concerns us most, the supreme mystery, man.'"&lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

Eiseley's writing often includes his belief that mankind does not have enough evidence to determine exactly how humans came to be. In ''The Immense Journey'', he writes, "…many lines of seeming relatives, rather than merely one, lead to man. It is as though we stood at the heart of a maze and no longer remembered how we had come there." According to Wentz, Eiseley realized that there is nothing below a certain depth that can truly be explained, and quotes Eiseley as saying that there is "nothing to explain the necessity of life, nothing to explain the hunger of the elements to become life . . . ."  and that "the human version of evolutionary events [is] perhaps too simplistic for belief." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===Science and progress===
Eiseley talked about the illusions of science in his book, ''The Firmament of Time'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;A scientist writing around the turn of the century remarked that all of the past generations of men have lived and died in a world of illusion. The unconscious irony in his observation consists in the fact that this man assumed the progress of science to have been so great that a clear vision of the world without illusion was, by his own time, possible. It is needless to add that he wrote before [[Einstein]]... at a time when [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]] was just about to be rediscovered, and before the advances in the study of radioactivity...&lt;ref&gt;Templeton, Robert L. ''Is God the Only Reality?'', Templeton Foundation Press (1994), quoted by, pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wentz noted Eiseley's belief that science may have become misguided in its goals: "Loren Eiseley thought that much of the modern scientific enterprise had removed humanity ever farther from its sense of responsibility to the natural world it had left in order to create an artificial world to satisfy its own insatiable appetites." Interpreting Eiseley's messages, he adds, "It would be well, he tells us, to heed the message of the [[Buddha]], who knew that 'one cannot proceed upon the path of human [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]] until one has made interiorly in one's soul a road into the future.' Spaces within stretch as far as those without." &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

===Purpose for mankind===
"In essay after essay," writes Wentz, "he writes as a [[magus]], a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] master or a [[shaman]] who has seen into the very heart of the universe and shares his healing vision with those who live in a world of feeble sight. We must learn to see again, he tells us; we must rediscover the true center of the self in the otherness of nature."  &lt;ref name=Wentz/&gt;

==Death and burial==
[[Image:Eiseley-headstone.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Loren Eiseley's headstone in West Laurel Hill Cemetery - "We loved the earth but could not stay"]]
Loren Eiseley died July 9, 1977, of cardiac arrest following surgery at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D00E3DD1F39E334BC4952DFB166838C669EDE |title=Loren Eiseley, Anthropologist, 69; Eloquent Writer on Man and Nature |publisher=Blum, Howard, ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 11, 1977 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in [[West Laurel Hill Cemetery]] in [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania]]. Eiseley's wife, Mabel Langdon Eiseley, died July 27, 1986, and is buried next to him, in the Westlawn section of the cemetery, in Lot 366. The inscription on their headstone reads, "We loved the earth but could not stay", which is a line from his poem ''The Little Treasures''.

A library in the [[Lincoln City Libraries]] [[public library]] system is named after Eiseley.

Loren Eiseley was awarded the Distinguished Nebraskan Award and inducted into the [[Nebraska Hall of Fame]]. A bust of his likeness resides in the [[Nebraska State Capitol]].

==Legacy==
In summarizing some of Eiseley's contributions, the editor of ''The Bloomsbury Review'' wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;There can be no question that Loren Eiseley maintains a place of eminence among nature writers. His extended explorations of human life and mind, set against the backdrop of our own and other universes are like those to be found in every book of nature writing currently available... We now routinely expect our nature writers to leap across the chasm between science, natural history, and poetry with grace and ease. Eiseley made the leap at a time when science was science, and literature was, well, literature... His writing delivered science to nonscientists in the lyrical language of earthly metaphor, irony, simile, and narrative, all paced like a good mystery.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On October 25, 2007, the Governor of Nebraska, [[Dave Heineman]], officially declared that year "The Centennial Year of Loren Eiseley."  In a written proclamation, he encouraged all Nebraskans

&lt;blockquote&gt;to read Loren Eisely's writings and to appreciate in those writings the richness and beauty of his language, his ability to depict the long, slow passage of time and the meaning of the past in the present, his portrayal of the relationships among all living things and his concern for the future.&lt;ref name=proclamation&gt;Heineman, Dave, Governor of Nebraska.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13378">{{Distinguish|Vacuum manifold}}

'''Manifold vacuum''', or '''engine vacuum''' in an [[internal combustion engine]] is the difference in air pressure between the engine's [[Inlet manifold|intake manifold]] and [[Earth's atmosphere]].

Manifold [[vacuum]] is an effect of a [[piston]]'s movement on the [[Stroke (engine)#Induction stroke|induction stroke]] and the [[choked flow]] through a [[throttle]] in the intake manifold of an engine. It is a measure of the amount of restriction of airflow through the engine, and hence of the unused power capacity in the engine. In some engines, the manifold vacuum is also used as an [[Automobile ancillary power|auxiliary power source]] to drive engine accessories and for the [[crankcase ventilation system]].

Manifold vacuum should not be confused with [[venturi effect|venturi vacuum]], which is an effect exploited in [[carburetor]]s to establish a pressure difference roughly proportional to mass airflow and to maintain a somewhat constant [[air/fuel ratio]]. It is also used in light airplanes to provide airflow for pneumatic gyroscopic instruments.

==Overview==
The rate of airflow through an internal combustion engine is an important factor determining the amount of power the engine generates. Most gasoline engines are controlled by limiting that flow with a [[throttle]] that restricts intake airflow, while a [[diesel engine]] is controlled by the amount of fuel supplied to the cylinder, and so has no "throttle" as such. Manifold vacuum is present in all [[naturally aspirated engine]]s that use throttles (including [[carburetor|carbureted]] and [[fuel injection|fuel injected]] [[gasoline engine]]s using the [[Otto cycle]] or the [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] cycle; [[diesel engine]]s do not have throttle plates).

The [[mass flow]] through the engine is the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of the rotation rate of the engine, the [[Engine displacement|displacement]] of the engine, and the density of the intake stream in the intake manifold. In most applications the rotation rate is set by the application (engine speed in a [[vehicle]] or machinery speed in other applications). The displacement is dependent on the engine geometry, which is generally not adjustable while the engine is in use (although a handful of models do have this feature, see [[variable displacement]]). Restricting the input flow reduces the density (and hence pressure) in the intake manifold, reducing the amount of power produced. It is also a major source of engine drag (see [[engine braking]]), as the engine must pump material from the low-pressure intake manifold into the exhaust manifold (at ambient atmospheric pressure).

When the throttle is opened (in a car, the [[Car controls#Pedals|accelerator pedal]] is depressed), ambient air is free to fill the intake manifold, increasing the pressure (filling the vacuum). A [[carburetor]] or [[fuel injection]] system adds fuel to the airflow in the correct proportion, providing energy to the engine. When the throttle is opened all the way, the engine's air induction system is exposed to full atmospheric pressure, and maximum airflow through the engine is achieved. In a naturally aspirated engine, output power is limited by the ambient [[barometric pressure]]. [[Supercharger]]s and [[turbocharger]]s [[Turbocharger#Pressure increase / boost|boost]] manifold pressure above atmospheric pressure.

==Modern developments==
Modern engines use a manifold absolute pressure (abbreviated as ''MAP'') sensor to measure air pressure in the intake manifold. Manifold absolute pressure is one of a multitude of parameters used by the [[engine control unit]] (ECU) to optimize engine operation. It is important to differentiate between absolute and gauge pressure when dealing with certain applications, particularly those that experience changes in elevation during normal operation.  

Motivated by government regulations mandating reduction of fuel consumption (in the USA) or reduction of [[carbon dioxide emissions]] (in Europe), passenger cars and light trucks have been fitted with a variety of technologies (downsized engines; lockup, multi-ratio and [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive transmissions]]; [[variable valve timing]], forced induction, diesel engines, et al.) which render manifold vacuum inadequate or unavailable. Electric vacuum pumps are now commonly used for powering pneumatic accessories.

==Manifold vacuum vs. venturi vacuum==
Manifold vacuum is caused by a different phenomenon than [[venturi effect|venturi vacuum]], which is present inside [[carburetor]]s. Venturi vacuum is caused by the venturi effect which, for fixed ambient conditions (air density and temperature), depends on the total mass flow through the carburetor. In engines that use carburetors, the venturi vacuum is approximately proportional to the total mass flow through the engine (and hence the total power output). As ambient pressure (altitude, weather) or temperature change, the carburetor may need to be adjusted to maintain this relationship.

Manifold pressure may also be "ported". Porting is selecting a location for the pressure tap within the throttle plate's range of motion. Depending on throttle position, a ported pressure tap may be either upstream or downstream of the throttle. As the throttle position changes, a "ported" pressure tap is selectively connected to either manifold pressure or ambient pressure. Antique (pre-[[OBD II#OBD-II|OBD II]]) engines often used ported manifold pressure taps for [[Distributor|ignition distributors]] and [[Vehicle emissions control#Emissions control|emission-control components]].

==Manifold vacuum in cars==
Most [[automobile]]s use four-stroke [[Otto cycle]] engines with multiple [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]]s attached to a single [[inlet manifold]]. During the [[induction stroke]], the piston descends in the cylinder and the [[intake valve]] is open. As the piston descends it effectively increases the volume in the cylinder above it, setting up low pressure. Atmospheric pressure pushes air through the manifold and [[carburetor]] or [[fuel injection|fuel injection system]], where it is mixed with fuel. Because multiple cylinders operate at different times in the engine cycle, there is almost constant pressure difference through the inlet manifold from carburetor to engine.

To control the amount of fuel/air mix entering the engine, a simple [[butterfly valve]] (throttle plate) is generally fitted at the start of the intake manifold (just below the [[carburetor]] in carbureted engines). The butterfly valve is simply a circular disc fitted on a spindle, fitting inside the pipe work. It is connected to the accelerator pedal of the car, and is set to be fully open when the pedal is fully depressed and fully closed when the pedal is released. The butterfly valve often contains a small "idle cutout", a hole that allows small amounts of fuel/air mixture into the engine even when the valve is fully closed, or the carburetor has a separate air bypass with its own idle jet.

If the engine is operating under light or no load and low or closed throttle, there is high manifold vacuum. As the throttle is opened, the engine speed increases rapidly. The engine speed is limited only by the amount of fuel/air mixture that is available in the manifold. Under full throttle and light load, other effects (such as [[valve float]], [[turbulence]] in the cylinders, or [[ignition timing]]) limit engine speed so that the manifold pressure can increase—but in practice, [[parasitic drag]] on the internal walls of the manifold, plus the restrictive nature of the venturi at the heart of the carburetor, means that a low pressure will always be set up as the engine's internal volume exceeds the amount of the air the manifold is capable of delivering.

If the engine is operating under heavy load at wide throttle openings (such as accelerating from a stop or pulling the car up a hill) then engine speed is limited by the load and minimal vacuum will be created. Engine speed is low but the butterfly valve is fully open. Since the pistons are descending more slowly than under no load, the pressure differences are less marked and parasitic drag in the induction system is negligible. The engine pulls air into the cylinders at the full ambient pressure.

More vacuum is created in some situations. On deceleration or when descending a hill, the throttle will be closed and a low gear selected to control speed. The engine will be rotating fast because the road wheels and transmission are moving quickly, but the butterfly valve will be fully closed. The flow of air through the engine is strongly restricted by the throttle, producing a strong vacuum on the engine side of the butterfly valve which will tend to limit the speed of the engine. This phenomenon, known as [[engine braking]], is used to prevent acceleration or even to slow down with minimal or no brake usage (as when descending a long or steep hill). This vacuum braking should not be confused with [[Compression release engine brake|compression braking]] (aka a "[[Jake brake]]"), or with [[exhaust brake|exhaust braking]], which are often used on large diesel trucks. Such devices are necessary for engine braking with a diesel as they lack a throttle to restrict the air flow enough to create sufficient vacuum to brake a vehicle.

===Uses of manifold vacuum===
[[File:1929-AEC-Regal-UU6646.jpg|thumb|Autovac fuel lifters. On both buses the red Autovac tank can be seen above and behind the left front wheel.]]
This low (or negative) pressure can be put to uses. A [[pressure gauge]] measuring the manifold pressure can be fitted to give the driver an indication of how hard the engine is working and it can be used to achieve maximum momentary fuel efficiency by adjusting driving habits: minimizing manifold vacuum increases momentary efficiency{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed; source with implementation preferred. Low manifold vacuum may indicate wide open throttle, not high efficiency|date=February 2016}}. A weak manifold vacuum under closed-throttle conditions shows that the butterfly valve or internal components of the engine ([[Poppet valve|valves]] or [[piston ring]]s) are worn, preventing good pumping action by the engine and reducing overall efficiency.

Vacuum is often used to [[Automobile accessory power|drive auxiliary systems]] on the vehicle. [[Vacuum servo|Vacuum-assist brake servos]], for example, use atmospheric pressure pressing against the engine manifold vacuum to increase pressure on the brakes. Since braking is nearly always accompanied by the closing of the throttle and associated high manifold vacuum, this system is simple and almost [[Idiot proof|foolproof]]. Vacuum tanks were installed on trailers to control their integrated braking systems.

Prior to the introduction of [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards]] in the USA by the [[National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act]] of 1966, it was common to use manifold vacuum to drive [[windscreen wiper]]s with a pneumatic motor. This system was cheap &amp; simple but resulted in the comical yet unsafe effect of wipers which operate at full speed while the engine idles, operate around half speed while cruising, and stop altogether when the driver depresses the pedal fully. Vehicle [[HVAC]] systems also used manifold vacuum to drive actuators controlling airflow and temperature.

Another obsolete accessory is the "Autovac" fuel lifter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autovac.co.uk/ autovac.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; which uses vacuum to raise fuel from the main tank to a small auxiliary tank, from which it flows by gravity to the carburetor. This eliminated the fuel pump which, in early cars, was an unreliable item.

===Manifold vacuum in diesel engines===
Many [[diesel engine]]s do not have butterfly valve throttles. The manifold is connected directly to the air intake and the only suction created is that caused by the descending piston with no venturi to increase it, and the engine power is controlled by varying the amount of fuel that is injected into the cylinder by a [[fuel injection]] system. This assists in making diesels much more efficient than petrol engines.

If vacuum is required (vehicles that can be fitted with both petrol and diesel engines often have systems requiring it), a butterfly valve connected to the throttle can be fitted to the manifold. This reduces efficiency and is still not as effective as it is not connected to a venturi. Since low-pressure is only created on the overrun (such as when descending hills with a closed throttle), not over a wide range of situations as in a petrol engine, a vacuum tank is fitted.

Most diesel engines now have a separate vacuum pump ("exhauster") fitted to provide vacuum at all times, at all engine speeds.

Many new [[BMW]] petrol engines do not use a throttle in normal running, but instead use "[[Valvetronic]]" variable-lift intake valves to control the amount of air entering the engine. Like a diesel engine, manifold vacuum is practically non-existent in these engines and a different source must be utilised to power the brake servo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8215">The idea that there are specific '''marine counterparts to land creatures''',&lt;ref&gt;Succinctly expressed by [[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], "It used to be a common belief that everything on the earth had its counterpart in the sea" ([[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], Kenneth Frazier, ''Bestiary: Being a Translation of a Latin Bestiary of the Twelfth Century'' (London, 1954), reissued as ''The Book of Beasts'' 1960:250ff).&lt;/ref&gt; inherited from the writers on [[natural history]] in [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]], was firmly believed in [[Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;See Hasan M. El-Shamy, ''Folk traditions of the Arab world: a guide to motif classification'', 1995, under F133.1, Marine counterpart to land.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Medieval Europe]], and is exemplified by the creatures represented in the medieval animal encyclopedias called [[Bestiary|bestiaries]] and in the parallels drawn in the moralising attributes attached to each. "The creation was a mathematical diagram drawn in parallel lines," T. H. White said a propos the bestiary he translated. "Things did not only have a moral they often had physical counterparts in other strata. There was a horse in the land and a sea-horse in the sea. For that matter there was probably a [[Pegasus]] in heaven".&lt;ref&gt;T.H. White, ''op. cit'' p 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of perfect analogies in the fauna of land and sea was considered part of the perfect [[symmetry]]&lt;ref&gt;The "perfection" of symmetry was an idea highly developed in the [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean tradition]].&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Creator_deity|Creator]]'s plan, offered as the "[[book of nature]]" to mankind, for which a text could be found in ''[[Book of Job|Job]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you. Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this? In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Job 12:7–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea appears in the Jewish Tannaic sources as well, as brought down in Babylonian Talmud, Chulin 127a. Rashi (Psalms 49:2) traces this to a biblical source – the land is referred to as "Chaled", from the weasel (chulda), because the weasel is the only animal on dry land that does not have its counterpart in the sea.
 
All of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] was considered to reflect the Creator, and Man could learn about the Creator through studying the Creation, an assumption that underlies the "[[watchmaker analogy]]" offered as a proof of God's existence.

The correspondence between the realms of earth and sea, extending to its denizens, offers examples of the taste for [[allegory]] engendered by Christian and Islamic methods of [[exegesis]], which also encouraged the [[doctrine of signatures]], a "key" to the meaning and use of herbs.

The source text that was most influential in compiling the bestiaries of the 12th and 13th centuries was the ''[[Physiologus]]'', one of the most widely read and copied secular texts of the Middle Ages. Written in Greek in Alexandria the 2nd century CE and accumulating further "exemplary" beasts in the next three centuries and more, ''Physiologus'' was transmitted in the West in Latin, and eventually translated into many vernacular languages: many manuscripts in various languages survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestiary.ca/intro.htm David Badke, "The Medieval Bestiary: Introduction"]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the Characteristics of Animals'' (A. F. Scholfield, in [[Loeb Classical Library]], 1958).

Christian writers, trained in [[Anagoge|anagogical thinking]] and expecting to find spiritual instruction inherent in the processes of Nature, disregarded the caveat in [[Pliny's Natural History]],&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Naturalis''IX.2.&lt;/ref&gt; where the idea is presented as a "vulgar opinion": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hence it is that the vulgar notion may very possibly be true, that whatever is produced in any other department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well; while, at the same time, many other productions are there to be found which nowhere else exist. That there are to be found in the sea the forms, not only of terrestrial animals, but of inanimate objects even, is easily to be understood by all who will take the trouble to examine the grape-fish, the sword-fish, the sawfish, and the cucumber-fish, which last so strongly resembles the real cucumber both in colour and in smell.&lt;ref&gt;Translation of [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] points out that many more things are found in the sea than on the land, and also mentions the correspondences that may be discovered between many non-living objects of the land and living creatures in the sea. 

Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] reasons based on [[analogy]], that since there is a serpent in the grass, there must be an eel in the sea; because there is a [[Leviathan]] in the sea, there must be a [[Behemoth]] on the land. (''City of God''? xi.15?)

&lt;!--this doctrine doesn't appear in the on-line translation of excerpts:[[Isidore of Seville]]'s encyclopedic ''Etymologiae'',&lt;ref&gt;''Etymologiae'' XII?&lt;/ref&gt; contained a section about animals, derived from Classical authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]].--&gt; 
The reaction to such anagogical thinking set in with the unfolding of critical [[Scientific thinking|scientific thought]] in the 17th century. Sir [[Thomas Browne]] devoted a chapter of his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' to dispelling such a belief: Chapter XXIV: "That all Animals in the land are in their kinde&lt;!--kinde in original--&gt; in the Sea."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo324.html On-line text].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] the ancient conception was given an innovative and rationalized cast by [[Benoît de Maillet]] in describing the transformations and metamorphoses undergone by creatures of the sea to render them fit for life on land, a proto-evolutionist concept, though it was based on superficial morphological similarities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are in the Sea, Fish of almost all the Figures of Land-Animals, and even of Birds. She includes Plants, Flowers, and some Fruits; the Nettle, the Rose, the [[Dianthus|Pink]], the Melon and the Grape, are to be found there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the Quadrupeds, we not only find in the Sea, Species of the same Figure and Inclinations, and in the Waves living on the same Aliments by which they are nourished on Land, we have also Examples of those Species living equally in the Air and in the Water. Have not the Sea-Apes precisely the same figure with those of the Land?&lt;ref&gt;Maillet, ''Telliamed'': "Sixth Day: Origin of Man and Animals"; this and several further passages are quoted in Mary Efrosini Gregory, ''Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought'' :22f., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' Ishmael, with a nod to Sir Thomas Browne's wording, denies the claim that land animals find their counterparts in the sea,&lt;blockquote&gt;For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Moby-Dick'', ch. 58 "Brit".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
in discussing [[dolphin]]s trained to aid scuba divers, a 1967 ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' article could still casually state: "It's hoped that the marine counterparts of some land animals can be trained to become useful members of the [[SEALAB (United States Navy)|Man-in-the-Sea program]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Stimson, "Lifeguards: Friendly dolphins— the mammals with the high IQ— are being trained for undersea rescue missions", ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7392">A '''metasystem transition''' is the [[emergence]], through [[evolution]], of a higher [[:wikt:level|level]] of [[organization]] or [[Control theory|control]].

A [[metasystem]] is formed by the integration of a number of initially independent components, such as [[molecules]] (as theorized for instance by [[Hypercycle_(chemistry)|hypercycles]]), [[cell (biology)|cells]], or individuals, and the emergence of a system steering or controlling their interactions. As such, the collective of components becomes a new, goal-directed [[individual]], capable of acting in a coordinated way. This metasystem is more [[Complex systems|complex]], more [[intelligent]], and more flexible in its actions than the initial component systems. Prime examples are the [[origin of life]], the transition from unicellular to [[multicellular]] organisms, the emergence of [[eusociality]] or [[symbol]]ic [[thought]]. 

The concept of metasystem transition was introduced by the cybernetician [[Valentin Turchin]] in his 1970 book ''The Phenomenon of Science'', and developed among others by [[Francis Heylighen]] in the [[Principia Cybernetica]] Project. The related notion of [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|evolutionary transition]] was proposed by the biologists [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[Eörs Szathmáry]], in their 1995 book ''[[The Major Transitions in Evolution]]''.&lt;ref name="Major Transition"&gt;Smith, J. M., &amp; Szathmary, E. (1997). ''The Major Transitions in Evolution''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Another related idea, that systems ("operators") evolve to become more complex by successive closures encapsulating components in a larger whole, is proposed in "[[the operator theory]]", developed by Gerard Jagers op Akkerhuis.

Turchin has applied the concept of metasystem transition in the domain of computing, via the notion of [[metacompilation]] or supercompilation. A supercompiler is a compiler program that compiles its own code, thus increasing its own efficiency, producing a remarkable speedup in its execution.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Evolutionary quanta ==

The following is the classical sequence of metasystem transitions in the history of animal evolution according to Turchin, from the origin of [[animal|animate]] life to [[sapience|sapient]] culture:

#''' Control of Position = [[motility|Motion]]''': the animal or agent develops the ability to control its position in space
# '''Control of Motion = [[sentience|Irritability]]''': the movement of the agent is no longer given, but a reaction to elementary sensations or stimuli
# '''Control of Irritability = [[Reflex]]''': different elementary sensations and their resulting actions are integrated into a coordinated, but still rigid, reflex-like behavior
# '''Control of Reflex = [[Association (psychology)|Association]]''': behavioral routines become flexible or adaptive, through the learning of new associations between experienced stimuli and actions
# '''Control of Association = [[Thought]]''': new routines no longer need to be learned through experience; they can be developed by abstract, symbolic [[reasoning]]
# '''Control of Thought = [[Culture]]''': symbols and concepts are no longer fixed entities; they  adapt through a process of [[cultural evolution]]

[[File:Major Evolutionary Transitions digital.jpg|thumb|340px|Schematic timeline of information and replicators in the biosphere: [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|major evolutionary transitions]] in information processing&lt;ref name=" InfoBiosphere2016"/&gt;]]

Many{{who|date=December 2016}} argue that the next human metasystem transition consists of a merger of biological metasystems with technological metasystems, especially information processing technology. Several [[The Major Transitions in Evolution|cumulative major transitions of evolution]] have transformed life through key innovations in information storage and replication, including [[RNA]], [[DNA]], [[multicellularity]], and also [[language]] and [[culture]] as inter-human information processing systems.&lt;ref name="Major Transition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jablonka, E., &amp; Szathmáry, E. (1995). The evolution of information storage and heredity. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution, 10(5), 206–211. http://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(00)89060-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szathmáry, E. (2015).

"Digital information has reached a similar magnitude to information in the biosphere... Like previous evolutionary transitions, the potential symbiosis between biological and digital information will reach a critical point where these codes could compete via natural selection. Alternatively, this fusion could create a higher-level superorganism employing a low-conflict division of labor in performing informational tasks... humans already embrace fusions of biology and technology. We spend most of our waking time communicating through digitally mediated channels, ...most transactions on the stock market are executed by automated trading algorithms, and our electric grids are in the hands of artificial intelligence. With one in three marriages in America beginning online, digital algorithms are also taking a role in human pair bonding and reproduction".&lt;ref name="InfoBiosphere2016"&gt;[http://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2015.12.013 "Information in the Biosphere: Biological and Digital Worlds"], Gillings, M.

[[File:Table of Natural History, Cyclopaedia, Volume 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Tables of natural history, from [[Ephraim Chambers]]'s 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]
'''Natural history''' is a domain of inquiry involving [[organism]]s including [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]] and [[plant]]s in their environment; leaning more towards [[observation]]al than [[experiment]]al methods of study. A person who studies natural history is called a '''naturalist''' or '''natural historian'''.

Natural history encompasses [[Scientific method|scientific research]] but is not limited to it.&lt;ref&gt;With ''natural history'' articles more often published today in [[List of science magazines|science magazines]] than in [[scientific journal|academic journals]].([http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history Natural History ''WordNet Search, princeton.edu''].&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the systematic study of any category of [[nature|natural]] objects or organisms.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{Citation |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while it dates from studies in the ancient [[Greco-Roman world]] and the [[Muslim Agricultural Revolution|mediaeval Arabic world]], through to European [[Renaissance]] naturalists working in near isolation, today's natural history is a [[cross discipline]] umbrella of many specialty sciences; e.g., [[geobiology]] has a strong multi-disciplinary nature.

==Definitions==
===Before 1900===
The meaning of the English term "natural history" (a [[calque]] of the [[Latin]] ''historia naturalis'') has narrowed progressively with time; while, by contrast, the meaning of the related term "nature" has widened (see also [[#History|History]] below).

In [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]], "natural history" covered essentially anything connected with [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], or which used materials drawn from nature, such as [[Pliny the Elder]]'s [[Natural History (Pliny)|encyclopedia of this title]], published [[circa]] 77 to 79 AD, which covers [[astronomy]], [[geography]], humans and their [[technology]], [[medicine]], and [[superstition]], as well as animals and plants.

Medieval European academics considered knowledge to have two main divisions: the [[humanities]] (primarily what is now known as [[classics]]) and [[divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]], with science studied largely through texts rather than observation or experiment. The study of nature revived in the [[Renaissance]], and quickly became a third branch of academic knowledge, itself divided into descriptive natural history and  [[natural philosophy]], the analytical study of nature. In modern terms, natural philosophy roughly corresponded to modern [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], while natural history included the [[biology|biological]] and [[geology|geological]] sciences. The two were strongly associated. During the heyday of the [[gentleman scientist]]s, many people contributed to both fields, and early papers in both were commonly read at professional [[Academy of Sciences|science society]] meetings such as the [[Royal Society]] and the [[French Academy of Sciences]] – both founded during the seventeenth century.

Natural history had been encouraged by practical motives, such as Linnaeus' aspiration to improve the economic condition of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koerner |first=Lisbet |authorlink=Lisbet Rausing |title=Linnaeus: Nature and Nation |year=1999 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |location=Harvard |isbn=978-0-674-09745-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Industrial Revolution]] prompted the development of geology to help find useful [[mineral]] deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Barnes and Steven Shapin, "Natural order: historical studies of scientific culture", Sage, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1900===
Modern definitions of natural history come from a variety of fields and sources, and many of the modern definitions emphasize a particular aspect of the field, creating a plurality of definitions with a number of common themes among them. For example, while natural history is most often defined as a type of observation and a subject of study, it can also be defined as a body of knowledge, and as a craft or a practice, in which the emphasis is placed more on the observer than on the observed.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lowe Fleischner, ''The Way of Natural History'', Trinity University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lycee Michelet Vanves bibliotheque collection histoire naturelle.jpg|thumb|left|A natural history collection in a French public secondary school]]
Definitions from biologists often focus on the scientific study of individual organisms in their environment, as seen in this definition by Marston Bates: "Natural history is the study of animals and Plants – of organisms. ... I like to think, then, of natural history as the study of life at the level of the individual – of what plants and animals do, how they react to each other and their environment, how they are organized into larger groupings like populations and communities"&lt;ref&gt;Marston Bates, ''The nature of natural history'', Scribners, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; and this more recent definition by D.S. Wilcove and T. Eisner: "The close observation of organisms—their origins, their evolution, their behavior, and their relationships with other species".&lt;ref&gt;D. S Wilcove and T. Eisner, "The impending extinction of natural history," Chronicle of Higher Education 15 (2000): B24&lt;/ref&gt;

This focus on organisms in their environment is also echoed by H.W. Greene and J.B. Losos: "Natural history focuses on where organisms are and what they do in their environment, including interactions with other organisms. It encompasses changes in internal states insofar as they pertain to what organisms do".&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Greene and J. B. Losos, "Systematics, Natural-History, and Conservation – Field Biologists Must Fight a Public-Image Problem," Bioscience 38 (1988): 458–462&lt;/ref&gt;

Some definitions go further, focusing on direct observation of organisms in their environment, both past and present, such as this one by G.A. Bartholomew: "A student of natural history, or a naturalist, studies the world by observing plants and animals directly. Because organisms are functionally inseparable from the environment in which they live and because their structure and function cannot be adequately interpreted without knowing some of their evolutionary history, the study of natural history embraces the study of fossils as well as physiographic and other aspects of the physical environment".&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Bartholomew, "The Role of Natural History in Contemporary Biology", Bioscience 36 (1986): 324–329&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread in many definitions of natural history is the inclusion of a descriptive component, as seen in a recent definition by H.W. Greene: "Descriptive ecology and ethology".&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Greene, "Organisms in nature as a central focus for biology", Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 20 (2005):23–27&lt;/ref&gt; Several authors have argued for a more expansive view of natural history, including S. Herman, who defines the field as "the scientific study of plants and animals in their natural environments. It is concerned with levels of organization from the individual organism to the ecosystem, and stresses identification, life history, distribution, abundance, and inter-relationships.

It often and appropriately includes an esthetic component",&lt;ref&gt;S. G Herman, "Wildlife biology and natural history: time for a reunion", The Journal of wildlife management 66, no. 4 (2002): 933–946&lt;/ref&gt; and T. Fleischner, who defines the field even more broadly, as "A practice of intentional, focused attentiveness and receptivity to the more-than-human world, guided by honesty and accuracy".&lt;ref&gt;T. L. Fleischner, "Natural history and the spiral of offering", Wild Earth 11, no. 3/4 (2002): 10–13&lt;/ref&gt; These definitions explicitly include the arts in the field of natural history, and are aligned with the broad definition outlined by B. Lopez, who defines the field as the "Patient interrogation of a landscape" while referring to the natural history knowledge of the Eskimo ([[Inuit]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barry Lopez, ''Arctic Dreams'', Vintage, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

A slightly different framework for natural history, covering a similar range of themes, is also implied in the scope of work encompassed by many leading [[natural history museum]]s, which often include elements of anthropology, geology, paleontology and astronomy along with botany and zoology,&lt;ref&gt;American Museum of Natural History, [http://www.amnh.org/about/ Mission Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604145807/http://www.amnh.org/about/ |date=2011-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field Museum, [http://fieldmuseum.org/about/mission Mission Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103185243/http://fieldmuseum.org/about/mission |date=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or include both cultural and natural components of the world.&lt;ref&gt;The Natural History Museum, [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/index.html Mission Statement]&lt;/ref&gt;

The plurality of definitions for this field has been recognized as both a weakness and a strength, and a range of definitions have recently been offered by practitioners in a recent collection of views on natural history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://declinetorebirth.org/conversations/an-accepted-way-of-viewing-art An Accepted Way of Viewing Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times===
[[File:ViennaDioscoridesPlant.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Blackberry]] from the 6th century ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'' manuscript]]
Natural history begins with [[Aristotle]] and other ancient philosophers who analyzed the diversity of the natural world. Natural history was understood by [[Pliny the Elder]] to cover anything that could be found in the world, including living things, geology, astronomy, technology, art and humanity.&lt;ref name=Pliny&gt;{{cite book | title=Natural History: A Selection | publisher=Penguin Classics | author=Pliny the Elder | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-14-044413-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' was written between 50 and 70 AD by [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], a Roman physician of Greek origin. It was widely read for more than 1,500 years until supplanted in the [[Renaissance]], making it one of the longest-lasting of all natural history books.

From the [[ancient Greeks]] until the work of [[Carl Linnaeus]] and other 18th century naturalists, a major concept of natural history was the ''scala naturae'' or [[Great Chain of Being]], an arrangement of minerals, vegetables, more primitive forms of animals, and more complex life forms on a linear scale of supposedly increasing perfection, culminating in our species.&lt;ref name=Lovejoy1964&gt;{{citation |date=1964 | origyear=1936 |author=Arthur O. Lovejoy |authorlink=Arthur Oncken Lovejoy |title=The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5u3HZjTpkTgC |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-36153-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
Natural history was basically static through the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe – although in the [[Arabic]] and [[Oriental]] world it proceeded at a much brisker pace. From the thirteenth century, the work of Aristotle was adapted rather rigidly into [[Christian philosophy]], particularly by [[Thomas Aquinas]], forming the basis for [[natural theology]]. During the Renaissance, scholars (herbalists and humanists, particularly) returned to direct observation of plants and animals for natural history, and many began to accumulate large collections of exotic specimens and unusual [[monster]]s. [[Leonhart Fuchs]] was one of the three founding fathers of botany, along with [[Otto Brunfels]] and [[Hieronymus Bock]]. Other important contributors to the field were [[Valerius Cordus]], [[Konrad Gesner]] (''[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|Historiae animalium]]''), [[Frederik Ruysch]], or [[Gaspard Bauhin]].&lt;ref name="natural"&gt;"[http://www.historyofscience.com/G2I/timeline/index.php?category=Natural+History Natural History Timeline]". HistoryofScience.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid increase in the number of known organisms prompted many attempts at classifying and organizing species into [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic groups]], culminating in the system of the Swedish naturalist [[Carl Linnaeus]].&lt;ref name="natural"/&gt;

===Birth of scientific biology===&lt;!--off topic? Biology isn't NH--&gt;
[[File:Buffon 1707-1788.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Georges Buffon]] is best remembered for his ''[[Histoire naturelle]]'', a 44 volume encyclopedia describing quadrupeds, birds, minerals and some science and technology. Reptiles and fish were covered in supplements by [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]].]]&lt;!--not discussed in text, no refs!--&gt;
A significant contribution to English natural history was made by [[parson-naturalist]]s such as [[Gilbert White]], [[William Kirby (entomologist)|William Kirby]], [[John George Wood]], and [[John Ray]], who wrote about plants, animals, and other aspects of nature. Many of these men wrote about nature to make the [[natural theology]] argument for the existence or goodness of God.&lt;ref name="Armstrong2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Patrick Armstrong|title=The English Parson-naturalist: A Companionship Between Science and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hB0hEc4CN3wC|accessdate=31 March 2013|year=2000|publisher=Gracewing Publishing|isbn=978-0-85244-516-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern [[Europe]], professional disciplines such as botany, geology, [[mycology]], [[palaeontology]], [[physiology]] and [[zoology]] were formed. ''Natural history'', formerly the main subject taught by college science professors, was increasingly scorned by scientists of a more specialized manner and relegated to an "amateur" activity, rather than a part of science proper. In Victorian Scotland it was believed that the study of natural history contributed to good mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences |title='An aid to mental health': natural history, alienists and therapeutics in Victorian Scotland| author=Finnegan, Diarmid A. |year=2008 |volume=39 |pages=326–337 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2008.06.006| pmid=18761284| issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly in Britain and the United States, this grew into specialist hobbies such as the [[Ornithology|study of birds]], butterflies, seashells ([[malacology]]/[[conchology]]), beetles and wildflowers; meanwhile, scientists tried to define a unified discipline of biology (though with only partial success, at least until the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]]). Still, the traditions of natural history continue to play a part in the study of biology, especially ecology (the study of natural systems involving living organisms and the inorganic components of the Earth's biosphere that support them), [[ethology]] (the scientific study of animal behavior), and [[evolutionary biology]] (the study of the relationships between life-forms over very long periods of time), and re-emerges today as integrative organismal biology.

Amateur collectors and natural history entrepreneurs played an important role in building the world's large natural history collections, such as the [[Natural History Museum, London]], and the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington D.C.

Three of the greatest English naturalists of the nineteenth century, [[Henry Walter Bates]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]—who all knew each other—each made natural history travels that took years, collected thousands of specimens, many of them new to science, and by their writings both advanced knowledge of "remote" parts of the world—the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Galápagos Islands]], and the [[Malay archipelago]], among others—and in so doing helped to transform biology from a descriptive to a theory based science.

The understanding of "Nature" as "an organism and not as a mechanism" can be traced to the writings of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (Prussia, 1769–1859). Humboldt's copious writings and research were seminal influences for Charles Darwin, [[Simón Bolívar]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], and [[John Muir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Wulf]] (2015),''[[The Invention of Nature]]'', Knopf {{page needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museums==
{{further|List of natural history museums}}
Natural history [[museum]]s, which evolved from [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]], played an important role in the emergence of professional biological disciplines and research programs. Particularly in the 19th century, scientists began to use their natural history collections as teaching tools for advanced students and the basis for their own [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] research.

==Societies==
[[File:Szczecin pomnik Jana Czekanowskiego.jpg|thumb|The monument of [[Jan Czekanowski]], a president of [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]] (1923–1924), in [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]]]]
The term "natural history" alone, or sometimes together with archaeology, forms the name of many national, regional and local natural history societies that maintain records for [[animal]]s (including [[birds]] (ornithology), [[insect]]s ([[entomology]]) and [[mammal]]s (mammalogy)), [[fungi]] ([[mycology]]), plants (botany) and other organisms. They may also have [[geological]] and [[microscope|microscopical]] sections.

Examples of these societies in Britain include the [[Natural History Society of Northumbria]] founded in 1829, [[London]] Natural History Society (1858), [[Birmingham Natural History Society]] (1859), [[British Entomological and Natural History Society]] founded in 1872, [[Glasgow]] Natural History Society, [[Manchester]] Microscopical and Natural History Society established in 1880, Whitby Naturalists' Club founded in 1913,&lt;ref name="whitbynaturalistsclub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitbynaturalists.co.uk |title=Whitby Naturalists' Club |publisher=whitbynaturalists.co.uk |accessdate=January 23, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarborough Field Naturalists' Society and the Sorby Natural History Society, [[Sheffield]], founded in 1918.&lt;ref name="WMBC-Oldest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/older|title=Older Organisations|last=Mabbett|first=Andy|date=20 November 2010|publisher=[[West Midland Bird Club]]|accessdate=11 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523040849/http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/club/older |archivedate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of natural history societies was also spurred due to the growth of British colonies in tropical regions with numerous new species to be discovered. Many [[civil servants]] took an interest in their new surroundings, sending specimens back to museums in [[UK|Britain]]. (See also: [[Indian natural history]])

Societies in other countries include the [[American Society of Naturalists]] and [[Polish Copernicus Society of Naturalists]].

It has been used in various ways such as to relate [[God]] or divinity with concrete things,&lt;ref&gt;Ethical and Religious Thought in Analytic Philosophy of Language by Quentin Smith, 1998, Yale University Press, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; determinism,&lt;ref name="Tillich"&gt;Paul Tillich: Theologian of the Boundaries by [[Paul Tillich]], Mark K. Taylor, Mark Lewis Taylor, Collins, 1987, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; or the substance of the [[Universe]].&lt;ref name="Panentheism"&gt;Panentheism--The Other God of the Philosophers, John W.

==Component definitions==
The term “pantheism" is derived from Greek words ''pan'' (Greek: πᾶν) meaning "all" and ''theos'' (θεός) meaning God. It was coined by [[Joseph Raphson]] in his work ''De spatio reali'', published in 1697.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ann Thomson]]; ''Bodies of Thought: Science, Religion, and the Soul in the Early Enlightenment'', 2008, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced to English by Irish writer [[John Toland]] in his 1705 work ''Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist'' that described pantheism as the "opinion of those who believe in no other eternal being but the universe."&lt;ref name=Toland&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison|first=Paul|title=Toland: the father of modern pantheism|url=http://www.pantheism.net/paul/history/toland.htm|work=Pantheist History|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "naturalistic" derives from the word "[[Naturalism (disambiguation)|naturalism]]", which has several meanings in philosophy and aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;A Dictionary of Philosophy, ed. T. Mautner, Blackwell, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In philosophy the term frequently denotes the view that everything belongs to the world of nature and can be studied with the methods appropriate for studying that world, ''i.e.'' the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Companion to Philosophy, ed. Ted Honderich, Oxford University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; It generally implies an absence of belief in supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;

==Early conceptions==
[[Joseph Needham]], a modern British scholar of Chinese philosophy and science, has identified [[Taoism]] as "a naturalistic pantheism which emphasizes the unity and spontaneity of the operations of Nature."&lt;ref&gt;Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 2, Joseph Needham, Cambridge University Press, 1956, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy can be dated to the late 4th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, Russell. ''Taoism: The Enduring Tradition.'' (London and New York: Routledge, 2004). p. 61. {{ISBN|978-0-415-26321-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hellenistic Greek philosophical school of [[Stoicism]] (which started in the early 3rd century BCE)&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; rejected the [[Mind-body dualism|dualist]] idea of the separate ideal/conscious and material realms, and identified the substance of God with the entire cosmos and heaven.&lt;ref name="Panentheism" /&gt; However, not all philosophers who did so can be classified as naturalistic pantheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=John W.|title=Panentheism: The Other God of the Philosophers: From Plato to the Present|year=2006|publisher=Baker Academic|page=16|quote=Naturalistic pantheism anticipates Bruno, Spinoza, Toland, Einstein (not Schelling, Hegel) defining God in terms of Nature should not be construed as naturalistic pantheism. By "Nature" Eriugena means something like "Reality" rather than the mere physical universe. "But his position is in fact closer to the naturalistic pantheism of ancient Stoicism. The World-Soul is not a higher reality that generates the physical world but the rational causal agent immanent in the world"...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern conceptions==
Naturalistic pantheism was expressed by various thinkers,&lt;ref name=Marvin /&gt; including [[Giordano Bruno]], who was burned at the stake for his views.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, William (prof. of philosophy at the Catholic University), "History of Philosophy", 1903, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 17th century Dutch philosopher Spinoza became particularly known for it.&lt;ref name=Marvin /&gt;

===Baruch Spinoza===
{{Main|Philosophy of Spinoza}}
Possibly drawing upon the ideas of Descartes,&lt;ref&gt;Elements of general philosophy By George Croom Robertson, p. 282
:"The pantheistic element in Descartes’ thought viz. the tendency to conceive the notion of substance in the truest sence as being only One, and the naturalistic element, viz. the tendency to conceive the One Substance of God as Order of Nature, were brought together and set in the front of Spinoza’s thought as the mother-idea of it all…Spinoza’s philosophy remains as yet and is likely to remain, the very type of a Naturalistic Pantheism."&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Spinoza|Baruch Spinoza]] connected God and Nature through the phrase ''deus sive natura'' ("God, or Nature"),&lt;ref&gt;Elements of General Philosophy, George Croom Robertson, John Murray, 1896, p. 282&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold: Between Two Worlds, AJ Lubell, Modern Language Quarterly, 1961, Duke University Press, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Concise Dictionary of Theology by Gerald O'Collins, Edward G. Farrugia, Paulist Press, 2000, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; making him the father of [[classical pantheism]]. He relied upon rationalism rather than the more intuitive approach of some Eastern traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophies of History: Meeting of East and West in Cycle-pattern ... Grace Edith Cairns, 1962
:This attitude is close to that of Spinoza's naturalistic pantheism in the West although Spinoza reached it by the more characteristically Western method, rationalism, versus the intuitive way of the Taoists&lt;/ref&gt;

Spinoza's philosophy, sometimes known as [[Spinozism]], has been understood in a number of ways, and caused disagreements such as the [[Pantheism controversy]]. However, many scholars have considered it to be a form of naturalistic pantheism. This has included viewing the pantheistic unity as natural.&lt;ref name=Pafumi&gt;{{cite book|last=Pafumi|first=G.R.|title=Is Our Vision of God Obsolete|year=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=1441590404|page=153|quote=Spinoza = naturalistic pantheism — universe as a "single, interconnected, and solely natural substance."}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortress Press|author2=Taylor, Mark Kline|quote=Naturalistic pantheism "denies finite freedom" as in Spinoza (as opposed to idealistic type of pantheism which identifies God with the universal essence of being)...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian philosophy, God: being a contribution to a philosophy of theism by John Thomas Driscoll, Benzinger 1904, p. 190
:“In the criticism of his system we meet with the same difficulties that we find in Spinoza, i.e., the nature of the mind and of matter, the character of their interaction and the doctrine of determinism. Both Spinoza and Spencer teach a pure Naturalism … The two theories set forth are phases of Realistic or Naturalistic Pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt;
Spinoza inspired a number of other pantheists, with varying degrees of idealism towards nature.&lt;ref&gt;
Goethe, Nietzsche, And Wagner: Their Spinozan Epics of Love And Power by T. K. Seung, p. 11
:“The second function of the Earth Spirit was to clarify Goethe’s own version of pantheism. With the revival of Spinoza’s philosophy, naturalistic pantheism became a groundswell for the German intellectuals of Goethe’s generation. Although they rejected the other world, many of them subscribed to an idealistic or Romantic view of Nature, which Goethe regarded as an unreal view of reality…”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The five great skeptical dramas of history by John Owen (theologian), 1896, p. 13
:“If he could be said to have owned a master of philosophy it was Spinoza. Of none other does he speak in such terms of commendation … In all probability Spinoza found his greatest disciple on the road to a naturalistic pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt; However, Spinoza's influence in his own time was limited.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Ethics by Adolf Wuttke (theologian), 1876, p. 289, p. 327
:“Spinoza exerted in his own age but little influence. Notwithstanding the deep spiritually-moral declension of that dark period, the religious God-consciousness was as yet too vital to fall in with this naturalistic pantheism.”&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Arnold: Between Two Worlds, AJ Lubell, Modern Language Quarterly, 1961, Duke University Press... Page 5
:"the naturalistic pantheism he then or somewhat later learned from Spinoza"&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have considered Spinoza the founder of a line of naturalistic pantheism, though not necessarily the only one.&lt;ref&gt;Nothingness in the theology of Paul Tillich and Karl Barth by Sung Min Jeong University Press of America, 2003, p. 24
:"Spinoza establishes a naturalistic pantheism. Tillich considers Spinoza’s substance as a category"...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Finger Thomas (prof of religious thought), "Philosophy and religious belief", 1970, p. 92
:"..two forms of pantheism we have distinguished, idealistic monism and naturalistic pantheism. Here we shall consider only the naturalistic pantheism we have been describing, especially that of Spinoza."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;The riddle of the universe by Edward Douglas, London: Fawcett, 1893, p. 30
:"Spinoza carried philosophy into the realms of a naturalistic pantheism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pantheist Movement]], started in 1999, describes Naturalistic Pantheism as including reverence for the universe, [[Philosophical realism|realism]], [[metaphysical naturalism|strong naturalism]], and respect for reason and the scientific method as methods of understanding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is your spiritual home right here on Earth?|url=http://www.pantheism.net|publisher=World Pantheist Movement|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Harrison (pantheist)|Paul Harrison]] considers its position the closest modern equivalent to Toland's.&lt;ref name=Toland /&gt;

He is regarded as one of the founders of modern [[ethology]], the study of animal behavior.

In 1951, he published ''The Study of Instinct'', an influential book on animal behaviour.
In the 1960s, he collaborated with filmmaker [[Hugh Falkus]] on a series of wildlife films, including ''The Riddle of the [[Rook (bird)|Rook]]'' (1972) and ''Signals for Survival'' (1969), which won the Italia prize in that year and the American blue ribbon in 1971.

== Education and early life ==
Born in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, he was one of five children of Dirk Cornelis Tinbergen and his wife Jeannette van Eek. His brother, [[Jan Tinbergen]], won the first [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1969/press.html | title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1969 | publisher=Nobelprize.org | year=1969 | accessdate=27 January 2014 | author=Lundberg, Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the only siblings to each win a Nobel Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/|title=Nobel Prize Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another brother, [[Luuk Tinbergen]] was also a noted biologist.

Tinbergen's interest in nature manifested itself when he was young. He studied [[biology]] at [[Leiden University]] and was a prisoner of war during [[World War II]]. Tinbergen's experience as a prisoner of the Nazis led to some friction with longtime intellectual collaborator [[Konrad Lorenz]], and it was several years before the two reconciled.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Nikolaas_Tinbergen.aspx | title=Encyclopedia.com Nikolaas Tinbergen | publisher=Encyclopedia.com | accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Tinbergen moved to England, where he taught at the [[University of Oxford]] and was a fellow first at [[Merton College, Oxford]] and later at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"/&gt; Several of his graduate students went on to become prominent biologists including [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref name=dawkinsphd/&gt; [[Marian Dawkins]],&lt;ref name=stamphd/&gt; [[Desmond Morris]],&lt;ref name=Beale/&gt; [[Iain Douglas-Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daston|first1=Lorraine|last2=Mitman|first2=Gregg|title=Thinking with Animals: New Perspectives on Anthropomorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaX_7w_gZwsC&amp;pg=PT193|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50377-8|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Sinclair (biologist)|Tony Sinclair]].&lt;ref name=serengeti&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinclair |first=Anthony |date=2012 |title=Serengeti Story: Life and Science in the World's Greatest Wildlife Region |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=33 |isbn=9780199645527 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and career==

=== The Study of Instinct ===
[[File:Tinbergen good figure wiki2.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 1. Tinbergen's hierarchical model. Modified from ''The Study of Instinct'' (1951).]]

In 1951 Tinbergen's ''The Study of Instinct'' was published. Behavioural ecologists and evolutionary biologists still recognise the contribution this book offered the field of [[behavioural science]] studies. ''The Study of Instinct'' summarises Tinbergen's ideas on innate behavioural reactions in animals and the adaptiveness and evolutionary aspects of these behaviours. By behaviour, he means the total movements made by the intact animal; innate behaviour is that which is not changed by the learning process. The major question of the book is the role of internal and external stimuli in controlling the expression of behaviour.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"&gt;Hinde, R. A. ''Ethological Models and the Concept of 'Drive'''. British Journal of the Philosophy of Science, 6, 321–331 (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, he was interested in explaining 'spontaneous' behaviours: those that occurred in their complete form the first time they were performed and that seemed resistant to the effects of learning.  He explains how behaviour can be considered a combination of these spontaneous behaviour patterns and as set series of reactions to particular stimuli. Behaviour is a reaction in that to a certain extent it is reliant on external stimuli, however it is also spontaneous since it is also dependent upon internal causal factors.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"/&gt;

His model for how certain behavioural reactions are provoked was based on work by [[Konrad Lorenz]]. Lorenz postulated that for each instinctive act there is a specific energy which builds up in a reservoir in the brain.  In this model, Lorenz envisioned a reservoir with a spring valve at its base that an appropriate [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] could act on, much like a weight on a scale pan pulling against a spring and releasing the reservoir of energy, an action which would lead an animal to express the desired behaviour.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"/&gt;

Tinbergen added complexity to this model, a model now known as Tinbergen's hierarchical model. He suggested that motivational impulses build up in nervous centres in the brain which are held in check by blocks. The blocks are removed by an innate releasing mechanism that allows the energy to flow to the next centre (each centre containing a block that needs to be removed) in a cascade until the behaviour is expressed. Tinbergen's model shows multiple levels of complexity and that related behaviours are grouped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tinbergen, Nikolaas | year=1951 | title=The Study of Instinct | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=nnn–mmm}}{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is in his experiments with foraging [[honey bees]]. He showed that honey bees show curiosity for yellow and blue paper models of flowers, and suggested that these were visual stimuli causing the buildup of energy in one specific centre. However, the bees rarely landed on the model flowers unless the proper odour was also applied. In this case, the chemical stimuli of the odour allowed the next link in the chain to be released, encouraging the bee to land. The final step was for the bee to insert its mouthparts into the flower and initiate suckling. Tinbergen envisioned this as concluding the reaction set for honey bee feeding behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tinbergen, Nikolaas | year=1951 | title=The Study of Instinct | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=nnn–mmm}}{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nobel Prize ===
In 1973 Tinbergen, along with [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]], were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/&lt;/ref&gt; The award recognised their studies on genetically programmed behaviour patterns, their origins, maturation and their elicitation by key stimuli. In his Nobel Lecture, Tinbergen addressed the somewhat unconventional decision of the Nobel Foundation to award the prize for Physiology or Medicine to three men who had until recently been regarded as "mere animal watchers". Tinbergen stated that their revival of the "watching and wondering" approach to studying behaviour could indeed contribute to the relief of human suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, N. Ethology and stress diseases. Physiology Or Medicine: 1971–1980 19711980, 113 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies performed by the trio on fish, insects and birds laid the foundation for further studies on the importance of specific experiences during critical periods of normal development, as well as the effects of abnormal psychosocial situations in mammals. At the time, these discoveries were stated to have caused "a breakthrough in the understanding of the mechanisms behind various symptoms of psychiatric disease, such as anguish, compulsive obsession, stereotypic behaviour and catatonic posture".&lt;ref&gt;Zetterström, R. The Nobel Prize for the introduction of ethology, or animal behaviour, as a new research field: possible implications for child development and behaviour: Nobel prizes of importance to Paediatrics. Acta Paediatrica 96, 1105–1108 (2007).

&lt;/ref&gt; Tinbergen’s contribution to these studies included the testing of the hypotheses of Lorenz/von Frisch by means of "comprehensive, careful, and ingenious experiments"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/presentation-speech.html |date=1973  |first=Börje |last=Cronholm |title=Award Ceremony Speech |publisher=Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his work on supernormal stimuli. The work of Tinbergen during this time was also regarded as having possible implications for further research in child development and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Zetterström, R.

Acta Paediatrica 96, 1105–1108 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also caused some intrigue by dedicating a large part of his acceptance speech to [[F. Matthias Alexander|FM Alexander]], originator of the [[Alexander technique]], a method which investigates postural reflexes and responses in human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/tinbergen-lecture.pdf|title = Nikolaas Tinbergen Nobel Lecture Ethology and Stress Diseases|date = 12 December 1973|access-date = |publisher = NobelPrize.org|last = Tinbergen|first = Nikolaas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other awards and honours===
In 1950 Tinbergen became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00003350 |title=Niko Tinbergen (1907–1988) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1962|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1962]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; He was also awarded the Godman-Salvin Medal in 1969 by the British Ornithologists' Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bou.org.uk/about-the-bou/administration-and-people/medals-and-awards/|title=Medals and awards "  British Ornithologists' Union|publisher=bou.org.uk|access-date=27 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331172205/https://www.bou.org.uk/about-the-bou/administration-and-people/medals-and-awards/|archivedate=31 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 received the Swammderdam Medal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gngh.uva.nl/onderscheidingen/swammerdam-medaille/swammerdam-medaille.html|title=Swammerdam medaille – GNGH – Universiteit van Amsterdam|last=Amsterdam|first=Universiteit van|website=gngh.uva.nl|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilhelm Bölsche Medal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life of David Lack: Father of Evolutionary Ecology|last=Anderson|first=Ted|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=0199922659|location=Oxford|pages=185|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from the Genootschap ter bervordering van Natuur-, Genees- en Heelkunde of the University of Amsterdam and the Kosmos-Gesellschaft der Naturfreunde respectively).

=== Approach to animal behaviour ===
{{main article|Tinbergen's four questions}}

Tinbergen described four questions he believed should be asked of any animal behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;Diagram on [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Nesse-Tinbergen4Q.PDF The Four Areas of Biology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further Diagrams on [http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/inhalt.html The Four Areas of Biology (Documents No. 5, 6 and 7 in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lorenz | first1 = K. | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1937.tb01401.x | title = Biologische Fragestellung in der Tierpsychologie | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 1 | pages = 24–32 | year = 1937}} (in English: Biological Questions in Animal Psychology).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = N. | authorlink = Nikolaas Tinbergen| title = On aims and methods of Ethology | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 410–433 | year = 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were:

# [[Causality|Causation]] (mechanism): what are the stimuli that elicit the response, and how has it been modified by recent [[learning]]? How do behaviour and psyche "function" on the molecular, physiological, neuro-ethological, cognitive and social level, and what do the relations between the levels look like? (compare: [[Nicolai Hartmann]]: "The laws about the levels of complexity")
# [[Developmental biology|Development]] ([[ontogeny]]): how does the behaviour change with age, and what early experiences are necessary for the behaviour to be shown? Which developmental steps (the ontogenesis follows an "inner plan") ''and'' which environmental factors play when / which role? (compare: [[Recapitulation theory]])
# Function ([[adaptation]]): how does the [[behaviour]] impact on the animal's chances of survival and reproduction?
# [[Evolution]] ([[phylogeny]]): how does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related [[species]], and how might it have arisen through the process of phylogeny? Why did structural associations (behaviour can be seen as a "time space structure") evolve in this manner and not otherwise?*

In [[ethology]] and [[sociobiology]], causation and ontogeny are summarised as the "proximate mechanisms", while [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] and [[phylogeny]] are the "ultimate mechanisms". They are still considered as the cornerstone of modern ethology, sociobiology and [[transdisciplinarity]] in Human Sciences.

=== Supernormal stimulus ===
A major body of Tinbergen's research focused on what he termed the [[supernormal stimulus]]. This was the concept that one could build an artificial object which was a stronger stimulus or releaser for an instinct than the object for which the instinct originally evolved.  He constructed plaster eggs to see which a bird preferred to sit on, finding that they would select those that were larger, had more defined markings, or more saturated colour—and a dayglo-bright one with black polka dots would be selected over the bird's own pale, dappled eggs.

Tinbergen found that territorial male [[three-spined stickleback]] (a small freshwater fish) would attack a wooden fish model more vigorously than a real male if its underside was redder. He constructed cardboard dummy butterflies with more defined markings that male butterflies would try to mate with in preference to real females. The superstimulus, by its exaggerations, clearly delineated what characteristics were eliciting the instinctual response.

Among the modern works calling attention to Tinbergen's classic work is [[Deirdre Barrett]]'s 2010 book, ''[[Supernormal Stimuli]]''.

=== Autism ===
Tinbergen applied his observational methods to the problems of [[autism spectrum|autistic]] children.

== Personal life ==
Tinbergen was a member of the advisory committee to the [[Anti-Concorde Project]]{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and was also an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supernormal Stimuli: How Primal Urges Overran Their Evolutionary Purpose|year=2010|publisher=W.

Tinbergen married Elisabeth Rutten and they had five children. Later in life he suffered [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and feared he might, like his brother Luuk, commit suicide. He was treated by his friend, whose ideas he had greatly influenced, [[John Bowlby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Der Horst | first1 = F. C.

'''''Path of the Puma: The Remarkable Resilience of the Mountain Lion''''', by Jim Williams, is a non-fiction book presenting the research of the author, a [[wildlife biologist]] and supervisor for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks' Region 1 in [[Kalispell, Montana|Kalispell]]. Williams also discusses [[DNA]] research conducted by others on these animals, and makes the case for coexistence with these big, wild cats

== Synopsis ==
[[File:Jim WIlliams author photo.jpg|thumb|left|Author Jim Williams]]
With a foreword by [[Douglas H. Chadwick|Doug Chadwick]], the book chronicles Williams' journey, from his early work at a Florida marine park, to his conversion to "a lifelong devotee of the species".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Williams has fitted [[Puma (genus)|pumas]] (also known as cougars and mountain lions) with [[Tracking collar|radio collars]] and has installed cameras in their caves to track and study them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/reviews/single/9781938340727|title=Nonfiction Book Review: Path of the Puma: The Remarkable Resilience of the Mountain Lion|last=|first=|date=6 August 2018|work=Publishers Weekly|access-date=2 September 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1 September 2018|title=Path of the Puma: the Remarkable Resilience of the Mountain Lion|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jim-williams/path-of-the-puma/|journal=Kirkus Reviews|volume=|pages=|isbn=978-1-938340-72-7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Publishers Weekly|''Publishers Weekly'']] wrote, "Montana-based wildlife biologist Jim Williams celebrates wildlife research and conservation of ghost cats from Canada’s [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]] to [[Tierra del Fuego]] in Argentina and Chile..."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Critical reception ==

''Path of the Puma'' has received positive reviews. ''Publishers Weekly'' said, "Williams writes movingly of the challenges these animals face, many due to human encroachment on their habitats. He makes a strong case for the necessity of preserving—or at least peacefully coexisting with—the puma."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Kirkus Reviews|''Kirkus Reviews'']] noted, "While the book is an undisguised conservationist’s plea ... it is not a harangue. The author’s passion and his firsthand knowledge of his subject make the narrative highly readable. A noteworthy feature of this work is the presence of numerous full-color photographs..."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kirkus concluded, "A handsome book that is well-balanced, instructive, and authoritative."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Natural History Book Service wrote that the puma's story, "...is fascinating for the lessons it can afford the protection of all species in times of dire challenge and decline."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhbs.com/path-of-the-puma-book|title=Path of the Puma: The Remarkable Resilience of the Mountain Lion|website=www.nhbs.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Waggoner of [[PressReader]] notes Williams' "...enthusiasm for nature and animals jumps off every page... Williams’s writing is expert, friendly, and interesting. Well organized and clearly presented, information emerges from field work examples, such as the tracking studies that showed that pumas feed almost exclusively on wild prey rather than domestic herds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/usa/foreword-reviews/20180814/282746292607191|title=Path of the Puma|last=Waggoner|first=Susan|date=14 August 2018|website=www.pressreader.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tristan Scott of the Flathead Beacon wrote, "''Path of the Puma'' doesn’t sugarcoat the risks of predators living among humans — mountain lions live at the intersection of human landscapes, livelihoods and lifestyles — but it points out the critical role predatory species play in the natural world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://flatheadbeacon.com/2018/08/31/pursuing-the-puma/|title=Pursuing the Puma - Flathead Beacon|last=Scott|first=Tristan|date=31 August 2018|work=Flathead Beacon|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Primary energy''' ('''PE''') is an [[energy]] form found in nature that has not been subjected to any [[energy engineering|human engineered]] conversion process. It is energy contained in raw [[fuel|fuels]], and other forms of energy received as input to a [[system]]. Primary energy can be [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] or [[renewable energy|renewable]].

Where primary energy is used to describe fossil fuels, the [[embodied energy]] of the fuel is available as thermal energy and around 70% is typically lost in conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. There is a similar 60-80% conversion loss when solar and wind energy is converted to electricity, but today's UN conventions on energy statistics counts the electricity made from wind and solar as the primary energy itself for these sources. One consequence of this counting method is that the contribution of wind and solar energy is under reported compared to fossil energy sources, and there is hence an international debate on how to count primary energy from wind and solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauar|first1=Erik|title=IEA underreports contribution solar and wind by a factor of three compared to fossil fuels|url=http://energypost.eu/iea-underreports-contribution-solar-wind-factor-three-compared-fossil-fuels/|website=energypost.eu|publisher=Energy Post|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Total primary energy supply''' ('''TPES''') is the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/06/01/01/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2ffactbook-2013-41-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f18147364&amp;accessItemIds=|title=OECD Factbook 2013: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics|year=2013|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of primary energy is used in [[energy distance|energy statistics]] in the compilation of [[energy accounting|energy balances]], as well as in the field of [[energetics]]. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of [[energy carrier|energy carriers]] used by human society.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giampietro |first1=Mario |last2=Mayumi |first2=Kozo |title=The Biofuel Delusion: The Fallacy of Large Scale Agro-Biofuels Production |publisher=Earthscan, Taylor &amp; Francis group |year=2009 |pages=336 |isbn=978-1-84407-681-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary energy''' is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source.

The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

PE and TPES are better defined in the context of [[worldwide energy supply]].

==Examples of sources==
Primary energy sources should not be confused with the [[energy system]] components (or conversion processes) through which they are converted into energy carriers.

In certain situations, the use of resources by human society is performed at a much higher rate than the minimum rate at which it can be geophysically renewed.

==Usable energy==
{{main|exergy}}
[[File:Different energy forms (PES).png|thumb|Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers.]]
Primary energy sources are transformed in [[energy conversion]] processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as [[electrical energy]], refined [[fuels]], or synthetic fuels such as [[hydrogen fuel]]. In the field of [[energetics]], these forms are called [[energy carrier]]s and correspond to the concept of "secondary energy" in energy statistics.

===Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)===
Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. [[District heating]] is another example of secondary energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference   U.S. EPA Energy STAR] Retrieved 2017-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009" /&gt;

[[Thermal efficiency|Conversion efficiency]] varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by [[Carnot's theorem]], and generates a lot of [[waste heat]]. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind's energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the [[exergy]] of a system.

===Site and source energy===
Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity). Site energy is measured at the campus, building, or sub-building level and is the basis for energy charges on utility bills.&lt;ref name="NRCan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring energy: site energy vs. source energy in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/buildings/energy-benchmarking/update/getready/19453|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torcellini|first=Paul|last2=Pless|first2=Shanti|last3=Deru|first3=Michael|last4=Crawley|first4=Drury|date=June 2006|title=Zero energy buildings: a critical look at the definition|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf|journal=ACEEE Summer Study|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory/U.S. Department of Energy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements.&lt;ref name="NRCan" /&gt; For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Energy vs Source Energy|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/energy/content/site-energy-vs-source-energy|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure.

== Energy accidents and fatalities ==

{{main|Energy accidents}}

Energy accidents are accidents that occur in systems that provide energy or power. These can result in fatalities, as can the normal running of many systems, for example those deaths due to pollution.

Globally, coal is responsible for 100,000 deaths per trillion kWh.&lt;ref name=deadly&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#2f9f079649d2 How Deadly Is Your Kilowatt? We Rank The Killer Energy Sources James Conca, June 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scandiobabingtonite''' was first discovered in the Montecatini granite quarry near [[Baveno]], Italy in a [[pegmatite]] cavity. Though found in pegmatites, the crystals of scandiobabingtonite are sub-millimeter sized, and are tabular shaped. Scandiobabingtonite was the sixth naturally occurring mineral discovered with the rare earth element [[scandium]], and grows around [[babingtonite]], with which it is [[isostructural]], hence the namesake. It is also referred to as scandian babingtonite. The ideal chemical formula for scandiobabingtonite is Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,Mn)ScSi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;(OH).&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Occurrence==
Scandiobabingtonite is found in association with [[orthoclase]], [[quartz]], light blue [[albite]], [[stilbite]], [[fluorite]], and [[mica]]. When found with these minerals, the scandiobabingtonite crystals are emplanted on the surface of the other minerals. It also occurs as growth around green-black prismatic crystals of babingtonite. The samples of scandiobabingtonite that have been discovered have shown that they start out growing from a seed of babingtonite crystal. This is how scandiobabingtonite gets its chemical structure. The starting seed of babingtonite is still present in the center of the resulting crystal and can be detected with optical and chemical studies.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt; Scandiobabingtonite is a uniquely rare mineral, as it occurs in very small amounts in few locations around the world.&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt; It is one of thirteen naturally occurring minerals where scandium is a dominant member. The other scandium minerals are [[bazzite]], [[cascandite]], [[hetftetjernite]], [[jervisite]], [[juonniite]], [[kolbeckite]], [[kristiansenite]], [[magbasite]], [[oftedalite]], [[pretulite]], [[thortveitite]], and [[titanowodginite]].&lt;ref name=scandium /&gt;&lt;ref name=webmineral&gt;webmineral.com, 2015, Mineral species Containing Scandium (Sc): http://webmineral.com/chem/Chem-Sc.shtml#.VmCC6s6przL (accessed December 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Scandium can also concentrate in other minerals, such as in [[Mafic|ferromagnesian]] minerals, [[aluminum phosphate]] minerals, [[meteor]]ic minerals, and other minerals containing rare earth elements, but it occurs in trace amounts.&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt;

==Physical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is a colorless or lightly gray-green colored transparent mineral with a glassy or [[Lustre (mineralogy)#Vitreous lustre|vitreous luster]]. It exhibits a hardness of 6 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness scale]]. Scandiobabingtonite occurs as short, prismatic crystals that are slightly elongated on the [001] [[Miller index|axis]] which gives it a tabular or platy shape. Its crystals are characterized by the {010}, {001}, {110}, {1-10}, and {101} [[Miller Index|faces]].  Scandiobabingtonite is brittle and shows perfect cleavage along the {001} and {1-10} planes. The measured density is 3.24 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Optical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is [[optic axis of a crystal|biaxial positive]], which means it will refract light along two axes. It exhibits a 2V&lt;sub&gt;(measured)&lt;/sub&gt;=64(2)°, strong dispersion with r&gt;v, and displays strong [[pleochroism]] with colors ranging from pink (γ') to green(α'). The extinction angle along the (110) is 6°. Z:Φ=-250°, ρ=47°; Y:Φ=146°, ρ=75°; X:Φ=42°, ρ=47°.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

==Chemical properties==
Scandiobabingtonite is [[isostructural]] with babingtonite, and has the same chemical properties as well. It is an [[inosilicate]] with 5-periodic single chains.&lt;ref name=mindat /&gt; Scandium replaces the [[Iron|Fe]]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; in babingtonite in six-fold coordination. The empirical chemical formula for scandiobabingtonite is (Ca&lt;sub&gt;1.71&lt;/sub&gt;,Na&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.97&lt;/sub&gt;(Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.65&lt;/sub&gt;,Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.97&lt;/sub&gt;(Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.91&lt;/sub&gt;,Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.04&lt;/sub&gt;,Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.03&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;Σ0.98&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;5.09&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;14.00&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;1.00&lt;/sub&gt;.

==X-ray crystallography==
Scandiobabingtonite is in the triclinic crystal system, with space group P1. The unit cell dimensions are a=7.536(2) Å, b=11.734(2) Å, c=6.748(2) Å, α=91.70(2)°, β=93.86(2)°, γ=104.53(2)°. These dimensions are almost identical to those of babingtonite. The difference in dimensions is caused by the replacement of iron with scandium in the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-centered octahedra. The Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-O distance measures as 2.048 Å, while the Sc-O distance is 2.092 Å. This equates to a slightly larger octahedra in scandiobabingtonite than babingtonite.&lt;ref name=Orlandi /&gt;

[[File:KelsoSand.JPG|thumb|Sand blowing off a crest in the [[Kelso Dunes]] of the [[Mojave Desert]], California]]
[[File:Singing Sand Dunes.JPG|thumb|Sand dunes on the edge of [[Dunhuang]]]]

'''Singing sand''', also called '''whistling sand''' or '''barking sand''', is [[sand]] that produces sound. The sound emission may be caused by wind passing over [[dune]]s or by walking on the sand.

Certain conditions have to come together to create singing sand:
# The sand grains have to be round and between 0.1 and 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm in [[diameter]].
# The sand has to contain [[silica]].
# The sand needs to be at a certain [[humidity]].

The most common frequency emitted seems to be close to 450 [[hertz|Hz]].

There are various theories about the singing sand mechanism. It has been proposed that the sound frequency is controlled by the shear rate. Others have suggested that the frequency of vibration is related to the thickness of the dry surface layer of sand. The sound waves bounce back and forth between the surface of the dune and the surface of the moist layer, creating a resonance that increases the sound's volume.  The noise may be generated by friction between the grains or by the compression of air between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hTPOi8urYKwC&amp;pg=PA534 |title=Shifting theories of singing sand |journal=New Scientist |date=31 May 1973|last1=Information |first1=Reed Business }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sounds that can be emitted by sand have been described as "roaring" or "booming".

==In dunes==
Singing sand dunes, an example of the phenomenon of singing sand, produce a sound described as roaring, booming, squeaking, or the "Song of Dunes". This is a natural sound phenomenon of up to 105 [[decibel]]s, lasting as long as several minutes, that occurs in about 35 [[desert]] locations around the world. The sound is similar to a loud low-pitch rumble.  It emanates from crescent-shaped dunes, or [[barchan]]s. The sound emission accompanies a slumping or avalanching movement of sand, usually triggered by wind passing over the [[dune]] or by someone walking near the crest.

Examples of singing sand dunes include California's [[Kelso Dunes]] and [[Eureka Valley Sand Dunes|Eureka Dunes]]; AuTrain Beach in Northern Michigan; [[sugar sand]] beaches and [[Warren Dunes]] in southwestern [[Michigan]]; [[Sand Mountain (Nevada)|Sand Mountain]] in [[Nevada]]; the Booming Dunes in the [[Namib Desert]], [[Africa]]; Porth Oer (also known as Whistling Sands) near [[Aberdaron]] in [[Wales]]; [[Indiana Dunes]] in [[Indiana]]; [[Barking Sands]] in [[Hawaiʻi]]; Mingsha Shan in [[Dunhuang]], China; Kotogahama Beach in [[Ōda, Shimane|Odashi]], Japan; Singing Beach in [[Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts]]; near [[Mesaieed]] in [[Qatar]]; and Gebel Naqous, near [[el-Tor]], South Sinai, Egypt.

The phenomena also inspired a song called "The Singing Sands of Alamosa" in [[Bing Crosby]]'s album [[Drifting_and_Dreaming_(album)|Drifting and Dreaming]](1947).&lt;ref name="NPS20180625"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Singing Sands of Great Sand Dunes |url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/grsa-singing-sands.htm |website=National Park Service |publisher=Great Sand Dunes National Park &amp; Preserve |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Singing Sands of Alamosa by Bing Crosby |url=https://archive.org/details/78_the-singing-sands-of-alamosa_bing-crosby-dick-mcintire-and-his-harmony-hawaiians-be_gbia0048648a |website=Archive.org |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On some beaches around the world, dry sand will make a singing, squeaking, whistling, or screaming sound if a person scuffs or shuffles their feet with sufficient force.&lt;ref name="about.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Knox Beckius|first=Kim|title=Squeak Your Feet on the Singing Beach|url=http://gonewengland.about.com/od/nbostonsights/ss/aamanorthshore_6.htm|website=The 10 Most Memorable Things To Do on the Massachusetts North Shore|publisher=about.com: New England Travel|accessdate=18 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="H2RNCB"&gt;{{cite book|title=How to Read a North Carolina Beach: Bubble Holes, Barking Sands, and Rippled Runnels|author1=Pilkey|first=Orrin H.|author2=Rice|first2=Tracy Monegan|author3=Neal|first3=William J.|date=29 March 2004|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0807855102|location=|pages=101|language=English|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon is not completely understood scientifically, but it has been found that quartz sand will do this if the grains are very well-rounded and highly spherical.&lt;ref name="CanadaCool"&gt;{{cite web|last=Izon|first=Lucy|title=The Sands 'Sing' on Prince Edward Island|url=http://www.canadacool.com/COOLFACTS/PEI/SingingSands.html|publisher=CANADA COOL|accessdate=18 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006142637/http://canadacool.com/COOLFACTS/PEI/SingingSands.html|archivedate=6 October 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by some that the sand grains must be of similar size, so the sand must be well sorted by the actions of wind and waves, and that the grains should be close to spherical and have dust-, pollution-, and organic-matter-free surfaces. The "singing" sound is then believed to be produced by [[Shear stress|shear]], as each layer of sand grains slides over the layer beneath it. The similarity in size, the uniformity, and the cleanness means that grains move up and down in unison over the layer of grains below them. Even small amounts of pollution on the sand grains reduce the friction enough to silence the sand.&lt;ref name="H2RNCB"/&gt;

Others believe that the sound is produced by the friction of grain against grain that have been coated with dried salt, in a way that is analogous to the way that the rosin on the [[Bow (music)|bow]] produces sounds from a violin string.  It has also been speculated that thin layers of gas trapped and released between the grains act as "percussive cushions" capable of vibration, and so produce the tones heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lencek|first=Lena|title=No Man and the Sea|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/l/lencek-beach.html|website=The Beach: The History of Paradise on Earth|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 September 2010|author2=Gideon Bosker |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all sands sing, whistle or bark alike. The sounds heard have a wide frequency range that can be different for each patch of sand. Fine sands, where individual grains are barely visible to the naked eye, produce only a poor, weak sounding bark. Medium-sized grains can emit a range of sounds, from a faint squeak or a high-pitched sound, to the best and loudest barks when scuffed enthusiastically.&lt;ref name="H2RNCB"/&gt;

Water also influences the effect. Wet sands are usually silent because the grains stick together instead of sliding past each other, but small amounts of water can actually raise the pitch of the sounds produced. The most common part of the beach on which to hear singing sand is the dry upper beach above the normal high tide line, but singing has been reported on the lower beach near the low tide line as well.&lt;ref name="H2RNCB"/&gt;

Singing sand has been reported on 33 beaches in the British Isles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Whistling sand beaches in the British Isles |author=Ridgway, K. |author2=Scotton, J.

To an observer on a planet with an [[axial tilt|orientation]] and [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] similar to those of [[Earth]], the subsolar point will appear to move westward, completing one circuit around the [[globe]] each day, approximately moving along the [[equator]]. However, it will also move [[declination|north and south]] between the [[tropics]] over the course of a year, so it is spiraling like a [[helix]].

'''Surface conductivity''' is an additional [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] of an [[electrolyte]] in the vicinity of charged surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Surface and [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] correspond to the electrically driven motion of [[ions]] in an [[electric field]].&lt;/ref&gt; Close to charged surfaces a layer of [[counter ion]]s of opposite polarity exists which is attracted by the [[surface charge]]s. This layer of higher ionic concentration is a part of the interfacial [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. The concentration of the ions in this layer is higher as compared to the [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] far from the charged surface and leads to a higher conductivity of this layer.

[[Marian Smoluchowski|Smoluchowski]] was the first to recognize the importance of surface conductivity at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. von Smoluchowski, Physik, Z., 6, 529 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a detailed description of surface conductivity by Lyklema in "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science" &lt;ref&gt;Lyklema, J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol. 2, Academic Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The Double Layer (DL) has two regions, according to the well established Gouy-Chapman-Stern model, Ref.2. The upper level, which is in contact with the bulk fluid is the [[diffuse layer]]. The inner layer that is in contact with interface is the [[Stern layer]].

It is possible that the lateral motion of ions in both parts of the DL contributes to the surface conductivity.

The contribution of the Stern layer is less well described. It is often called "additional surface conductivity".&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S. and Derjaguin, B.V. "Electrokinetic Phenomena", John Wiley and Sons, New York (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the surface conductivity of the diffuse part of the DL was developed by Bikerman.&lt;ref&gt;Bikerman, J.J. Z.Physik.Chem. A163, 378, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; He derived a simple equation that links surface conductivity κ&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; with the behaviour of ions at the interface. For symmetrical electrolyte and assuming identical ions diffusion coefficients D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=D&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;=D it is given in Ref.2:

:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}^{\sigma} = \frac{4F^2Cz^2D(1+3m/z^2)}{RT\kappa}\left(\cosh\frac{zF\zeta}{2RT}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:F is the [[Faraday constant]]
:T is the [[absolute temperature]]
:R is the [[gas constant]]
:C is the ionic concentration in the bulk fluid
:z is the [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
:ζ is the [[electrokinetic potential]]

The parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] to the motion of ions within the DL:
:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Dukhin number]] is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the contribution of the surface conductivity to a variety of [[electrokinetic phenomena]], such as, [[electrophoresis]] and [[electroacoustic phenomena]].

==Surface Science==
'''Surface conductivity''' may refer to the electrical conduction across a solid surface measured by surface probes. Experiments may be done to test this material property as in the [[Extrinsic semiconductor|n-type]] surface conductivity of [[Extrinsic semiconductor|p-type]] &lt;ref&gt; W.L. Brown. "n-Type Surface Conductivity on p-Type Germanium". Phys. Rev. 91, 518 (1953). &lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, surface conductivity is measured in coupled phenomena such as [[Photoconductivity|photoconductivity]], for example, for the metal oxide semiconductor [[Zinc oxide|ZnO]]&lt;ref&gt;Y. Shapira, S.M. Cox and David Lichtman. "CHEMISORPTION, PHOTODESORPTION AND CONDUCTIVITY
MEASUREMENTS ON ZnO SURFACES". Surface Science 54, 43 (1976). &lt;/ref&gt;. Surface conductivity differs from bulk conductivity for analogous reasons to the electrolyte solution case, where the [[Charge carrier|charge carriers]] of holes (+1) and electrons (-1) play the role of ions in solution.

'''Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment''' ('''SELEX'''), also referred to as ''[[Deoxyribozyme#in vitro selection|in vitro selection]]'' or ''[[Deoxyribozyme#in vitro evolution|in vitro evolution]]'', is a [[combinatorial chemistry]] technique in [[molecular biology]] for producing [[oligonucleotide]]s of either single-stranded [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that specifically bind to a target [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] or ligands, which are commonly referred to as [[aptamer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hak-Hagir A | title = [The Hak-Hagir skin conduit] | journal = Zeitschrift Fur Urologie Und Nephrologie | volume = 71 | issue = 9 | pages = 639–42 | date = September 1978 | pmc = 362762 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.9.7.2944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuerk C, Gold L | title = Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment: RNA ligands to bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase | journal = Science | volume = 249 | issue = 4968 | pages = 505–10 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 2200121 | doi = 10.1126/science.2200121 | bibcode = 1990Sci...249..505T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ellington AD, Szostak JW | title = In vitro selection of RNA molecules that bind specific ligands | journal = Nature | volume = 346 | issue = 6287 | pages = 818–22 | date = August 1990 | pmid = 1697402 | doi = 10.1038/346818a0 | bibcode = 1990Natur.346..818E }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Although SELEX has emerged as the most commonly used name for the procedure, some researchers have referred to it as '''SAAB''' (selected and amplified binding site) and '''CASTing''' (cyclic amplification and selection of targets)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blackwell TK, Weintraub H | title = Differences and similarities in DNA-binding preferences of MyoD and E2A protein complexes revealed by binding site selection | journal = Science | volume = 250 | issue = 4984 | pages = 1104–10 | date = November 1990 | pmid = 2174572 | doi = 10.1126/science.2174572 | bibcode = 1990Sci...250.1104B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright WE, Binder M, Funk W | title = Cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) for the myogenin consensus binding site | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 4104–10 | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1649388 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.11.8.4104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SELEX was first introduced in 1990. In 2015 a special issue was published in the [[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] in the honor of quarter century of the SELEX discovery.

The process begins with the synthesis of a very large oligonucleotide library consisting of randomly generated sequences of fixed length flanked by constant [[5' end|5']] and [[3' end|3']] ends that serve as [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For a randomly generated region of length ''n'', the number of possible sequences in the library is 4&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (''n'' positions with four possibilities (A,T,C,G) at each position). The sequences in the library are exposed to the target ligand - which may be a [[protein]] or a [[small organic compound]] - and those that do not bind the target are removed, usually by [[affinity chromatography]] or target capture on paramagnetic beads.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoltenburg R, Schubert T, Strehlitz B | title = In vitro Selection and Interaction Studies of a DNA Aptamer Targeting Protein A | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = e0134403 | date = 2015-07-29 | pmid = 26221730 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0134403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bound sequences are eluted and amplified by [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; to prepare for subsequent rounds of selection in which the stringency of the elution conditions can be increased to identify the tightest-binding sequences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A caution to consider in this method is that the selection of extremely high, sub-[[Nano-|nano]]molar binding affinity entities may not in fact improve specificity for the target molecule.&lt;ref name="Carothers"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carothers JM, Oestreich SC, Szostak JW | title = Aptamers selected for higher-affinity binding are not more specific for the target ligand | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 128 | issue = 24 | pages = 7929–37 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16771507 | pmc = 4287982 | doi = 10.1021/ja060952q }}&lt;/ref&gt; Off-target binding to related molecules could have significant clinical effects.

SELEX has been used to develop a number of aptamers that bind targets interesting for both clinical and research purposes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu YX, Kwon YJ | title = Aptamers: The "evolution" of SELEX | journal = Methods | volume = 106 | pages = 21–8 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27109056 | doi = 10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.04.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also towards these ends, a number of nucleotides with chemically modified sugars and bases have been incorporated into SELEX reactions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keefe AD, Cload ST | title = SELEX with modified nucleotides | journal = Current Opinion in Chemical Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 448–56 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18644461 | doi = 10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.06.028 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These modified nucleotides allow for the selection of aptamers with novel binding properties and potentially improved stability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Procedure ==

=== Generating single stranded oligonucleotide library ===
The first step of SELEX involves the synthesis of fully or partially randomized oligonucleotide sequences of some length flanked by defined regions which allow PCR amplification of those randomized regions and, in the case of RNA SELEX, in vitro transcription of the randomized sequence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huizenga2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huizenga DE, Szostak JW | title = A DNA aptamer that binds adenosine and ATP | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 34 | issue = 2 | pages = 656–65 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7819261 | doi = 10.1021/bi00002a033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ellington and Szostak demonstrated that chemical synthesis is capable of generating ~10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; unique sequences for oligonucleotide libraries in their 1990 paper on in vitro selection,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; they found that amplification of these synthesized oligonucleotides led to significant loss of pool diversity due to PCR bias and defects in synthesized fragments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The oligonucleotide pool is amplified and a sufficient amount of the initial library is added to the reaction so that there are numerous copies of each individual sequence to minimize the loss of potential binding sequences due to stochastic events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Before the library is introduced to target for incubation and selective retention, the sequence library must be converted to single stranded oligonucleotides to achieve structural conformations with target binding properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Target incubation ===
Immediately prior to target introduction, the single stranded oligonucleotide library is often heated and cooled slowly to renature oligonucleotides into thermodynamically stable secondary and tertiary structures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Once prepared, the randomized library is incubated with immobilized target to allow oligonucleotide-target binding. There are several considerations for this target incubation step, including the target immobilization method and strategies for subsequent unbound oligonucleotide separation, incubation time and temperature, incubation buffer conditions, and target versus oligonucleotide concentrations. Examples of target immobilization methods include [[affinity chromatography]] columns,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; nitrocellulose [[Filter binding assay|binding assay filters,]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and [[Dynabeads|paramagnetic beads.]]&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Recently, SELEX reactions have been developed where the target is whole cells, which are expanded near complete [[Confluency|confluence]] and incubated with the oligonucleotide library on culture plates.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwagawa T, Ohuchi SP, Watanabe S, Nakamura Y | title = Selection of RNA aptamers against mouse embryonic stem cells | journal = Biochimie | volume = 94 | issue = 1 | pages = 250–7 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22085640 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2011.10.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Incubation buffer conditions are altered based on the intended target and desired function of the selected aptamer. For example, in the case of negatively charged small molecules and proteins, high salt buffers are used for [[Electric-field screening|charge screening]] to allow nucleotides to approach the target and increase the chance of a specific binding event.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Alternatively, if the desired aptamer function is in vivo protein or whole cell binding for potential therapeutic or diagnostic application, incubation buffer conditions similar to in vivo plasma salt concentrations and homeostatic temperatures are more likely to generate aptamers that can bind in vivo. Another consideration in incubation buffer conditions is non-specific competitors. If there is a high likelihood of non-specific oligonucleotide retention in the reaction conditions, non specific competitors, which are small molecules or polymers other than the SELEX library that have similar physical properties to the library oligonucleotides, can be used to occupy these non-specific binding sites.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Varying the relative concentration of target and oligonucleotides can also affect properties of the selected aptamers. If a good [[binding affinity]] for the selected aptamer is not a concern, then an excess of target can be used to increase the probability that at least some sequences will bind during incubation and be retained. However, this provides no selective pressure for high [[Ligand (biochemistry)|binding affinity]], which requires the oligonucleotide library to be in excess so that there is competition between unique sequences for available specific binding sites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Binding sequence elution and amplification ===
Once the oligonucleotide library has been incubated with target for sufficient time, unbound oligonucleotides are washed away from immobilized target, often using the incubation buffer so that specifically bound oligonucleotides are retained.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With unbound sequences washed away, the specifically bound sequences are then eluted by creating denaturing conditions that promote oligonucleotide unfolding or loss of binding conformation including flowing in deionized water,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; using denaturing solutions containing urea and EDTA,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vater A, Jarosch F, Buchner K, Klussmann S | title = Short bioactive Spiegelmers to migraine-associated calcitonin gene-related peptide rapidly identified by a novel approach: tailored-SELEX | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 31 | issue = 21 | pages = e130 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14576330 | pmc = 275487 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gng130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by applying high heat and physical force.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Upon elution of bound sequences, the retained oligonucleotides are [[Reverse transcriptase|reverse-transcribed]] to DNA in the case of RNA or modified base selections,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; or simply collected for amplification in the case of DNA SELEX.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blank M, Weinschenk T, Priemer M, Schluesener H | title = Systematic evolution of a DNA aptamer binding to rat brain tumor microvessels. selective targeting of endothelial regulatory protein pigpen | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 276 | issue = 19 | pages = 16464–8 | date = May 2001 | pmid = 11279054 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M100347200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These DNA templates from eluted sequences are then amplified via [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] and converted to single stranded DNA, RNA, or modified base oligonucleotides, which are used as the initial input for the next round of selection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Obtaining ssDNA===
One of the most critical steps in the SELEX procedure is obtaining single stranded DNA (ssDNA) after the PCR amplification step. This will serve as input for the next cycle so it is of vital importance that all the DNA is single stranded and as little as possible is lost. Because of the relative simplicity, one of the most used methods is using biotinylated reverse primers in the amplification step, after which the complementary strands can be bound to a resin followed by elution of the other strand with lye. Another method is asymmetric PCR, where the amplification step is performed with an excess of forward primer and very little reverse primer, which leads to the production of more of the desired strand. A drawback of this method is that the product should be purified from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and other left-over material from the PCR reaction. Enzymatic degradation of the unwanted strand can be performed by tagging this strand using a phosphate-probed primer, as it is recognized by enzymes such as [[Exodeoxyribonuclease|Lambda exonuclease]]. These enzymes then selectively degrade the phosphate tagged strand leaving the complementary strand intact. All of these methods recover approximately 50 to 70% of the DNA. For a detailed comparison refer to the article by Svobodová et al. where these, and other, methods are experimentally compared.&lt;ref name="Svobodová"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Svobodová M, Pinto A, Nadal P, O' Sullivan CK | title = Comparison of different methods for generation of single-stranded DNA for SELEX processes | journal = Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume = 404 | issue = 3 | pages = 835–42 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22733247 | doi = 10.1007/s00216-012-6183-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical SELEX, the process of randomized single stranded library generation, target incubation, and binding sequence elution and amplification described above are repeated until the vast majority of the retained pool consists of target binding sequences,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; though there are modifications and additions to the procedure that are often used, which are discussed below.

=== Negative or counter selection ===
In order to increase the specificity of aptamers selected by a given SELEX procedure, a negative selection, or counter selection, step can be added prior to or immediately following target incubation. To eliminate sequences with affinity for target immobilization matrix components from the pool, negative selection can be used where the library is incubated with target immobilization matrix components and unbound sequences are retained.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stoltenburg R, Reinemann C, Strehlitz B | title = SELEX--a (r)evolutionary method to generate high-affinity nucleic acid ligands | journal = Biomolecular Engineering | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 381–403 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17627883 | doi = 10.1016/j.bioeng.2007.06.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Negative selection can also be used to eliminate sequences that bind target-like molecules or cells by incubating the oligonucleotide library with small molecule target analogs, undesired cell types, or non-target proteins and retaining the unbound sequences.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haller AA, Sarnow P | title = In vitro selection of a 7-methyl-guanosine binding RNA that inhibits translation of capped mRNA molecules | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 94 | issue = 16 | pages = 8521–6 | date = August 1997 | pmid = 9238009 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.94.16.8521 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracking selection progression ===
To track the progress of a SELEX reaction, the number of target bound molecules, which is equivalent to the number of oligonucleotides eluted, can be compared to the estimated total input of oligonucleotides following elution at each round.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sefah K, Shangguan D, Xiong X, O'Donoghue MB, Tan W | title = Development of DNA aptamers using Cell-SELEX | language = En | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 1169–85 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20539292 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2010.66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of eluted oligonucleotides can be estimated through elution concentration estimations via 260&amp;nbsp;nm wavelength absorbance&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; or fluorescent labeling of oligonucleotides.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As the SELEX reaction approaches completion, the fraction of the oligonucleotide library that binds target approaches 100%, such that the number of eluted molecules approaches the total oligonucleotide input estimate, but may converge at a lower number.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Caveats and considerations ===
Some SELEX reactions can generate probes that are dependent on primer binding regions for secondary structure formation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are aptamer applications for which a short sequence, and thus primer truncation, is desirable.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lubin AA, Hunt BV, White RJ, Plaxco KW | title = Effects of probe length, probe geometry, and redox-tag placement on the performance of the electrochemical E-DNA sensor | language = EN | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 81 | issue = 6 | pages = 2150–8 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19215066 | doi = 10.1021/ac802317k }}&lt;/ref&gt; An advancement on the original method allows an RNA library to omit the constant primer regions, which can be difficult to remove after the selection process because they stabilize [[secondary structure]]s that are unstable when formed by the random region alone.&lt;ref name="Jarosch2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jarosch F, Buchner K, Klussmann S | title = In vitro selection using a dual RNA library that allows primerless selection | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 12 | pages = e86 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16855281 | pmc = 1524915 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl463 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemically modified nucleotides ==
Recently, SELEX has expanded to include the use of chemically modified nucleotides. These chemically modified oligonucleotides offer many potential advantages for selected aptamers including greater stability and nuclease resistance, enhanced binding for select targets, expanded physical properties - like increased hydrophobicity, and more diverse structural conformations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pinheiro VB, Taylor AI, Cozens C, Abramov M, Renders M, Zhang S, Chaput JC, Wengel J, Peak-Chew SY, McLaughlin SH, Herdewijn P, Holliger P | title = Synthetic genetic polymers capable of heredity and evolution | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6079 | pages = 341–4 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22517858 | pmc = 3362463 | doi = 10.1126/science.1217622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:pub.williams.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|right|A thatched pub (The Williams Arms) at [[Wrafton]], [[North Devon]], [[England]]]]
'''Thatching''' is the craft of building a [[roof]] with dry vegetation such as [[straw]], [[Phragmites|water reed]], [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] (''[[Cladium mariscus]]''), [[Juncus|rushes]], [[Calluna|heather]], or [[palm branch]]es, layering the vegetation so as to shed water away from the inner roof. Since the bulk of the vegetation stays dry and is densely packed—trapping air—thatching also functions as insulation. It is a very old roofing method and has been used in both [[tropical]] and [[temperate climates]]. Thatch is still employed by builders in developing countries, usually with low-cost local vegetation. By contrast, in some developed countries it is  the choice of some affluent people who desire a rustic look for their home, would like a more ecologically friendly roof, or who have purchased an originally thatched abode.

==History==
Thatching methods have traditionally been passed down from generation to generation, and numerous descriptions of the materials and methods used in [[Europe]] over the past three centuries survive in archives and early publications.
[[File:Thatch C8248 Stretton on Fosse.jpg|thumb|Thatched roof, England]]
In some equatorial countries, thatch is the prevalent local material for [[roof]]s, and often [[wall]]s. There are diverse building techniques from the [[ancient Hawaiian]] ''hale'' shelter made from the local [[Cordyline fruticosa|ti leaves]] (''Cordyline fruticosa''), [[lauhala]] (''Pandanus tectorius'') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Lex AJ | last1 = Thomson | first2 = Lois | last2 = Englberger | first3 = Luigi | last3 = Guarino | first4 = RR | last4 = Thaman | first5 = Craig R | last5 = Elevitch | year = 2006 | chapter = Pandanus tectorius (''Pandanus'') | edition = 1.1 | editor-first = Craig R | editor-last = Elevitch | title = Species Profiles for Pacific Island Agroforestry | publisher = Permanent Agriculture Resources (PAR) | location = Hōlualoa, [[Hawai‘i|HI]] | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/P.tectorius-pandanus.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121021015441/http://www.agroforestry.net/tti/P.tectorius-pandanus.pdf | archivedate = 2012-10-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Heteropogon contortus|pili grass]] (''Heteropogon contortus'').
[[File:PrayerAtBesakih.jpg|thumb|right|The multi-tiered [[Meru tower]]s of [[Besakih]] temple, [[Bali]], uses black ''[[Arenga pinnata|ijuk]]'' fibres.]]
Palm leaves are also often used. For example, in Na Bure, [[Fiji]], thatchers combine fan palm leave roofs with layered reed walls. Feathered palm leaf roofs are used in Dominica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hawaiianthatch.com/index-3.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140201101759/http://hawaiianthatch.com/index-3.html |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imperata cylindrica|Alang-alang]] (''Imperata cylindrica'') thatched roofs are used in Hawaii and [[Bali]]. In Southeast Asia, mangrove [[Nypa fruticans|nipa palm]] leaves are used as thatched roof material known as [[attap dwelling]]. In Bali, [[Indonesia]], the black fibres of [[Arenga pinnata]] called ''ijuk'' is also used as thatched roof materials, usually used in [[Balinese temple]] roof and meru towers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Indonesian Town Revisited, Volume 1 of Southeast Asian dynamics | author = Peter J.

Wild vegetation such as water reed (''Phragmites australis''), bulrush/cat tail (''Typha'' spp.), broom (''Cytisus scoparius''), heather (''Calluna vulgaris''), and rushes (''Juncus'' spp. and ''Schoenoplectus lacustris'') was probably used to cover shelters and primitive dwellings in Europe in the late Palaeolithic period, but so far no direct archaeological evidence for this has been recovered. People probably began to use straw in the Neolithic period when they first grew cereals—but once again, no direct archaeological evidence of straw for thatching in Europe prior to the early medieval period survives.{{Sfn | Letts | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}

Many [[Indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] people of the Americas, such as the former Maya civilization, Mesoamerica, the Inca empire, and the Triple Alliance (Aztec), lived in thatched buildings. It is common to spot thatched buildings in rural areas of the Yucatán Peninsula as well as many settlements in other parts of Latin America, which closely resemble the method of construction from distant ancestors. After the collapse of most extant American societies due to diseases introduced by Europeans, wars, enslavement, and genocide, the first Americans encountered by Europeans lived in structures roofed with bark or skin set in panels that could be added or removed for ventilation, heating, and cooling.  Evidence of the many complex buildings with fiber-based roofing material was not rediscovered until the early 2000s. French and British settlers built temporary thatched dwellings with local vegetation as soon as they arrived in New France and New England, but covered more permanent houses with wooden shingles.

[[File:Thatched Roof Cottage, Cotswolds, England (2016).jpg|thumb|Thatched Roof Cottage, Cotswolds, England (2016)]]

In most of England, thatch remained the only roofing material available to the bulk of the population in the countryside, in many towns and villages, until the late 1800s.&lt;ref name= "MoirLetts"&gt;{{Citation | first1 = J | last1 = Moir | first2 = John | last2 = Letts | title = Thatch: Thatching in England 1790–1940 | publisher = English Heritage | journal = Research Transactions | volume = 5 | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Slate industry in Wales|Commercial production of Welsh slate]] began in 1820, and the mobility provided by [[canals]] and then [[railways]] made other materials readily available. Still, the number of thatched properties actually increased in the UK during the mid-1800s as agriculture expanded, but then declined again at the end of the 19th century because of agricultural recession and rural depopulation.  
[[File:Thatch stanton c 8333.jpg|thumb|Cottage with thatched roof in Stanton, a village in the Cotswolds, England]]
Gradually, thatch became a mark of poverty, and the number of thatched properties gradually declined, as did the number of professional thatchers. Thatch has become much more popular in the UK over the past 30 years, and is now a symbol of wealth rather than poverty. There are approximately 1,000 full-time thatchers at work in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Letts | first = John | edition = unpublished | title = Survey | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and thatching is becoming popular again because of the renewed interest in preserving historic buildings and using more sustainable building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/magical-thatched-homes-that-will-enchant-you/ss-BBIRVia#image=21|title=Magical thatched homes that will enchant you|author=|date=|website=www.msn.com|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402035458/http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/magical-thatched-homes-that-will-enchant-you/ss-BBIRVia#image=21|archivedate=2 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although thatch is popular in Germany, The Netherlands, Denmark, parts of France, Sicily, Belgium and Ireland, there are more thatched roofs in the [[United Kingdom]] than in any other European country.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=February 2014}} Good quality straw thatch can last for more than 50 years when applied by a skilled thatcher. Traditionally, a new layer of straw was simply applied over the weathered surface, and this "spar coating" tradition has created accumulations of thatch over 7’ (2.1&amp;nbsp;m) thick on very old buildings. The straw is bundled into "yelms" before it is taken up to the roof and then is attached using staples, known as "spars", made from twisted hazel sticks. Over 250 roofs in Southern England have base coats of thatch that were applied over 500 years ago, providing direct evidence of the types of materials that were used for thatching in the medieval period.{{Sfn | Letts | 2000}}{{Rp | needed = yes | date =February 2013}}  Almost all of these roofs are thatched with wheat, rye, or a "maslin" mixture of both.  Medieval wheat grew to almost {{convert |6|ft}} tall in very poor soils and produced durable straw for the roof and grain for baking bread.

Technological change in the [[farming]] [[industry]] significantly affected the popularity of thatching. The availability of good quality thatching straw declined in England after the introduction of the combine harvester in the late 1930s and 1940s, and the release of short-stemmed wheat varieties. Increasing use of nitrogen fertiliser in the 1960s–70s also weakened straw and reduced its longevity. Since the 1980s, however, there has been a big increase in straw quality as specialist growers have returned to growing older, tall-stemmed, "heritage" varieties of wheat such as Squareheads Master (1880), N59 (1959), Rampton Rivet (1937), Victor (1910) and April Bearded (early 1800s)] in low input/organic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Letts | first = John | year = 2007 | title = Growing Straw for Thatching: a guide | publisher = The COHT (Conservation of Historic Thatch Committee}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK it is illegal under the [[Plant Variety and Seeds Act 1964]] (with many amendments) for an individual or organisation to give, trade or sell seed of an older variety of wheat (or any other agricultural crop) to a third party for growing purposes, subject to a significant fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Legislation | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/14 | year = 1964 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111202021/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1964/14 | archivedate = 2012-01-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this legislation, thatchers in the UK can no longer obtain top quality thatching straw grown from traditional, tall-stemmed varieties of wheat.

All evidence indicates that water reed was rarely used for thatching outside of East Anglia.&lt;ref name= "MoirLetts"/&gt; It has traditionally been a "one coat" material applied in a similar way to how it is used in continental Europe. Weathered reed is usually stripped and replaced by a new layer. It takes 4–5 acres of well-managed reed bed to produce enough reed to thatch an average house, and large reed beds have been uncommon in most of England since the Anglo-Saxon period. Over 80% of the water reed used in the UK is now imported from [[Turkey]], [[Eastern Europe]], China and South Africa. Though water reed might last for 50 years or more on a steep roof in a dry climate, modern imported water reed on an average roof in England does not last any longer than good quality wheat straw. The lifespan of a thatched roof also depends on the skill of the thatcher, but other factors must be considered—such as [[climate]], quality of materials, and the roof pitch.

In areas where [[Arecaceae|palms]] are abundant, palm leaves are used to thatch walls and roofs. Many species of palm trees are called "[[thatch palm]]", or have "thatch" as part of their common names. In the [[southeastern United States]], Native and pioneer houses were often constructed of [[Arecaceae|palmetto]]-leaf thatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last = Andrews | editor1-first = Charles Mclean | editor2-last = Andrews | editor2-first = Evangeline Walker | origyear = 1945 | title = Jonathan Dickinson's Journal or, God's Protecting Providence.

&lt;gallery mode=nolines widths="300px" heights="300px"&gt;
File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 1.jpg|The creativity that comes with mud housing in rural areas is largely in the art of its roofing, of crafting thatch. As poor areas develop, newer ways of doing things have arrived: faster, more reliable, more durable ways. Houses are now being raised with modern materials, and even the ones standing still in traditional clay and thatch are being refurbished with the fashionable cement blocks/metal roofing sheets. This progression has no doubt brought about a decline in the practice of traditional crafts such as thatching.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 2.jpg|Mr. Bassey Ekpenyong, an indigene of Ito community in Cross-River state, Nigeria, calls me his friend in that manner that, as a stranger serving in his community under the National Youth Service Corp, makes me feel safe. He invites me to his shop during evening hours, and as he offers me roasted nuts, he makes a new promise to take me on his bike to the beach when the rains have stopped and the roads are accessible again.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 3.jpg|It is on my return to Ito after a couple of weeks away that I first see him seated in the shade outside of his shop, palm leaves littered all over. He sees the excitement register on my face as I pass on my bike and signals that I return, as if to say, "I have been waiting for you." And truly, he has.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 4.jpg|He is making a new roof for his shop, he tells me. He wants me to make pictures. There are palm leaves all over, some tied up in a bunch, some lying underneath the sun, others thatched already and staked up in a pile. In his hands are two long, thinly carved sticks that would function as the skeletal frame for a pair of thatch.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 5.jpg|He begins a new pair and laughs as he talks; a satisfaction comes with the knowledge that he is creating for me yet another experience to take home when service is over. He makes a joke of it.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 6.jpg|He folds a leaf in half neatly across both sticks. He does the same for another leaf, lapping it with the previous; then, using another tiny stick which he breaks afterwards, pins the leaves firmly in place.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 7.jpg|The process continues until the sticks are fully covered in green palm leaves. He completes a pair of thatch in minutes and begins another.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 8.jpg|Mr. Bassey is a conversationalist. He talks about the need for this change, a practice he does every five years as this is the durability period for the thatch. "Nfok nkaya," he says in Efik, pointing to his shop behind: mud house with mat (thatch). He points to other houses around, including the ones made of clay but with metal roofing sheets, and calls them "Ikanga": zinc dey up.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 9.jpg|On other days, Mr Bassey is joined by his friends. They sit for long hours underneath the tree on their return from their various farms. They chat as they thatch, switching on occasion from Efik to English.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 10.jpg|They craft at the same pace, with the same measure of skill, but what intrigues me the most is their fellowship in that shared space, a communion of banter and silence. How silence descends on them as they craft, only to be broken yet again with a thought, a story, a sigh—childhood friends who had all grown up in this same space and carried within themselves different experiences as they each sorted life out; some leaving only to return yet again.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 11.jpg|Childhood friends thatching through time, memories into their palms, pinning them into that place of recollection, of regret, of conquests. Pinning them with the same laughter and voices that survived time.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 12.jpg|When asked how and when they had learnt thatching, the story is the same for everyone. They throw back to a time when they were just kids, when Ito was only made of the traditional mud houses.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 13.jpg|As kids, they had been taken along with other kids by the contractor, an older member of the community who dealt in sales of thatch, to the beach. There, they had each been assigned to a bunch of palm leaves, and had made dozens of thatch. This contractor in return had provided their meal for the day and bought them treats. Afterwards, he had also paid their mothers for the children's work; money meant for their upkeep.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 14.jpg|"We just sabi," Mr. Bassey tells me, explaining to me how he couldn't really pinpoint exactly how he had learnt. In a society where almost everything used was hand-crafted, most of these skills children grew into, got used to just by seeing them done on a daily basis, just by being a part of the home/society.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 15.jpg|"Those wen no sabi wen we go beach go just sidon look those wen sabi, or, watch contractor do am and dem go sabi."

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 16.jpg|To Mr. Bassey this is more. It carries sentiments enough for him to brag about the metal roofing sheets he's kept lying waste in his house for years. When the few thatched houses left have been broken down and then raised up in modern fashion, he still sits outside of his shop underneath the tree every five years, matting green leaves into thatch.

File:The Making of Thatch, Nigeria Photo 17.jpg|His shop, once his home, carries for him memories of events: of childhood adventures; of leaving and returning; of his late wife, of loss. Memories that make him. And thatching, this craft, this practice of maintenance is, in a fast-paced world, for him the very means through which he holds time in his hands. The very means to which he laps these memories into a place of remembrance. The very means in which he shelters them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Maintenance in temperate climates==
[[File:Old-sanrizuka-goryou-farm,old-house-for-honored-guests,narita-city,japan.JPG|thumb|Thatched roof in [[Narita, Chiba|Narita]], [[Japan]].]]
Good thatch does not require frequent maintenance. In England a ridge normally lasts 8–14 years, and re-ridging is required several times during the lifespan of a thatch. Experts no longer recommend covering thatch with wire netting, as this slows evaporation and reduces longevity. [[Moss]] can be a problem if very thick, but is not usually detrimental, and many species of moss are actually protective. {{Citation | title = The Thatcher's Craft | year = 1960}}, remains the most widely used reference book on the techniques used for thatching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.hct.ac.uk/Downloads/cp_thatch.html | publisher = HCT | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | title = Thatch | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120111063005/http://www.hct.ac.uk/Downloads/cp_thatch.html | archivedate = 2012-01-11 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The thickness of a layer of thatch decreases over time as the surface gradually turns to compost and is blown off the roof by wind and rain. Thatched roofs generally needs replacement when the horizontal wooden 'sways' and hair-pin 'spars', also known as 'gads' (twisted hazel staples) that fix each course become visible near the surface. It is not total depth of the thatch within a new layer applied to a new roof that determines its longevity, but rather how much weathering thatch covers the fixings of each overlapping course. “A roof is as good as the amount of correctly laid thatch covering the fixings.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.eamta.co.uk/ | title = The Thatch &amp; Thatching | publisher = The East Anglia Master Thatchers Association | place = UK | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831101444/http://www.eamta.co.uk/ | archivedate = 2011-08-31 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flammability ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}
[[Image:House river kwai.jpg|thumb|right|River houses on the [[Khwae Noi River|River Kwai]].]]
Thatch is not as flammable as many people believe. It burns slowly, "like a closed book," thatchers say. The vast majority of fires are linked to the use of wood burners and faulty chimneys with degraded or poorly installed or maintained flues. Sparks from paper or burned rubbish can ignite dry thatch on the surface around a chimney. Fires can also begin when sparks or flames work their way through a degraded chimney and ignite the surrounding semi-charred thatch. This can be avoided by ensuring that the chimney is in good condition, which may involve stripping thatch immediately surrounding the chimney to the full depth of the stack. This can easily be done without stripping thatch over the entire roof. Insurance premiums on thatched houses are higher than average in part because of the perception that thatched roofs are a fire hazard, but also because a thatch fire can cause extensive smoke damage and a thatched roof is more expensive to replace than a standard tiled or slate roof. Workmen should never use open flame near thatch, and nothing should be burnt that could fly up the chimney and ignite the surface of the thatch. [[Spark arrestor]]s usually cause more harm than good, as they are easily blocked and reduce air flow. All thatched roofs should have smoke detectors in the roof space. Spray-on fire retardant or pressure impregnated fire retardants can reduce the spread of flame and radiated heat output.

On new buildings, a solid fire retardant barrier over the rafters can make the thatch sacrificial in case of fire. If fireboards are used, they require a ventilation gap between boarding and thatch so that the roof can breathe, as condensation can be a significant problem in thin, single layer thatch. Condensation is much less of a problem on thick straw roofs, which also provide much better insulation since they do not need to be ventilated.

==Performance==
[[Image:Kodaiji-2002-0098.jpg|thumb|Ihōan, a tea house at [[Kōdai-ji]] in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]].]]
The performance of thatch depends on roof shape and design, pitch of roof, position—its [[geography]] and [[topography]]—the quality of material and the expertise of the thatcher.

Thatch has some natural properties that are advantageous to its performance. It is naturally weather-resistant, and when properly maintained does not absorb a lot of water. There should not be a significant increase to roof weight due to water retention. A roof pitch of at least 50 degrees allows precipitation to travel quickly down slope so that it runs off the roof before it can penetrate the structure.

Thatch is also a natural insulator, and air pockets within straw thatch insulate a building in both warm and cold weather. A thatched roof ensures that a building is cool in summer and warm in winter.

Thatch also has very good resistance to wind damage when applied correctly.

===Advantages===
Thatching materials range from plains grasses to waterproof leaves found in equatorial regions. It is the most common roofing material in the world, because the materials are readily available.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}
[[Image:Partially thatched roof.jpg|thumb|right|Farm-house in the [[Netherlands]] near [[Alkmaar]]. The combination of thatch and [[roof tiles]] is quite common in that area.]]
Because thatch is lighter, less timber is required in the roof that supports it.

Thatch is a versatile material when it comes to covering irregular roof structures. This fact lends itself to the use of second-hand, [[recycled]] and natural materials that are not only more [[sustainable]], but need not fit exact standard dimensions to perform well.

===Disadvantages===
Thatched houses are harder to insure because of the perceived fire risk, and because thatching is labor-intensive, it is much more expensive to thatch a roof than to cover it with slate or tiles. Birds can damage a roof while they are foraging for grubs, and rodents are attracted by residual grain in straw.

[[Image:Lucy in the sky.jpg|thumb|right|Thatched hut in [[Lesotho]].]]
Thatch has fallen out of favor in much of the industrialized world not because of fire, but because thatching has become very expensive and alternative 'hard' materials are cheaper—but this situation is slowly changing. There are about 60,000 thatched roofs in the UK, of which 50–80 suffer a serious fire each year, most of these being completely destroyed. The cost to the Fire Brigade is £1.3m per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more thatched roofs are being built every year.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

New thatched roofs were forbidden in London in 1212 following a major fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/community/cmfabr08.html|title=Florilegium urbanum - Physical fabric - Regulations for building construction and fire safety |date=|website=users.trytel.com|accessdate=6 May 2018 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026234132/http://users.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/community/cmfabr08.html |archivedate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and existing roofs had to have their surfaces plastered to reduce the risk of fire. The modern [[Shakespeare's Globe|Globe Theatre]] is one of the few thatched buildings in London (others can be found in the suburb of [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]]), but the Globe's modern, water reed thatch is purely for decorative purpose and actually lies over a fully waterproofed roof built with modern materials. The Globe Theatre, opened in 1997, was modelled on the Rose, which was destroyed by a fire on a dry June night in 1613 when a burning wad of cloth ejected from a special effects cannon during a performance set light to the surface of the thatch. The original Rose Theatre was actually thatched with cereal straw, a sample of which was recovered by Museum of London archaeologists during the excavation of the site in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = John | last = Letts | title = Unpublished photos and sample records}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim thatch cannot cope with regular snowfall but, as with all roofing materials, this depends on the strength of the underlying roof structure and the pitch of the surface. A law passed in 1640 in [[Massachusetts]] outlawed the use of thatched roofs in the colony for this reason. Thatch is lighter than most other roofing materials, typically around {{convert|7|lb/sqft|abbr=on}}, so the roof supporting it does not need to be so heavily constructed, but if snow accumulates on a lightly constructed thatched roof, it could collapse. A thatched roof is usually pitched between 45–55 degrees and under normal circumstances this is sufficient to shed snow and water. In areas of extreme snowfall, such as [[Minka#Roofing|parts of Japan]], the pitch is increased further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.addictedtotravel.com/holidays/snow-country|title=Winter Japan at its Best|publisher=Addicted to Travel|accessdate=7 September 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328175612/http://www.addictedtotravel.com/holidays/snow-country|archivedate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some thatched roofs in the UK are extremely old and preserve evidence of traditional materials and methods that have long since been lost. In northern Britain this evidence is often preserved beneath corrugated sheet materials and frequently come to light during the development of smaller rural properties.

[[File:Clou45.jpg |thumb|1820 edition, C. &amp; J. Ollier, London.]]

"'''The Cloud'''" is a major 1820 poem written by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. "The Cloud" was written during late 1819 or early 1820, and submitted for publication on 12 July 1820. The work was published in the 1820 collection ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]], A Lyrical Drama, in Four Acts, With Other Poems'' by [[Charles Ollier|Charles and James Ollier]] in London in August 1820. The work was proof-read by John Gisborne. There were multiple drafts of the poem. The poem consists of six stanzas in [[anapestic]] or antidactylus meter, a foot with two unaccented syllables followed by an accented syllable.

==Analysis==

The cloud is a metaphor for the unending cycle of nature: "I silently laugh at my own cenotaph/ ... I arise and unbuild it again." As with the wind and the leaves in "[[Ode to the West Wind]]", the skylark in "[[To a Skylark]]", and the plant in "The Sensitive Plant", Shelley endows the cloud with sentient traits that personify the forces of nature.

In "The Cloud", Shelley relies on the imagery of transformation or metamorphosis, a cycle of birth, death, and rebirth: "I change, but I cannot die." [[Mutability (poem)|Mutability]] or change is a fact of physical nature.&lt;ref&gt;MacEachen, Dougald B. "CliffsNotes on Shelley's Poems". ''CliffsNotes''. Retrieved 18 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lightning]] or [[electricity]] is the "pilot" or guide for the cloud. Lightning is attracted to the "[[Jinn|genii]]" in the earth which results in lightning flashes. The genii symbolize the positive charge of the surface of the earth while the cloud possesses a negative charge.

British scientist and poet [[Erasmus Darwin]], the grandfather of [[Charles Darwin]], had written about plant life and science in the poem collection ''[[The Botanic Garden]]'' (1791) and on "spontaneous vitality", that "microscopic animals are said to remain dead for many days or weeks ... and quickly to recover life and motion" when water and heat are added, in ''The Temple of Nature'' (1803).&lt;ref&gt;[http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Darwin/an01.html ''The Temple of Nature'' By Erasmus Darwin. {1} ADDITIONAL NOTES. SPONTANEOUS VITALITY OF MICROSCOPIC ANIMALS. Hence without parent by spontaneous birth/Rise the first specks of animated earth. CANTO I. l. 227.]&lt;/ref&gt; Percy Bysshe Shelley had cited Darwin in his Preface to the anonymously published novel ''[[Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]'' (1818), explaining how the novel was written and its meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordscholarlyeditions.com/view/10.1093/actrade/9780198127482.book.1/actrade-9780198127482-work-17 Preface to ''Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus''.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc= 1279684 | pmid=11983772 | volume=95 | title=The real Doctor Frankenstein? | journal=J R Soc Med | pages=257–9 | last1 = Goulding | first1 = C | doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.5.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that imparting life to a corpse "as not of impossible occurrence".

The cloud is a personification and a metaphor for the perpetual cycle of transformation and change in nature. All life and matter are interconnected and undergo unending change and metamorphosis.

==Reception==

A review of the 1820 ''Prometheus Unbound'' collection in the September and October 1821 issues of ''The London Magazine'' noted the originality of "The Cloud": "It is impossible to peruse them without admiring the peculiar property of the author's mind, which can doff in an instant the cumbersome garments of metaphysical speculations, and throw itself naked as it were into the arms of nature and humanity. The beautiful and singularly original poem of 'The Cloud' will evince proofs of our opinion, and show the extreme force and freshness with which the writer can impregnate his poetry."&lt;ref&gt;Barcus 1975 qtd p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the October 1821 issue of ''Quarterly Review'', W.S. Walker argued that "The Cloud" is related to ''Prometheus Unbound'' in that they are both absurd and "galimatias".&lt;ref&gt;Barcus 1975 qtd p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Todhunter wrote in 1880 that "The Cloud" and "To a Skylark" were "the two most popular of Shelley's lyrics".&lt;ref&gt;Todhunter 1880 pp. 183–184.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1889, Francis Thompson asserted that "The Cloud" was the "most typically Shelleyan of all the poems" because it contained "the child's faculty of make-believe raised to the nth power" and that "He is still at play, save only that his play is such as manhood stops to watch, and his playthings are those which the gods give their children. The universe is his box of toys. He dabbles his fingers in the dayfall. He is gold-dusty with tumbling amidst the stars."&lt;ref&gt;McMahan 1909 qtd. p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1919 movie==
On 20 April 1919, a silent black and white movie was released in the US entitled ''The Cloud'' which was "a visual poem featuring clouds and landscapes in accompaniment to the words of Shelley's poem 'The Cloud'." The film was directed by W.A. Van Scoy and produced by the Post Nature Pictures company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0010012/ IMDB link to ''The Cloud'' (1919).]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[tsunami]] is defined as a series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water; in the case of this article the body of water being investigated will be a [[lake]] rather than an ocean. '''Tsunamis in lakes''' are becoming increasingly important to investigate as a hazard, due to the increasing popularity for recreational uses, and increasing populations that inhabit the shores of lakes. Tsunamis generated in lakes and reservoirs are of high concern because it is associated with a near field source region which means a decrease in warning times to minutes or hours.

==Causes==
{{see also|Megatsunami|Tsunami earthquake}}
Inland tsunami hazards can be generated by many different types of earth movement. Some of  these include [[earthquake]]s in or around lake systems, [[landslide]]s, debris flow, rock avalanches, and glacier calving. Volcanogenic processes such as gas and [[mass flow]] characteristics are discussed in more detail below.

===Earthquakes===
[[File:Tsunami comic book style.png|thumb|Figure 1: Diagram showing how earthquakes can generate a tsunami.]]

Tsunamis in lakes can be generated by [[fault (geology)|fault]] displacement beneath or around lake systems. Faulting shifts the ground in a vertical motion through reverse, normal or oblique strike slip faulting processes, this displaces the water above causing a tsunami (Figure 1). The reason strike-slip faulting does not cause tsunamis is because there is no vertical displacement within the fault movement, only lateral movement resulting in no displacement of the water. In an enclosed basin such as a lake, tsunamis are referred to as the initial wave produced by coseismic displacement from an earthquake, and the [[seiche]] as the harmonic resonance within the lake.&lt;ref&gt;Ichinose .G.A, et al; 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a tsunami to be generated certain criteria is required:
*Needs to occur just below the lake bottom.
*Earthquake is of high or moderate magnitude typically over magnitude four.
*Displaces a large enough volume of water to generate a tsunami.

These tsunamis are of high damage potential due to being within a lake, making them of a near field source. This means a vast decrease in warning times, resulting in organised [[emergency evacuation]]s after the generation of the tsunami being virtually impossible, and due to low lying shores even small waves lead to substantial flooding.&lt;ref&gt;Freundt Armin et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Planning and education of residents needs to be done beforehand, so that when an earthquake is felt they know to head to higher ground and what routes to take to get there.

====Lake Tahoe====
[[Lake Tahoe]] is an example of a lake that is in danger of having a tsunami due to faulting processes. Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada USA lies within an intermountain basin bounded by faults, with most of these faults at the lake bottom or hidden in glaciofluvial deposits. Lake Tahoe has had many prehistoric eruptions and in studies of the lake bottom sediments, a 10m high scarp has displaced the lake bottom sediments, indicating that the water was displaced by the same magnitude, as well as generating a tsunami. A tsunami and seiche in Lake Tahoe can be treated as shallow-water long waves as the maximum water depth is much smaller than the wavelength. This demonstrates the interesting impact that lakes have on the tsunami wave characteristics, as it is very different from ocean tsunami wave characteristics due to the ocean being deeper, and lakes being relatively shallow in comparison. With ocean tsunami waves amplitudes only increase when the tsunami gets close to shore, in lake tsunami waves are generated and stay in a shallow environment.

This would have a major impact on the 34,000 permanent residences along the lake, not to mention the impact on tourism in the area. Tsunami run-ups would leave areas near the lake inundated due to permanent ground subsidence attributed to the earthquake, with the highest run-ups and amplitudes being attributed to the [[seiche]]s rather than the actual tsunami. The reason seiches cause so much damage is due to resonance within the bays reflecting the waves where they combine to make larger standing waves. For more information see [[seiche]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ichinose .G.A, et al; 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Tahoe also experienced a massive collapse of the western edge of the basin that formed McKinney Bay around 50,000 years ago. Is thought to have generated a tsunami/[[seiche|seiche wave]] with a height approaching {{convert|330|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Gardner|first=J.V.|title=The Lake Tahoe debris avalanche|conference=Geological Society of Australia|booktitle=15th Annual Geological Conference |date=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-aerial mass flows===
[[subaerial|Sub-aerial]] mass flows ([[landslide]]s or rapid [[mass wasting]]) happen when a large amount of sediment becomes unstable, this can happen for example from the shaking from an earthquake, or saturation of the sediment initiating a sliding layer. This volume of sediment then flows into the lake giving a sudden large displacement of water. Tsunamis generated by sub aerial mass flows are defined in terms of the first initial wave being the tsunami wave and any tsunamis in terms of sub aerial mass flows are characterised into three zones. A splash zone or wave generation zone, this is the region were landslides and water motion are coupled and it extends as far as the landslide travels. Near field area, were the concern is based on the characteristics of the tsunami wave such as amplitude and wavelength which are crucial for predictive purposes. Far field area, the process is influenced mainly by dispersion characteristics and is not often used when investigating tsunamis in lakes, as most lake tsunamis are related only to near field processes.&lt;ref&gt;Walder J.S, et al; 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern example of a landslide into a reservoir lake, overtopping a dam, occurred in Italy with the [[Vajont Dam]] disaster in 1963. Evidence exists in [[paleoseismology|paleoseismological]] evidence and other sedimentary [[core sample]] proxies of catastrophic rock failures of landslide-triggered lake tsunamis worldwide, including in [[Lake Geneva]] during AD 563.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kremer|first=Katrina|author2=Guy Simpson|author3=Stéphanie Girardclos|last-author-amp=yes|title=Giant Lake Geneva tsunami in AD 563|journal=Nature Geoscience|date=28 October 2012|doi=10.1038/ngeo1618|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo1618.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..756K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand example====
In the event of the [[Alpine fault]] in New Zealand rupturing in the [[South Island]], it is predicted that there would be shaking of approximately magnitude eight in the lake side towns of [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] ([[Lake Wakatipu]]) and [[Wanaka]] ([[Lake Wanaka]]). These could possibly cause sub-aerial mass flows that could generate tsunamis within the lakes, this would have a devastating impact on the 28,224 residents ([[2013 New Zealand census]]) who occupy these lake towns, not only in the potential losses of life and property, but the damage to the booming tourism industry would take years to rebuild.

The [[Otago Regional Council]], responsible for the area, has recognised that in such an event, tsunamis could occur in both lakes.

===Volcanogenic processes===
[[File:LakeKivu satellite.jpg|thumb|Figure 2: Satellite image of [[Lake Kivu]] in Africa.]]

In this article the focus is on tsunamis generated in lakes by volcanogenic processes in terms of gas build up causing violent lake over turns, with other processes such as pyroclastic flows not accounted for, as it requires more complex modelling . Lake overturns can be incredibly dangerous and occur when gas trapped at the bottom of the lake is heated by rising magma causing an explosion and lake overturn; an example of this is Lake Kivu.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

====Lake Kivu====
[[Lake Kivu]], one of the [[African Great Lakes]], lies on the border between the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Rwanda]], and is part of the [[East Africa Rift]]. Being part of the rift means it is affected by volcanic activity beneath the lake. This has led to a buildup of methane and carbon dioxide at the bottom of the lake, which can lead to violent [[limnic eruptions]].

[[Limnic eruptions]] (also called "lake over turns") are due to volcanic interaction with the water at the bottom of the lake that has high gas concentrations, this leads to heating of the lake and this rapid rise in temperature would spark a methane explosion displacing a large amount of water, followed nearly simultaneously by a release of carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide would suffocate large numbers of people, with a possible tsunami generated from water displaced by the gas explosion affecting all of the 2 million people who occupy the shores of Lake Kivu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcanolive.com/news16.htm Volcano Facts]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is incredibly important as the warning times for an event such as a lake overturn is incredibly short in the order of minutes and the event itself may not even be noticed. Education of locals and preparation is crucial in this case and a lot of research in this area has been done in order to try to understand what is happening within the lake, in order to try to reduce the effects when this phenomenon does happen.

A lake turn-over in Lake Kivu occurs from one of two scenarios. Either (1) up to another hundred years of gas accumulation leads to gas saturation in the lake, resulting in a spontaneous outburst of gas originating at the depth at which gas saturation has exceeded 100%, or (2) a volcanic or even seismic event triggers a turn-over. In either case a strong vertical lift of a large body of water results in a plume of gas bubbles and water rising up to and through the water surface. As the bubbling water column draws in fresh gas-laden water, the bubbling water column widens and becomes more energetic as a virtual "chain reaction" occurs which would look like a watery volcano. Very large volumes of water are displaced, vertically at first, then horizontally away from the centre at surface and horizontally inwards to the bottom of the bubbling water column, feeding in fresh gas-laden water. The speed of the rising column of water increases until it has the potential to rise 25m or more in the centre above lake level. The water column has the potential to widen to well in excess of a kilometre, in a violent disturbance of the whole lake. The watery volcano may take as much as a day to fully develop while it releases upwards of 400 billion cubic metres of gas (~12tcf). Some of these parameters are uncertain, particularly the time taken to release the gas and the height to which the water column can rise. As a secondary effect, particularly if the water column behaves irregularly with a series of surges, the lake surface will both rise by up to several metres and create a series of tsunamis or waves radiating away from the epicentre of the eruption. Surface waters may simultaneously race away from the epicentre at speeds as high as 20-40m/second, slowing as distances from the centre increase. The size of the waves created is unpredictable. Wave heights will be highest if the water column surges periodically, resulting in wave heights is great as 10-20m. This is caused by the ever-shifting pathway that the vertical column takes to the surface. No reliable model exists to predict this overall turnover behaviour. For tsunami precautions it will be necessary for people to move to high ground, at least 20m above lake level. A worse situation may pertain in the Ruzizi River where a surge in lake level would cause flash-flooding of the steeply sloping river valley dropping 700m to Lake Tanganyika, where it is possible that a wall of water from 20-50m high may race down the gorge. Water is not the only problem for residents of the Kivu basin; the more than 400 billion cubic metres of gas released creates a denser-than-air cloud which may blanket the whole valley to a depth of 300m or more. The presence of this opaque gas cloud, which would suffocate any living creatures with its mixture of carbon dioxide and methane laced with hydrogen sulphide, would cause the majority of casualties. Residents would be advised to climb to at least 400m above the lake level to ensure their safety. Strangely the risk of a gas explosion is not great as the gas cloud is only about 20% methane in carbon dioxide, a mixture that is difficult to ignite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Modern examples==

===Askja===

At 11:24 PM on 21 July 2014, in a period experiencing an [[earthquake swarm]] related to the upcoming eruption of [[Bárðarbunga]], an 800m-wide section gave way on the slopes of the Icelandic volcano [[Askja]]. Beginning at 350m over water height, it caused a tsunami 20–30 meters high across the caldera, and potentially larger at localized points of impact. Thanks to the late hour, no tourists were present; however, search and rescue observed a steam cloud rising from the volcano, apparently geothermal steam released by the landslide. Whether geothermal activity played a role in the landslide is  uncertain. A total of 30-50 million cubic meters was involved in the landslide, raising the caldera's water level by 1–2 meters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frumniðurstöður rannsókna á berghlaupi í Öskju 21. júlí 2014 |author1=Jón Kristinn Helgason |author2=Sveinn Brynjólfsson |author3=Tómas Jóhannesson |author4=Kristín S.

==Hazard mitigation==
[[Hazard]] mitigation for tsunamis in lakes is immensely important in the preservation of life, infrastructure and property. In order for hazard management of tsunamis in lakes to function at full capacity there are four aspects that need to be balanced and interacted with each other, these are:

*'''Readiness''' (preparedness for a tsunami in the lake)
**Evacuation plans
**Making sure equipment and supplies are on standby in case of a tsunami
**Education of locals on what hazard is posed to them and what they need to do in the event of a tsunami in the lake
*'''Response''' to the tsunami event in the lake
**Rescue operations
**Getting aid into the area such as food and medical equipment
**Providing temporary housing for people who have been displaced.
*'''Recovery''' from the tsunami
**Re-establishing damaged road networks and infrastructure
**Re-building and/or relocation for damaged buildings
**Cleanup of debris and flooded areas of land.
*'''Reduction''' (plans to reduce the effects of the next tsunami)
**Putting in place land use zoning to provide a buffer for tsunami run ups, meaning that buildings cannot be built right on the lake shore.

When all these aspects are taken into consideration and continually managed and maintained, the vulnerability of an area to a tsunami within the lake decreases. This is not because the hazard itself has decreased but the awareness of the people who would be affected makes them more prepared to deal with the situation when it does occur. This reduces recovery and response times for an area, decreasing the amount of disruption and in turn the effect the disaster has on the community.

==Future research==
Investigation into the phenomena of tsunamis in lakes for this article was restricted by certain limitations. Internationally there has been a fair amount of research into certain lakes but not all lakes that can be affected by the phenomenon have been covered. This is especially true for New Zealand with the possible occurrence of tsunamis in the major lakes recognised as a hazard, but with no further research completed.
