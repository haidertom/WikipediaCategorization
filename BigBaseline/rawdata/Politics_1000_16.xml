The '''1978 Arab League summit''' was meeting held between Arab leaders on 2 November in [[Baghdad]] as the 9th [[Arab League Summit]]. The summit came in the aftermath of the [[Egypt]]'s [[Anwar Sadat]]'s unilateral [[Camp David Accords|peace treaty]] with [[Israel]]. The conference resolved that the agreements signed by the Egyptian Government at Camp David harmed the rights of the Palestinian people. The Egyptian government was urged not to ratify the agreements and to align itself with the Arab League. Most importantly, the League froze its relations with the Government of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/arab-league-summit-conferences-19642000|title=Arab League Summit Conferences, 1964–2000|website=www.washingtoninstitute.org|access-date=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 March 1979, five days after the ratification of the [[Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAd8efHdVzIC|title=The Encyclopedia of the Arab-Israeli Conflict: A Political, Social, and Military History [4 volumes]: A Political, Social, and Military History|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C.|last2=Roberts|first2=Priscilla|date=12 May 2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851098422|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arab leaders again convened in Baghdad in the absence of Egypt and decided to expel it from the Arab League.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Consequently, the secretariat of the League was moved out of its [[Cairo]] headquarters to [[Tunis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This decision was slowly reversed in the 1980s after president [[Hosni Mubarak]] ascended to power.

The '''1982 Bonn summit''' was the 6th [[NATO summit]] bringing the leaders of member nations together at the same time. The formal sessions and informal meetings in [[Bonn]] took place on June 10, 1982.&lt;ref name="nato1"&gt;{{cite web|title=NATO summit meetings |author=NATO |url=http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html#agendas |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5gWo4KcXm?url=http://www.nato.int/issues/summits/index.html |archivedate=2009-05-04 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was only the fifth meeting of the NATO heads of state following the ceremonial signing of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] on April 4, 1949.&lt;ref name="thomas101"&gt;Thomas, Ian Q.R.

==Background==
In this period, the organization faced unresolved questions concerned whether a new generation of leaders would be as committed to NATO as their predecessors had been.&lt;ref name="thomas101"/&gt; The Bonn Summit addressed many issues and discussed many topics. Most notable of these topics was the accession of [[Spain]] to [[NATO]], as the summit was held years after the fall of [[Francisco Franco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/docu/comm/49-95/c820610a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The summit also voiced concern to the perceived threat the [[Soviet Union]] posed to members of NATO.

The '''1998 killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan''' refers to the siege of the Iranian consulate in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], in the [[Taliban]]-[[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|controlled]] [[Afghanistan]] during the Taliban and [[Northern Alliance]] [[battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–98)|battles of Mazar-i-Sharif]].

==Background==
{{Further|Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–98)}}
Before this incident, Iran was supportive of the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]], and the city of Mazari Sharif was one of the headquarters of the alliance. It is reported that between May and July 1997 [[Abdul Malik Pahlawan]] executed thousands of Taliban prisoners as a revenge for the 1995 death of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]]. "He is widely believed to have been responsible for the brutal massacre of up to 3,000 Taliban prisoners after inviting them into Mazar-i-Sharif."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1615824.stm#pahlawan |title=Afghan powerbrokers: Who's who |publisher=BBC News |date= November 19, 2001|accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a revenge, Taliban forces captured Mazar-i-Sharif and killed hundreds of Northern Alliance members, particularly members of the Hazara and Uzbek ethnic group as they were accused of being the ones who carried out the killings of Taliban prisoners.

==Events==
On August 8, 1998, Taliban forces captured Mazar-i-Sharif. After this incident, 11 Iranian diplomats and a correspondent from Iran's state news agency ([[IRNA]]) were attacked at the Iranian consulate and subsequently disappeared. Unofficial reports from the city indicated that all these men were killed. Later it was confirmed that 8 of the Iranian diplomats and the IRNA correspondent were killed by the Taliban militia attacking the consulate. The Taliban spokesmen said the Iranians had been killed by renegade forces who had acted without orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The election was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout and low awareness of the people about the election and election process and widespread ballot stuffing, intimidation, and other electoral fraud.&lt;ref name=invalid&gt;{{Cite web|last=McDonald |first=Charlotte |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i3xqZSi2U_mgENDm3TK0-yqI7I_g |title=Afghan commission orders first ballots invalidated |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413122433/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i3xqZSi2U_mgENDm3TK0-yqI7I_g| archivedate=April 13, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scrapped&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&amp;hp Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=messy&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dixon |first=Robyn |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-fg-obama-karzai3-2009nov03,0,963693.story |title=Obama calls Afghan election 'messy' but upholds its final outcome |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105050208/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-fg-obama-karzai3-2009nov03%2C0%2C963693.story |archivedate=November 5, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[#November 7 run-off election|second round run-off vote]], announced under heavy U.S. and ally pressure, was originally scheduled for 7 November 2009, but [[#Run-off cancelled and winner declared|it was cancelled]] after Abdullah refused to participate, and [[Hamid Karzai]] was declared [[President of Afghanistan]] for another 5-year term.&lt;ref name=scrapped/&gt;&lt;ref name=messy/&gt;

The election was the second under the present [[constitution of Afghanistan]] and was held on the same day as elections for 34 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provincial council]] seats. The [[Taliban]] called for a boycott of the election, describing it as a "''program of the crusaders''" and "''this American process''".&lt;ref name=ordinary&gt;{{Cite web|first=Abdulhadi |last=Hairan |title=Afghanistan: 'Ordinary people want change' |url=http://www.guardianweekly.co.uk/?page=editorial&amp;id=1199&amp;catID=1 |publisher=[[The Guardian Weekly]] |date=2009-08-11 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=killed26/&gt;&lt;ref name=farce&gt;{{Cite web|last=Margolis |first=Eric |url=http://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/eric_margolis/2009/08/16/10476066-sun.html |title=Afghan elections will be a farce |website=Toronto Sun  |date=2009-08-16 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election date==
Under the [[Constitution of Afghanistan|2004 constitution]], elections should have been held no later than 60 days before the end of President Karzai's term in July 2009. The Independent Election Commission (IEC) originally recommended that the poll be held at the same time as the 2010 parliamentary balloting to save costs. However, politicians in the country were unable to agree to the details.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120904050930/http://www.afghanconflictmonitor.org/2008/04/afghanistan-to.html Afghanistan To Hold Separate Presidential, Parliamentary Elections], ''[[The Canadian Press]]'', 2008-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about accessibility to mountainous areas in spring 2009 and the ability of getting adequate people and materials in place by then led the IEC to announce the elections would be delayed to August 2009.

The opposition accused Karzai of attempting to extend his power past his term. In February 2009, President Hamid Karzai called on the Independent Election Committee to hold the election according to the country's constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7916607.stm|work=BBC News  |title=Afghan president urges April poll|date=2009-02-28|accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/uspolicy/2009-03-09-voa7.cfm |title=Afghanistan's Election Dilemma |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2009-03-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331141358/http://www.voanews.com/uspolicy/2009-03-09-voa7.cfm |archivedate=March 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Forty-four candidates had registered for the presidential election when the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan (IEC) announced its official preliminary list of registered candidates on May 17, 2009. Three candidates withdrew from the race before the election took place, having thrown their support behind one of the top two contenders. Each presidential candidate ran with two vice-presidential candidates.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifes.org/publication/a05e4a3ba20a60b82a650a1fa9e18ecf/Election_Kit_Afghanistan.pdf Afghanistan2009 Presidential and Provincial Council Elections Kit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616213130/http://www.ifes.org/publication/a05e4a3ba20a60b82a650a1fa9e18ecf/Election_Kit_Afghanistan.pdf |date=June 16, 2011 }}, [[International Foundation for Electoral Systems]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6659282.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Karzai filed his candidacy on May 4, 2009; he retained incumbent second Vice President [[Karim Khalili]], who is from the [[Hazara people|Hazara]] ethnic group but exchanged the first Vice President [[Ahmad Zia Massood]] for [[Mohammad Qasim Fahim]], a [[Tajik people|Tajik]] former warlord blamed by human rights groups for mass civilian deaths during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghan Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtontimes.com/news/2009/may/08/karzai-jockeys-to-stay-in-power/ Afghan Karzai likely to win reelection], ''[[Washington Times]]'', 2009-05-08&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United National Front (Afghanistan)|United National Front]] announced on April 16, 2009 that they would nominate former foreign minister Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah (politician)|Abdullah Abdullah]] as their presidential candidate. Abdullah was foreign minister of the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] from 1998 onwards, and was a dominant figure in the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Alliance]]. He was appointed foreign minister in the interim government that was installed after the U.S. invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/afghan-opposition-picks-candidate-20090416-a8j5.html |title=Afghan opposition picks candidate |publisher=News.smh.com.au |date=2009-04-16 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FACTBOX/&gt;&lt;ref name=newopt&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/Opinion/1140249.html |title=Afghan election only shows a new option is needed |website=The Chronicle Herald |date=2010-04-07|accessdate=2010-04-07}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard&gt;{{Cite web|author= |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/KI01Df02.html |title=Wizards and wives drive Afghan election |website=Asia Times |date=2009-09-01 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first person to have declared his intention to run, Dr. [[Ramazan Bashardost]] formally registered for the presidential election on May 7, 2009, with vice-presidential candidates Mr. Mohammad Mosa Barekzai, a professor at the Kabul Agricultural Institute and Ms. Afifa Maroof, a member of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, and with a dove, a symbol of peace and liberty, as their campaign symbol. Bashardost openly criticized the government and accused ministers of corruption. While serving as the planning minister, he was critical of foreign organizations in Afghanistan eating up aid money meant for the Afghan people and later resigned under government and foreign pressure.&lt;ref name=FACTBOX&gt;A [https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSSP345133 FACTBOX - Possible Afghan presidential candidates]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kabulpress.org/my/spip.php?article3456 |title=Dr. Ramazan Bashardost officially enters presidential campaign |publisher=Kabulpress.org |date=2009-05-07 |accessdate=2010-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100401183226/http://kabulpress.org/my/spip.php?article3456| archivedate=April 1, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MrClean&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/116/article_4803.asp |title=Afghan Mr Clean takes on Karzai ... and everyone else |publisher=Rfi.fr |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Ashraf Ghani]], a senior fellow in foreign policy at the [[Brookings Institution]] in Washington D.C., and former finance minister, UN special advisor, and [[World Bank]] analyst, registered as a presidential candidate on May 7, 2009. At a time when many Afghans would have preferred to lessen the appearance of ties to the U.S. government, he had the distinction of hiring Clinton-campaign chief strategist [[James Carville]] as his campaign advisor. His close ties to Washington placed him among those that Afghans considered to be "''Zana-e-Bush''", literally "Bush's wives". Ashraf Ghani was also reported as the candidate most favoured by the U.S. for appointment to a "chief executive officer" position that the U.S. intended to insert regardless of the winner of the election.{{Clarify|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=FACTBOX/&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama&gt;{{Cite news|author=Ewen MacAskill |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/19/obama-chief-executive-afghanistan |title=Obama administration to continue push for chief executive in Afghanistan |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-08-19|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JC&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=107006724 |title=James Carville Joins The Afghan Campaign Trail |publisher=Npr.org |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=squand&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/opinions/2009/08/20/2009-08-20_why_im_rooting_against_h.html |title=Afghanistan's president has squandered the people's trust |work=Daily News |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | location=New York | first=Michael | last=Weiss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mirwais Yasini]], the First Deputy Speaker of the Afghan [[House of the People (Afghanistan)|House of the People]] joined the race in March 2009.

Along with the presidential candidates, were 3197 candidates for 420 provincial council positions.

===Prominent involvement of warlords===
According to human rights groups, at least 70 candidates with links to "illegal armed groups" were on the ballot list in the election.&lt;ref name=breath/&gt;

While the electoral law disallowed candidates with links to "illegal armed groups", and the [[#Systemic conflicts of interest|Karzai-appointed]] Independent Election Commission had barred 56 other candidates that it identified as being commanders or members of illegal militias, many of the bigger [[warlord]]s, including current parliamentarians and provincial council members elected in 2004 and 2005, simply bypassed this by registering their militias as [[private military company|private security companies]] or by having the right political connections.&lt;ref name=breath/&gt;&lt;ref name=canada&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=azZCwLShznhc |title=Afghan Election's Legitimacy May Hang on Canadian's Judgment |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;&lt;ref name=US2/&gt;

Both of Hamid Karzai's vice-presidential candidates and many of his key allies in the election are alleged to have committed widespread human rights violations and [[war crime]]s. [[Human Rights Watch]] has called for Vice President [[Karim Khalili]] and key ally, former army chief of staff General [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], to face trial before a special court for alleged war crimes.

Karzai's other vice-presidential candidate and former senior security advisor [[Mohammad Qasim Fahim]], along with Karzai backer and former energy minister [[Ismail Khan]], have also been listed by the human rights group as among the "worst perpetrators." Better known as Marshal Fahim, the vice-presidential candidate is accused of having been a former Communist secret police chief, murdering prisoners of war during the 1990s, running private armed militias, and involvement in kidnapping and other crimes after 2001. Fahim, a key U.S. ally in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], had also previously served as Karzai's First Vice President and Minister of Defense, having been appointed to those positions in the interim and transitional governments installed after the 2001 invasion. Karzai is also being advised by [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]], who is said to have first invited [[Osama bin Laden]] to Afghanistan and has lobbied for an amnesty for warlords.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=newopt/&gt;&lt;ref name=US2/&gt;&lt;ref name=former/&gt;&lt;ref name=boost/&gt;&lt;ref name=flames/&gt;&lt;ref name=Malalai/&gt;&lt;ref name=strange/&gt;&lt;ref name=HR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.af/pme/showdoc.aspx?Id=12 |title=Parliament of Afghanistan |publisher=Parliament.af |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113173536/http://www.parliament.af/pme/showdoc.aspx?Id=12 |archivedate=November 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=accused&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/27/world/asia/27kabul.html "Accused of Drug Ties, Afghan Official Worries U.S."].

Most prominently covered was the dramatic return, three days before the election, of General [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] from exile in Turkey as part of a deal to help bring President Karzai to victory. After allegedly [[Abdul Rashid Dostum#Akbar Bai kidnapping|kidnapping and beating up a political rival]], he was removed as Karzai's army chief of staff in late 2008 and disappeared into exile in Turkey. A key U.S. ally during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]], General Dostum is arguably the most notorious of Afghanistan's warlords, accused of massive human rights abuses, including the [[Dasht-i-Leili massacre]] of up to 2,000 Taliban who were suffocated in cargo containers in late 2001. He is also alleged to have crushed one of his own soldiers to death by tying him to the tracks of a tank.&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=US2/&gt;&lt;ref name=boost/&gt;&lt;ref name=Malalai/&gt;&lt;ref name=strange/&gt;

Many Afghans hate these powerbrokers in the Afghan government, angered that they evaded accountability for their human rights abuses in the nineties and regained power and land through private militias funded by the millions of dollars they were paid by the [[CIA]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 U.S. invasion]].&lt;ref name=US2/&gt;&lt;ref name=flames/&gt;&lt;ref name=Malalai/&gt;&lt;ref name=accused/&gt;&lt;ref name=US&gt;{{Cite web|last=Landay |first=Jonathan S. |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/story/1192161.html |title=Afghan election fraught with political risk for U.S |website=Miami Herald |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091007020740/http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/story/1192161.html |archivedate=October 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts have suggested that part of Karzai's strategy was to make deals with warlord allies to deliver large blocs of votes in return for key positions and influence in his new government or other significant promises.&lt;ref name=newopt/&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=boost/&gt;&lt;ref name=US/&gt;&lt;ref name=qtime/&gt;&lt;ref name=scheme/&gt;&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;

In the immediate aftermath of the election, analysts and diplomats suggested that Karzai's alliances with [[strongman (politics)|strongmen]] like General Dostum had paid off, delivering him large numbers of votes in the north. Fahim delivered Tajik votes for Karzai, Khalili brought Hazara support, and Dostum delivered Uzbek votes.&lt;ref name=newopt/&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=insult/&gt;&lt;ref name=pulls/&gt;

===Involvement of drug traffickers===
Karzai's vice-presidential candidate, Marshal [[Muhammad Qasim Fahim]], is also alleged to have long ties to drug trafficking, according to CIA reports from as early as 2002.&lt;ref name=accused/&gt;

A crucial U.S. ally as the military commander of the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]], he worked closely with the [[CIA]] in the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and was rewarded with millions of dollars in cash. He was then appointed First Vice President and Minister of Defense in the interim and transitional governments installed after the invasion, handling more millions of dollars sent by the U.S. in military aid to raise and arm a new Afghan army. CIA intelligence reports in 2002 showed that Fahim had a history of narcotics trafficking before the U.S. invasion, and that he was still actively involved after being installed as defense minister, trafficking heroin via cargo plane flights north through Russia, with aides in the Afghan Defense Ministry also involved.&lt;ref name=accused/&gt;

Hamid Karzai's election campaign manager for the south, and half-brother, [[Ahmed Wali Karzai]] – himself a candidate for re-election as the head of the Kandahar provincial council – has also long been alleged to have prominent drug trafficking ties, and was thought to control a significant proportion of Afghan heroin production. Numerous reports link him to the Afghan drug trade, according to officials from the White House, the [[State Department]] and the United States Embassy in Afghanistan. Officials at the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) and the Office of the [[Director of National Intelligence]] have alleged that the [[White House]] favored a hands-off approach with Ahmed Wali Karzai because of his political position. Only a week before the election he denied a report from German news magazine [[Stern (magazine)|Stern]] that said that British special forces had found several tons of [[opium]] on his land. He claimed that this was being done just before the election to hurt Hamid Karzai's chance of re-election.&lt;ref name=link&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/world/asia/05afghan.html "Reports Link Karzai’s Brother to Afghanistan Heroin Trade"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Peter Graff |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/GCA-Afghanistan-Pakistan/idUSTRE57C2Z220090813 |title=Afghan president's brother denies drugs link |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=narco&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/magazine/27AFGHAN-t.html Is "Afghanistan a Narco-State?"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to current and former U.S. officials, Ahmed Wali Karzai was also being paid by [[CIA]], and had been for the past eight years. The New York Times [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/world/asia/28intel.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all reported] on October 27, 2009, stating: "''The C.I.A.’s practices also suggest that the United States is not doing everything in its power to stamp out the lucrative Afghan drug trade.''" Also alleged to have orchestrated much of the [[#Election fraud|fraud]] in favour of his brother in the presidential election, Ahmed Wali Karzai was himself re-elected to the Kandahar provincial council in the August 20 vote.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/world/asia/28intel.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all "Brother of Afghan Leader Said to Be Paid by C.I.A."], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/Provincial/ElectedP28.html |title=IEC Final Uncertified Provincial Council Results 27-Oct-09 2:00 PM |publisher=Iec.org.af |accessdate=2010-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407184620/http://www.iec.org.af/results/Provincial/ElectedP28.html |archivedate=April 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC), said insecurity had "severely limited freedom of movement and constrained freedom of expression for candidates".&lt;ref name=AlJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=willnot/&gt; Security concerns prevented presidential candidates from campaigning in most of the provinces, and candidates running for provincial councils were under constant threat wherever they went.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt; Widespread cultural opposition to women in public life, further compounded by the lack of security, made campaigning by women candidates very difficult or impossible in many parts of the country, according to EU observers.&lt;ref name=intimid/&gt; [[File:Afghan presidential election, 2009 poster 4.jpg|thumb|Election billboard for [[Hamid Karzai]] in the outskirt of Kandahar City.]]

A UN election monitoring report said in early August that there was mounting evidence that the government was using state resources to favour Karzai. An election commission report in July noted that state-run [[Radio Television Afghanistan]] had dedicated 71% of prime-time news coverage to the president.&lt;ref name=willnot/&gt;&lt;ref name=key/&gt;

Issues at the forefront in the election campaign were the insurgency and [[#Lack of security|lack of security]], the conduct of foreign troops in Afghanistan and [[Civilian casualties of the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|civilian casualties]], [[#Election fraud|corruption]], and [[#Bribes being offered|poverty]]. Topics concerning women's rights were virtually never featured in news coverage of the electoral campaign, and women received almost no coverage in news reporting during the election, according to a European Union observation mission report.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;&lt;ref name=intimid/&gt;&lt;ref name=key&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tolo.tv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=261&amp;Itemid=42 |title=Foreign troops a key issue in Afghan presidential |publisher=Tolo.tv |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Karzai announced that he would invite the Taliban to a [[Loya Jirga]] (a grand tribal council) to try to restart stalled peace talks. A May pre-election poll reported that over two-thirds, 68%, of Afghans thought their government should hold talks and reconcile with the Taliban, and 18% did not know or refused to answer. Only 14% did not support government talks and reconciliation with the Taliban. Karzai also said the country was growing in stature and would be able to prevent "foreigners" from jailing Afghans, referring to the foreign military forces operating in their country.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;&lt;ref name=willnot/&gt;&lt;ref name=IRI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/story.html?id=1894765 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110104045050/http://www.nationalpost.com/m/story.html?id=1894765 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-04 |title=Candidates take campaigns across Afghanistan |website=National Post |location=Canada |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ramazan Bashardost, the insurgency was motivated by the presence of foreign military forces in their country, by the presence of warlords and human rights abusers in the Western-backed regime, by the corruption in that government, and by poverty. Bashardost vowed that he would not allow foreign troops to stay in Afghanistan if elected.&lt;ref name=MrClean/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6797093.ece Abdullah Abdullah throws down election gauntlet to President Karzai]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdul Salam Rocketi]], a former [[Mujahideen]] "[[freedom fighter]]" – whose name came from using rocket-propelled grenades to shoot down Soviet helicopters – and former Taliban commander, said he would announce an amnesty for all the [[insurgents]] if he won the election.&lt;ref name=ordinary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=111349105 |title=Candidates' Stories Reflect Afghanistan's Struggle |publisher=Npr.org |date=2009-07-30 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Election Commission accredited 160,000 observers for the election. The Afghan Free and Fair Elections Foundation, the largest local monitoring group, said that it would have observers at 70 per cent of polling stations but couldn't observe the remainder because of security concerns.&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;

===Debates===
Two candidate debates took place before the August 20 election. The first debate was held on July 23 and was broadcast on [[Tolo TV]]. It was supposed to feature Karzai, Abdullah, and Ghani, though Karzai later declined to take part, with his campaign blaming Tolo TV for being biased against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Carlotta |last=Gall |author2=Wafa, Abdul Waheed |title=Afghanistan’s Leader Skips an Election Debate, Claiming Bias |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/24/world/asia/24karzai.html |work=The New York Times |date=2009-07-23 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second debate took place on August 16 on [[RTA TV]] (the state broadcaster) and [[Radio Free Afghanistan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Abubakar |last=Siddique |title=In Landmark Debate, Afghan Presidential Contenders Challenge Karzai |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/In_Landmark_Debate_Afghan_Presidential_Contenders_Challenge_Karzai_On_Corruption_Warlords/1800957.html |publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=2009-08-16 |accessdate=2009-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090820072029/http://www.rferl.org/content/In_Landmark_Debate_Afghan_Presidential_Contenders_Challenge_Karzai_On_Corruption_Warlords/1800957.html| archivedate=August 20, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; involving Karzai, Ghani, and Bashardost, with Abdullah not participating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Karzai, rivals debate as Afghan elections near |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/08/16/afghanistan.elections/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2009-08-16 |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-election polls===
The pre-election polls, funded by the U.S. government and conducted by Washington D.C.-based organizations, found Hamid Karzai leading his nearest rival, Abdullah Abdullah, by a wide margin, but suggested that he would not have the 50% support required to win the August 20 election outright, raising the prospect of a run off election in October.&lt;ref name=AlJ&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/08/200981194629468195.html Polls: Karzai could face run-off], ''[[Al Jazeera]]'', 2009-08-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=willnot&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6010602/Hamid-Karzai-will-not-win-Afghan-election-outright.html Hamid Karzai 'will not' win Afghan election outright], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 2009-08-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-08-14-voa20.cfm New Poll Shows Afghan President Leading Race for a Second Term] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816160138/http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-08-14-voa20.cfm |date=August 16, 2009 }}, ''[[Voice of America]]'', 2008-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iri.org/mena/afghanistan/pdfs/2009%20August%2014%20Survey%20of%20Afghan%20Public%20Opinion%20July%2016-26,%202009.pdf Afghanistan Public Opinion Survey:July 16–26, 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824005330/http://www.iri.org/mena/afghanistan/pdfs/2009%20August%2014%20Survey%20of%20Afghan%20Public%20Opinion%20July%2016-26%2C%202009.pdf |date=August 24, 2009 }}, ''[[International Republican Institute]]'', 2008-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;

The administering of public opinion polls for the 2009 presidential election was beset by numerous difficulties because of the lack of security, harsh geography, and lack of accurate demographic data, but analysts hoped that with improved sampling techniques the pre-election polls would be more predictive of [[#Post-election vote count and investigations|the outcome]] than they were in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Brian |last=Palmer |title=How Accurate Is Pre-Election Polling in Afghanistan? |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2225508/ |publisher=Slate |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2009-08-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090823115456/http://www.slate.com/id/2225508/| archivedate=August 23, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lack of security==
Despite the surge of 30 thousand additional foreign military troops into Afghanistan in the three to four months leading up to the elections, and major military operations in the weeks and days ahead of the election, 12 out of Afghanistan's 34 provinces remained classified as "high risk" by the Afghan Ministry of Interior – meaning limited or no government presence – casting into doubt the ability of over one-third of the country to participate in the elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6036318.ece Extra Nato troops for Afghan elections]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hires/&gt;&lt;ref name=USbrit&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://story.heraldglobe.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/15665b944045da4a/id/533627/cs/1/ |title=US, British soldiers killed in attacks in Afghanistan |publisher=Story.heraldglobe.com |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711163420/http://story.heraldglobe.com/index.php/ct/9/cid/15665b944045da4a/id/533627/cs/1/ |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=breath&gt;{{Cite news|author=Canada |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/free-and-fair-elections-in-afghanistan-dont-hold-your-breath/article1255051/ |title=Free and fair elections in Afghanistan?

[[File:Aghanistan 2009 -- 'Go vote!'.jpg|thumb|'Go vote!' billboard prominently depicting armed security forces at polling stations.]]

A week and a half before the election, the Afghan government announced that it had hired 10,000 tribesmen to provide additional security for the election in almost two-thirds of Afghanistan's provinces. The men were being paid $160 a month, would be non-uniformed, and would use their own guns to secure polling stations in 21 out of Afghanistan's 34 provinces.&lt;ref name=willnot/&gt;&lt;ref name=hires&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/world/breakingnews/Afghanistan-hires-10_000-tribesmen-for-security-at-polling-stations-in-presidential-election-52954712.html Afghanistan hires 10,000 tribesmen for security at polling stations in presidential election]&lt;/ref&gt;

ISAF officials stated two days before the election that the 60,000-troop ISAF military force in Afghanistan would halt all offensive operations on polling day in order to help Afghan forces maintain security for the presidential election. The order to halt operations and divert forces to help security followed a similar order issued to Afghan forces by Afghan President Hamid Karzai.&lt;ref name=halted&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/08/18/afghanistan-presidential-election-nato471.html |title=Offensives halted for Afghan election |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8185222.stm |title=Outrage over Afghan child deaths |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-05 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the lack of security, the full list of polling centers was only announced on the actual polling day.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

A day before the election, hundreds of polling stations were ordered closed in parts of the country where military and police forces fear to go and would not be able to provide protection for election monitors. It had previously been estimated that as many as 700 out of 7,000 polling stations across the country would not open because of the widespread insecurity.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;&lt;ref name=kandahar&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/16/afghanistan-hamid-karzai-elections Karzai counts on tribal vote to win Kandahar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819133847/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/aug/16/afghanistan-hamid-karzai-elections |date=August 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On election day, the Afghan election commission reported that only 6,200 polling stations had operated.&lt;ref name=hires/&gt;&lt;ref name=knockout&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/karzai-quick-to-claim-knockout-victory-20090821-etu8.html |title=Karzai quick to claim knockout victory |work=The Age |date=2009-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | location=Melbourne, Australia | first1=James | last1=Rupert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Kandahar province]], the mayor of [[Kandahar]] city, Ghulam Haider Hamidi, said that he would not go vote. "For the last three years the security is getting worse, day by day," Hamidi stated. "Even a child understands that the election day is not safe." His daughter, [[Rangina Hamidi]], a prominent women's advocate, said that it was not worth the risk and that she would not vote either:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Attacks ahead of the vote===
Already in the month preceding the election day, there was a rise in violent incidents, all over Afghanistan, including a [[suicide bomber]] attack on the [[India]]n embassy in Kabul on July 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kabul-suicide-bomber-kills-41-in-worst-attack-since-fall-of-taliban-862060.html |title=Kabul suicide bomber kills 41 in worst attack since fall of Taliban - Suspicion falls on Pakistani intelligence after embassy blast |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2010-04-07|first1=Miles|last1=Amoore|first2=Kim|last2=Sengupta}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ISAF spokesperson stated two days before the election that insurgent attacks had averaged 32 per day in the last 10 days, but had spiked up to 48 attacks per day within the last four days.&lt;ref name=insurgent&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/08/18/afghanistan-presidential-election-nato471.html |title=Insurgent attacks spike in run-up to Afghan vote |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the major attacks reported:

*On August 15, 2009, five days before the election, a suicide car bomb struck NATO's headquarters at the core of Kabul's most fortified district, in the equivalent of Baghdad's [[Green Zone]]. The massive blast that shook the city left seven people dead and 91 wounded, including several foreign soldiers, four Afghan soldiers, and a member of parliament. The attack, inside several rings of security around the fortified embassies and government buildings by the presidential palace, was confirmed by a Taliban spokesperson to have had as targets the NATO military headquarters (HQ ISAF) and the U.S. embassy less than 150 meters away, and to have been part of a campaign to disrupt the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Fawad Muslim |url=http://www.afghanistannewscenter.com/news/2009/august/aug162009.html#11 |title=Afghanistan News August 16, 2009 |publisher=Afghanistannewscenter.com |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/crossroads-afghanistan/story/2009/08/15/kabul-attack.html |title=Canadian among injured in Kabul car bombing |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-08-15 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 12 vehicles were destroyed and several surrounding buildings were damaged by the blast.

*On August 19, 2009, gunmen seized control of a bank in downtown Kabul one day before the Afghan election. The bold raid was the third major attack in Kabul in five days, shattering the capital city's relative calm since the last major attacks there in February. Police reported that three fighters and three policemen were killed in the four-hour-long siege.&lt;ref name=gunmen&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2009/08/19/world/international-us-afghanistan.html "Gunmen In Bloody Kabul Siege on Eve Of Afghan Election"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media blackout imposed===
In decrees issued two days before the presidential election, the Afghan government imposed censorship for election day, barring news organizations from reporting any information about violence between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m. out of concern that reports of violence could reduce voter turnout and damage chances of staging a successful election. Low turnout could undermine the credibility of the election – and could also hurt Karzai's results in the election if not enough ethnic [[Pashtun people]], who form his base of support, turned out for the vote in the insurgent-dominated south of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=bans&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/southAsiaNews/idINIndia-41825520090818 |title=Afghanistan bans reporting of attacks during vote |publisher=In.reuters.com |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/world/asia/19afghan.html?em "Afghanistan Imposes Censorship on Election Day"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of the election, police at the Kabul bank beat journalists and bystanders with rifle butts to keep them away from the scene where the bloody siege had taken place.&lt;ref name=gunmen/&gt;

The head of the Afghan Independent Journalists' Association (AIJA) said that the government censorship decrees would not stop Afghan and foreign journalists from providing information to the public during the critical election period: "It shows the weakness of the government and we condemn such moves to deprive people from accessing news."&lt;ref name=bans/&gt;

Human Rights Watch also criticized the news censorship, stating: "An attempt to censor the reporting of violence is an unreasonable violation of press freedoms."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/449668/1/.html |title=Afghanistan calls for media blackout on polling day |publisher=Channelnewsasia.com |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan called the Afghan government's limitation of media freedom on election day "a violation of democratic principles".&lt;ref name=FEFA/&gt;

===Election day violence===
{{quote|text="''This was one of the most violent days witnessed in Afghanistan in the last eight years.''"|sign=Rachel Reid, researcher for [[Human Rights Watch]] in Afghanistan&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;}}

Afghan government officials reported that 73 incidents of violence had taken place in 15 provinces throughout the country during voting. That number of attacks represented a 50% spike over NATO figures for the [[#Attacks ahead of the vote|violence in the days]] leading up to the poll.&lt;ref name=killed26/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/world/asia/21afghan.html?bl=&amp;ei=5087&amp;en=dd1c0cc23ceed45e&amp;ex=1250913600&amp;pagewanted=all Turnout Seen as Uneven in Afghanistan as Polls Close], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Jon Boone |author2=Peter Beaumont |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/20/afghanistan-elections-taliban-attack-voters |title=Afghanistan poll legitimacy fears as Taliban violence keeps voters away |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-08-20|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government figures were impossible to verify, however, because of the government-imposed ban against reporting any information on violence. Anecdotal evidence suggested that the number of election day attacks could actually be much higher than the government reports.&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;

Another report since has placed the number of attacks on election day in Afghanistan at more than 130.&lt;ref name=USbrit/&gt; - Broken link in citation.

ISAF has since reported that more than 400 militant attacks occurred on election day – making it one of the most violent days in Afghanistan since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8221709.stm |title=More Afghan poll results expected |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; By comparison, ISAF had stated two days before the election that insurgent attacks had averaged 32 per day in the previous 10 days.&lt;ref name=insurgent/&gt;

In one of the worst reported attacks, militants stormed the town of [[Baghlan]] in northern Afghanistan, forcing all polling stations there to be closed down, with fighting lasting for most of the day. The district police chief was among those killed.&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;&lt;ref name=amid&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6803686.ece Violence forces polls to shut amid low Afghan turnout]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocket attacks, gun battles, and bomb blasts occurred across much of the country, closing scores of polling stations. The province of Kandahar alone was hit by 122 insurgent rockets. Rockets and mortars were launched into [[Kandahar]], the second largest city in the country, [[Lashkar Gah]], the capital of Helmand province, [[Tirin Kot]], the provincial capital of [[Uruzgan]], as well as other cities.&lt;ref name=FEFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;&lt;ref name=amid/&gt;

Two British soldiers and one U.S. soldier were also killed in separate roadside bomb blasts in the southern and eastern parts of Afghanistan on election day.&lt;ref name=USbrit/&gt;

On August 25, 2009, a few hours after the first preliminary results were released, a cluster of vehicle bombs detonated together in a massive explosion that killed at least 43 people and wounded at least 65 in [[Kandahar]] city, in the bloodiest attack since July 2008. The force of the giant blast, at the center of the city in a district that includes U.N. facilities and an Afghan intelligence office, caused houses and buildings around to collapse, shattering windows around the city, and sending flames shooting into the sky. People miles outside of town felt the rumble. The main target appeared to be a Japanese company that had recently taken over a contract to build a road that insurgents had stalled for several months. A Taliban spokesman denied responsibility, saying the group condemned the attack.&lt;ref name=kills41&gt;[http://www.kansascity.com/news/world/story/1406087.html Explosion in Afghanistan kills at least 41] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/presidential-runoff-could-spell-trouble-for-afghanistan/article1264308/ |title=Presidential runoff could spell trouble for Afghanistan |work=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=2010-04-07 |location=Toronto, Canada |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829161404/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/presidential-runoff-could-spell-trouble-for-afghanistan/article1264308/ |archive-date=August 29, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=widens&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9AAJ9M82 Karzai widens lead over Abdullah in Afghan vote] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907194704/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9AAJ9M82 |date=September 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seven&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/30/weekinreview/30filkins.html "Seven Days That Shook Afghanistan"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, another bomb blast in southern Afghanistan killed four U.S. soldiers, bringing the total number of foreign troop deaths in Afghanistan this year to 295, making the 2009 death toll for foreign forces in Afghanistan the highest in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|eight-year war]] since the 2001 U.S. invasion.&lt;ref name=kills41/&gt;&lt;ref name=seven/&gt;

August 2009 ended as the deadliest month for U.S. troops in Afghanistan since the U.S. invasion in 2001. At least 51 American soldiers were killed in the month of the election, the highest monthly toll for the U.S. in the nearly eight-year-long war, surpassing the previous high of 45 in July. The month was also the worst in the war in terms of the overall death toll for all foreign military troops, with 77 deaths. Along with 76 deaths in July, the two months were by far the deadliest for the foreign military troops in Afghanistan, according to figures from icasualties.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/08/31/2048560.aspx |title=August deadliest month for U.S. military |publisher=Firstread.msnbc.msn.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928234410/http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2009/08/31/2048560.aspx |archivedate=September 28, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icasualties.org/oef/ |title=Coalition Military Fatalities By Year and Month |publisher=Icasualties.org |accessdate=2010-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406083558/http://icasualties.org/oef/ |archivedate=April 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2009, a day on which the IEC was to have announced the first full preliminary results, waves of attacks engulfed Afghanistan. At least 66 people – including 24 civilians, 5 U.S. soldiers, and 26 Afghan policemen, soldiers, and guards – were killed in violence that swept across the country. The bloodshed seemed to demonstrate the ability of insurgents, including the Taliban, to carry out attacks in most parts of the country despite the surge to a record number of foreign military troops in the eight-year war.&lt;ref name=engulf&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/world/asia/13afghan.html?hp "Wave of Attacks Engulfs Afghanistan"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dozens&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/homepageCrisis/idUSISL479504._CH_.2400 |title=Afghan attacks kill dozens; Karzai leads in poll |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spate&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2009-09-12-voa12.cfm |title=Spate of Attacks Across Afghanistan Kills Dozens |publisher=Voanews.com |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330235410/http://www1.voanews.com/english/2009-09-12-voa12.cfm |archivedate=March 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{Cite news|author=Declan Walsh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/13/hamid-karzai-power-sharing-afghanistan |title=Pressure grows in Afghanistan for Hamid Karzai to strike a deal |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-09-13|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible ethnic imbalance===
The lack of security and its effects on voter registration, polling station accessibility, and voter turnout – mainly in regions populated by Afghanistan's [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribes, which make up 32-37% of the country's population – have raised serious concerns about an ethnic imbalance in the Afghan election.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=qtime&gt;{{Cite web|last=Margolis |first=Eric |url=http://www.torontosun.com/comment/columnists/eric_margolis/2009/08/23/10569911-sun.html |title=Quittin' time in Afghanistan |website=Toronto Sun  |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;&lt;ref name=mock&gt;{{Cite news|author=Rosie DiManno |url=https://www.thestar.com/News/World/article/686508 |title=Afghan vote called 'mockery' |work=Toronto Star  |date= 2009-08-26|accessdate=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text="''There are districts that I am 100 percent sure no government worker can go to - But you are telling me that still so many people registered? I don't believe it.''"|sign=Roshanak Wardak, Afghan member of parliament from Wardak Province&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;}}

According to leaders and residents of [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] districts, many voter registration centers in their districts never opened during the registration period and few people even left their homes, let alone registered. Provincial officials have also said that election registration teams rarely, if ever, dared to venture outside of the district capitals.&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

In the province of [[Maidan Wardak Province|Wardak]], with six of the province's eight districts controlled by insurgents, this resulted in the two [[Hazara people|Hazara]]-dominated districts of the province forming the bulk of the new voters registered. Independent Election Commission (IEC) Deputy Chief Electoral Officer Zekra Barakzai stated that "the registration numbers in Pashtun districts are very low."&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

According to Habibullah Rafeh, a policy analyst with the Afghan Academy of Sciences, there could be an ethnic imbalance if the same problem was reproduced in other Pashtun regions of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

In Helmand province, where 62% of the population is [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and where U.S. Marines conducted major offensives, only 75 people were found to have been registered in one town of 2,000 residents.&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt;

For those that did register to vote, the absence of polling stations because of lack of security may have been the next obstacle. In [[Helmand]] province, Haji Mohammad, from Marja district, said that he sold all his family’s voting cards because there were no polling stations in their area.&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;

On the day before the election, Afghan election officials ordered 443 polling stations within insurgent territory in the Pashtun-dominated provinces of [[Paktika]], [[Paktia]], [[Khost Province|Khost]], [[Zabul]], [[Helmand]] and [[Kandahar Province|Kandahar]] to stay closed because of the lack of security. While the Afghan election commission had until recently presented a figure of 7,000 polling stations, on election day it reported that only 6,200 polling stations had actually operated.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;&lt;ref name=knockout/&gt;

Compounded with its effects on voter registration and polling station accessibility, the lack of security also seems to have been a major factor in the much [[#Low voter turnout|lower voter turnout]] in the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]-dominated south of the country, where turnout was as low as 5–10%, effectively disenfranchising the region.&lt;ref name=qtime/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/world/asia/22kabul.html "Afghan Election Poses New Tests for Washington"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

On election day, Abdul Hamid, a tribal elder from [[Paghman District]] – a mostly [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] district bordering Wardak province – was reported as insisting that 40 to 50% of eligible [[Paghman District|Paghman]] voters had not received voting cards, and therefore could not cast a ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/212916/ |title=Anti-Climax in Afghanistan |website=Newsweek |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928045812/http://www.newsweek.com/id/212916 |archivedate=September 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aims.org.af/afg/dist_profiles/unhcr_district_profiles/centra/kabul/paghmani.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027173613/http://www.aims.org.af/afg/dist_profiles/unhcr_district_profiles/centra/kabul/paghmani.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-27 |title=UNHCR profile for Paghman District |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election fraud==
Starting in December 2008, journalist [[Anand Gopal]] and others have reported extensively on the widespread instances of fraud in the voter registration process, with the registration rolls including "phantom voters" and multiple registration cards issued to a single registrant, amongst numerous other problems.&lt;ref name=shut&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6050245/Afghan-polling-stations-shut-amid-fears-of-voting-fraud.html |title=Afghan polling stations shut amid fears of voting fraud |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

Two days before the election, an investigation by the [[BBC]] also found and reported evidence of widespread [[electoral fraud]] and corruption in the Afghan presidential election.&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;&lt;ref name=unearth&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pannell |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8207315.stm |title=Afghan election fraud is unearthed |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-18 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting cards being sold===
After being informed that voting cards were being sold in the capital, [[Kabul]], an Afghan working for the BBC posed as a potential buyer and was offered one thousand voting cards on the spot, for $10 (£6) per card. Samples provided were all authentic with the name, photo and home details of the voter on them.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt; Other parties also offered to sell the BBC investigators thousands of votes, and some sellers have even been arrested by the authorities.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;

A flourishing black market in voter registration cards has also sprung up across the south of Afghanistan where they were being sold for £6 to £18 each.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt; The Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan (FEFA), an independent election monitoring organisation, had also collected evidence of election fraud, particularly in the voter registration process.&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt; The monitoring group found that in many places people were being issued multiple voting cards, that voting cards were often issued for children, and that stacks of voting cards were given to men who falsely claimed that they were for women in their households.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt; Long lists of imaginary female relatives were found to have been concocted during an attempt to update the electoral roll. In Kandahar, "Britney Jamilia Spears" appeared among the names registered.&lt;ref name=kandahar/&gt; FEFA found that multiple registrations of a single person were taking place in at least 40% of all centers in one phase of the registration drive, and in one case, investigators found that about 500 voting registration cards were given to just one individual in [[Badghis province]].&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

The independent election observers also reported that as many as one in five registrations were for people under the voting age – in many cases as young as 12 years old.&lt;ref name=scheme&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48142 |title=Karzai and Warlords Mount Massive Vote Fraud Scheme |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524074225/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=48142 |archivedate=May 24, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a pre-election report by the Afghanistan Analyst Network, a Kabul-based group of foreign experts, as many as three million voters on the register were feared to not exist. The huge numbers of vote cards issued for phantom voters have raised concerns about massive electoral fraud.&lt;ref name=insult&gt;{{Cite news|author= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/23/havana-marking-afghanistan-election |title=It is insulting to Afghans to declare their election a success |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kandahar/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt; Shahrzad Akbar, a senior analyst with FEFA, stated that because the monitoring body was only able to investigate a few parts of the country, the election irregularities and abuses could be even more widespread:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''We couldn't observe how it went in every single district or village. I am sure that there are cases of multiple card distribution that we don't know about. But those incidents that we do know about caused us enough concern to contact the Independent Election Commission and say, 'please prevent this!'''"&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bribes being offered===
There has also been evidence that people working for candidates have deliberately tried to influence the outcome of the election by offering bribes to buy large numbers of votes.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;

In [[Baghlan province]], a tribal elder and former military commander described how the voter fraud scheme worked. Within the hierarchical structure of Afghanistan, key local leaders like him have the ability to persuade large numbers of people to vote for one candidate or another. He reported that he and other local leaders had been approached by teams from the two leading contenders of the presidential election with monetary bribes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''If one candidate gives $10,000, then the other gives $20,000 and a third one offers even more. It has become such a lucrative and competitive business. I don't know where they get their money from.''"&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a U.S. government-funded poll released the week before the poll, the two leading contenders in the election were [[Hamid Karzai]], the Pashtun incumbent, and Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]], the former foreign minister with strong ties to the former [[Northern Alliance]].&lt;ref name=halted/&gt;&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

In [[Helmand]] province, tribal leaders and local people also described a systematic attempt by Karzai supporters to collect or buy voter registration cards from people in an electoral fraud scheme allegedly orchestrated by Karzai's half-brother and campaign manager for the south, [[Ahmed Wali Karzai]].&lt;ref name=buy&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6792729.ece President Karzai’s supporters ‘buy’ votes for Afghanistan election], ''[[The Times]]'', 2009-08-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kandahar/&gt;

===Armed coercion===
Along with bribes, cases of threats by [[#Prominent involvement of warlords|warlords]] have also been reported. In [[Herat]] province, a village elder said he had been threatened with "very unpleasant consequences" by a local commander if the residents of his village failed to vote for Karzai.&lt;ref name=breath/&gt;&lt;ref name=scheme/&gt;

Other instances of coercion in the electoral process – ranging from threatening phone calls to beatings and killings – by government agents (particularly [[#Prominent involvement of warlords|security forces and armed factions aligned with certain candidates]]) have been extensively documented.&lt;ref name=breath/&gt;

The hiring of 10,000 tribesmen by the Karzai government to secure polling stations in 21 out of 34 provinces, without uniforms and using their own guns, also raised questions of voter intimidation.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=breath/&gt;&lt;ref name=willnot/&gt;

During the voting, intimidation of voters by some powerful candidates, in particular local candidates running for provincial council seats, was reported by observers.&lt;ref name=intimid/&gt;

In the northern province of [[Balkh Province|Balkh]], people were forced at gunpoint to vote for former foreign minister Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]], according to complaints lodged with the election commission by former finance minister Dr. [[Ashraf Ghani]] in the days after the vote.&lt;ref name=UNwarns/&gt;

Meanwhile, both the Karzai and Abdullah camps have accused each other's side of having engaged in intimidation of voters, including allegations from Abdullah of intimidation and other interference by the head of the border police in Kandahar province, [[General Abdul Raziq]], and his forces on behalf of Karzai.&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;

===Hundreds of polling stations shut down===
The day before the election, Afghan election officials ordered more than 440 polling stations to stay closed during the vote out of fears of election fraud. The Independent Election Commission (IEC) said Hamid Karzai's supporters were trying to keep open polling stations deep within insurgent-held regions where the army and police fear going and where voting could not be properly monitored by observers.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

An international observer monitoring the election proceedings said that the IEC had come under "a lot of pressure" from the Karzai administration to open more polling stations in the provinces of [[Paktika]], [[Paktia]], [[Khost Province|Khost]], [[Zabul]], [[Helmand]] and [[Kandahar province|Kandahar]] where the government has little control beyond major urban centers.&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

Registration figures suggested that concerted preparations for vote-rigging had taken place in Khost and Paktia. Records suspiciously showed that twice as many women as men had registered to vote, while a thriving black market in voting cards has appeared with cards being bought and sold by the thousands for £6 to £18 each.&lt;ref name=afraud/&gt;&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

===Systemic conflicts of interest===
Government workers, required to be impartial in the election, were found by election observers to have actively and illegally campaigned for candidates.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt; Investigators have also found members of political parties occupying positions as election officials.&lt;ref name=intimid&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/23/world/asia/23afghan.html "Intimidation and Fraud Observed in Afghan Election"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marred/&gt;

The most problematic conflict of interest may be the fact that the country's Independent Elections Commission (IEC) that oversees the whole election is not "independent" of the Karzai administration at all. All seven of its members were appointed to the commission by Hamid Karzai, and its chairman, a former Karzai advisor in [[Herat province]], has reportedly made no secret of his partisan support for the incumbent president.&lt;ref name=clouds&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Jon Boone |author2=Daniel Nasaw |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/23/afghanistan-elections-hamid-karzai |title=Cloud hangs over legitimacy of Afghan election result as &amp;#124; World news |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-08-23|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scheme/&gt;&lt;ref name=intimid/&gt;&lt;ref name=bias&gt;{{Cite web|last=Duparcq |first=Emmanuel |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i_sTDs1IFG4TmQ47XKOIsoEnmQnA |title='Biased' Afghan vote commission under fire |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the days following the election, Karzai's main challenger, Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]], denounced the chairman of the IEC as working for Mr. Karzai. Foreign election observers have also criticized the Independent Election Commission as being full of Karzai appointees.&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;&lt;ref name=bias/&gt;

The BBC has reported that the Independent Election Commission has been accused of not doing enough to prevent abuses that have been brought to its attention.&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;

FEFA, the country's largest independent election monitoring organization, has also raised questions about the impartiality of Independent Election Commission (IEC) local officials, and noted that questions about IEC impartiality constituted "a trend that has persisted throughout the electoral process". Throughout election day, numerous reports were received of local IEC officials improperly interfering in the voting process.&lt;ref name=FEFA&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fefa.org.af/pressrelease/FEFA-Election%20Day%20Statement-Aug20.pdf |title=FEFA - Election Day Press Statement 20 August 2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902082723/http://fefa.org.af/pressrelease/FEFA-Election%20Day%20Statement-Aug20.pdf |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bias/&gt;

U.S.-based [[Human Rights Watch]] said the independence of the Independent Election Commission was compromised by Karzai's appointment of the IEC chairman without parliamentary oversight and accused the IEC chairman of displaying "clear bias".&lt;ref name=bias/&gt;

===Voting irregularities===
Election day news included reports of widespread electoral fraud throughout the day.&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt; At one polling station in [[Nad-e-Ali]], in the [[Helmand]] province, just over 400 people had voted by 1 p.m., but three hours later, the figure had apparently rose to some 1,200, despite that guards had hardly seen any voters. Election officials were later seen counting piles of ballot papers, without checking simply declaring the votes had been cast for Karzai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/kim-sengupta-a-dubious-litmus-test-for-the-poll-1775228.html |title=Kim Sengupta: A dubious litmus test for the poll - Our man in Helmand questions the election's integrity |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 8 a.m., only one hour after the polls had opened, officials at the U.S. embassy in Kabul were receiving complaints of fraud.&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;

[[Ashraf Ghani]], one of the presidential candidates and also reported as favoured by the U.S. for a "chief executive" position to run the country regardless of the election outcome, e-mailed U.S. officials with reports of his opponents stuffing election ballot boxes. Other candidates also lodged similar complaints with U.S. officials – who referred them instead to the national election body.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama/&gt;&lt;ref name=squand/&gt;

Abdullah, the main opponent to Hamid Karzai in the presidential election, said that his supporters were lodging complaints of election fraud, in particular from [[Kandahar province]]. Hours after the polls closed, his deputy campaign manager, Saleh Mohammad Registani, alleged that "very large scale" fraud had taken place in at least three of the country's 34 provinces, including [[ballot stuffing|ballot box stuffing]].&lt;ref name=killed26/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt; [[File:Inked finger.jpg|thumb|An Afghan man showing his inked finger, which was part of the procedure to prevent people from voting twice.]]

Presidential candidate [[Mirwais Yasini]], the deputy speaker of the lower house of parliament, lodged 31 complaints with Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission (IEC), telling the BBC that both main camps had engaged in widespread electoral fraud.&lt;ref name=fraud2&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8215612.stm |title=Afghan polling 'marked by fraud' |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Election monitor group FEFA reported receiving cases throughout the voting day of "improper interference" by local Independent Election Commission (IEC) staff in the voting process, raising continued concerns about the impartiality of IEC election officials. Their post-election provisional report also detailed cases of election officials being ejected from polling stations by representatives of candidates.&lt;ref name=FEFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt;&lt;ref name=fraud2/&gt;

Photojournalist Peter Nicholls of ''[[The Times]]'' photographically [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6804730.ece documented] an apparent case of ballot box stuffing amid low voter turnout in Pul-e-Charkhi, in [[Kabul province]].&lt;ref name=poll&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6804730.ece Afghan polling station gave clear image of nothing but a box of tricks]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a further irregularity, the supposedly indelible ink used to mark the index finger of voters to prevent voting more than once was found to be easily removable in many instances – a repeat of a problem that had also occurred in the 2004 and 2005 elections. According to Havana Marking, director of a documentary on the elections, by 9 a.m. people were bleaching their fingers and casting ballots twice. The documentary makers filmed "a cafe full of young men laughing and deciding who to vote for the second time".&lt;ref name=killed26/&gt;&lt;ref name=newopt/&gt;&lt;ref name=scheme/&gt;&lt;ref name=insult/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;

Complaints about the ink were made by the camps of all three of the main challengers in the presidential race. Aides to Dr. Abdullah reported that at the polling station where he had cast his ballot, voters had been able to clean the ink from their fingertips within minutes. [[Ashraf Ghani]]'s team had reports of inferior ink that was easily removed being used in the western city of [[Herat]]. Presidential candidate and former planning minister Dr. [[Ramazan Bashardost]] charged that the indelible ink could be washed off easily, and lodged an official complaint endorsed by a member of the Election Complaints Commission. The former minister, who had been running third in the pre-election polls, said: "This is not an election. This is a comedy."&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6804584.ece 'Indelible' ink used to mark Afghan voters may stain election success]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flawed election==
Western officials conceded the election would be flawed, admitting that there had been election corruption, that there was apathy, that the lack of security would stop some from voting, and that precautions designed to prevent fraud would be ineffective in many parts of the country where election monitors cannot go.&lt;ref name=afraud/&gt;&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;&lt;ref name=fraud&gt;{{Cite news |last=Press |first=Associated |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns-ap-as-afghanistan,0,4315489.story?track=rss |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091003215921/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/sns%2Dap%2Das%2Dafghanistan%2C0%2C4315489.story?track%3Drss |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-10-03 |title=Afghan vote fraud allegations mount, threatening credibility of election |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2010-02-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/state-of-afghanistan-deteriorating-top-us-commander-says/article1261705/ |title=State of Afghanistan 'deteriorating,' top U.S. commander says |work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2010-04-07 |location=Toronto, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international community accepted that fraud would be inevitable in the presidential election, but hoped that it could be minimised to an "acceptable level where it will not alter the final result".&lt;ref name=shut/&gt;

Former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan [[Ronald E. Neumann]] put the odds of an election that would appear "good enough" at "50-50".&lt;ref name=scheme/&gt;

Additionally, 7 million fewer Afghans were even allowed to vote than in the last election. Thousands of complaints were filed, and there was blatant evidence of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/184618/index.en.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615095610/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/184618/index.en.shtml |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low voter turnout==
[[NATO]] officials announced in March 2009 that 15.6 million voters had registered to vote, roughly half of the country's population, and that 35 to 38 percent of registered voters were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=7057152 |title=NATO: 15.6 million Afghans are registered to vote |accessdate=2009-03-12 |agency=Associated Press |date=2009-03-11 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those registration numbers were disputed, however, by the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan and media reports, which suggested [[#Election fraud|widespread fraudulent activity]] in the election process.&lt;ref name=afraud&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6802683.ece Afghanistan votes amid fear of Taleban attacks and alleged fraud] [http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20100418021010/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/afghanistan/article6802683.ece Archived copy] at the Icelandic Web Archive (April 18, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=buy/&gt;&lt;ref name=marred&gt;{{Cite news |author=[[Anand Gopal]] |title=Afghan voter registration marred |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1224/p06s01-wosc.html |publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=2008-12-24 |accessdate=2009-08-18 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.csmonitor.com%2FWorld%2FAsia-South-Central%2F2008%2F1224%2Fp06s01-wosc.html&amp;date=2010-02-18 |archivedate=February 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unearth/&gt;

While UN, American and Afghan officials quickly hailed the election as a success, evidence from observers on the ground and from journalists suggested that the Taliban had succeeded in deterring many Afghans from voting.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=insult/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;&lt;ref name=amid/&gt;&lt;ref name=mock/&gt;&lt;ref name=bias/&gt;

At the end of the voting day, top election official Zekria Barakzai estimated the [[voter turnout]] across the country at around 40–50%. One Western diplomat slapped aside 50 percent as a "joke". On August 21, [[The New York Times]] [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/world/asia/22afghan.html article] reported that overall turnout was expected to be about 40%. On August 26, [[The Daily Telegraph]] reported that turnout may have been little more than 35% nationwide and was less than 10% in some districts of Helmand and Kandahar.&lt;ref name=killed26&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleid=498012 |title=Low turnout seen in Afghan election; 26 killed |publisher=Philstar.com |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;&lt;ref name=Abdullah&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6096661/Afghanistan-election-Hamid-Karzai-widens-lead-over-Abdullah-Abdullah.html |title=Afghanistan election: Hamid Karzai widens lead over Abdullah Abdullah |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-08-27 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures released by the IEC on August 31, when the ballots from almost half of the country's polling stations had been counted, pointed to a turnout of only 30% to 35%. Most of the ballots counted to that point were from the north of the country.&lt;ref name=latest&gt;{{Cite web|author=Siek, Stephanie |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4615076,00.html |title=Latest Afghan vote count shows Karzai still in lead |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent election observers in the country almost all agreed that voter turnout was far lower than in the previous presidential election in 2004.&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=mock/&gt;

The turnout was uneven across the country with low turnout in the south and east of Afghanistan, suppressed by lack of security and disenchantment, while vote participation was somewhat higher in the more stable north and west of the country, including some reports of long lines of voters seen outside polling stations.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;

Voter turnout in the eastern city of [[Jalalabad]] was low at no more than 20–30%, according to election observer Tim Fairbank: "A lot of people have told us they were afraid to vote, and afraid to have their fingers dipped in ink because of the Taliban's threats." The government, on the other hand, was expected to claim that it was more like 60% in the area.&lt;ref name=amid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6802964.ece?token=null&amp;offset=0&amp;page=1 Afghanistan election: rockets fired as voting begins]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]-dominated southern provinces, turnout was as low as 5–10%, according to one Western official. In some parts of the country almost no women voted.&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;

In [[Khan Neshin]], [[Helmand province]], in the south of Afghanistan, election officials estimated that only 250 to 300 people – out of an estimated population of 35,000 to 50,000 in a region larger than [[Connecticut]] – showed up to vote at the single polling station available for the area. Not a single woman voted, according to the district governor, Massoud Ahmad Rassouli Balouch.&lt;ref name=rockets&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/world/asia/21sceneoppel.html?hp "Rockets and Intimidation Deter Voters in the South"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Babaji district of Helmand province, where 10 British soldiers were killed in [[Operation Panther's Claw]], a British offensive launched against insurgents a few weeks ahead of the elections, reports indicated that only about 150 people voted out of a population of 55,000. One election observer said no more than 15 people voted at the polling centre where he was based.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8249983.stm |title=Afghan fraud fear despite UK push |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another [[Helmand province]] district of 70,000 people, barely 500 people voted, while in one town of 2,000 residents, only 50 people voted.&lt;ref name=fraud/&gt;

Voter turnout in [[Kandahar]] city, Afghanistan's second largest city, was estimated to be down 40% from the previous election in 2004. Noor Ahmad, a resident of Zerai District, said: "The turnout is very low, perhaps less than 5 percent."&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;

In the [[Spin Boldak]] district of [[Kandahar province]], RFE/RL's [[Radio Free Afghanistan]] correspondent in Kandahar, Dawa Khan Meenapal, said that people voted heavily but overall turnout was lower than in past elections, and that participation by women was very low.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;

In [[Lashkargah]], the provincial capital of [[Helmand]], Mohammad Aliyas Daee, a [[Radio Free Afghanistan]] correspondent in Helmand, similarly reported that "the overall participation of women was negligible." Voter turnout, by one estimate, was at below 20% in the city, considered to be more secure than the rest of the province.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;

In the southeastern [[Uruzgan province]], the deputy police chief, Mohammad Nabi, estimated the province-wide turnout to be less than 40%, saying that "people had no interest".&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;

Voting in the capital city [[Kabul]] also appeared to have been depressed, with one estimate placing turnout at only 30%. Officials, witnesses, and journalists at several polling stations reported low participation numbers. Afghan journalist and research analyst, Abdulhadi Hairan, observed that the low voter turnout in Kabul resulted in reporters and cameramen having to wait nearly to midday before having enough voter interviews to send back to their news organizations. Dr. [[Abdullah Abdullah]], Karzai's main opponent in the presidential election, called the low voter turnout in Kabul "unsatisfactory."&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=insult/&gt;&lt;ref name=keepsv/&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;&lt;ref name=poll/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abdulhadihairan.com/2009/08/majority-of-a-low-turnout-votes-for-karzai/ |title=Majority of a low turnout voted for Karzai (report and pictures) Abdulhadi Hairan |publisher=Abdulhadihairan.com |date=2009-08-20 |accessdate=2010-04-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822032905/http://www.abdulhadihairan.com/2009/08/majority-of-a-low-turnout-votes-for-karzai/ |archivedate=August 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The polls in Afghanistan, originally scheduled to close at 4 p.m. after nine hours of voting, had been held open an hour longer in a last-minute decision by the Independent Election Commission.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;

===Post-audit voter turnout figures===
Official election monitors and the UN placed voter turnout in the election at only around 30–33%.&lt;ref name=UNAMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=delay&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/10/21/a_crash_course_in_democracy?page=full |title=Afghanistan's runoff election must be delayed |publisher=Foreignpolicy.com |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a joint report with the [[Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission]], issued October 21, 2009, after the release of the final certified election results for the August 20 vote, the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] stated:

:"''One third of registered voters, a figure which is significantly lower than the previous elections, are understood to have cast their ballots,''"&lt;ref name=UNAMA/&gt;

The approximate quantity and guarded wording of the UN statement indicated a voter turnout of no higher than 33%.&lt;ref name=Dr&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6425178/Dr-Abdullah-makes-history-in-challenge-to-Afghanistans-president-Hamid-Karzai.html |title=Dr Abdullah 'makes history' in challenge to Afghanistan's president Hamid Karzai |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-10-24 |accessdate=2010-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100223063428/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6425178/Dr-Abdullah-makes-history-in-challenge-to-Afghanistans-president-Hamid-Karzai.html| archivedate=February 23, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures of the Independent Election Commission, adjusted for 1,065,031 votes discarded as fraudulent, indicate a voter turnout of 31.4%:

When the IEC released its [[#September 16 uncertified final result|September 16 uncertified final results]] with a total of 5,662,758 "valid votes", the IEC claimed a voter turnout of 38.7%.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;&lt;ref name=secures&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090916-karzai-secures-546-afghan-vote-first-count |title=Karzai secures 54.6% of Afghan vote: first count |publisher=France24.com |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fraudulent&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/world/afghan-election15m-votes-fraudulent-20090917-fryc.html |title=Afghan election:1.5m votes 'fraudulent' |work=Sydney Morning Herald  |date=2009-09-17 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=plea&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/karzai-rival-makes-afghan-runoff-fraud-plea-20091022-h997.html |title=Karzai rival makes Afghan run-off fraud plea |publisher=News.smh.com.au |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Lynne | last=O'donnell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the ECC's official audit findings, the IEC's [[#October 21 certified final result|October 21 final certified results]] for the August 20 election presented a total of 4,597,727 "valid votes". 1,065,031 votes or 18.8% of the votes had been invalidated between the IEC's September 16 results and its final certified results.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt;&lt;ref name=IEC2/&gt;

A proportional 18.8% reduction of the IEC's September 16 voter turnout figure of 38.7% gives a voter turnout figure of 31.4%.&lt;ref name=plea/&gt;

In an article published October 21, 2009, in [[Foreign Policy]] magazine, J. Scott Carpenter, an official election observer for the August 20 vote, placed the voter turnout at 30%.&lt;ref name=delay/&gt;

==Post-election vote count and investigations==

===August, rampant allegations of fraud===

Ballot counting began immediately after the polls closed on August 20, with official preliminary results to be declared two weeks later on September 3, official final results to be declared two weeks after that on September 17, and a run-off, if required, to be held within two weeks after that.&lt;ref name=mixed/&gt;&lt;ref name=poolsclose/&gt;&lt;ref name=twoclaim&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/22/world/asia/22afghan.html "Two Claim to Lead Afghan Race for President"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tout/&gt;

Within a day into the vote counting, however, both the Karzai and Abdullah camps were making claims of leading far enough in the count to obtain a majority of over 50%, and that a run-off vote would not be needed.&lt;ref name=twoclaim/&gt;&lt;ref name=knockout/&gt;

Three days into the vote counting, reports suggested that Hamid Karzai had been re-elected by a landslide, with early figures giving Karzai 72% of the vote and his closest rival, Abdullah Abdullah, at 23%.&lt;ref name=landslide&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6077203/Hamid-Karzai-re-elected-by-landslide-poll-data-shows.html |title=Hamid Karzai 're-elected' by landslide, poll data shows |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If confirmed, the scale of the win is expected to provoke accusations of [[vote-rigging]], with the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) having already received 225 complaints within three days – some containing multiple allegations – and reports still arriving from remote areas.&lt;ref name=landslide/&gt;&lt;ref name=more&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090823/wl_afp/afghanistanvotecomplaints More than 200 claims of irregularities in Afghan vote] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916152851/http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090823/wl_afp/afghanistanvotecomplaints |date=September 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-five of the complaints received so far were deemed by the ECC to have been on a scale large enough to have altered the outcome of the poll, with the most common complaint among them being [[ballot box]] tampering. Other charges included [[#Armed coercion|intimidation of voters]], failures of the "indelible ink", and [[#Systemic conflicts of interest|interference in polling]].&lt;ref name=landslide/&gt;&lt;ref name=more/&gt;

Abdullah Abdullah accused Hamid Karzai of "stealing" the election and alleged that widespread [[electoral fraud]] had been committed. He told [[The Guardian]]: "It was led by Mr Karzai. He knew. He knew that without this he cannot win, about that I have no doubt in my mind."&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;

A senior UN official said that there would be no legitimacy if Karzai was proclaimed the outright winner in the election that Afghanistan's international backers are desperate should be seen as legitimate: "If the international community say it is all wonderful, they lose further credibility and are associated with an illegitimate government."&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;

By August 25, the ECC said it had received 1,157 complaints, with 54 categorized as "high priority" and material to the outcome, and many more still expected. Some of the worst fraud may have occurred in [[Helmand province]], according to allegations from at least two presidential candidates. A spokesman for Ashraf Ghani alleged large-scale ballot box stuffing in [[Lashkar Gah]], the capital of the province. An aide to Dr. Abdullah accused election officials in Helmand of having doubled the real turnout figure – a claim that found some anectdotal support in changing figures given by the top local Independent Election Commission official in Helmand, who told [[The Times]] on the day of the election that fewer than 50,000 people had voted in the province, then changed the number to 110,000, and then to 150,000 in subsequent days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6808566.ece "Hamid Karzai expected to gain first-round victory in Afghanistan election"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=leads/&gt;&lt;ref name=tlead/&gt;

A UN official predicted that anywhere between 10% and 20%, or as many as one in five, of all the ballots were illegal, and even proposed that negotiations would have to be made to "''massage'' down" Karzai's victory margin.&lt;ref name=UNwarns&gt;{{Cite news|author=Jon Boone |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/24/afghan-elections-fraud-karzai |title=One in five Afghan ballots may be illegal, UN warns |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-08-24|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deputy speaker of Afghanistan's lower house of parliament, [[Mirwais Yasini]], claimed that thousands of ballots cast for him had been removed from ballot boxes by his opponents and taken away to be destroyed instead of counted. He displayed bags full of ballots from Kandahar that had been discovered by his supporters. Yasini said the only option available was to "abolish the election".&lt;ref name=clouds/&gt;&lt;ref name=UNwarns/&gt;

Abdullah Abdullah also brought forth evidence to support his allegations of widespread vote-rigging. He showed sealed ballot forms that he similarly claimed were votes for him that were never counted; a vote ledger sheet from a polling station that listed only a few names, yet had a ballot tally on the bottom of 1,600; video showing ballot-stuffing that he said was recorded on August 22 – two days after the polls had closed on August 20 and ballot boxes were supposed to have been sealed; video of an individual directing voters to cast their ballot for Karzai; a photograph allegedly showing Karzai people looking over the shoulders of voters filling their ballot sheets behind the cardboard voting screens; a thick tablet of ballot sheets still affixed to the pad, with every single ballot apparently pre-marked for Karzai with the same pen and by what seemed to be the same hand. Abdullah said the tablet had been turned over to them in southern Afghanistan and was just one of hundreds. He said: "This amount of fraud ... Even I did not anticipate it. I was shocked."&lt;ref name=mock/&gt;

More than 10 boxes of ballots were lost when a [[U.S. Air Force]] Chinook helicopter accidentally dropped and lost the ballot boxes collected from a remote village.&lt;ref name=newopt/&gt;

====August 26 partial results====
On August 26, the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) reported partial results tallied from 10% of the polling stations, and announced that it planned to release partial results each day for the next several days.&lt;ref name=leads&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/08/25/afghanistan-election-results025.html | work=CBC News | title=Karzai leads in early Afghan election results | date=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tlead&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aNGkj52.ha98 |title=Karzai Takes Lead in Afghan Vote as Count Shows Lower Turnout |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2009-08-25 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By one account, Hamid Karzai was leading slightly with 41% of the counted votes, while Abdullah Abdullah was at 39%, based on 524,000 valid votes counted after 31,000 – or 5.6% – of the votes were thrown out.&lt;ref name=leads/&gt;

By another account, covering the same news, IEC Chief Electoral Officer Daoud Ali Najafi announced in a news conference that Karzai was at 38% while Abdullah was at 36%, based on 550,000 votes.&lt;ref name=tlead/&gt;

According to the BBC, the partial results were as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8221709.stm|title=BBC August 26 partial results |accessdate=2009-08-26 |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090826100508/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8221709.stm| archivedate=August 26, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 212,927 votes, 40.6%
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 202,889 votes, 38.7%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 53,740 votes, 10.2%
*[[Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai]] – 15,143 votes, 2.9%

Those partial figures of 550,000 votes from 10% of the polling stations, when extrapolated, could suggest a national turnout of 5.5 million, which would be about 30% lower than the turnout figures from the previous presidential election in 2004. The tally was based mainly on returns in the north and other parts of the country – the commission said that less than 2% of the ballots in [[Kandahar province]] and none of the ballots from [[Helmand province]] had been tallied.&lt;ref name=mock/&gt;&lt;ref name=leads/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec21cdfc-91d8-11de-879d-00144feabdc0.html |title=Early poll results put Afghanistan on course for more political limbo |website=Financial Times  |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====August 27 partial results====
A second release of partial results was made by the election authorities after 17%, or 940,000, of the ballots were counted.

According to the BBC:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8221709.stm|title=Karzai widens lead in Afghan poll |accessdate=2009-08-26 |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090826100508/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8221709.stm| archivedate=August 26, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 422,000 votes, 45%
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 330,000 votes, 35%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 108,000 votes, 10.8%
*[[Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai]] – 28,000 votes, 2.8%

The figures have also been reported as Karzai having 44.8% and Abdullah 35.1% of the ballots based on 17% of the country's polling stations (as opposed to 17% of the ballots).&lt;ref name=widens/&gt;

Again, slightly different figures were reported in other accounts,&lt;ref name=tally/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6096661/Afghanistan-election-Hamid-Karzai-widens-lead-over-Abdullah-Abdullah.html |title=Afghanistan election: Hamid Karzai widens lead over Abdullah Abdullah |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-08-27 |accessdate=2010-04-07|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the same news, in which IEC Chief Electoral Officer Daoud Ali Najafi told reporters in Kabul that Karzai had 42% and Abdullah 33% of 998,000 ballots counted from 17% of the polling stations in the country.&lt;ref name=Abdullah/&gt;&lt;ref name=tally&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601091&amp;sid=aduGynxzrM9A |title=Karzai Widens Lead in Afghanistan's Presidential Vote Tally |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

998,000 ballots from 17% of the polling stations suggests a nationwide turnout of nearly 5.9 million.&lt;ref name=tally/&gt; 940,000 ballots representing 17% of the ballots would suggest a turnout of 5.5 million out of 15-17 million voters registered. The presidential election of 2004 had produced a tally of approximately 8 million ballots out of 11 million voters registered.&lt;ref name=mock/&gt;&lt;ref name=tally/&gt;

[[Ramazan Bashardost]], the candidate likely to place third in the election, said the Independent Election Commission (IEC) officials were breaking electoral law by announcing results before the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) had completed its work. The complaints commission had by now received more than 1,400 complaints, with over 150 of them serious enough to change the vote's outcome.&lt;ref name=widens /&gt;

====August 29 partial results====
Partial results released on August 29, with 2.03 million ballots tallied from 35% of polling stations, gave the following numbers:&lt;ref name=pulls&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2009/08/2009829131256991701.html |title=Karzai pulls ahead in Afghan polls |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=closer&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ahmad |first=Sardar |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ia7TYzMUofdg_H_agOnIg0BtVs8w |title=Karzai closer to winning tainted Afghan vote |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= AFP |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hUdUP7tnusuEznxrjIAkzWoZjAxQ |title=Karzai widens lead in Afghan election race |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 940,558 votes, 46.3%
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 638,924 votes, 31.4%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 277,404 votes, 13.6%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 47,375 votes, 2.3%

Claims of massive fraud escalated with a total of more than 2,000 now received by the Electoral Complaints Commission, 270 of which it considered serious enough to have changed the outcome.&lt;ref name=seven/&gt;&lt;ref name=closer/&gt;

Abdullah Abdullah stepped up his allegations of widespread [[vote rigging]], saying that "massive fraud, state-crafted, state-engineered fraud" had taken place throughout the country," and that ballot boxes had been stuffed with hundreds of thousands of votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8228443.stm |title=Afghan's Karzai extends poll lead |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-08-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, supporters of Abdullah threatened with violence if their candidate would lose, while Abdullah himself urged them to stay calm while the electoral commission would investigate their concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/abdullahs-supporters-threaten-to-take-up-arms-over-rigged-election-1776783.html |title=Abdullah's supporters threaten to take up arms over 'rigged' election - In northern Afghanistan, where opposition to Hamid Karzai is strong, the mood is darkening |work=The Independent |location=UK |date= 2009-08-25|accessdate=2010-04-07|first=Kim|last=Sengupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 30, the Electoral Complaints Commission announced that the number of allegations it considered serious enough to have affected the outcome had now reach 567, more than double the number announced the day before. The total number of complaints registered with the ECC had now reached 2,493, with over one-fifth classified as "Category A", meaning serious enough to alter the outcome. Most votes in the southern parts of the country, where Karzai is seen as having strong ethnic Pashtun support, and where complaints of fraud seemed highest, had yet to be counted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Peter Graff |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE57T0ET20090830 |title=Serious fraud complaints double in Afghan vote |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====August 31 partial results====
Partial results released on August 31, with 2,869,562 valid ballots tallied from 47.8% of polling stations, gave the following numbers:&lt;ref name=lead2&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20090831-president-karzai-lead-narrows-slightly-presidential-vote-afghanistan-election- |title=Karzai lead narrows slightly in presidential vote |publisher=France24.com |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904174544/http://www.france24.com/en/20090831-president-karzai-lead-narrows-slightly-presidential-vote-afghanistan-election- |archivedate=September 4, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2009-08-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902162405/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 1,317,121 votes, 45.9%
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 954,256 votes, 33.3%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 359,214 votes, 12.5%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 62,536 votes, 2.2%

The results with nearly half of the polling stations counted pointed to a turnout of only 30% to 35%, adding to doubts about the election's legitimacy. Most of the ballots counted so far had been from polling stations in the north of Afghanistan, where most of Abdullah's support was. Observers said that the ballots from the south that mostly remained to be counted could put Karzai over the 50% needed to win the election without a run-off.&lt;ref name=latest/&gt;

===September, massive fraud alleged, sample-based audit===
According to a senior Western diplomat, hundreds of thousands of ballots for Hamid Karzai were from as many as 800 fake polling sites where no one had actually voted. The diplomat and another Western official also said that Karzai supporters took over approximately 800 actual polling centers on election day and used them to fraudulently report tens of thousands of ballots for Karzai. The Western diplomat said: "''This was fraud en masse''." In Karzai's home province, [[Kandahar province|Kandahar]], preliminary results indicated that more than 350,000 ballots had been turned in to be counted, but Western officials estimated that only about 25,000 people had actually voted in the whole province.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/world/asia/07fraud.html?hpw=&amp;pagewanted=all "Fake Afghan Poll Sites Favored Karzai, Officials Assert"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an IEC official and a Western official in Afghanistan, the Independent Election Commission introduced a set of standards to exclude questionable votes on August 29, but when it appeared that the new exclusions would put Karzai's tally below 50%, the commission cast a second vote on September 7 to loosen the fraud standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/AP/v-fullstory/story/1233579.html Karzai rival warns: Vote fraud would doom U.S. involvement] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2009, the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC), dominated by U.N.-appointed Westerners, reported that over 720 major fraud allegations considered material to the outcome had been registered, and ordered recounts at polling stations where it had found "clear and convincing evidence of fraud" in at least three provinces. The U.N.-appointed ECC chairman, Grant Kippen, said voting irregularities included unfolded ballots (that would not have fit through a ballot box slot), identically marked ballots, and overly large ballot counts, including a box in Kandahar with 1,700 ballots when the maximum should be 600. Dozens of voting sites tallied by the Independent Election Commission reportedly had Karzai winning in perfectly round numbers like 200, 300, or 500 ballots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gH6zTk0ZvJGljIu7bpEh3P2uECEwD9AJCPMG0 Afghan recount ordered because of fraud charges] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on September 8, 2009, with the IEC releasing the first partial results to show Hamid Karzai above the 50% threshold, the U.S. [[State Department]] called for a "rigorous vetting" of the [[electoral fraud]] claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2009/09/us-calls-for-rigorous-vetting-of-afghan-election-fraud-allegations.html |title=U.S. Calls For 'Rigorous Vetting' of Afghan Election Fraud Allegations |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2009, the ECC ordered the invalidation of tens of thousands of ballots, mostly votes for Karzai, from 83 polling stations from three provinces. These included all presidential ballots from 5 polling stations in [[Paktika Province]], either all presidential ballots, all provincial council ballots - or in some case both - from 27 polling stations in [[Ghazni Province]], as well as ballots from 51 polling stations in [[Kandahar Province]]. The chairman of the ECC, Grant Kippen, said there would be no re-voting and that the ballots would simply discounted from the final tally. A source at the ECC indicated this was just the beginning of a process, according to a BBC correspondent.&lt;ref name=invalid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8248543.stm |title=Afghan fraud ballots invalidated |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=probed&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0911/afghanistan.html |title=Up to 500,000 Afghan votes may be probed |publisher=Rte.ie |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Independent Election Commission indicated that results from 447 polling stations, or 200,000 ballots, had already been quarantined and flagged to the ECC for investigation, and that the figure could rise to 660 polling stations and as many as 500,000 ballots.&lt;ref name=probed/&gt;

On September 15, 2009, the foreign-dominated ECC ordered a recount of 2,600, or 10%, of the country's 26,000 polling stations – many of them in southern Afghanistan – a move expected to strip votes away from incumbent President Hamid Karzai. Because many of those polling stations had substantially higher turnouts than average, possibly the result of ballot stuffing, more than 10% of the vote could be affected. With the September 12 partial results showing Karzai at 54.3% of the votes, just 4.3 points above the 50% threshold, the ECC-ordered recount could potentially force a run-off election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/75478.html |title=U.N. panel orders recounts of 1 in 10 Afghan polling stations |publisher=Mcclatchydc.com |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930130147/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/75478.html |archivedate=September 30, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 2009, over a month after the election day, and after several weeks of wrangling, it was reported that the IEC and ECC had agreed to rely on [[statistical sampling]] in the interests of expediency instead of carrying out an in-depth investigation of all the alleged voting irregularities.&lt;ref name=sample&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-afghan-recount22-2009sep22,0,250820.story |title=Afghanistan election review will be based on sample |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Mark | last=Magnier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact methodology to be used had yet to be agreed upon and could take a few days.&lt;ref name=sample/&gt;

Supporters of the deal claimed that streamlining the complaints review process would reduce political instability. Critics of the deal said that bypassing a full investigation of all the irregularities would undermine faith in the credibility of the outcome.&lt;ref name=sample/&gt;

On September 25, 2009, the IEC and ECC announced that they had agreed to audit and recount ballots from only 313 of the 3,063 polling stations that had been deemed suspicious, representing a sample of about 10% of suspect ballot boxes, in order to expedite a resolution to the disputed election. According to the election officials, the 313 ballot boxes to be used in the statistical sampling were randomly selected in front of candidate agents and observers, and were to be retrieved from the provinces as soon as the next day.&lt;ref name=recount&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=111510450 1 in 10 suspect Afghan ballot boxes face recount] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 26, 2009, Afghan newspaper "daily 8 Subh" quoted the IEC chief electoral officer as saying that a decision about whether a run-off would occur would be made within the next ten days, and that any run-off would be held within a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90851/6768445.html |title=IEC: Final results of Afghan presidential election to be announced soon |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=2009-09-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other news sources reported the IEC as urging the Electoral Complaints Commission to expedite their fraud investigations, saying that the final results must be released within the next ten days if the election commission is to be able to prepare a second round of voting before winter snow at the end of October makes voting impossible in parts of the country. Missing the window could delay any run-off until springtime, creating a power vacuum.&lt;ref name=recount/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=The Earthtimes |url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/287325,august-deadliest-month-for-afghan-civilians-un-report.html |title=August deadliest month for Afghan civilians: UN report |publisher=Earthtimes.org |date=2009-09-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====September 2 partial results====
Partial results released by the Independent Election Commission on September 2, with 3,689,715 valid ballots tallied from 60.3% of polling stations, gave the following numbers:&lt;ref name=attack&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9AFF65O0 Afghan spy boss killed in Taliban suicide attack] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907170420/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9AFF65O0 |date=September 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IEC&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2009-09-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902162405/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 1,744,428 votes, 47.3%
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 1,201,838 votes, 32.6%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 426,331 votes, 11.6%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 88,835 votes, 2.4%

Abdullah reiterated his allegations of massive fraud, and accused the Independent Election Commission of cooperating in "organized fraud". One of his campaign chiefs, Zalmai Younosi, said: "''How can we accept a corrupt government funded by drugs and not respected by the world?''"&lt;ref name=attack/&gt;

The Electoral Complaints Commission reported that it had hired 70 extra people and would need at the very least two weeks, working overtime, in order to process the more than 2,600 reports of fraud, with over 650 of them large enough to "have material effect on the results".&lt;ref name=attack/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=ahwgbckQtPtY |title=Karzai Leads Afghan Vote as Panel Probes Election Fraud Reports |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=complaints&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=aNDTre.7Sbfk |title=Afghan Election Results Delayed Amid Probe of Fraud Complaints |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 2009, when official preliminary results were originally planned to have been released, the IEC said the earliest possible date was now delayed to September 7.&lt;ref name=complaints/&gt;

====September 6 partial results====
Results released on September 6, 2009, with ballots from 74.2% of polling stations tallied, gave the following count:&lt;ref name=win&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8240534.stm |title=Karzai closer to Afghan poll win |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 457,909 votes, 10.7%

Independent Election Commission officials said results from 447 of about 28,000 polling stations had been annulled after fraud investigations.&lt;ref name=win/&gt;&lt;ref name=lead&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8244215.stm |title=Recount clouds Karzai poll lead |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====September 8 partial results====
Partial results released by the Independent Election Commission on September 8, with 5,469,289 valid ballots tallied from 91.6% of polling stations, showed Hamid Karzai over the 50% vote threshold needed win the election without a run-off:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2009-09-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902162405/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 505,347 votes, 9.2%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 147,761–2.7%

The Independent Election Commission (IEC) also reported that it had "quarantined" results from 600 polling stations where it suspected irregularities, and sent the list of stations to the ECC.&lt;ref name=lead/&gt;

Meanwhile, the U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) said it had found "clear and convincing evidence of fraud", and that a recount and inspection should be done for any polling station where 600 or more ballots were cast, or where any single candidate received more than 95% of the votes. U.N.-appointed ECC chairman Grant Kippen said how many polling stations this would involve was unknown. The chief electoral officer of the IEC said it could take two to three months to comply with the ECC's recount and audit order.&lt;ref name=lead/&gt;

With Karzai passing the 50 per cent threshold but confrontated with allegations of massive fraud, a crisis emerged when a recount of ballots was ordered. That demand was challenged by the Afghan-dominated Independent Election Commission (IEC), which went on to publish the results, effectively giving Karzai the victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/karzai-victory-provokes-fresh-crisis-between-kabul-and-west-1783873.html |title=Karzai 'victory' provokes fresh crisis between Kabul and West - Asia, World |work=The Independent |location=UK |date= 2009-09-09|accessdate=2010-04-08|first=Kim|last=Sengupta| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100316232451/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/karzai-victory-provokes-fresh-crisis-between-kabul-and-west-1783873.html| archivedate=March 16, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====September 12 partial results====
The IEC had previously announced that it hoped to release full preliminary results, originally scheduled for September 3, on September 12, 2009, instead. On that date, however, they announced that the count was still not complete and that there would be another delay, with no date known.&lt;ref name=vict&gt;{{Cite web|last=Massoud |first=Waheedullah |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jJNHOkmXeTNoKkoP9HVKo0Ttarng |title=Afghan leader Karzai nears election victory |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partial results released by the IEC on September 12, tallied from the ballots of 92.8% of polling stations, showed Karzai slightly further in the lead and Abdullah slightly further lagging:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2009-09-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902162405/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 511,441 votes, 9.2%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 149,720–2.7%

Ballots from an additional 2.15% of polling stations were set aside because of irregularities at the 600 stations and excluded from the IEC's latest results on orders from the ECC. The IEC reported that hundreds of thousands of ballots had now been quarantined for audit.&lt;ref name=dozens/&gt;&lt;ref name=vict/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8252394.stm |title=Afghan leader closer to victory |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Election officials were unwilling to provide a time-scale for the final result, while observers said that investigation of the extensive fraud allegations could take months.&lt;ref name=vict/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McDonald |first=Charlotte |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gwx3I6OTH7SspVL3_maiPw5cQEWg |title=Afghanistan awaits results from fraud-tainted poll |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day was accompanied by a spate of violence in which at least 66 people were killed in gunbattles, suicide strikes, and roadside bombs. The dead included 24 civilians, 5 foreign soldiers, 7 Afghan soldiers, 12 Afghan policemen, 7 security firm guards, and at least 11 militants. Attacks occurred in all corners of the country – not only in the south and east, but also in the west and north that had been comparatively quiet until recent weeks around the election – signalling an expanding insurgency despite record numbers of U.S. and coalition troops in the eight-year war since the 2001 U.S. invasion.&lt;ref name=engulf/&gt;&lt;ref name=dozens/&gt;&lt;ref name=spate/&gt;

====September 16 uncertified final result====
On September 16, 2009, the IEC released its final uncertified results for the presidential election, with Hamid Karzai winning the election in one round with 54.6% of the vote:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections - Final uncertified results released September 16, 2009 2PM |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2009-09-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902162405/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=September 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2009 Afghan election map.png|300px|thumb|Provinces where Hamid Karzai won a majority (in blue), provinces were Abdullah Abdullah won a majority (in red)]]
*[[Hamid Karzai]] – 3,093,256 votes, '''54.6%'''
*[[Abdullah Abdullah]] – 1,571,581 votes, 27.8%
*[[Ramazan Bashardost]] – 520,627 votes, 9.2%
*[[Ashraf Ghani]] – 155,343–2.7%

Total Valid Votes: 5,662,758.

The IEC claimed that voter turnout was 38.7%. However, anectdotal evidence from observers suggests it was much lower.&lt;ref name=EU&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6837654.ece "President Karzai claims victory as EU demands inquiry into vote fraud"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=secures/&gt;&lt;ref name=fraudulent/&gt;

The results were not final until approved by the UN-dominated Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) which had already previously called for recounts at about 10% of polling stations, a process which could take months.&lt;ref name=give55&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/09/16/afghan-election016.html |title=Afghan election results give Karzai 55% of vote |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 2,800 complaints were registered with the ECC, including complaints involving polling day and the ballot counting process, with 726 allegations that the ECC categorized as serious enough to have affected the outcome.&lt;ref name=give55/&gt;

The EU deputy chief observer, Dimitra Ioannou, alleged that 1.5 million ballots were suspect out of the 5.5 million ballots, representing 27% of the vote. According to Ioannou, 1.1 million of the votes for Karzai were suspect, along with 300,000 of the votes for Abdullah, and 92,000 of the votes for Bashardost. The EU deputy chief observer noted that if all the votes they deemed suspect were invalidated, Karzai's percentage would drop from 54.6% to 46%, while Abdullah's would rise from 27.7% to 31%, effectively forcing a run-off. The Karzai campaign denounced the announcement as "partial, irresponsible and in contradiction with Afghanistan's constitution."&lt;ref name=give55/&gt;&lt;ref name=morethan1&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6199070/More-than-1m-Hamid-Karzai-votes-suspicious-says-EU.html |title=More than 1m Hamid Karzai votes 'suspicious', says EU |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-09-16 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union election observer mission had previously declared the election process to be generally "good and fair", shortly after voting day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6081952/Abdullah-Abdullah-under-pressure-to-concede-to-Hamid-Karzai-in-Afghanistan.html |title=Abdullah Abdullah under pressure to concede to Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2010-04-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100501203139/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6081952/Abdullah-Abdullah-under-pressure-to-concede-to-Hamid-Karzai-in-Afghanistan.html| archivedate=May 1, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/irregularities-continue-to-pile-up-in-afghan-vote/article1263106/ |title=Irregularities continue to pile up in Afghan vote |work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2010-04-07 |location=Toronto, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figures alleged by the EU deputy chief observer represented approximately 36%, 19%, and 18% of the votes counted for Karzai, Abdullah, and Bashardost, respectively. Invalidating the 1.5 million ballots would reduce the already low voter turnout figure to under 27%.

===October, ruling of the ECC awaited, run-off possibility===
The time frames mentioned at the end of [[#September, massive fraud alleged, sample-based audit|September]] for a decision about a run-off did not appear to hold however: The recount of the random sample of 10% of suspect ballot boxes finally only began nine days later, on October 5, 2009. The UN stated that this recount process would take at least four days and that a final result would come next week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8291713.stm |title=Afghan election recount under way Afghan election recount under way |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 2009, the recount of the 10% sample of suspect ballot boxes was reported to be completed, with results to be announced within a few days. The head of the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan|United Nations mission in Afghanistan]], [[Kai Eide]], stated that [[vote fraud]] in the Afghan election had been "''widespread''". He refused to reveal any numbers however, saying "any specific figures would be speculative".&lt;ref name=widespread&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/10/11/afghan-vote-fraud.html |title=Afghan vote fraud 'widespread': UN official |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-10-11 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4782409,00.html?maca=en-en_nr-1893-xml-atom |title=Afghan elections hit yet another snag |publisher=Dw-world.de |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2009, just days before results of the audit were expected to be announced, the chairman of the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC), Canadian Grant Kippen, told reporters that the ECC had misinterpreted the statistical analysis to determine the percentage of votes that would be voided for each candidate in ballot boxes deemed suspect. The week before, the ECC had stated that each candidate would lose votes in proportion to the number of fraudulent ballots cast for them in a random sampling of ballots boxes deemed suspect. Under the new ECC interpretation, the commission divides suspect ballot stations into six categories of reason for suspicion, and disqualifies the same percentage from each candidate's total ballots within each category. According to an Associated Press article: "''That means votes legitimately cast for a candidate could be canceled if they were found in ballot boxes that were deemed to have been stuffed in favor of another contender.''"&lt;ref name=beset&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9B9MQN00 Problems beset Afghan vote recount] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=watchdog&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/asiaCrisis/idUSSP510247 |title=Watchdog alters Afghan recount rules, member quits |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-10-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Peter | last=Graff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecc.org.af/en/images/stories/pdf/ECC%202009%20Understanding%20the%20process%20of%20ECC%20policy%20implementation%2020091011_ENG.pdf |title=October 11, 2009, ECC policy guideline factsheet |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, in a blow for the UN-backed complaints body's credibility, one of the two Afghan members of the five-member ECC resigned, stating "foreign interference" on the part of the three Western members – an American, a Canadian, and a Dutch – of the complaints body.&lt;ref name=beset/&gt;&lt;ref name=watchdog/&gt;

====Waiting game and Western political pressure====
On October 17, 2009, the U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission, which had widely been expected to release its findings from its statistics-based audit, delayed the announcement again as ECC officials spent the day in meetings with Afghan election officials and double-checking calculations – and as U.S. and other Western officials pressured Karzai and Abdullah to state their acceptance of the findings before the ECC announcement and to work out [[#U.S. efforts to force a power-sharing deal|a power-sharing deal]].&lt;ref name=underpressure&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9BD1VK01 Afghan president under pressure over fraud rulings] [https://www.webcitation.org/5kbFnlxFk?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9BD1VK01 Archived copy] at [[WebCite]] (October 17, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=allies&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/18/world/asia/18afghan.html Allies Press Karzai to Accept Election Audit Results"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', Karzai fielded a flurry of visits and phone calls from U.S. and other Western officials pressing him to accept the delayed U.N.-led audit results, enter into a power-sharing deal with Abdullah, or otherwise avert a crisis in the contended election. Among the American officials working the phones were Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], her Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan [[Richard C. Holbrooke]], and Defense Secretary [[Robert M. Gates]]. In Afghanistan, U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]], chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], met with Karzai at least twice, and Abdullah once, stressing "''the necessity of a legitimate outcome'',"&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;

British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] and U.N. Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] also called Karzai and Abdullah. French foreign minister [[Bernard Kouchner]], who had flown to Afghanistan "in the context of tension" caused by the election crisis, pressured both Karzai and Abdullah to "respect" the U.N.-backed audit process.&lt;ref name=underpressure/&gt;&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;

Along with U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]] and French Foreign Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]], former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, [[Zalmay Khalilzad]] was also in Kabul that day for talks with Afghan leaders.&lt;ref name=underpressure/&gt;&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;

The spokesman for Karzai's campaign, [[Wahid Omar]], said they were concerned that the process was "being overshadowed by political discussions." Karzai's spokesman stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''We will not be committed to a result that is decided on politically.''"&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ECC's ruling was now expected October 18, according to ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;

On October 18, 2009, however, the BBC reported that the ECC results from the fraud investigation were now due "in the next few days". The Telegraph [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6367822/Afghan-leaders-under-pressure-to-avoid-election-run-off.html reported] that the ECC investigation was "understood" to have knocked Karzai's vote percentage down to between 47% and 49%, but that the official result "''was delayed as the West asked the men to reach an agreement that would avoid another round of voting.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8313423.stm|work=BBC News  |title=US decision after Afghan result|date=2009-10-19|accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=underpressure2&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6367822/Afghan-leaders-under-pressure-to-avoid-election-run-off.html |title=underpressure2 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White House Chief of Staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] indicated in veiled criticism of Hamid Karzai that it would be 'reckless' for the U.S. to commit more troops to Afghanistan until there is a 'true partner' to work with in Kabul. An expert familiar with the U.S. administration's thinking said there was no stomach for an election run-off after the "organisational headaches and risks to American troops" experienced in the August 20 ballot, and stated: "''There is a clear preference for a deal.''"&lt;ref name=underpressure2/&gt;

====ECC fraud investigation findings reported to IEC====
On October 19, 2009, ''The New York Times'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/world/asia/20afghan.html reported] that the ECC submitted its findings to the IEC that day, leaving the official announcement of results to the Independent Election Committee. However, an unnamed Western official said that the ECC investigation gave Karzai only 48% of the vote, under the 50% threshold required to avoid a run-off. The sample-based audit was reported to have found levels of fraud ranging from 71% to 96% in the six categories into which suspect ballot boxes had been divided.&lt;ref name=has48&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/world/asia/20afghan.html "Election Audit Said to Show Karzai Has 48 Percent"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Karzai campaign spokesman [[Wahid Omar]] stated: "''I don't think we can make any judgment based on the figures announced today''."&lt;ref name=panel&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9BE6ROG0 Afghan fraud panel voids thousands of Karzai votes] [https://www.webcitation.org/5ke2nQ6nt?url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9BE6ROG0 Archived copy] at [[WebCite]] (October 19, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a follow-up article the same day, ''The New York Times'' [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/world/asia/20afghan.html?hp reported] that based on its own analysis using preliminary data from the ECC findings, 874,000, or 28%, of Karzai's 3,093,000 votes were ordered invalidated by the sample-based fraud audit, as were 185,000, or 18%, of Abdullah's votes. The ECC also completely discarded 210 ballot boxes because of fraud, reducing Karzai's total by 41,000 votes and Abdullah's by 10,807 votes. The ECC findings resulted in pushing Karzai's final vote total from 54% down to around 48–49%, and raising Abdullah's vote total from 28% up to 31%.&lt;ref name=audit&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/20/world/asia/20afghan.html?hp "Audit Pushes Karzai Below 50 Percent in Afghan Vote"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ecc.org.af/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=56 |title=October 18, 2009, ECC Decision |publisher=Ecc.org.af |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024013329/http://www.ecc.org.af/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=50&amp;Itemid=56 |archivedate=October 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6881718.ece article] by [[The Times]], overall, "''some 1.26 million recorded votes were excluded from an election that cost the international community more than $300 million.''" The New York Times wrote, "''fraud was so pervasive that nearly a quarter of all votes were thrown out.''".&lt;ref name=ruleout&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6881718.ece "Hamid Karzai faces another ballot after 1m votes ruled out"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nov7/&gt;

Concerns that Karzai might reject the ECC findings in direct conflict with his main backer for eight years, the United States, led to continued intense American and ally pressure on him [[#U.S. efforts to force a power-sharing deal|to accept a power-sharing deal]] or face a second round [[#U.S. efforts to force a run-off|run-off]]. Senator [[John Kerry]] made an unplanned stop in Kabul to meet Karzai in the presidential palace "to continue his discussions and consultations", according to the U.S. embassy. White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs said former U.S. army general [[Karl Eikenberry]], the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, was engaged in "delicate but extremely important" efforts to persuade Karzai to accept the ECC's findings.&lt;ref name=audit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;

U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], who said that she had spoken a number of times with Karzai in recent days, announced that Karzai would be making an announcement the next day, saying "''He is going to announce his intentions ... But I don't want to pre-empt in any way President Karzai's statement, which will set the stage for how we go forward in the next stage of this.''" An unnamed diplomatic source also said that Karzai would be making a nationwide address flanked by U.S. Senator John Kerry and U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan [[Kai Eide]], and claimed that Karzai was prepared to make concessions, such as forming a power-sharing coalition or agreeing to a run-off.&lt;ref name=audit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;&lt;ref name=clinton&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5h3mpSI8fPqHjCQ2uJQchn_R1BUoQD9BEC8180 Clinton says Karzai set to announce his intentions] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to ''The Times'', one of Karzai's senior cabinet ministers, [[Ismail Khan]], who had met with Karzai, said he had been told that a formal challenge will be issued: "''He said he will complain against the ECC decision, and demand an investigation into why they cut his votes."&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;

====Acquiescence to a run-off on November 7====
On October 20, 2009, under heavy U.S. and ally pressure, President Hamid Karzai announced his acquiescence to a run-off in the election. Flanked at a news conference by U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]], the head of the powerful [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], and [[Kai Eide]], the U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan, he announced a run-off to be held on November 7, stating: "''Unfortunately, the election of Afghanistan was defamed. Any result that we were getting out of it was not able to bring legitimacy.''"&lt;ref name=nov7&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/world/asia/21afghan.html?hp "Karzai Agrees to Nov. 7 Runoff in Afghanistan"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=violence&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6389109/Hamid-Karzai-agrees-to-run-off-amid-fears-of-more-violence-and-fraud.html |title=Hamid Karzai agrees to run-off amid fears of more violence and fraud |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=future&gt;{{Cite news|last=Patience |first=Martin |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8317445.stm |title=Afghan elections - an uncertain future |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-10-20 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pathf&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/world/asia/21afghan.html?bl "With New Afghan Vote, Path Forward Is Unclear"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Karzai had initially indicated that he might reject the Western-dominated ECC's findings. According to ''The New York Times'', Karzai's capitulation came after "''all-out push''" by U.S. administration officials and their European allies. In a meeting hastily arranged after the release of the ECC ruling the previous day, U.S. Senator Kerry and the U.S. ambassador Lt. Gen. [[Karl W. Eikenberry]] were at the presidential palace in Kabul. Karzai initially hesitated but ended up agreeing to accept the findings during the course of the two-hour meeting.&lt;ref name=nov7/&gt;&lt;ref name=pathf/&gt;

Besides Senator Kerry and General Eikenberry, Karzai was pushed hard by U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], who urged him in multiple calls over the last few days to be a "statesman" and accept the results, and by British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], who called Karzai three times in the last 48 hours, warning him that he could lose Western support if he did not accede to a second round. Chiming in as well, Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] also called to warn Karzai that he would face dire problems with the coalition countries involved in Afghanistan if he did not cooperate. The American, British, and French ambassadors to Afghanistan joined U.S. Senator Kerry and the U.N.'s Kai Eide in flanking Karzai as he made his announcement at the news conference. U.S. administration officials had also used President Obama's pending strategy review on Afghanistan as leverage on Karzai, indicating that they would not make a decision on adding troops until Karzai agreed to accept the election outcome.&lt;ref name=nov7/&gt;&lt;ref name=violence/&gt;&lt;ref name=future/&gt;&lt;ref name=pathf/&gt;&lt;ref name=thecall&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6883040.ece "The call that made Hamid Karzai relent to a run-off in Afghanistan"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/harper-warns-karzai-to-accept-recount/article1328998/ |title=Harper warns Karzai to accept recount |work=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2010-04-07 |location=Toronto, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A senior Western official was quoted in [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6883072.ece an article] by The Times as saying: "''No one wants a second round. It'll be expensive, bloody, and probably fraudulent.''"&lt;ref name=winter&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6883072.ece "Winter election looms as Hamid Karzai bows to pressure"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Times'', the certified results after the audit findings had left Karzai with 49.67% of the vote, just 0.33% below the 50% threshold to have avoided the run-off.&lt;ref name=pathf/&gt;&lt;ref name=winter/&gt;

====October 21 certified final result====
On October 21, 2009, following the ECC's official audit findings and Karzai's heavily pressured acquiescence to a run-off, the IEC released its final certified results for the August 20 vote:&lt;ref name=IEC2&gt;{{Cite web|title=IEC - Presidential &amp; Provincial Council Elections - Afghanistan 2009 Elections - Final certified results released October 21, 2009 2PM |url=http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2009-10-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103222205/http://www.iec.org.af/results/leadingCandidate.html |archivedate=November 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 23, election authorities, with UN assistance, began delivering ballots for the November 7 run-off. UN planes flew ballots and voting kits to provincial capitals from where they would be delivered to thousands of polling stations by helicopter, truck, women and donkey.&lt;ref name=eo&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hvWEqwq3CrRvaQCmt21MfoYhjZJQD9BG96UG1 Election officials deliver Afghan runoff ballots] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=troops&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/afghan-runoff-may-force-us-hand-on-troops-1806890.html |title=Afghan run-off may force US hand on troops |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2009-10-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07|first1=Julius|last1=Cavendish|first2=David|last2=Usborne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of insecurity and fraud concerns, 7,000 polling stations – nearly 30% of the 24,000 polling stations that had been set up for the August 20 vote – were cut for the run-off vote.&lt;ref name=eo/&gt;

There were also concerns that voter turnout for the run-off could be even lower than the "anemic" [[#Post-audit voter turnout figures|turnout of 30–33%]] in the first round on August 20.&lt;ref name=UNAMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=delay/&gt;&lt;ref name=illegit&gt;{{Cite news|last=Editors |first=The |url=http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/is-a-fair-election-in-afghanistan-possible/#gilles |title=Already Illegitimate |work=The New York Times |date=2009-10-21 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gilles Dorronsoro, a visiting scholar at the [[Carnegie Endowment]] and an expert on Afghanistan and South Asia: "''This time around, the weather will be worse, and the plain fact is, most Afghans don’t like their options enough to vote.''"&lt;ref name=illegit/&gt;

The run-off campaign period formally opened on October 24. Abdullah's campaign called for the dismissal of the three top officials of the Independent Election Commission (IEC), accusing them of having allowed widespread fraud in the first round of the election.&lt;ref name=Dr/&gt;&lt;ref name=As&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-afghan-vote25-2009oct25,0,7367781.story |title=As Afghan runoff campaign opens, Taliban again threatens voters |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=2009-10-25 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Laura | last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both run-off candidates were reported to be frantically wooing [[Ramazan Bashardost]], the presidential candidate that had placed third in the August 20 first round vote.&lt;ref name=Dr/&gt;

Bashardost, who had campaigned against the corruption and greed of Kabul politicians and against the poverty of Afghans, said he had not decided who to support between the two – if anyone – saying the choice was between "''the worst, and worse than the worst.''"&lt;ref name=eo/&gt;

The Taliban reiterated their call for Afghans to boycott the election, denouncing it as a foreign-orchestrated sham.&lt;ref name=Dr/&gt;&lt;ref name=As/&gt;

On October 26, Abdullah called again for the sacking of [[Azizullah Lodin]], the head of the Independent Election Commission, saying that he had "no credibility".&lt;ref name=Lodin&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8325709.stm |title=Row erupts over Afghan poll chief|accessdate=2009-10-26|date=2009-10-26|publisher=BBC News  | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091027093210/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8325709.stm| archivedate=October 27, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karzai rejected the call by Abdullah, stating "the changes would not be helpful to the elections and the country".&lt;ref name=Lodin/&gt;

===Abdullah withdrawal from the run-off vote===
On November 1, 2009, Abdullah Abdullah announced that he was withdrawing from the run-off vote, saying "I will not participate in the November 7 election," because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met, and a "transparent election is not possible." Hamid Karzai had rejected Abdullah's demand that the head of the IEC resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8336388.stm |title=Abdullah pulls out of Afghan vote |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-11-01 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abdullah5&gt;{{Cite news|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6478225/Abdullah-Abdullah-pulls-out-of-Afghan-presidential-election-run-off.html |title=Abdullah Abdullah pulls out of Afghan presidential election run-off |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-11-01 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdullah also said the Afghan people should not accept results of an election from the current election commission, and stated that Karzai's government had not been legitimate since its mandate expired in May 2009.&lt;ref name=Abdullah5/&gt;

Speculation immediately followed that the run-off election would be cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20091101/GLOBALBRIEFING/911019991/1009/NEWS?template=globalbriefing |title=Afghan run-off election likely to be cancelled |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2009-11-01 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010520/http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20091101%2FGLOBALBRIEFING%2F911019991%2F1009%2FNEWS%3Ftemplate%3Dglobalbriefing |archivedate=April 27, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan was thrown into a crisis after the withdrawal of Abdullah, which in effect cleared the way for Karzai to retain power despite the accusations of fraud.

==Perceived U.S. interference==
The United States is widely seen to have an enormous stake riding on the outcome of the election in Afghanistan. While U.S. officials have taken great pains to repeatedly assert neutrality, there are many perceptions and allegations of U.S. interference and manipulation in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama/&gt;&lt;ref name=squand/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/CDDB55AE1A7AC53B8725761200518AA6?OpenDocument |title=With Karzai Favored to Win, U.S. Walks a Fine Line |publisher=E-ariana.com |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121182313/http://e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/CDDB55AE1A7AC53B8725761200518AA6?OpenDocument |archivedate=January 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=USwalks&gt;{{Cite news|author=ANAND GOPAL |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125164667290770259 |title=U.S. Walks Fine Line in Afghan Vote |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=2009-08-31 |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231063132/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125164667290770259.html |archivedate=December 31, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2009 Afghan Presidential election2.jpg|thumb|Armored US military trucks distributing ballot boxes.]]

Many in Afghanistan perceive the U.S. to have favoured [[Ashraf Ghani]] and [[Abdullah Abdullah]] over [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

Four prominent Afghan politicians, including Ghani and Abdullah, were in attendance at U.S. President Obama's inauguration in January. Karzai, however, was not. Media reports began appearing that suggested that the U.S. was eager for a change at the top in Afghanistan. Hamid Karzai was also angered when the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, [[Karl W. Eikenberry]], appeared beside Ghani and Abdullah at news conferences in June, ahead of the election, though Eikenberry stressed impartiality in his remarks. After Karzai did not show up at the first televised debate – against Abdullah and Ghani – the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan published an op-ed in [[The Washington Post]] calling for "serious debate among the candidates" in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama/&gt;&lt;ref name=squand/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

All these developments were viewed by many in Afghanistan as a message about which candidates the U.S. now preferred to have in power in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

{{quote|text="''"The U.S. has certainly tried to undermine Karzai's leadership.''"|sign=Haroun Mir, director of Afghanistan's Centre for Research &amp; Policy Studies&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;}}

Some of Karzai's rivals have alluded that Karzai is extremely concerned about foreign interference in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

"He considers everybody part of that big plot," Abdullah said. "In the meetings with elders and political leaders who have talked and spoken to me, he says this, 'We should unite. You know, there are plots, Americans, British,' and so on and so forth."&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

Both Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani have told people privately that the United States gave them the green light to run for president, according to a former U.S. official in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

===Allegations of U.S. manipulation===
As the first installments of vote counting results were being released, about a week after election day, [[Ramazan Bashardost]], who ran third in exit polls, contended that the U.S. was playing a role in manipulating the outcome, in order to use a contested situation for its plans to broker a deal among the leading candidates.&lt;ref name=USwalks/&gt;&lt;ref name=mischief&gt;{{Cite news|last=Motlagh |first=Jason |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1918850,00.html |title=Afghanistan's Long Vote Count: Room for Mischief? |work=TIME  |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have made the same contention.&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;

A TIME [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1918110,00.html article] that came out just after the election did suggest that a contested election outcome could "suit the U.S. purpose."&lt;ref name="how?"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Karon |first=Tony |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1918110,00.html |title=How a Contested Afghan Election Could Help the U.S. |work=TIME  |date=2009-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some support for Bashardost's allegation may be seen in the U.S.-funded [[#Pre-election polls|pre-election polls]], one conducted by what Gary Langer, director of polling at ABC News, [http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenumbers/2009/08/assessing-the-afghanistan-election.html described] as "an outfit called Glevum Associates, which appears from its website to be a military contractor engaged in producing psychological operations data as part of a U.S. Army counterinsurgency program, the Human Terrain System," and the other by the [[International Republican Institute]], a "pro-democracy group affiliated with the Republican Party and financed by the American government."&lt;ref name=IRI&gt;[http://www.iri.org/mena/afghanistan/pdfs/2009%20August%2014%20Survey%20of%20Afghan%20Public%20Opinion%20July%2016-26,%202009.pdf International Republican Institute - Afghanistan Public Opinion Survey:July 16–26, 2009]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824005330/http://www.iri.org/mena/afghanistan/pdfs/2009%20August%2014%20Survey%20of%20Afghan%20Public%20Opinion%20July%2016-26%2C%202009.pdf |date=August 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=assess&gt;{{Cite web|author=Gary Langer |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenumbers/2009/08/assessing-the-afghanistan-election.html |title=Assessing the Afghanistan Election |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=2009-08-25 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their May 3–16, 2009 poll, the International Republican Institute found that Bashardost [[#Pre-election polls|placed higher]] than Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani in favorability amongst Afghans, and that Bashardost and Ghani both came in at the very same level of support, 3%, when Afghans were asked who they would vote for president in an open-ended question. Yet their July 16–26 survey asked a series of questions that quite specifically included Ghani, but left Bashardost out for some reason:&lt;ref name=IRI/&gt;

*"''If the presidential race were among only three people - Hamid Karzai, Ashraf Ghani, and Abdulah Abdullah - which one would you vote for president?''"
*"''If there is a second round election and the candidates are Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, for whom would you vote?''"
*"''If there is a second round election and the candidates are Hamid Karzai and Ashraf Ghani, for whom would you vote?''"
*"''Do you think a unified team of Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani is a good option for Afghanistan?''"

===New chief executive position===
U.S. officials have also made clear, even before the election, that – regardless of who won the Afghan election – Washington planned to use the leverage of the military force and financial resources at its command to extensively reorganize the Afghan government according to U.S. plans. The U.S. would push for a new non-elected "Chief Executive" position to be inserted under the President, with the appointee taking over all the day-to-day operations of the country.&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama/&gt;&lt;ref name=squand/&gt;&lt;ref name=seven/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;&lt;ref name="how?"/&gt;&lt;ref name=west&gt;{{Cite news|author= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/aug/25/western-hypocrisy-afghanistan-elections |title=West loses its values in Afghanistan |work=Guardian |location=UK |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ex&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/world/asia/19diplo.html "Ex-U.S. Envoy May Take Key Role in Afghan Government"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashraf Ghani has widely been characterized as the U.S. favourite for appointment to that position. (Another mention was [[Zalmay Khalilzad]].) Ghani has had discussions with U.S. officials, including both the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan, [[Richard Holbrooke]], and the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, [[Karl Eikenberry]], and has denied turning down the job offer. He told reporters a few days before the election: "''I've been approached repeatedly; the offer is on the table. I have not accepted it.''"&lt;ref name=farce/&gt;&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama/&gt;&lt;ref name=squand/&gt;&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;&lt;ref name="how?"/&gt;&lt;ref name=west/&gt;&lt;ref name=ex/&gt;

Other plans by the U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Defense]] and [[State department]]s also call for the installation of American "''mentors''" and liaisons inside Afghan government ministries in Kabul, a policy that was heavily used in the early years of the U.S. military [[History of Iraq (2003–2011)|occupation of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

The powerful, non-elected "chief executive" position envisaged for insertion into the Afghan government was characterized by a senior White House official as "a prime minister, except not prime minister because he wouldn’t be responsible to a parliamentary system."&lt;ref name=ex/&gt;

Afghan Foreign Minister [[Rangin Dadfar Spanta]] said that installing a "shadow prime-minister" would pose constitutional problems, but said: "''I know that in Washington this idea has strong supporters.''"&lt;ref name=withK/&gt;

===U.S. efforts to force a run-off===
The day after the election, a tense meeting took place between the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan, [[Richard Holbrooke]], and Afghan president Hamid Karzai, with sources describing the meeting as "a dramatic bust up" and "explosive". [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6814965.ece According] to ''[[The Times]]'', Holbrooke was already raising the possibility of a run-off, causing Karzai to accuse the U.S. special envoy of trying to force a second round "against the interests of Afghanistan".&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=obama2&gt;{{Cite news|author=Haroon Siddique |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/28/karzai-holbrooke-election-clash |title=Obama's envoy Holbrooke 'in heated row' with Karzai |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2009-08-28|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6814965.ece "Hamid Karzai in fiery row with US official"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. special envoy also met with Karzai's rival, Abdullah Abdullah, after the election. The discussion between Holbrooke and Karzai was said to have been noticeably briefer than Holbrooke's meeting with Abdullah.&lt;ref name=obama2/&gt;

On August 29, it was announced that the envoys from the United States, Britain, France, and Germany would meet in Paris to discuss the Afghan elections. According to [[The Times]], a French official said that Holbrooke wanted a run-off in order to chasten Karzai and show him his power was limited.&lt;ref name=wizard/&gt;&lt;ref name=closer/&gt;

Reacting to reports that the U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan wanted the vote to go to a second round for the sake of [[credibility]], the IEC said the result is an Afghan issue:&lt;ref name=closer/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''It is not up to Mr. Holbrooke to decide the first or the second round, this decision is up to the people of Afghanistan who have voted and the IEC is counting these votes.''"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On September 3, 2009, envoys from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and other Western countries met in Paris to discuss the Afghan elections and how to rescue their costly efforts. The Paris meeting was seen as an effort to garner support for the U.S. response to the election and pressure Afghan President Hamid Karzai. The Western envoys to Afghanistan said to expect a run-off in the Afghan election, suggesting that one could occur if enough votes are invalidated.&lt;ref name=closer/&gt;&lt;ref name=attack/&gt;&lt;ref name=western&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://features.csmonitor.com/globalnews/2009/09/02/western-envoys-expect-run-off-in-afghanistan-election/ |title=Western envoys: Expect run-off in Afghanistan election |publisher=csmonitor.com |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S., European, and NATO leaders also declared in their Paris meeting that their Western military troops were staying in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Lynne O'Donnell |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hO--E7LsTUreTrJsoPN4drBbi7cQ |title=Devastating suicide strikes show Taliban expansion |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Le Figaro]] released on September 7, 2009, Hamid Karzai accused the United States of trying to undermine him in order to make him more malleable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL7677562 |title=Karzai says United States wants to manipulate him |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-09-07 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Crispian | last=Balmer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 2009, the [[Sunday Telegraph]] reported that a "stormy meeting" between U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, former U.S. general [[Karl Eikenberry]], and President Karzai had occurred the previous week. "Don't declare victory," warned the ambassador, on the instructions of Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]. The Telegraph reported that the Afghan president had refused to meet American officials since then.&lt;ref name=US3&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6180179/US-tries-to-force-Afghanistan-election-deal.html |title=US tries to force Afghanistan election deal |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-09-12 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2009, the top U.S. diplomat to the [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan|United Nations mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA)]], [[Peter Galbraith]], was [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6834487.ece reportedly] ordered out of the country by the head of the mission, U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan [[Kai Eide]], following a heated disagreement over the American diplomat's demands for a wholesale recount that would virtually ensure a run-off. According to diplomatic sources, Galbraith – a close friend of the U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke – wanted the Independent Election Commission (IEC) to annul results from 1,000 of the nationwide total of about 6,500 polling centres and to recount results from another 5,000. Eide, on the other hand had been seeking only a recount of some 1,000 polling centres. UN officials suggested that Mr. Galbraith's position was representative of the U.S. stance, while Mr. Eide's echoed those of the European missions in Kabul.&lt;ref name=UNchief&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6834487.ece "UN chief Peter Galbraith is removed in Afghanistan poll clash"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Times'', the IEC were preparing on September 8 to announce results for the last 15% of ballots, mostly from the controversial areas of the south and [[Badghis province]] in the north that were expected to return big majorities for Karzai, when Galbraith stepped in and forced them not to announce those results.&lt;ref name=UNchief/&gt;

At a meeting with IEC officials on September 13, Galbraith "laid into the commissioners, in front of the donors and observers" and demanded to know why they had not yet started printing ballot papers in preparation for a run-off.&lt;ref name=UNchief/&gt;

On September 30, 2009, The Times [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6856029.ece reported] that the U.S. diplomat was fired from the UN mission in Afghanistan. The [[UN Secretary-General]], [[Ban Ki Moon]], said he dismissed Galbraith "in the best interests of the mission" after the Karzai government had told the UN that it was unwilling to deal with the American in the future. The Times also revealed that UN Special Representative to Afghanistan Kai Eide had lobbied hard behind the scenes against the appointment of Galbraith as his deputy, but that the United States had pushed Ban Ki Moon to appoint Galbraith, a close friend and ally of [[Richard Holbrooke]], the U.S. Special Envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan.&lt;ref name=UNenvoy&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6856029.ece "UN envoy Peter Galbraith sacked after attack on Afghanistan poll fraud"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, numerous news articles, such as [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/world/asia/21afghan.html?bl one] by ''The New York Times'' and [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/20/AR2009102003447.html another] by the Associate Press, described the extraordinary American efforts, in concert with allies, over multiple days to pressure Hamid Karzai into acceding to run-off vote. On October 20, caving in to the relentless U.S. arm-twisting, he [[#Acquiescence to a run-off on November 7|reluctantly acquiesced]].&lt;ref name=pathf/&gt;&lt;ref name=winter/&gt;&lt;ref name=troops/&gt;&lt;ref name=tepid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/20/AR2009102003447.html Karzai needed convincing twice on new election]{{Dead link|date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. efforts to force a power-sharing deal===
On September 13, 2009, the [[Sunday Telegraph]] [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6180179/US-tries-to-force-Afghanistan-election-deal.html reported] that American officials were making frantic efforts to force President Hamid Karzai into a power-sharing deal against his wishes, stating that "US officials have made little secret of their wish to see his wings clipped". In what one official in Kabul described as "turmoil" behind the scenes, Western diplomats were attempting to convert the election crisis into an opportunity for their purposes by forcing Karzai to share power in government with Dr. Abdullah Abdullah and "reformist ministers", and accept a diminished role for the presidency.&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;
[[File:John Kerry with Abdullah Abdullah in 2009.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[John Kerry]] and losing candidate [[Abdullah Abdullah]] in October 2009.]]

Intense Western diplomatic pressure was also being exerted on Abdullah Abdullah to cut a deal. According to ''The Telegraph'', the fear is that if Karzai defies Washington and appoints his own choice of allies to key ministerial roles, he would be more "difficult for the West to influence".&lt;ref name=US3/&gt;

On September 27, 2009, it was reported that the United States and other NATO countries with military forces in Afghanistan had indicated to Hamid Karzai's government that they expected he would remain in office for another five-year term. The U.S. Secretary of State and foreign ministers of the countries, meeting in New York on September 25, 2009, with U.N. Special Representative [[Kai Eide]] and Afghan Foreign Minister Rangin Spanta, reached "consensus" in Spanta's presence that Hamid Karzai would probably "continue to be president" of Afghanistan, whether by winning a run-off or as a result of having won more than 50% of the ballots in the disputed August 20 elections. The electoral fraud investigations by the Electoral Complaints Commission had not yet been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author= |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/27/AR2009092703155_pf.html |title=U.S., Allies Vow Support for Karzai |work=The Washington Post  |date=2009-09-27 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Farmer |first=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/6240118/US-says-Hamid-Karzai-likely-to-be-re-elected.html |title=US 'says' Hamid Karzai likely to be re-elected |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2009, [[Zalmay Khalilzad]], the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan under [[George W. Bush]], arrived in Kabul from Washington D.C. A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said Khalilzad was there as a "private citizen" and that he was not representing the United States government. Earlier in the year Khalilzad was widely discussed as an American favorite to assume a powerful, unelected [[#New chief executive position|"CEO" position]] that U.S. officials hoped to create inside the Afghan government. A Western official said Khalilzad had come on the invitation of Mr. Karzai, but a spokesman for Karzai’s campaign denied that. In an appearance on Afghan television, Khalilzad indicated that he had come to help Afghans during a difficult election process, but an official in Mr. Abdullah’s campaign said they did not want his assistance, saying "''We do not need any broker''."&lt;ref name=ex/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/16/world/asia/16afghan.html?hpw "Karzai Challenger Hints at Flexibility on Afghan Vote"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2009, the U.N.-backed Electoral Complaints Commission, which had widely been expected to release its findings from the statistics-based audit, delayed the announcement again as U.S. and ally envoys pressured Karzai and Abdullah to state their acceptance of the findings before the ECC announcement and to work out a power-sharing deal. A senior American official made the point of stating that Karzai and Abdullah together won more than 70% of the votes in the first round, ensuring the credibility of a government in which they shared power. A Karzai spokesman indicated that both foreign and Afghan officials were proffering formulas for power sharing, but that Karzai had rejected them and would not discuss power sharing until after a winner is declared. Abdullah also reiterated that he would consider negotiating after the results were announced.&lt;ref name=underpressure/&gt;&lt;ref name=allies/&gt;

On October 18, 2009, ''The Telegraph'' [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/6367822/Afghan-leaders-under-pressure-to-avoid-election-run-off.html reported] that the ECC results were being "''delayed as the West asked the men to reach an agreement that would avoid another round of voting.''" In veiled criticism of Hamid Karzai, White House Chief of Staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] made clear that the U.S. would not send more troops to Afghanistan until there is a 'true partner' to work with in Kabul. An expert familiar with the U.S. administration's thinking suggested there was no longer any stomach for an election run-off after the "organisational headaches and risks to American troops" brought by the August 20 ballot, and stated: "''There is a clear preference for a deal.''"&lt;ref name=underpressure2/&gt;

French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner stated that Karzai and Abdullah were ready to "work together" to find a settlement. A Western diplomat in Kabul said: "The idea now is to reach an agreement in which Karzai's victory at the first round is accepted ..."&lt;ref name=underpressure2/&gt;

Following the flurry of last-minute phone calls, visits, and statements that U.S. and other Western officials made to Karzai, on October 19, 2009, ''The New York Times'' reported an unnamed Western official saying: "''In the last 72 hours, I think even Karzai got the message.''".&lt;ref name=has48/&gt;

Demonstrations supporting Karzai took place in [[Kandahar]], in the south of Afghanistan and in [[Ghazni province]] in the center of the country. In the district of [[Spin Boldak]], around 3,000 demonstrators gathered in a market, shouting: "''We don't want foreigners to interfere in our election.''"&lt;ref name=has48/&gt;

Ali Shah Khan, a tribal leader from the area, said the protesters believed that foreigners were deliberately delaying the election results, and stated: "''The foreign countries want a weak leader for Afghanistan. After that they can do whatever they want.''"&lt;ref name=panel/&gt;

On October 19, 2009, the ECC communicated its fraud investigation result to the IEC, with its unofficially released findings stripping approximately a million votes from Karzai – and bringing his vote share slightly below the critical 50% threshold required to win without a run-off. The continued concerns that Karzai and the IEC, whose members he appointed, might reject the ECC's findings, resulted in continuation of the intense American and ally efforts to pressure Karzai into accepting a power-sharing deal or face a run-off vote.&lt;ref name=audit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;

According to the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Senator [[John Kerry]] made an unplanned stop in Kabul to meet Karzai in the presidential palace "''to continue his discussions and consultations''". Meanwhile, according to White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, former U.S. army general [[Karl Eikenberry]] who commanded U.S. and ally forces in Afghanistan in 2005–2007, was also engaged in "''delicate but extremely important''" efforts to persuade Karzai to accept the U.N. panel's ruling.&lt;ref name=audit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;

U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], stating that she had spoken with Karzai a number of times in recent days, announced that Karzai would be making an announcement the next day, saying "''He is going to announce his intentions ... I am very hopeful that we will see a resolution in line with the constitutional order in the next several days. But I don't want to pre-empt in any way President Karzai's statement, which will set the stage for how we go forward in the next stage of this.''" A diplomatic source told [[The Times]] that Karzai would make a nationwide address flanked by U.S. Senator John Kerry and U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan [[Kai Eide]], claiming that Karzai was prepared to make concessions, such as agreeing to a run-off or forming a power-sharing coalition.&lt;ref name=audit/&gt;&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;&lt;ref name=clinton/&gt;

On the other hand, ''The Times'' [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6881718.ece reported] that one of Karzai's senior cabinet ministers, [[Ismail Khan]], who had met with Karzai, said he had been told that a formal challenge will be issued: "''He said he will complain against the ECC decision, and demand an investigation into why they cut his votes."&lt;ref name=ruleout/&gt;

According to one analysis on October 20, 2009, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6881898.ece "''Why a weakened President remains the least worst option''"] by Tom Coghlan in The Times, the U.S. did not want a run-off to take place, but, rather, was trying to push Karzai into entering a power-sharing deal with his rival, in order to keep him in office but with a "''weakened mandate''".&lt;ref name=thecall/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/Afghanistan/article6881898.ece Why a weakened President remains the least worst option"], ''The Times'' (UK)&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 2009, after Karzai caved in to intense U.S. and ally pressure that a senior U.S. administration official described as a "''full court press''", and acceded to a run-off, diplomats said the efforts to get the two men to join forces would now intensify.&lt;ref name=future/&gt;&lt;ref name=pathf/&gt;

On October 21, 2009, U.S. officials, including a U.S. defence official, emphasized that a power-sharing agreement remained a strong possibility as a way of resolving the crisis without going through with the run-off that had just been announced the day before.&lt;ref name=troops/&gt;

On October 25, 2009, Karzai and Abdullah, responding to questions in separate interviews on U.S. television, both rejected a power-sharing deal before the run-off vote. Karzai, responding to questions in a CNN interview, stated that such a deal would be "''an insult to democracy''". Abdullah, responding to questions on Fox News, ruled out a deal ahead of the run-off, and, in another interview on CNN, stated he had "''absolutely no interest''" in joining the government if Karzai won, saying that he would not be "''part of the same deteriorating situation''". The New York Times wrote that such a coalition would provide the U.S. and NATO with political cover for the continued presence of their military forces "''because they would be backing a government that had the support of a vast majority of Afghans.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/10/25/afghanistan-runoff.html |title=Karzai, Abdullah reject power-sharing |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |date=2009-10-25 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8325331.stm |title=Afghan poll rivals rule out deal |publisher=BBC News   |date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/26/world/asia/26afghan.html "Afghan Rivals Rule Out Power-Sharing Deal"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/asiaCrisis/idUSN24139145 |title=Karzai rival says won't join Afghan government |agency=Reuters  |date=2009-10-24 |accessdate=2010-04-07 | first=Mohammad | last=Zargham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of foreign interference from within the ECC===
On October 12, 2009, one of the two Afghan members of the Western-dominated Electoral Complaints Commission resigned over "foreign interference".&lt;ref name=beset/&gt;

Maulavi Mustafa Barakzai, a judge who ad been appointed to the panel by the Afghan Supreme Court, stated that his resignation was due to the fact that the three UN-appointed Western officials on the panel – an American, a Canadian, and a Dutch – were "making all the decisions on their own" and that Afghans had little input in its decisions.&lt;ref name=beset/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/mod-wins-first-round-of-compensation-battle-1801783.html |title=MoD wins first round of compensation battle |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2010-04-07|first=Kim|last=Sengupta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barakzai's resignation left the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) with only one Afghan member and three officials from countries with foreign military troops in Afghanistan. The ECC is led by one of the three foreign officials, chairman Grant Kippen.

Karzai said that the resignation Barakzai "cast serious doubt" on the work of the commission.

Mustafa Barakzai, a Supreme Court Judge who was one of two Afghans on the Commission, resigned on Monday claiming foreigners were "interfering" in its work. Supporters of Abdullah claimed that Karzai was somehow behind Barakzai's sudden resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/karzai-has-grave-doubts-about-vote-fraud-panel-1802262.html |title=Karzai has 'grave doubts' about vote fraud panel |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=2009-10-14 |accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of a United Nations cover-up==
U.S. diplomat [[Peter Galbraith]], fired from his UN post by [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki Moon]] on September 30, 2009, after accusing his former boss, UN special envoy [[Kai Eide]], of helping cover up electoral fraud and being biased in favor of Hamid Karzai, further accused the UN of fabricating the reason for his dismissal and of helping to cover up massive electoral fraud committed by Afghan President [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/5/fired_un_official_peter_galbraith_accuses

In his statements on October 4, 2009, the American diplomat characterized the Afghan election as a "''train wreck''", and claimed: "''As many as 30% of Karzai's votes were fraudulent, and lesser fraud was committed on behalf of other candidates.''"&lt;ref name=US5/&gt;

Galbraith told the Washington Post that [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki Moon]]'s final instruction before firing him was: "''Do not talk''".&lt;ref name=US5/&gt;

On October 11, 2009, [[Kai Eide]] referred to Galbraith's allegations as "personal attacks" against his integrity, adding they have "affected the whole election process."&lt;ref name=widespread/&gt;

The '''Alhambra Decree''' (also known as the '''Edict of Expulsion'''; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Decreto de la Alhambra, Edicto de Granada'') was an edict issued on 31 March 1492, by the joint [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Spain]] ([[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]) ordering the expulsion of practicing [[Jews]] from the [[Kingdom of Castile|Kingdoms of Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and its territories and possessions by 31 July of that year.&lt;ref name="Decree-translation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/decree.html|title=The Edict of Expulsion of the Jews - 1492 Spain|website=www.sephardicstudies.org|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary purpose was to eliminate their influence on Spain's large ''[[converso]]'' population and ensure they did not revert to Judaism. Over half of Spain's Jews had converted as a result of the religious persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Perez|2012|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to continuing attacks around 50,000 more had converted by 1415.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews of Spain: A History of the Sephardic Experience|last=Gerber|first=Jane|publisher=The Free Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0029115749|location=New York|pages=1-144}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further number of those remaining chose to convert to avoid expulsion. As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution in prior years, over 200,000 Jews converted to Catholicism and between 40,000 and 100,000 were expelled, an indeterminate number returning to Spain in the years following the expulsion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_a_Tragedy.html?id=GKYlN1ySFOYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=History of a Tragedy: The Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|last=Pérez|first=Joseph|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2007|isbn=9780252031410|location=|pages=|language=en|translator-last=Hochroth|translator-first=Lysa|author-link=Joseph Pérez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:17&lt;/sup&gt;

The edict was formally and symbolically revoked on 16 December 1968,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1968/12/17/archives/1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-by-spain-1492-ban-on-jews-is-voided-in.html "1492 Ban on Jews Is Voided by Spain"], ''The New York Times'', Dec. 17, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[Second Vatican Council]]. This was a full century after Jews had been openly practicing their religion in Spain and synagogues were once more legal places of worship under Spain's Laws of Religious Freedom.

In 1924, the regime of Primo de Rivera granted Spanish citizenship to the entire Sephardic Jewish diaspora. In 2014, the government of Spain passed a law allowing [[dual citizenship]] to Jewish descendants who apply, to "compensate for shameful events in the country's past."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/sephardic-jews-eager-to-apply-for-spanish-citizenship/2014/02/17/e56978dc-9810-11e3-ae45-458927ccedb6_story.html "Sephardic Jews eager to apply for Spanish citizenship"], ''Washington Post'', Feb. 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Sephardi Jews]] who can prove they are the descendants of those Jews expelled from Spain because of  the Alhambra Decree can "become Spaniards without leaving home or giving up their present nationality."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/europe/21596963-offer-right-past-wrong-may-not-lead-huge-influx-people-1492-and-all "1492 and all that"], ''The Economist'', Feb. 22, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/opinion/repatriating-spains-jews.html|title=Repatriating Spain’s Jews|last=Stavans|first=Ilan|date=2014-04-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|History of the Jews in Spain}}

By the end of the 8th century, [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslim]] forces had conquered and settled most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under Islamic law, the [[Jews]] who had lived in the region since at least [[Roman Empire|Roman times]], were considered "[[People of the Book]]," which was a protected status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The ornament of the world: How Muslims, Jews, and Christians created a culture of tolerance in medieval Spain|last=Menocal|first=María Rosa|date=|publisher=Back Bay Books|year=2012|isbn=9780316168717|edition=Reprint|location=|pages=|oclc=183353253|author-link=María Rosa Menocal|orig-year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the repressive policies of the Visigothic kingdom, who, starting in the sixth-century had enacted a series of anti-Jewish statutes which culminated in their forced conversion and enslavement, the tolerance of the Muslim Moorish rulers of ''[[al-Andalus]]'' allowed Jewish communities to thrive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Jewish merchants were able to trade freely across the Islamic world, which allowed them to flourish, and made Jewish enclaves in Muslim Iberian cities great centers of learning and commerce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This led to a flowering of Jewish culture, as Jewish scholars were able to gain favor in Muslim courts as skilled physicians, diplomats, translators, and poets.  Although Jews never enjoyed equal status to Muslims, in some [[Taifa|Taifas]], such as [[Taifa of Granada|Granada]], Jewish men were appointed to very high offices, including Grand Vizier.&lt;ref&gt;http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/ha-nagid.asp&lt;/ref&gt; However, Muslim forces did not control the entire peninsula.

The ''[[Reconquista]]'', or the gradual reconquest of Muslim Iberia by the [[Christian]] kingdoms in the North, was driven by a powerful religious motivation: to reclaim Iberia for [[Christendom]] following the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] centuries before. By the 14th century, most of the Iberian Peninsula (present-day Spain and [[Portugal]]) had been reconquered by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]], [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]].

During the Christian re-conquest, the Muslim kingdoms in Spain became less welcoming to the ''[[dhimmi]]''. In the late twelfth century, the Muslims in al-Andalus invited the fanatical [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohad]] dynasty from North Africa to push the Christians back to the North.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After they gained control of the Iberian Peninsula, the Almohads offered the Sephardim a choice between expulsion, conversion, and death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many Jewish people fled to other parts of the Muslim world, and also to the Christian kingdoms, which initially welcomed them. In Christian Spain, Jews functioned as courtiers, government officials, merchants, and moneylenders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, the Jewish community was both useful to the ruling classes and to an extent protected by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Faith of the Fallen Jews: Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi and the Writing of Jewish History (The Tauber Institute Series for the Study of European Jewry)|publisher=Brandeis University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1611684872|editor-last=Kaye|editor-first=Alexander|location=Massachusetts|pages=252-253|editor-last2=Meyers|editor-first2=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; The erosion of rights the Sephardim had enjoyed under the Muslims, in Christian territories was slow and in some areas barely perceptible.

As the [[Reconquista]] drew to a close, overt hostility against Jews in Christian Spain became more pronounced, finding expression in brutal episodes of violence and oppression. In the early fourteenth century, the Christian kings vied to prove their piety by allowing the clergy to subject the Jewish population to forced sermons and disputations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; More deadly attacks came later in the century from mobs of angry Catholics, led by popular preachers, who would storm into the Jewish quarter, destroy synagogues, and break into houses, forcing the inhabitants to choose between conversion and death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thousands of Jews sought to escape these attacks by converting to Christianity.These Jewish converts were commonly called ''[[converso]]s'', [[New Christian]]s, or ''[[marrano]]s''; the latter two terms were used as insults. At first these conversions seemed an effective solution to the cultural conflict: many ''converso'' families met with social and commercial success.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; But eventually their success made these new Catholics unpopular with their neighbors, including some of the clergy of the [[Catholic Church|Church]] and Spanish aristocrats competing with them for influence over the royal families. By the mid-fifteenth century, the demands of the Old Christians, that the Catholic Church and the monarchy differentiate them from the conversos, led to the first ''[[Limpieza de sangre|Limpieza de Sangre]]'' laws, which restricted opportunities for converts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

These suspicions on the part of Christians were only heightened by the fact that some of the coerced conversions were undoubtedly insincere. Some, but not all, ''conversos'' had understandably chosen to salvage their social and commercial positions or their lives by the only option open to them – baptism and embrace of Christianity – while privately adhering to their Jewish practice and faith. Recently converted families who continued to intermarry were especially viewed with suspicion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These secret practitioners are commonly referred to as [[crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] or ''marranos''.

The existence of crypto-Jews was a provocation for secular and [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] leaders who were already hostile toward Spain's Jewry. For their part, the Jewish community viewed conversos with compassion, because Jewish law held that conversion under threat of violence was not necessarily legitimate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although the Catholic Church was also officially opposed to forced conversion, under ecclesiastical law all baptisms were lawful, and once baptized, converts were not allowed to rejoin their former religion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The uncertainty over the sincerity of Jewish converts added fuel to the fire of [[antisemitism]] in 15th century Spain.

===European context===
{{Main|History of the Jews in Europe}}
[[File:Expulsion judios-en.svg|thumb|right|300px|Expulsions of Jews in Europe from 1100 to 1600]]

From the 13th to the 16th centuries European countries expelled the Jews from their territory on at least 15 occasions. Before the Spanish expulsion, the Jews were expelled from England in 1290 and multiple times from France between 1182 and 1354. The French case is typical of most expulsions, because whether they were local or national, the Jews were usually invited back a few years later.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Alienated Minority: The Jews of Medieval Latin Europe|last=Stow|first=Kenneth|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0674015937|location=Massachusetts|pages=181-308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews were also expelled from some of the German states. The Spanish expulsion was succeeded by at least five more expulsions, from other European countries.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7065-1327-4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Anti-Semitism: Israel Pocket Library|last=|first=|publisher=Keter Books|year=1974|isbn=9780706513271|volume=12|location=Jerusalem, IS|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teacher's"&gt;{{cite web |title=Map of Jewish expulsions and resettlement areas in Europe |url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/gallery/expuls.htm |work=A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust  |publisher=Florida Center for Instructional Technology, College of Education, University of South Florida |access-date=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the expulsion of the Jews from Spain was both the largest of its kind, and officially the longest in Western European history.

Over the four hundred year period the majority of these decrees were implemented, the meaning of the expulsions gradually changed. At first, the expulsions of the Jews, or lack thereof, were exercises of kingly prerogative. Jewish communities in Europe were often protected by and associated with European monarchs in the Middle Ages, because under the feudal system, the Jews were often the monarch’s only reliable tax base.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, the Jews had the reputation of moneylenders because they were the only group allowed to loan money at a profit under the prevailing interpretation of the [[Vulgate|Vulgate (Latin; official for Catholics) Bible]], which forbid Christians from collecting interest.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, the Jews were the creditors of the merchants, the aristocrats, and even the monarchs. Most expulsions were centered on this issue: the monarch would tax the Jewish community heavily, forcing them to call in loans, and then expel them. At the time of expulsion, the monarch would seize their remaining valuable assets, including the debts owed by the aristocrats and the merchants.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, expulsion of the Jews from Spain was unique not only in scale, but in its ideological motivations.

===Ferdinand and Isabella===
{{Main|Catholic Monarchs}}

Hostility towards the Jews in Spain was brought to a climax during the reign of the “Catholic Monarchs,” [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]]. Their marriage in 1469, which formed a [[personal union]] of the crowns of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], with coordinated policies between their distinct kingdoms, eventually led to the final unification of Spain.

Although their initial policies towards the Jews were protective, Ferdinand and Isabella were disturbed by reports claiming that most Jewish converts to Christianity were insincere in their conversion.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As mentioned above, some accusations that [[Converso|''conversos'']] continued to practice Judaism in secret (see [[Crypto-Judaism]]) were true, but the “Old” Christians exaggerated the scale of the problem. More serious were the accusations that the Jews were trying to draw conversos back into the Jewish fold. In 1478, Ferdinand and Isabella made a formal application to [[Holy See|Rome]] to set up an Inquisition in Castile to investigate these and other suspicions. In 1487, King Ferdinand promoted the establishment of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] Tribunals in Castile.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Aragon, it had been first instituted in 13th century to combat the Albigense heresy. However, the focus of this new Inquisition was to find and punish ''conversos'' who were practicing Judaism in secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0DoY6VKNSC0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Imperial Spain 1469-1716|last=Huxtable|first=Elliott John|publisher=Penguin|year=2002|isbn=9780141925578|location=London, UK|pages=|oclc=759581255|orig-year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These issues came to a head during Ferdinand and Isabella’s final conquest of Granada. The independent Islamic [[Emirate of Granada]] had been a [[tributary state]] to Castile since 1238. Jews and conversos played an important role during this campaign, because they had the ability to raise money and acquire weapons through their extensive trade networks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This perceived increase in Jewish influence further infuriated the Old Christians and the hostile elements of the clergy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Finally, in 1491 in preparation for an imminent transition to Castilian territory, the [[Treaty of Granada (1491)|Treaty of Granada]] was signed by Emir [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Muhammad XII]] and the Queen of Castile, protecting the religious freedom of the Muslims there. By 1492, Ferdinand and Isabella had won the [[Battle of Granada]] and completed the Catholic [[Reconquista]] of the Iberian Peninsula from Islamic [[Al-Andalus|forces]]. However, the Jewish population emerged from the campaign more hated by the populace and less useful to the monarchs.

==Decree==
[[File:Alhambra Decree.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A signed copy of the Edict of Expulsion]]
The king and queen issued the Alhambra Decree less than three months after the surrender of Granada. Although Isabella was the force behind the decision, her husband Fernando did not oppose it, and both proved skillful at exploiting the hopes of the desperate Jewish population for monetary gain.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  That her [[confessor]] had just changed from the tolerant [[Hernando de Talavera]] to the very intolerant [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]] suggests an increase in royal hostility towards the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.co.il/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/deisenbe/Other_Hispanic_Topics/Cisneros_y_la_quema_de_los_manuscritos_granadinos.htm&amp;prev=search|title=Cisneros y la quema de los manuscritos granadinos|last=Eisenberg|first=Daniel|date=|year=1993|website=|publisher=Journal of Hispanic Philology|pages=107–124|trans-title=Cisneros and the Burning of the Grenadinian Manuscripts|orig-year=1992|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 June 2017|volume=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most powerful proponent of the decision however, was Torquemada, the priest in charge of the Spanish Inquisition.{{cn|date=August 2018}} The text of the decree accused the Jews of trying "to subvert the holy Catholic faith” by attempting to "draw faithful Christians away from their beliefs."&lt;ref name="Decree-translation" /&gt; These measures were [[Edward I of England#Finances.2C Parliament and the expulsion of Jews|not new in Europe]].

After the decree was passed, Spain's entire Jewish population was given only four months to either convert to Christianity or leave the country. The edict promised the Jews' royal "protection and security" for the effective three-month window before the deadline. They were permitted to take their belongings with them, excluding “gold or silver or minted money or other things prohibited by the laws of our kingdoms."&lt;ref name="Decree-translation"/&gt; In practice, however, the Jews had to sell anything they could not carry: their land, their houses, and their libraries, and converting their wealth to a more portable form proved difficult. The market in Spain was saturated with these goods, which meant the prices were artificially lowered for the months before the deadline. As a result, much of the wealth of the Jewish community remained in Spain. The punishment for any Jew who did not convert or leave by the deadline was [[summary execution]].&lt;ref name="Decree-translation" /&gt;

===Dispersal===
The Sephardic Jews migrated to four major areas: North Africa, the Ottoman Empire, Portugal, and Italy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some [[Sephardi Jews|Spanish Jews]] who emigrated to avoid conversion [[Jewish diaspora|dispersed]]  throughout the region of North Africa known as the [[Maghreb]]. The Jewish scholars and physicians among previous Sephardic immigrants to this area had reinvigorated the Jewish communities in North Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in the 1490s, parts of the Mediterranean world, including Morocco were experiencing severe famine. As a result, a number of cities in Morocco refused to let the Spanish Jews in. This led to mass starvation among the refugees, and made the Jewish refugees vulnerable to the predation of slavers, although the regional ruler invalidated many of these sales within a few years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A good number of the Jews who had fled to North Africa returned to Spain and got converted. The Jews who stayed in North Africa often intermingled with the already existing [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] Arabic or Berber speaking communities, becoming the ancestors of the Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian and Libyan Jewish communities.

Many Spanish Jews also fled to the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they were given refuge. Sultan [[Bayezid II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], learning about the expulsion of Jews from Spain, dispatched the [[Ottoman Navy]] to bring the Jews safely to Ottoman lands, mainly to the cities of [[Thessaloniki]] (currently in [[Greece]]) and [[İzmir]] (currently in [[Turkey]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Turkey.html "Turkey"], ''Jewish Virtual Library''&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these Jews also settled in other parts of the Balkans ruled by the Ottomans such as the areas that are now Bulgaria, Serbia and Bosnia. Concerning this incident, Bayezid II is alleged to have commented, "those who say that Ferdinand and Isabella are wise are indeed fools; for he gives me, his enemy, his national treasure, the Jews."

A majority of Sephardim migrated to [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], where they gained [[Expulsion of the Jews from Portugal|only a few years of respite from persecution]]. About 600 Jewish families were allowed to stay in Portugal following an exorbitant bribe, until the Portuguese king entered negotiations to marry the daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella. Caught between his desire for an alliance with Spain and his economic reliance on the Jews, Manuel I declared the Jewish community in Portugal (perhaps then some 10% of that country's population)&lt;ref&gt;Kayserling, Meyer. "História dos Judeus em Portugal". Editora Pioneira, São Paulo, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; Christians by royal decree unless they left the country. In return, he promised the Inquisition would not come to Portugal for 40 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He then seized the Jews who tried to leave and had them forcibly baptized, after separating them from their children.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It was years before the Jews who fled to Portugal were allowed to emigrate. When the ban was lifted, many of them fled to the Low Countries, or the Netherlands. 

Throughout history, scholars have given widely differing numbers of Jews expelled from Spain. However, the figure is likely to be below the 100,000 Jews who had not yet converted to Christianity by 1492, possibly as low as 40,000. Such figures exclude the significant number of Jews who returned to Spain due to the hostile reception they received in their countries of refuge, notably [[Fez]] (Morocco). The situation of returnees was legalized with the Ordinance of the 10 of November 1492 which established that civil and church authorities should be witness to baptism and, in the case that they were baptized before arrival, proof and witnesses of baptism were required. Furthermore, all property could be recovered by returnees at the same price at which it was sold. Similarly the Provision of the Royal Council of 24 of October 1493 set harsh sanctions for those who slandered these New Christians with insulting terms such as ''tornadizos''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:115&lt;/sup&gt; After all, the Catholic monarchs were concerned with the souls of their subjects, and Catholic doctrine held that the persecution of converts would remove an important incentive for conversion. Returnees are documented as late as 1499.

===Conversions===
A majority of Spain's Jewish population had converted to Christianity during the waves of religious persecutions prior to the Decree—a total of 200,000 converts according to Joseph Pérez.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main objective of the expulsion of practicing Jews was  ensuring the sincerity of the conversions of such a large convert population. Of the 100,000 Jews that remained true to their faith by 1492, an additional number chose to convert and join the converso community rather than face expulsion. Recent conversos were subject to additional suspicion by the Inquisition, which had been established to persecute religious heretics, but in Spain and Portugal was focused on finding crypto-Jews. Although Judaism was not considered a heresy, professing Christianity while engaging in Jewish practices was heretical. Additionally, ''Limpieza de Sangre'' statutes instituted legal discrimination against converso descendants, barring them from certain positions and forbidding them from immigrating to the Americas. For years, families with urban origins who had extensive trade connections, and people who were learned and multilingual were suspected of having Jewish ancestry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to the prejudice of the time, a person with Jewish blood was untrustworthy and inferior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Such measures slowly faded away as converso identity was forgotten and this community merged into Spain's dominant Catholic culture. This process lasted until the eighteenth century, with a few exceptions, most notably the [[Chuetas]] of the island of [[Majorca]], where discrimination lasted into early 20th Century.

A [[Y chromosome]] [[DNA testing|DNA test]] conducted by the [[University of Leicester]] and the [[Pompeu Fabra University]] has indicated an average of nearly 20% for Spaniards having some direct patrilineal descent from populations from the Near East which colonized the region either in historical times, such as [[Jews]] and [[Phoenicians]], or during earlier prehistoric [[Neolithic]] migrations. Between the 90,000 Jews who converted under the Visigoth persecutions, and the 100,000+ Jews who converted in the years leading up to expulsion, it is likely that many of these people have Jewish ancestry. On the other hand, genetic studies have dispelled local beliefs in the American South West that Spanish Americans are the descendants of conversos.&lt;ref name="FloresMaca-Meyer2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flores |first1=Carlos |last2=Maca-Meyer |first2=Nicole |last3=González |first3=Ana M |last4=Oefner |first4=Peter J |last5=Shen |first5=Peidong |last6=Pérez |first6=Jose A |last7=Rojas |first7=Antonio |last8=Larruga |first8=Jose M |last9=Underhill |first9=Peter A |title=Reduced genetic structure of the Iberian peninsula revealed by Y-chromosome analysis: implications for population demography |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=12 |issue=10 |year=2004 |pages=855–863 |issn=1018-4813 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201225 |pmid=15280900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12627534 | doi=10.1002/ajpa.10168 | volume=120 | issue=4 | title=Mitochondrial DNA affinities at the Atlantic fringe of Europe |date=April 2003 | journal=Am.

==Modern Spanish policy==
The Spanish government has actively pursued a policy of reconciliation with the descendants of its expelled Jews. In 1924, the regime of Primo de Rivera granted Spanish citizenship to the entire Sephardic Jewish diaspora. As stated above, the Alhambra decree was officially revoked in 1968, after the Second Vatican Council rejected the charge of deicide traditionally attributed to the Jews. In 1992, in a ceremony marking the 500th anniversary of the Edict of Expulsion, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]] (wearing a [[Kippah|yarmulke]]) prayed alongside Israeli president [[Chaim Herzog]] and members of the Jewish community in the [[Beth Yaacov Synagogue (Madrid, Spain)|Beth Yaacov Synagogue]]. The King said, "[[Sepharad|Sefarad]] (the Hebrew name for Spain) isn't a nostalgic memory anymore; it is a place where it must not be said that Jews should simply 'feel' at home there, for indeed Hispano-Jews are at home in Spain...What matters is not accountability for what we may have done wrong or right, but the willingness to look to the future, and analyze the past in light of our future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://elpais.com/diario/1992/04/01/espana/702079221_850215.html |title=El Rey celebra en la sinagoga de Madrid "el encuentro con los judíos españoles" |last=Cembrero |first=Ignacio |date=1 April 1992 |access-date=9 September 2016 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The King celebrates the "meeting with Spanish Jews" in the Madrid synagogue}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From November 2012 Sephardi Jews have had the right to automatic Spanish nationality without the requirement of residence in Spain. Prior to November 2012, Sephardi Jews already had the right to obtain Spanish citizenship after a reduced residency period of two years (versus ten years for foreigners but natural from Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, Brazil and about other 20 American republics than also require 2 years.) While their citizenship is being processed, Sephardi Jews are entitled to the consular protection of the Kingdom of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/23/world/europe/spain-citizenship-process-eased-for-sephardic-jews.html |title=Spain: Citizenship Process Eased for Sephardic Jews |last=Minder |first=Raphael |publisher=The New York Times |date=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Spain unique among European nations as the only nation that currently grants automatic citizenship to the descendants of Jews expelled during the [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|European medieval evictions]]. Although these measures are popular in the Jewish community, they have also sparked some controversy. A minority of thinkers hold that these policies represent less the abnegation of prejudice as a shift to [[Philo-Semitism|philo-semitism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; As of November 2015, 4300 Sephardi Jews have benefited from this law and acquired Spanish citizenship, swearing allegiance to the Spanish Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2015/11/30/actualidad/1448887588_869275.html |title=El Rey, a los sefardíes: "¡Cuánto os hemos echado de menos!" |publisher=El País |date=30 November 2015 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The King, the Sephardim, "How I've missed you!"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the number of Jews in Spain was estimated to range between 40,000 and 50,000 people.

'''Avon County Council''' was the [[county council]] of the non-metropolitan county of [[Avon (county)|Avon]] in south west England. It came into its powers on 1 April 1974 and was abolished on 1 April 1996 at the same time as the county. The county council was based in [[Bristol]] at [[Avon House, Bristol|Avon House]] and Avon House North. It was replaced with four authorities: [[Bristol City Council]], [[South Gloucestershire Council]], [[North Somerset Council]] and [[Bath and North East Somerset Council]].

A '''cabinet crisis''' or '''government crisis''' is a situation when the [[government]] is challenged before the [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] period expires, because it threatens to resign over a proposal, or it is at risk at being dismissed after a [[motion of no confidence]], a conflict between the parties in a [[coalition government]] or a [[coup d'état]]. It may also be the result of there being no clear majority willing to work together to form a government.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} During this period a [[caretaker government]] with a limited mandate may take care of the day-to-day affairs of the state, while waiting for a [[snap election]].

'''Caesaropapism''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|iː|z|ər|oʊ|ˈ|p|eɪ|p|ɪ|z|əm}} is the idea of combining the [[power (social and political) | power]] of [[secularity|secular]] government with the religious power, or of making secular authority superior to the spiritual authority of the Church; especially concerning the connection of the Church with government. [[Justus Henning Böhmer]] (1674–1749) may have originally coined the term ''[[Wiktionary:caesaropapism|caesaropapism]]'' (''Cäseropapismus'').&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Pennington, "Caesaropapism," The New Catholic Encyclopedia: Supplement 2010 (2 Vols. Detroit: Gale Publishers 2010) 1.[http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/PenningtonCaesaropapism.htm 183-185] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184027/http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Canon%20Law/PenningtonCaesaropapism.htm |date=2013-10-29 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Weber]] (1864-1920) wrote: "a secular, caesaropapist ruler... exercises supreme authority in ecclesiastic matters by virtue of his autonomous legitimacy".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Weber's political sociology, caesaropapism entails "the complete subordination of priests to secular power."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In its extreme form, caesaropapism is a political theory in which the head of state, notably the emperor ("Caesar", by extension a "superior" king), is also the supreme head of the church (pope or analogous religious leader). In this form, caesaropapism inverts [[theocracy]] (or [[hierocracy]] in Weber) in which institutions of the church control the state. Both caesaropapism and theocracy are systems in which there is no [[separation of church and state]] and in which the two form parts of a single power-structure.

==Caesaropapism in the Eastern Church==

Caesaropapism's chief example is the authority that the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[List of Byzantine emperors|(East Roman) Emperors]] had over the [[Church of Constantinople]] and [[Eastern Christianity]] from the 330 consecration of [[Constantinople]] through the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Cross | first1 = F.L.| last2 = Livingstone | first2 = E.A.| title = Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church| publisher = Oxford University Press| year = 1983| location = Oxford| pages = [http://faculty.cua.edu/Pennington/ChurchHistory220/LectureTwo/caesaropapism.htm 218]| edition = 2nd

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Timothy Ware|Metropolitan Kallistos Ware]], the historical reality of caesaropapism stems from the confusion of the Byzantine Empire with the [[Kingdom of God]] and the zeal of the Byzantines "to establish here on earth a living icon of God's government in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saints, such as such as [[Maximus the Confessor]], resisted the imperial power as a consequence of their witness to orthodoxy. In addition, at several occasions imperial decrees had to be withdrawn as the people of the Church, both lay people, monks and priests, refused to accept inventions at variance with the Church's customs and beliefs. These events show that power over the Church really was in the hands of the Church itself – not solely with the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Caesaropapism was most notorious in the [[Tsardom of Russia]] when [[Ivan IV the Terrible]] assumed the title [[Czar]] in 1547 and subordinated the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] to the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was taken to a new level in 1721, when [[Peter the Great]] replaced the patriarchate with a [[Holy Synod]], making the church a department of his government.

==Caesaropapism in the Western Church==
[[File:San Vitale Ravenna.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]], Italy combines Western and Byzantine elements.]]{{main|Byzantine Papacy}}

[[Justinian I]] conquered the Italian peninsula in the [[Gothic War (535–554)]] and [[papal selection before 1059|appointed the next three popes]], a practice that would be continued by his successors and later be delegated to the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. The ''Byzantine Papacy'' was a period of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] domination of the [[pope|papacy]] from 537 to 752, when popes required the approval of the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] for [[consecration#Roman Catholic Church|episcopal consecration]], and many popes were chosen from the ''[[apocrisiarius|apocrisiarii]]'' (liaisons from the pope to the emperor) or the inhabitants of [[Byzantine Greece]], [[Byzantine Syria]], or [[History of Sicily#Byzantine period|Byzantine Sicily]].

===Analogue in the Church of England===

When [[Henry VIII of England]] declared the [[Church of England]] to exist as an entity separate from and independent of the Roman Church, he declared himself to be the [[Supreme Head of the Church of England|"Supreme Head" of that church]], to which declaration the English Parliament acceded by passing the [[Act of Supremacy 1534]] at Henry's behest. When [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] restored royal supremacy, she replaced the title "Supreme Head" with that of "[[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|Supreme Governor]]", a change both conciliatory to English Catholics on a political level and reflecting a shift toward a more metaphysically and theologically modest stance involving only a claim to supreme authority over the Church of England's conduct in temporal matters. Since then, the monarchs of England, of Great Britain, and of the United Kingdom have claimed the "Supreme Governor" status as well as the title of ''[[fidei defensor|Defender of the Faith]]'' (which was originally bestowed on Henry VIII by [[Pope Leo X]] but later revoked by [[Pope Paul III]]).

{{About|the Jewish-Palestinian ideological movement|ancient Canaanite polytheism|Canaanite religion}}
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
{{Israelis}}
'''Canaanism''' was a cultural and ideological movement founded in 1939 that reached its peak in the 1940s among the [[Jews]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. It has had significant effect on the course of Israeli art, [[Israeli literature|literature]] and spiritual and political thought. Its adherents were called '''Canaanites''' ({{lang-he-n|כנענים}}). The movement's original name was the ''Council for the Coalition of Hebrew Youth'' ({{Hebrew|הוועד לגיבוש הנוער העברי}}); "Canaanism" was originally a pejorative term. It grew out of [[Revisionist Zionism]] and according to Ron Kuzar had "its early roots in [[Far-right politics|European extreme right-wing]] movements, notably [[Italian Fascism|Italian fascism]]"&lt;ref&gt;Kuzar 107, 12-13&lt;/ref&gt; which was not anti-Semitic like [[Nazism|German national socialism]]. Most of its members were part of the [[Irgun]] or [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]].&lt;ref name="Kuzar 13"&gt;Kuzar 13&lt;/ref&gt; Canaanism never had more than around two dozen registered members, but because most of these were influential intellectuals and artists, the movement had an influence far beyond its size,&lt;ref name="kuzar107"&gt;Kuzar 197&lt;/ref&gt; Its members believed that much of the Middle East had been a Hebrew-speaking civilization in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Kuzar 12"&gt;Kuzar 12&lt;/ref&gt; Kuzar also says they hoped to revive this civilization, creating a "Hebrew" nation, disconnected from the Jewish past, which would embrace the Middle East's Arab population as well.&lt;ref name="Kuzar 12"/&gt;  They saw both "world Jewry and world Islam" as backward and medieval; Ron Kuzar writes that the movement "exhibited an interesting blend of militarism and power politics toward the Arabs as an organized community on the one hand and a welcoming acceptance of them as individuals to be redeemed from medieval darkness on the other."&lt;ref name="Kuzar 13"/&gt;

==The Canaanites and Judaism==
The movement was founded in 1939. In 1943 the Jewish-Palestinian poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] published an "Epistle to the Hebrew Youth", the first manifesto of the Canaanites. In this tract, Ratosh called upon Hebrew youth to disaffiliate themselves from [[Judaism]], and declared that no meaningful bond united Hebrew youth residing in Palestine and Judaism. Ratosh argued that Judaism was not a [[nation]] but a [[religion]], and as such it was universal, without territorial claims; one could be Jewish anywhere. For a nation to genuinely arise in Palestine, he maintained, the youth must uncouple from Judaism and form a [[Hebrew]] nation with its own unique identity. (The term "Hebrew" had been associated with the Zionist aspiration to create a strong, self-confident "new Jew" since the late nineteenth century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Segev|first=Tom|author2=Haim Watzman|title=Elvis in Jerusalem: Post-Zionism and the Americanization of Israel  |publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|pages=26|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rCAk-6zJIC8C&amp;pg=PA26 | isbn=978-0-8050-7288-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shavit xiv&lt;/ref&gt;  The birthplace and geographical coordinates of this nation is the [[Fertile Crescent]].

The Council for the Coalition of Hebrew Youth calls upon you as a Hebrew, as one for whom the Hebrew homeland is a homeland in actuality: not as vision, nor as desire; and not as solution for the Jewish question, nor as solution to cosmic questions, and not as solution to the variegated neuroses of those stricken by the diaspora. As one for whom the Hebrew language is a language in actuality and practicality, a mother tongue, a language of culture and of the soul; the one and only language for emotion and thought. As one whose character and intellect were determined in the Hebrew reality, whose internal landscape is the landscape of the nation and whose past is the past of the nation alone. As one who, despite the best efforts of rootless parents, teachers, statesmen and religious leaders, could not be made to like and affiliate with the [[Shtetl]] and the history of the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], the pogroms and expulsions and martyrs, and whose natural estrangement from all prophets of Zionism, the fathers of Jewish Literature in the Hebrew tongue, and the diaspora mentality and the diaspora problem, cannot be expunged. Whereas all these were conferred upon you by force, like a borrowed cloth, faded and tattered and too-tight.&lt;ref name="epistle"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Out of their estrangement from Judaism the Canaanites were also estranged from [[Zionism]]. The [[Israel|State of Israel]] ought to be, they argued, a [[Jewish state|Hebrew state]], not a solution to the [[Jewish Question]]. Following the first [[Aliyah|Aliyot]], a generation arose in Palestine that spoke Hebrew as a native language and did not always identify with Judaism. Designating the Israeli People as a "Jewish People", the Canaanites argued, was misleading. If it was possible to be a Jew anywhere, then the State of Israel was merely an anecdote in the [[history of Judaism]]. A nation must be rooted in a territory and a language—things which Judaism, in its very nature, could not provide.

==Canaanites and history==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

The movement promoted the idea that the [[Land of Israel]] was that of ancient [[Canaan]] (or, according to others, the whole of the [[Fertile Crescent]]) in which ancient peoples and cultures had lived, and that the historical occasion of the reemergence of an Israeli people constituted a veritable revival of these selfsame ancient Hebrews and their civilization, and consequently a rejection of religious Judaism in favor of a native and rooted Hebrew identity.

Because the Canaanites sought to create in Israel a new people, they mandated the dissociation of [[Israelis]] from Judaism and the history of Judaism. In their stead they placed the culture and history of the [[Ancient Near East]], which they considered the true historical reference. They argued that the people of the Land of Israel in the days of the biblical monarchs had not been [[Jews|Jewish]] but [[Hebrews|Hebrew]], and had shared a cultural context with other peoples of the region. Citing contemporary [[biblical criticism]], the Canaanites argued that the [[Hebrew Bible|Tanakh]] reflected this ancient history, but only partly, since it had been compiled in the period of the [[Second Temple]] by Jewish [[Scribe|scribes]] who had rewritten the history of the region to suit their world-view.

Much of the Canaanite effort was dedicated to researching the history of the [[Middle East]] and its peoples. The Canaanites cited approvingly the work of [[Umberto Cassuto]], who translated [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] poetry into Hebrew. ([[Ugarit]] was an ancient city located in modern-day northern [[Syria]], where in the early 20th century many important ancient texts, written in the [[Ugaritic language]], were discovered.) Ugaritic verse bore an uncanny resemblance to the language of the [[Tanakh]]. The Canaanites argued that these texts proved that the people of the [[Land of Israel]] had been much closer socially and culturally to other peoples of the region than they had been to Judaism.

==Canaanites and literature==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
In his book, ''Sifrut Yehudit ba-lashon ha-ʻIvrit'' (Jewish Literature in the Hebrew Tongue), Yonatan Ratosh sought to differentiate between [[Hebrew literature]] and [[Jewish literature]] written in the [[Hebrew language]]. Jewish literature, Ratosh claimed, could be and was written in any number of languages. The ideas and writing style that characterize Jewish literature in Hebrew were not substantially different from those of Jewish literature in other languages. Ratosh and his fellow Canaanites (especially [[Aharon Amir]]) thought that Hebrew literature should be rooted to its historical origins in the [[Land of Israel]] and the [[Hebrew language]]. As an example they noted American literature, which in their mind was newly created for the new American people.

Canaanite verse is often obscure to those unfamiliar with ancient Ugaritic and [[Canaanite mythology]]. One of the principal techniques used by the Canaanites to produce Hebrew literature was to adopt words and phrases (especially [[hapax legomenon|hapax legomena]], which the Canaanites regarded as traces of the original unedited Hebraic Tanakh) from the Tanakh, and use them in a poetic that approximated [[Biblical poetry|biblical]] and Ugaritic verse, especially in their use of repetitive structures and [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]. The Canaanites did not rule out the use of new Hebrew words, but many of them did avoid [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] Hebrew. However, these characteristics represent only the core of the Canaanite movement, and not its full breadth.

The late literary scholar [[Baruch Kurzweil]] argued that the Canaanites were not ''[[sui generis]]'', but a direct continuation (albeit a radical one) of the literature of [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski]] and [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]].

==Canaanites and language==
Ratosh and his brother, [[Uzzi Ornan]], also sought for the [[Romanization of Hebrew]] in order to further divorce the language from the older [[Hebrew alphabet]]. Writing articles in the Hebrew-language press in the 1960s and 1970s, they criticized the Hebrew alphabet for its graphical shortcomings and relationship with Judaism, and proposed for official Romanization of the language in order to further free secular Hebrew Israelis from the hold of religion and integrate them into the larger [[Levant|Levantine region]].&lt;ref&gt;J. S. Diamond, Homeland or Holy Land? The ‘Canaanite’ Critique of Israel (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yaakov Shavit, The New Hebrew Nation (London: Frank Cass, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Their proposals for wholesale Romanization met condemnation from various public figures due to the perception that Romanization was a means of assimilation and Levantinization.&lt;ref&gt;Esther Raizen, “Romanization of the Hebrew Script,” 1987. (University of Texas Press) pp. 41–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aytürk later compared the Canaanite proposal for Romanization to the more successful reform of the [[Turkish alphabet]] [[Atatürk's Reforms|as undertaken by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] in [[Turkey]]; the reform of Turkish spelling, which had previously been written in the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]-based [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] for over 1,000 years until the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], was similarly motivated by Atatürk's attempts to secularize and modernize post-Ottoman Turkish society.&lt;ref&gt;İlker Aytürk, "Script Charisma in Hebrew and Turkish: A Comparative Framework for Explaining Success and Failure of Romanization," Journal of World History, Volume 21, Number 1, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}

The Coalition published a journal, ''[[Aleph]]'', which ran from 1948-1953, featuring the works of several luminaries of the movement including Ratosh, [[Adia Horon]], [[Uzzi Ornan]], [[Amos Kenan]] and [[Benjamin Tammuz]]. It was edited by [[Aharon Amir]], and the journal circulated erratically throughout its existence.

The history of the Coalition and the movement was fraught with controversy and opposition. In 1951, leaflets were distributed by self-identified Canaanites in opposition to Zionism during the [[World Zionist Congress]] in Jerusalem that year. Later that year, the Coalition was formally organized at a conference of ideologues, but the permit to formally register as an NGO was deliberately delayed by the Interior Ministry; the ministry's representative explained that the approval has been delayed because "the group did not complete the standard inquiry of the granting of approvals for political societies". The group claimed as many as 500 members at its height, although outside commentators only assessed the membership at around 100.

After the arrest of Amos Kenan in June 1952 on suspicion of throwing a bomb onto the doorstep of [[David-Zvi Pinkas]], newspaper editorials were lodged against the Canaanite movement and its members. The Coalition claimed to have no connection to Kenan or his act, and both Amir and Ratosh filed a [[defamation|libel suit]] against [[Isaiah Bernstein]] of ''[[HaTzofe]]'' and [[Ezriel Carlebach]] from ''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]'' on behalf of the Coalition, but the suit was rejected for technical reasons.

In the 1960s, the movement's members participated in group discussions called "Hebrew Thought Clubs" and issued a booklet of their discussions as "the first claw." Among participants in the discussions were also identified individuals who were Canaanites, as [[Rostam Bastuni]], an Israeli Arab who was a member of the second Knesset for Mapam, and [[Yehoshua Palmon]].

==Scope and influence==
[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|200px|''Nimrod'' (1939) by [[Yitzhak Danziger]], a visual emblem of the Canaanite idea.]]
The political influence of the Canaanites was limited, but their influence on literary and intellectual life in Israel was great. Among the avowed Canaanites were the poet [[Yonatan Ratosh]] and thinkers such as [[Edya Horon]]. A series of articles which Horon published in the journal "Keshet" in 1965 were compiled after his death into a book and published in 2000. These articles constituted political and cultural manifestos that sought to create a direct connection between [[Semitic culture]] from the second millennium BCE and contemporary Israeli culture, relying on advancements in the fields of [[archeology]] and research of [[Semitic languages]] in [[linguistics]].

Some of the artists who took after the movement were the sculptor [[Yitzhak Danziger]] (whose ''Nimrod'' became a visual emblem of the Canaanite idea), novelist [[Benjamin Tammuz]], writer [[Amos Kenan]], novelist and translator [[Aharon Amir]], thinker and linguist [[Uzzi Ornan]] and many others.

The journalist [[Uri Avnery]] praised Horon's journal ''[[Shem]]'' in 1942 but did not subscribe to Ratosh's orthodoxy; in 1947 he derided the Canaanites as [[Romanticism|romantic]], anachronistic, and divorced from reality.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 135-37, 139&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the influence of Canaanism is still evident in some of his political thought, such as his 1947 proposal for a pan-Semitic union of Middle Eastern states.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 141&lt;/ref&gt;  Avnery, along with several former Canaanites (notably Kenan and [[Boaz Evron]]) later changed positions drastically, becoming advocates for a Palestinian state.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 151-153&lt;/ref&gt;  Israeli leftists and secularists are sometimes accused of Canaanism or Canaanite influence by their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;Shavit 20: "Some observers, very ironically, still find strong echoes of Canaanite ideology in what they consider anti-religious and leftist political opinions".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journalterraincognita.blogspot.nl/2008/03/terra-incognita-26-jewish-tourism.html "Jewish tourism, mexican racism and canaanism,"] Terra Incognita, Issue 26, A Publication of Seth J.

The idea of creating a new people in Palestine different from the Jewish life in the diaspora which preceded it never materialized in purist Canaanite conception, but nevertheless had a lasting effect on the self-understanding of many spheres of Israeli public life.

==Criticism==
The Canaanite movement, since soon after its inception, has met with heavy criticism. In 1945 [[Nathan Alterman]] published the poem "Merivat Kayitz" (later included in the collection ''Yr HaYona'', published in 1958), which took issue with the central tenets of the Canaanite movement. Alterman and others claimed that so many years in the diaspora cannot be simply expunged. Alterman argued that no one should coerce the Jewish settlement to adopt an identity; its identity will be determined through its experience in time.

Ratosh responded with an article in 1950 in which he claimed that Alterman was dodging important questions about Israeli identity. He argued that a return to ancient Hebrew traditions is not only feasible but necessary.

Alterman was not the only person to speak out against the Canaanites. Among the important critics of the movement was [[Baruch Kurzweil]], who published ''The Roots and Quintessence of the 'Young Hebrews' Movement'' in 1953, which analyzed and sharply criticized Canaanite ideas. Kurzweil argued that the Canaanite ambition to motivate the variegated ethnography of the region in a single direction was not as easy as the Canaanites believed. Kurzweil believed the Canaanites replaced [[logos]] with [[Mythology|mythos]], producing a religious delusion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Since it itself neglects the historical continuity of its people, introduces obscure concepts into their political vision in its declarations of a 'Hebrew Land on the Euphrates', and relies on increasingly irrational argumentation, the movement is liable to find itself an escape into the realm of myth.

The Young Hebrews are not the first to launch themselves into the task of mythic renewal. Their original contribution is rather stale. For over a hundred years, the world has pined for a return to the lap of myth.  The escapes into various myths have hitherto inflicted disasters upon humanity. In the spirit of good faith, it is best to assume that the whole chapter of mythic renewal in European thought is unclear to them. For the moment, we shall content ourselves with this quotation from [[Johan Huizinga|Huizinga]]: "Barbarization sets in when, in an old culture… the vapors of the magic and fantastic rise up again from the seething brew of passions to cloud the understanding: when the mythos supplants the logos."&lt;ref name="huizinga"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same article Kurzweil argues that, if no viable alternative was found, the Canaanite movement might become the leading political ideology in Israel.

The '''Comandos Autónomos Anticapitalistas''' ('''CAA''' or '''CCAA''') ({{lang-eu|Komando Autonomo Antikapitalistak}}; "Autonomous Anticapitalist Commandos") were a [[Basque people|Basque]] armed group in Spain with [[Autonomism|Autonomist Marxist]] politics, defined as an [[anarchism|anarchistic]] breakaway of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]].

The group was very active in the 1970s and 1980s. The most important attack was the assassination of [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]] [[Senate of Spain|Senator]] [[Enrique Casas]] in 1984, which was rejected by all the political spectrum including ETA, which at the time, rejected violence against politicians.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}
Soon after, one of the few operating CAA commandos was ambushed by the [[Guardia Civil]] at the bay of [[Pasaia]], killing four – all but one.

The ambush at Pasaia is dealt with in a documentary film called "Pasaiako Badia". [[Pasaiako Badia]] In this film, witnesses, relatives and others recount the arrest of Rosa Jimeno by the Spanish police, her torture and the trap set for the CAA, which included Rosa being tied up and a rendezvous with the members of CAA arranged. She was forced to set a date with CAA members near the harbor at Pasaia in March 1984.  Once the CAA members arrived in the harbor the armed police, shot Pelu and Pelitxo, killing both, and arrested two, ‘Txapas' and ‘Kurro', who were tortured and killed. Joseba Merino&lt;ref name="undefined" /&gt; and Rosa survived. The G.A.L. a paramilitary group including former francoist officers which used public funds and participated in the Spanish state's war on terrorism was allegedly involved in the ambush.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2851">A '''comeback''', in terms of [[publicity]], is a return by a well-known person to the activity in which they initially obtained their fame. Comebacks can occur in all walks of life, and have been noted to occur in entertainment, sports, and politics.

A comeback may occur after a public figure has been forced to withdraw from the public eye due to a real or perceived scandal.

==Entertainment==
An entertainer may make a comeback after having been absent from their area of entertainment for a time.

In South Korea, [[Comeback (K-pop)]], talent agencies stage-manage the debut of new acts in order to create anticipation for the new act, which will often officially debut live on one of the main television music programs with a "debut stage". For the debut [[Single (music)|single]], acts will have an overall "[[gimmick|concept]]", a marketing hook, which influences the name of the act, clothes, choreography, catch phrases and how they are presented; within bands individual members will have a personal concept, this being a role that they will play within the band, e.g. leader, visual, maknae, rapper e.t.c. Once a rookie act's debut cycle has ended they enter their second promotional cycle with a "comeback", called as such even when the musician or group in question did not go on hiatus.&lt;ref name="ramstadwsj"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ramstad|first=Evan|title=Korea Counts Down Not Just To New Year, But to New Girls' Album|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2012/12/31/korea-counts-down-not-just-to-new-year-but-to-new-girls-album/|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=5 January 2013|quote=One of the unique things about album releases by K-pop artists is that they are routinely called 'comebacks' even when there's been no evidence that the musician or group went away or, in the conventional sports usage of the term, experienced a setback or loss.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each promotional cycle will be presented with its own concept.

==Sports==
{{distinguish|Comeback (sports)}}
In sports, a comeback occurs where an athlete or a team returns to success after a period of poor performance or inactivity. "The comeback may be the most compelling phenomenon in sports. ... Comebacks in individual sports like tennis, boxing, or golf occur more commonly than in team sports, as athletes in these games have more control over their destiny".&lt;ref&gt;Rick Swaine, ''Baseball's Comeback Players: Forty Major Leaguers Who Fell and Rose Again'' (2014), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
A politician may make a comeback after having left public life, either voluntarily or through loss of an election.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Shlomit Barnea, "Chronicles of the Comeback that Was and the One that Almost Was", in Asher Arian, Michal Shamir, ''The Elections in Israel 2009'' (2011), p. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1647">The '''commanding heights of the economy''' refers to existing private industry essential to the economy like public utilities, natural resources, heavy industry and transport as well as control over foreign and domestic trade. This phrase emerged from a branch of modern political philosophy concerned with organizing society and can be traced back to [[Karl Marx]]'s idea on socialism, which stresses the commanding heights and advocates for government control of it. This should not be confused with complete socialism or communism.

According to [[Yevgeni Preobrazhensky]], a Bolshevik economist, control over the "commanding heights of the economy" would ensure "[[primitive socialist accumulation]]".{{sfn|Bonner|2013|p=86}} [[Deng Xiaoping]], the leader who along with [[Chen Yun]] introduced the [[Chinese economic reforms]], was inspired by this concept. The [[Communist Party of China]] still believes to this day that the state needs to control the economy's commanding heights.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Consent theory''' is a term for the idea in [[social philosophy]] that individuals primarily make decisions as [[Free will|free agent]]s entering into consensual relationships with other free agents, and that this becomes the basis for political governance. An early elaborator of this idea was [[John Locke]], from whom the expression "[[all men are created equal]]" can be traced. Consent theory goes back at least to the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title="Oh, Ye Are For Anarchy!": Consent Theory in the Radical Libertarian Tradition|author=C Watner|publisher=Journal of Libertarian Studies|year=1986|url=http://mises.org/sites/default/files/8_1_9_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
One criticism is after the original administering of consent by the people, subsequent generations often only give [[tacit consent]] to the government. Without the power to refuse consent, true consent cannot be given.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''Corporatism''' is the organization of a society by [[Corporate group (sociology)|corporate groups]], such as agricultural, labour, military, scientific, or guild associations, on the basis of their common interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IKn2y2yS014C&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=%22system+of+social+organization+that+has+at+its+base+the+grouping+of+men+according+to+the+community+of+their+natural+interests%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22system%20of%20social%20organization%20that%20has%20at%20its%20base%20the%20grouping%20of%20men%20according%20to%20the%20community%20of%20their%20natural%20interests%22&amp;f=false|title=Corporatism and Comparative Politics: The Other Great Ism|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|author=. Wiarda, Howard J|year=1996|location=0765633671|pages=22–23|isbn=0765633671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke, Paul A. B. 2001. Pp. 113"&gt;Clarke, Paul A. B; Foweraker, Joe. ''Encyclopedia of democratic thought''. London, UK; New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, [[Pope Leo XIII]] commissioned theologians and social thinkers to study corporatism and provide a definition for it. In 1884 in [[Freiburg]], the commission declared that corporatism was a "system of social organization that has at its base the grouping of men according to the community of their natural interests and social functions, and as true and proper organs of the state they direct and coordinate labor and capital in matters of common interest".&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 35"/&gt; Corporatism is related to the [[sociology|sociological]] concept of [[structural functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Adler, Franklin Hugh Pp. 349"&gt;Adler, Franklin Hugh.''Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The Political Development of the Industrial Bourgeoisie, 1906–34''. Pp. 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J 1996. Pp. 10"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murchison, Carl Allanmore 1967. Pp. 150"&gt;Murchison, Carl Allanmore; Allee, Warder Clyde. ''A handbook of social psychology, Volume 1''. 1967. Pp. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conwy Lloyd Morgan 2009. Pp. 14"&gt;Conwy Lloyd Morgan, Conwy Lloyd. ''Animal Behaviour''. Bibliolife, LLC, 2009. Pp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Corporatist ideas are common to ideologies including [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]], [[fascism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 31-38, 44, 111, 124, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporatism may also refer to economic [[tripartism]] involving negotiations between business, labour and state interest groups to establish economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Slomp. ''European politics into the twenty-first century: integration and division''. Westport, Connecticut, USA: Praeger Publishers, 2000. Pp. 81&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes also referred to as neo-corporatism and is associated with [[social democracy]].&lt;ref name="Social Democratic Corporatism and Economic Growth, 1988"&gt;''Social Democratic Corporatism and Economic Growth'', by Hicks, Alexander. 1988. The Journal of Politics, vol. 50, no. 3, pp. 677-704. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;{{how|date=July 2017}}

==Common types==
===Kinship corporatism===
[[Kinship]]-based corporatism emphasizing [[clan]], ethnic and family identification has been a common phenomenon in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. [[Confucianism|Confucian]] societies based upon families and clans in East Asia and Southeast Asia have been considered types of corporatism. [[China]] has strong elements of [[clan corporatism]] in its society involving legal norms concerning family relations.&lt;ref&gt;Bao-Er. China's Neo-traditional Rights of the Child. Blaxland, Australia: Lulu.com, 2006. Pp. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islam]]ic societies often feature strong clans which form the basis for a community-based corporatist society.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J 1996. Pp. 10"/&gt; [[Family business]]es are common worldwide in capitalist societies.

===Corporatism in the Roman Catholic Church===
In the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] sponsored the creation of various institutions including brotherhoods, monasteries, religious orders and military associations, especially during the [[Crusades]], to sponsor association between these groups. In [[Italy]], various function-based groups and institutions were created, including universities, [[guild]]s for artisans and craftspeople and other professional associations.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 31"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the guild system is a particularly important aspect of the history of corporatism because it involved the allocation of power to regulate trade and prices to guilds, which is an important aspect of corporatist economic models of economic management and [[class collaboration]].&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 31" /&gt;

Corporatism's popularity increased in the late 19th century and a corporatist internationale was formed in 1890, followed by the publishing of ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' by the Catholic Church that for the first time declared the Church's blessing to trade unions and recommended for organized labour to be recognized by politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Many corporatist unions in Europe were endorsed by the Catholic Church to challenge the [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]] and other radical unions, with the corporatist unions being fairly conservative in comparison to their radical rivals.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Catholic corporatist states include Austria under the leadership of Federal Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] and Ecuador under the leadership of [[Garcia Moreno]]. The economic vision outlined in ''Rerum novarum'' and ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' also influenced the regime of [[Juan Perón]] and [[Justicialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bethell |first1=Leslie |title=Argentina Since Independence |date=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rein |first1=Monica |title=Politics and Education in Argentina, 1946-1962 |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |quote=The Church's social concept presented an alternative to the Marxist and capitalist positions, both of which it saw as misguided. Justicialism sought to extend this line of thinking.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aasmundsen |first1=Hans Geir |title=Pentecostals, Politics, and Religious Equality in Argentina |date=2016 |publisher=BRILL |page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the Roman Catholic corporatism of the 1890s, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] corporatism was developed, especially in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Protestant corporatism has been much less successful in obtaining assistance from governments than its Roman Catholic counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biology===
In social psychology and biology, researchers have found the presence of [[corporate group]] social organization amongst animal species.&lt;ref name="Murchison, Carl Allanmore 1967. Pp. 150"/&gt; Research has shown that [[penguin]]s are known to reside in densely populated corporate breeding colonies.&lt;ref name="Murchison, Carl Allanmore 1967. Pp. 150"/&gt;

====Communitarian corporatism====
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Plato]] (left) and [[Aristotle]] (right)]]
Ancient Greece developed early concepts of corporatism. [[Plato]] developed the concept of a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] and [[Communitarianism|communitarian]] corporatist system of natural-based classes and natural [[Social hierarchy|social hierarchies]] that would be organized based on function, such that groups would cooperate to achieve social harmony by emphasizing [[collective]] interests while rejecting individual interests.&lt;ref name="Adler, Franklin Hugh Pp. 349"/&gt;

In ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' , [[Aristotle]] also described society as being divided along natural classes and functional purposes that were priests, rulers, slaves and warriors.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 29"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Rome adopted Greek concepts of corporatism into their own version of corporatism but also added the concept of political representation on the basis of function that divided representatives into military, professional and religious groups and created institutions for each group known as ''[[wikt:colegio|colegios]]''&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 29"/&gt; ({{lang-la|[[wikt#Latin:collegium|collegia]]}}). See [[collegium (ancient Rome)]].

====Absolutist corporatism====
Absolute monarchies during the late Middle Ages gradually subordinated corporatist systems and corporate groups to the authority of centralized and [[Autocracy|absolutist]] governments, resulting in corporatism being used to enforce [[social hierarchy]].&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 33"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the French Revolution, the existing absolutist corporatist system was abolished due to its endorsement of social hierarchy and special "corporate privilege" for the Roman Catholic Church. The new French government considered corporatism's emphasis on group rights as inconsistent with the government's promotion of individual rights. Subsequently corporatist systems and corporate privilege throughout Europe were abolished in response to the French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 33"/&gt; From 1789 to the 1850s, most supporters of corporatism were [[Reactionary|reactionaries]].&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 35"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of reactionary corporatists favoured corporatism in order to end liberal [[capitalism]] and restore the [[feudalism|feudal system]].&lt;ref name="J. Barry Jones 2001. Pp. 243"&gt;R. J. Barry Jones. ''Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries A-F''. Taylor &amp; Frances, 2001. Pp. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Progressive corporatism====
From the 1850s onward, [[Progressivism|progressive]] corporatism developed in response to [[classical liberalism]] and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 35"/&gt; These corporatists supported providing group rights to members of the middle classes and working classes in order to secure cooperation among the classes. This was in opposition to the Marxist conception of [[class conflict]]. By the 1870s and 1880s, corporatism experienced a revival in Europe with the creation of workers' unions that were committed to negotiations with employers.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 35"/&gt;

In his work ''[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' ("Community and Society") of 1887, [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] began a major revival of corporatist philosophy associated with the development of [[neo-medievalism]] and increased promotion of [[guild socialism]] and causing major changes of theoretical [[sociology]]. Tönnies claims that [[Organicism|organic]] communities based upon clans, communes, families and professional groups are disrupted by the mechanical society of economic classes imposed by capitalism.&lt;ref name="Peter F. Klarén 1986. Pp. 221"&gt;Peter F. Klarén, Thomas J. Bossert. Promise of development: theories of change in Latin America. Boulder, Colorado, USA: Westview Press, 1986. Pp. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Socialists used Tönnies' theory to promote their notion of ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' ("people's community").&lt;ref&gt;Francis Ludwig Carsten, Hermann Graml. ''The German resistance to Hitler''. Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press. Pp. 93&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tönnies opposed [[Nazism]] and joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] in 1932 to oppose fascism in Germany and was deprived of his honorary professorship by [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Tönnies, José Harris. ''Community and civil society''. Cambridge University Press, 2001 (first edition in 1887 as ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft''). Pp. xxxii-xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Corporate solidarism====
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] advocated a form of corporatism termed "solidarism" that advocated creating an [[Organicism|organic]] [[social solidarity]] of society through functional representation.&lt;ref name="Antony Black 1984. P226"&gt;Antony Black, pp. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; Solidarism was based upon Durkheim's view that the dynamic of human society as a [[collective]] is distinct from that of an individual, in that society is what places upon individuals their cultural and social attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Black, pp. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim claimed that in the economy solidarism would alter the division of labour by changing it from the mechanical [[social solidarity|solidarity]] to organic solidarity. Durkheim claimed that the existing industrial [[Capitalism|capitalist]] division of labour caused "juridical and moral ''[[anomie]]''" which had no norms or agreed procedures to resolve conflicts resulting in chronic confrontation between employers and trade unions.&lt;ref name="Antony Black 1984. P226"/&gt; Durkheim believed that this anomie caused social [[dislocation]] and claimed that by this "[i]t is the law of the strongest which rules, and there is inevitably a chronic state of war, latent or acute".&lt;ref name="Antony Black 1984. P226"/&gt; As a result, Durkheim claimed it is a moral obligation of the members of society to end this situation by creating a moral organic solidarity based upon professions as organized into a single public institution.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Black, pp. 226, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Liberal corporatism====
[[File:John-stuart-mill-sized.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of [[John Stuart Mill]]]]
The idea of [[liberal corporatism]] has also been attributed to English liberal philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] who discussed corporatist-like economic associations as needing to "predominate" in society to create equality for labourers and give them influence with management by [[economic democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, Samuel. ''The commercial society: foundations and challenges in a global age''. Lanham,USA; Plymouth, UK: Lexington Books, 2007. Pp. 109&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike some other types of corporatism, liberal corporatism does not reject capitalism or [[individualism]], but believes that the capitalist companies are social institutions that should require their managers to do more than maximize [[net income]] by recognizing the needs of their employees.&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"&gt;Waring, Stephen P. ''Taylorism Transformed: Scientific Management Theory Since 1945''. University of North Carolina Press, 1994. Pp. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

This liberal corporatist ethic is similar to [[Taylorism]], but endorses democratization of capitalist companies. Liberal corporatists believe that inclusion of all members in the election of management in effect reconciles "ethics and efficiency, freedom and order, liberty and rationality".&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 193"/&gt; Liberal corporatism began to gain disciples in the United States during the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 35"/&gt;

Liberal corporatism was an influential component of the [[progressivism in the United States]] that has been referred to as "interest group liberalism".&lt;ref name="Wiarda, Howard J. 1996. Pp. 134"&gt;Wiarda, Howard J., pp. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, economic corporatism involving capital-labour cooperation was influential in the [[New Deal]] economic program of the United States in the 1930s as well as in [[Keynesianism]] and even [[Fordism]].&lt;ref name="J. Barry Jones 2001. Pp. 243"/&gt;

====Fascist corporatism====
{{Fascism sidebar}}
{{see also|Preussentum und Sozialismus}}
Fascism's theory of economic corporatism involved management of sectors of the economy by government or privately-controlled organizations (corporations).{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Each trade union or employer corporation would theoretically represent its professional concerns, especially by negotiation of labour contracts and the like. It was theorized that this method could result in [[Class collaboration|harmony amongst social classes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Mazower]], ''Dark Continent: Europe's 20th Century'' p. 29 {{ISBN|0-679-43809-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, authors have noted that historically ''de facto'' economic corporatism was also used to reduce opposition and reward political loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;"Fascism." Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010. Web. 15 April 2010 [http://search.eb.com/eb/article-219369].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy from 1922 until 1943, corporatism became influential amongst Italian nationalists led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. The [[Charter of Carnaro]] gained much popularity as the prototype of a "corporative state", having displayed much within its tenets as a [[Gremialismo|guild system]] combining the concepts of autonomy and authority in a special synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parlato|first=Giuseppe|title=La sinistra fascista|publisher=Il Mulino|year=2000|location=Bologna|pages=88|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfredo Rocco]] spoke of a corporative state and declared corporatist ideology in detail. Rocco would later become a member of the Italian fascist regime.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Stanley G. 1996. ''A History of Fascism, 1914–1945''. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9wHNrF7nFecC] Routledge. Pp. 64 [https://books.google.com/books?id=9wHNrF7nFecC&amp;q=Alfredo+Rocco#search] {{ISBN|1-85728-595-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italian Fascism]] involved a corporatist political system in which the economy was [[Tripartism|collectively managed]] by employers, workers and state officials by formal mechanisms at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;''The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right'' (2002) by Peter Jonathan Davies and Derek Lynch, Routledge (UK), {{ISBN|0-415-21494-7}} p.143.&lt;/ref&gt; It supporters claimed that corporatism could better recognize or "incorporate" every divergent interest into the state organically, unlike majority-rules democracy which they said could marginalize specific interests. This total consideration was the inspiration for their use of the term "[[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]]", described without coercion (which is connotated in the modern meaning) in the 1932 ''[[Doctrine of Fascism]]'' as thus: {{quote|When brought within the orbit of the State, Fascism recognizes the real needs which gave rise to socialism and trade unionism, giving them due weight in the guild or corporative system in which divergent interests are coordinated and harmonized in the unity of the State.&lt;ref name=doctrine&gt;[http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Germany/mussolini.htm Mussolini{{spaced ndash}}The Doctrine of Fascism]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|[The state] is not simply a mechanism which limits the sphere of the supposed liberties of the individual... Neither has the Fascist conception of authority anything in common with that of a police ridden State... Far from crushing the individual, the Fascist State multiplies his energies, just as in a regiment a soldier is not diminished but multiplied by the number of his fellow soldiers.&lt;ref name=doctrine /&gt;}}

A popular slogan of the Italian Fascists under Mussolini was "Tutto nello Stato, niente al di fuori dello Stato, nulla contro lo Stato" ("everything for the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state").

This prospect of Italian fascist corporatism claimed to be the direct heir of [[Georges Sorel]]'s [[Sorelianism|revolutionary syndicalism]]&lt;!-- The form? --&gt;, such that each interest was to form as its own entity with separate organizing parameters according to their own standards, but only within the corporative model of Italian fascism each was supposed to be incorporated through the auspices and organizing ability of a statist construct. This was by their reasoning the only possible way to achieve such a function, i.e. when resolved in the capability of an indissoluble state. Much of the corporatist influence upon Italian Fascism was partly due to the Fascists' attempts to gain endorsement by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] that itself sponsored corporatism.&lt;ref name="Morgan, Philip 2003. P. 170"&gt;Morgan, Philip. ''Fascism in Europe, 1919–1945''. Routledge, 2003. P. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, fascism's corporatism was a top-down model of state control over the economy while the Roman Catholic Church's corporatism favoured a bottom-up corporatism, whereby groups such as families and professional groups would voluntarily work together.&lt;ref name="Morgan, Philip 2003. P. 170" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul H. ''Authoritarian regimes in Latin America: dictators, despots, and tyrants''. Lanham, Maryland, USA: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc, 2006. Pp. 131. "Fascism differed from Catholic corporatism by assigning the state the role of final arbiter, in the event that employer and labor syndicates failed to agree."&lt;/ref&gt; The fascist state corporatism (of Roman Catholic Italy) influenced the governments and economies of a not only other Roman Catholic-majority countries, such as the governments of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] in [[Austria]] and [[António de Oliveira Salazar]] in [[Portugal]], but also [[Konstantin Päts]] and [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] in non-Catholic [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]. Fascists in non-Catholic countries also supported Italian Fascist corporatism, including [[Oswald Mosley]] of the [[British Union of Fascists]], who commended corporatism and said that "it means a nation organized as the human body, with each organ performing its individual function but working in harmony with the whole".&lt;ref name="Robert Eccleshall 1994. P. 208"&gt;Robert Eccleshall, Vincent Geoghegan, Richard Jay, Michael Kenny, Iain Mackenzie, Rick Wilford. ''Political Ideologies: An Introduction''. 2nd ed. Routledge, 1994. P. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Mosley also considered corporatism as an attack on ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economics and "international finance".&lt;ref name="Robert Eccleshall 1994. P. 208" /&gt;

The corporatist state Salazar [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|established in Portugal]] was not associated with Mussolini—quite the opposite as he banished the fascist party in Portugal and distanced himself from all of Europe's fascist regimes. Portugal during Salazar's reign was considered Catholic corporatism. Portugal remained neutral throughout World War II. Salazar also had a strong dislike of Marxism and liberalism.

In 1933, Salazar stated: "Our Dictatorship clearly resembles a fascist dictatorship in the reinforcement of authority, in the war declared against certain principles of democracy, in its accentuated nationalist character, in its preoccupation of social order. However, it differs from it in its process of renovation. The fascist dictatorship tends towards a pagan [[Caesarism]], towards a state that knows no limits of a legal or moral order, which marches towards its goal without meeting complications or obstacles. The Portuguese New State, on the contrary, cannot avoid, not think of avoiding, certain limits of a moral order which it may consider indispensable to maintain in its favour of its reforming action".&lt;ref&gt;''Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review'' Vol. 92, No. 368, Winter, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neo-corporatism====
During the post-[[World War II]] reconstruction period in Europe, corporatism was favoured by [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] (often under the influence of [[Catholic social teaching]]), [[National conservatism|national conservatives]] and [[Social democracy|social democrats]] in opposition to liberal capitalism. This type of corporatism became unfashionable but revived again in the 1960s and 1970s as "neo-corporatism" in response to the new economic threat of [[stagflation|recession-inflation]].

Neo-corporatism favoured economic [[tripartism]] which involved strong labour unions, employers' unions and governments that cooperated as "[[social partners]]" to negotiate and manage a national economy.&lt;ref name="J. Barry Jones 2001. Pp. 243" /&gt; [[Social corporatism|Social corporatist]] systems instituted in Europe after World War II include the [[Ordoliberalism|ordoliberal]] system of the [[social market economy]] in Germany, the [[Social Partnership|social partnership]] in Ireland, the [[polder model]] in the Netherlands (although arguably the polder model already was present at the end of World War I, it was not until after World War II that a social service system gained foothold there), the concertation system in Italy, the [[Rhine capitalism|Rhine model]] in Switzerland and the Benelux countries and the [[Nordic model]] in Scandinavia.

Attempts in the United States to create neo-corporatist capital-labor arrangements were unsuccessfully advocated by [[Gary Hart]] and [[Michael Dukakis]] in the 1980s. As Secretary of Labor during the Clinton administration, [[Robert Reich]] promoted neo-corporatist reforms.&lt;ref name="Waring, Stephen P. 1994. Pp. 194"&gt;Waring, Stephen P. ''Taylorism Transformed: Scientific Management Theory Since 1945''. University of North Carolina Press, 1994. Pp. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chinese corporatism====
Chinese corporatism, as described by [[Jonathan Unger]] and Anita Chan in their essay ''China, Corporatism, and the East Asian Model'', is the following:&lt;ref&gt;[http://ips.cap.anu.edu.au/psc/ccc/publications/papers/JUAC_China_Corporatism.pdf "China，Corporatism，and the East Asian Model"]. By Jonathan Unger and Anita Chan, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;[A]t the national level the state recognizes one and only one organization (say, a national labour union, a business association, a farmers' association) as the sole representative of the sectoral interests of the individuals, enterprises or institutions that comprise that organization's assigned constituency. The state determines which organizations will be recognized as legitimate and forms an unequal partnership of sorts with such organizations. The associations sometimes even get channelled into the policy-making processes and often help implement state policy on the government's behalf.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By establishing itself as the arbiter of legitimacy and assigning responsibility for a particular [[constituency]] with one sole organization, the state limits the number of players with which it must negotiate its policies and co-opts their leadership into policing their own members. This arrangement is not limited to economic organizations such as business groups and social organizations.

The use of corporatism as a framework to understand the central state's behaviour in China has been criticized by authors such as Bruce Gilley and William Hurst.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Gilley (2011) "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10670564.2011.565181#.UhTA27FzZrQ Paradigms of Chinese Politics: Kicking Society Back Out]", ''Journal of Contemporary China'' 20(70).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Hurst (2007) "The City as the Focus: The Analysis of Contemporary Chinese Urban Politics’, ''China Information'' 20(30).&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars such as Jennifer Hsu and Reza Hasmath have argued the framework is still useful for analyzing China's local state behaviour and its engagement with social actors.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Hsu and Reza Hasmath (2014) “[http://ssrn.com/abstract=2211248 The Local Corporatist State and NGO Relations in China]”, ''Journal of Contemporary China'' 23(87).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Hsu and Reza Hasmath (2013) ''The [http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415640725/ Chinese Corporatist State: Adaptation, Survival and Resistance]''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reza Hasmath and Jennifer Hsu (2009) ''[http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/china-in-an-era-of-transition-reza-hasmath/?K=9780230613508 China in an Era of Transition: Understanding Contemporary State and Society Actors]''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Studying how the government engages with NGOs in particular has been a key part of the analysis of how local authorities in China have adapted and employed corporatist measures. Hsu and Hasmath argue that corporatist measures "continue to be employed by local authorities as an effective means of ensuring the potency and relevance of the local state in a rapidly changing sector," while the state itself continues to retreat from the provision of welfare and social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer YJ|last2=Hasmath|first2=Reza|date=2014|title=The Local Corporatist State and NGO Relations in China|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/15/|journal=Journal of Contemporary China|language=en|volume=23|issue=87|pages=516-517|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local governments have adapted corporatist measures by "utilizing subtle or tacit forms of approval" to influence NGOs' operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer YJ|last2=Hasmath|first2=Reza|date=2014|title=The Local Corporatist State and NGO Relations in China|url=https://works.bepress.com/rhasmath/15/|journal=Journal of Contemporary China|language=en|volume=23|issue=87|pages=517|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Russian corporatism====
On October 9, 2007, an article signed by [[Viktor Cherkesov]], head of the Russian Drug Enforcement Administration, was published in ''[[Kommersant]]'', where he used the term "corporativist state" in a positive way to describe the evolution of Russia. He claimed that the administration officials detained on criminal charges earlier that month are the exception rather than the rule and that the only development scenario for Russia that is both realistic enough and relatively favorable is to continue evolution into a corporativist state ruled by security service officials.&lt;ref&gt;Cherkesov, Viktor. [http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=812840 Нельзя допустить, чтобы воины превратились в торговцев]. ''[[Kommersant]]'' #184 (3760), October 9, 2007. [http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/10/viktor_cherkesov_on_the_spy_wa.htm English translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025092259/http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/10/viktor_cherkesov_on_the_spy_wa.htm |date=2007-10-25 }} and [http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/10/grigory_pasko_a_cry_from_a_jar.htm Comments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017134834/http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/10/grigory_pasko_a_cry_from_a_jar.htm |date=2007-10-17 }} by [[Grigory Pasko]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, [[Andrei Illarionov]], former economic adviser to [[Vladimir Putin]], claimed that Russia had become a corporativist state: &lt;blockquote&gt;The process of this state evolving into a new corporativist [''sic''] model reached its completion in 2005. [...] The strengthening of the corporativist state model and setting up favorable conditions for quasi-state monopolies by the state itself hurt the economy. ... Cabinet members or key Presidential Staff executives chairing corporation boards or serving on those boards are the order of the day in Russia. In what Western country—except in the corporativist state that lasted for 20 years in Italy—is such a phenomenon possible? Which, actually, proves that the term 'corporativist' properly applies to Russia today.&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1145192,00.html "Q&amp;A: Putin's Critical Adviser"]. By Yuri Zarakhovich. December 31, 2005. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to some researchers, all [[political power]]s and most important economic [[asset]]s in the country are controlled by former [[state security]] officials ("[[silovik]]s").&lt;ref name="Takeover"/&gt; The takeover of Russian state and economic assets has been allegedly accomplished by a clique of [[Political groups during Vladimir Putin's presidency|Putin's close associates and friends]]&lt;ref name="Glinski"&gt;[http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/pm_0147.pdf The Essence of Putinism: The Strengthening of the Privatized State] by Dmitri Glinski Vassiliev, [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], November 2000&lt;/ref&gt; who gradually became a leading group of [[Russian oligarch]]s and who "seized control over the financial, media and administrative resources of the Russian state"&lt;ref&gt;[http://eng.globalaffairs.ru/numbers/7/521.html What is ‘Putinism’?], by Andranik Migranyan, ''Russia in Global affairs'', 13 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vladimir Putin legislation and program|restricted democratic freedoms]] and [[Human rights in Russia|human rights]]&lt;ref name="Takeover"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08850600500483699 The Chekist Takeover of the Russian State], Anderson, Julie (2006), International Journal of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence, 19:2, 237 - 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Illarionov described the present situation in Russia as a new socio-political order, "distinct from any seen in our country before". In this model, members of the Corporation of Intelligence Service Collaborators (KSSS) took over the entire body of state power, follow an [[omerta]]-like behavior code and "are given instruments conferring power over others – membership "perks", such as the right to carry and use weapons". According to Illarionov, the "Corporation has seized key government agencies – the Tax Service, [[Ministry of Defence (Russia)|Ministry of Defense]], [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], [[Duma|Parliament]], and the [[Media freedom in Russia|government-controlled mass media]] – which are now used to advance the interests of KSSS members. Through these agencies, every significant resource of the country – security/intelligence, political, economic, informational and financial – is being monopolized in the hands of Corporation members".&lt;ref name="Illarionov"&gt;[http://ej.ru/comments/entry/6735/ Andrei Illarionov: Approaching Zimbabwe (Russian)] [http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/04/andrei_illarionov_approaching.htm Partial English translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705011725/http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2007/04/andrei_illarionov_approaching.htm |date=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyst [[Andrei Piontkovsky]] also considers the present situation as "the highest and culminating stage of bandit capitalism in Russia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/4094.html#1 Putinism: highest stage of robber capitalism], by [[Andrei Piontkovsky]], The Russia Journal, February 7–13, 2000. The title is an allusion to work ''"[[Imperialism]] as the last and culminating stage of capitalism"'' by [[Vladimir Lenin]]&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that "Russia is not corrupt. [[Political corruption|Corruption]] is what happens in all countries when businessmen offer officials large bribes for favors. Today’s Russia is unique. The businessmen, the politicians, and the bureaucrats are the same people".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=publication_details&amp;id=4852 Review of Andrei's Pionkovsky's ''Another Look Into Putin's Soul'' by the Honorable Rodric Braithwaite], [[Hoover Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1303">The '''delegate model of representation''' is a model of a [[representative democracy]]. In this model, [[Electoral district|constituents]] elect their representatives as [[delegates]] for their [[constituency]]. These delegates act only as a mouthpiece for the wishes of their constituency/ state, and have no [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomy]] from the constituency only the autonomy to vote for the actual representatives of the state. This model does not provide representatives the luxury of acting in their own conscience. Essentially, the representative acts as the voice of those who are (literally) not present.

This model was contested by [[Edmund Burke]] (1729-1797), an Irish philosopher, who also created the [[trustee model of representation]].

{{Democracy}}
{{Forms of government}}

'''Demoicracy''' (also demoi-cracy) is a polity of multiple distinct people (''demoi''), polity of polities. The term is derived from ''demoi'' (δῆμοι in original [[Ancient Greek]], plural form of δῆμος or ''demos''), meaning "peoples" and ''kratos'' (κράτος) meaning "power" (to govern oneself). It is apparently meant to become an alternative to [[democracy]], understood as power of a single ''demos''. The term is used mainly to describe the genus of the [[European Union]] ([[European Union|EU]]) but is also gaining currency in more general theories of democracy above state level.

==History==
Philippe van Parijs used the term "demoi-cracy" negatively in 1998&lt;ref&gt;Philippe van Parijs 'Should the European union become more democratic?' in Follesdal, Andreas &amp; Koslowski, Peter ''Democracy and the European Union'', 1998&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to the existing state of affair in Europe and in contrast to "European demos-cracy". This is not the meaning of the term in mainstream scholarship today. Instead, the term refers to [[Kalypso Nicolaïdis]] original statement in 2003 that the EU ought to be understood as a demoicracy in the making,  a third way against two alternatives which both equate the possibility of democracy with the existence of a single demos, either national demos (the EU as association of democratic states) or supranational (the EU as a federal state). In contrast, the EU is not and should not be conceived of as any form of state (federal or any other) and does not depend on the existence of a single European demos to be demoicratic.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaïdis, Kalypso 'Our European Demoï-cracy: Is this Constitution a Third Way for Europe?' in Nicolaidis, Kalypso &amp; Weatherill, Stephen ''Whose Europe? National Models and the Constitution of the European Union'', European Studies at Oxford Series, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaidis, Kalypso 'We the Peoples of Europe' in Foreign Affairs, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the concept has both descriptive and normative aspects. It tries to square the circle between the common criticism that the EU is undemocratic (the ''[[democratic deficit]]'' thesis) and the claim that there is no European demos (the ''no demos thesis''), purporting that a demos is not a ''sine qua non'' for democracy and multiple separate demoi can effectively control the government and in that sense exercise [[popular sovereignty]]. Later, Nicolaidis refined her definition of demoicracy as "a Union of peoples who govern together but not as one" [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcms.12006/full  &lt;ref&gt;Nicolaidis, Kalypso 'European Demoicracy and Its Crisis,' Journal of Common Market Studies March Volume 51 No 2: 351–369, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;]

==Philosophy==
Nicolaïdis’s originally advanced the concept as an alternative to the calls of the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]]&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Habermas 'Why Europe Needs Constitution?' in 11 ''New Left Review'' (2001). See also Jurgen Habermas &amp; Jacques Derrida 'February 15, or What Binds Europeans Together' in 10 ''Constellations'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  and by the former German foreign minister [[Joschka Fischer]]&lt;ref&gt;Joschka Fischer 'From Confederacy to Federation: Thoughts on the Finality of European Integration', Speech at the Humboldt University in Berlin, 12 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  that a common European [[Cultural identity|identity]] must and should be ‘forged’. Instead, she argued in favour of a [[community]] which recognises its irreducible internal [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] and is based on [[mutual recognition]] of differences rather than shared values as Habermas would have it.  While both sides of the debate premise their argument on some arguable empirical claims (distinct ‘European’ values or celebration of tolerance respectively), neither of these is necessary for the normative plausibility of demoicracy as a theoretical concept. Currently many other commentators maintain that the concept is uniquely adequate for the age of interdependence of states and globalization of governance which should supersede the 'nation-centred' vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Werner Muller 'The Promise of Demoi-cracy: Diversity and Domination in the European Public Order' in Neyer, Jurgen &amp; Wiener, Antije ''The Political Theory of the European Union''(2010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps that is why the term was latter embraced by some of the major proponents of deliberative democracy like [[James Bohman]]&lt;ref&gt;James Bohman 'From Demos to Demoi: Democracy across Borders' in 18 Ratio Juris (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Samantha Besson]]&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Besson 'Deliberative Demoi-cracy in the EU: Towards the Deteritorialisation of Democracy' in Samantha Besson &amp; Jose Luis Marti, ''Deliberative democracy and its discontents'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  (even if not by Habermas himself). With the work of the latter authors the concept gained currency beyond the EU-scholarship and especially among the [[cosmopolitan republicanists]] as the most promising way for realisation of [[transnational democracy]]. Bohman in particular sees demoicracy as an emancipation project. It is meant to avoid domination which can occur across borders (citizens of one state may suffer from decisions of citizens of another which are taken arbitrarily). As domination can occur also internally all oppressed groups may qualify as demoi deserving a voice in governance. Thus, Besson suggests a dynamic concept of ''demoi'', which comprises all those affected by any particular decision (and thus subject to arbitrary domination by the group of the decision-makers).

==European Union==
With regard to the EU the concept has been criticized because it does not provide an answer to the 'no demos thesis' but merely disguises the problem of democratic deficit and forgoes the capacity of peoples to collectively control their fate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Mair]], ‘Ruling the Void? The Hollowing of Western Democracy’ in New Left Review (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet the concept is certainly more than a euphemism or exercise in scholastic creativity&amp;nbsp;– if the EU is qualitatively different from the nation state (and from the federation) it needs to be analysed in different terms as well. As almost all politicians and academics claim the EU is not and should not become a superstate, it would be grossly misleading to evaluate it in terms of a state. Indeed, it makes little sense to claim that the Union is not a state and in the same time to criticise it for not being a democratic one. On the other hand, if it is recognised that the Union, as a polity of its own kind is to be analysed in idiosyncratic terms, we face a problem of circularity&amp;nbsp;– we face an entity which claims to be a standard to itself.
Recognising that, Francis Cheneval and Frank Schimmelfenning propose to extend the moral constructivism of John Rawls to transnational cases: 'the inter-subjective beliefs about the moral purpose of the liberal democratic state do not only imply the normative expectation of rule of law and procedural justice for the fundamental institutions of international society. They also imply normative expectations of democratic government in a society of liberal  democratic states. The inter-subjective beliefs about the moral purpose of the liberal democratic state will eventually filter through into the relational structure of liberal democratic states.'&lt;ref name="euce"&gt;Francis Cheneval &amp; Frank Schimmelfenning 'The Case for Demoicracy in the EU' (2011) available at http://euce.org/eusa/2011/papers/8h_cheneval.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus they set out to derive abstract moral principles for a demoicracy and use them to judge the EU subsequently. Their principles apply to transnational as well as to national level, and they find that the EU is approaching these principle while 'major demoi-cratic deficits remain at the national level.'&lt;ref name="euce" /&gt;  In spite of this optimistic result, there is at least one deficiency of the EU from demoicratic perspective and it is that the governance discourse is almost exclusively elitist. This is especially problematic as demoicracy is calling for even more involvement of citizens on issues of governance.

==Development==
Most demoicracy scholarship is abstract, and very little has been done to flesh out what an actual demoicracy should look like. Yet there are few practical claims that seem shared by all of the commentators. The first is the reliance on networks as agents of democracy beyond the nation-state where discourses are not mediated by states or nationality. The second is the active participation of citizens in these networks so that they are involved in the decision-making, deliberations and contestation at every level. All demoicrats would emphasise the importance of horizontal relationships between citizens, organisations and institutions from the different ''demoi'' on issues of their collective governance or on the governance of other states. Rights and legitimate interests of citizens are not limited to their own demos/polity but are extended across the borders to what is usually considered internal affairs of the other polities and people. This horizontal relationship is what distinguishes a demoicracy from a federation where the internal affairs of a federal unit are insulated from external contestation at least horizontally.

Beyond these general principles however, few details of an actual demoicracy are spelled out. To remedy this, Cheneval and Schimmelfenning with a team of researchers at ETH Zurich have embarked on a project intended 'to map and explain the development of demoicratic institutions.'&lt;ref name="ETH"&gt;The project 'Designing "Demoi-cracy" in the European Union' of the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology) Zurich. More information is available at http://www.eup.ethz.ch/research/demoicracy/&lt;/ref&gt; A precious few examples of genuine demoicratic institutions have been identified by other researchers. Bohman celebrates the system of policy coordination through committees and agencies in the EU as a demoicratic mechanism.&lt;ref name="ETH" /&gt; This is noteworthy, as from the traditional, that is ''demo''-cratic, perspective the influence of numerous EU committees and working parties is quite questionable. In the same vein, Michael Buess reconsiders the interaction between the EU agencies and their national counterparts from demoicratic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Buess 'European Union Agencies' Relationships with their National Counterparts' presentation at European Union Studies Association Conference Boston, March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example of demoicratically interlinked institutions is the so-called ‘yellow card’ or [[Early Warning Mechanism]] introduced by the [[Lisbon Treaty]]. According to Vesco Paskalev this is an attempt to provide an institutionalized network which enables many ''demoi'' to deliberate together on substantive EU legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Vesco Paskalev 'Lisbon Treaty and the Possibility of a European Network Demoi-Cracy' (2009), European University Institute Working paper available at http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/13005/LAW_2009_20.pdf?sequence=1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fasces.svg|thumb|upright=0.4|A ''fasces'' image, with the axe in the middle of the bundle of rods]]
'''Fasces''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|ˈ|f|æ|s|iː|z}}, {{IPA-la|ˈfa.skeːs|lang}}; a ''[[plurale tantum]]'', from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:en:fascis#Latin|fascis]]'', meaning "bundle";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webster.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=fasces Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]: fasces&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-it|fascio littorio}}) is a bound bundle of wooden rods, sometimes including an axe with its blade emerging. The fasces had its origin in the [[Etruscan civilization]] and was passed on to [[ancient Rome]], where it symbolized a [[magistrate]]'s [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[jurisdiction]]. The axe originally associated with the symbol, the [[Labrys]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|xld-Grek|λάβρυς}}, ''{{lang|xld-Latn|lábrys}}'') the double-[[Axe#Parts of the axe|bitted]] [[axe]], originally from [[Crete]], is one of the oldest symbols of Greek civilization. To the Romans, it was known as a ''bipennis''.&lt;ref&gt;the term for a single-bladed axe being ''hēmipelekys'' "half-pelekys", e.g. [[Iliad|Il]]. 23.883.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly, the symbol was associated with [[female deities]], from prehistoric through historic times.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The image has survived in the modern world as a representation of magisterial or collective power, law and governance. The fasces frequently occurs as a [[Charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]]: it is present on the reverse of the U.S. [[Mercury dime]] coin and behind the podium in the [[United States House of Representatives]]; and it was the origin of the name of the [[National Fascist Party]] in Italy (from which the term ''[[fascism]]'' is derived).

During the first half of the 20th century both the fasces and the [[swastika]] (each symbol having its own unique ancient religious and mythological associations) became heavily identified with the [[authoritarian]]/[[Fascism|fascist]] political movements of [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]].  During this period the swastika became deeply stigmatized, but the fasces did not undergo a similar process.

The fact that the fasces remained in use in many societies after [[World War II]] may have been due to the fact that prior to Mussolini the fasces had already been adopted and incorporated within the governmental iconography of many governments outside Italy. As such, its use persists as an accepted form of governmental and other iconography in various contexts. (The [[swastika]] remains in common usage in parts of Asia for religious purposes which are also unrelated to early 20th century European fascism.)

The fasces is sometimes confused with the related term ''[[fess]]'', which in [[French heraldry]] is called a ''fasce''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Origin and symbolism==
[[File:Fasces in the Sheldonian Theatre.jpg|thumb|Ornamentation consisting of fasces held in the mouth of a lion inside the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] at Oxford University]]
A few artifacts found showing a thin bundle of rods surrounding a two-headed axe point to a possible Etruscan origin for fasces, but little is known about the Etruscans themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, S. (2000). Etruscan civilization: A cultural history. Los Angeles: J. Paul Getty Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; Fasces symbolism might be derived via the Etruscans from the eastern Mediterranean, with the [[labrys]], the [[Anatolia]]n, and [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] double-headed axe, later incorporated into the [[praetor]]ial fasces. There is little archaeological evidence for precise claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/fasces/fasces.html|accessdate=2011-04-13|title=Fasces|date=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Roman Republic]], the fasces had developed into a thicker bundle of [[Betula pubescens|birch]] rods, sometimes surrounding a single-headed axe and tied together with a red leather ribbon into a cylinder. On certain special occasions, the fasces might be decorated with a [[laurel wreath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/fa-fn/fasces/fasces.html|accessdate=2011-04-13|title=Fasces|date=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism of the fasces could suggest strength through unity (see [[Unity makes strength]]); a single rod is easily broken, while the bundle is very difficult to break. This symbolism occurs in [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's fable]] "[[The Old Man and his Sons]]". A similar story is told about the [[Bulgar]] (pre-Bulgarian, proto-Bulgarian) Khan [[Kubrat]], giving rise to the Bulgarian national motto "Union gives strength" (Съединението прави силата). However, bundled birch twigs could also symbolise [[corporal punishment]] (see [[birching]]).

==Republican Rome==
The ''fasces lictoriae'' ("bundles of the lictors") [[symbol]]ised power and authority (''[[imperium]]'') in ancient [[Rome]], beginning with the early [[Roman Kingdom]] and continuing through the republican and [[Roman Empire|imperial]] periods. By republican times, use of the fasces was surrounded with tradition and protocol. A corps of ''apparitores'' (subordinate officials) called [[lictors]] each carried fasces before a [[Roman magistrate|magistrate]], in a number corresponding to his rank. Lictors preceded [[Roman consul|consul]]s (and [[proconsul]]s), [[praetor]]s (and [[propraetor]]s), [[Roman dictator|dictator]]s, curule [[aedile]]s, [[quaestor]]s, and the [[Flamen Dialis]] during [[Roman triumph]]s (public celebrations held in Rome after a military conquest).

According to Livy, it is likely that the lictors were an Etruscan tradition, adopted by Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:8&lt;/ref&gt; The highest magistrate, the ''[[Roman dictator|dictator]]'', was entitled to twenty-four lictors and fasces, the consul to twelve, the proconsul eleven, the praetor six (two within the ''[[pomerium]]''), the propraetor five, and the curule aediles two.

Another part of the symbolism developed in Republican Rome was the inclusion of just a single-headed axe in the fasces, with the blade projecting from the bundle. The axe indicated that the magistrate's judicial powers (''[[imperium]]'') included capital punishment. Fasces carried within the ''[[Pomerium]]''—the boundary of the sacred inner city of Rome—had their axe blades removed; within the city, the power of life and death rested with the people through their assemblies. During times of emergency, however, the Roman Republic might choose a dictator to lead for a limited time period, who was the only magistrate to be granted capital punishment authority within the Pomerium. Lictors attending the dictator kept the axes in their fasces even inside the Pomerium—a sign that the dictator had the ultimate power in his own hands. There were exceptions to this rule: in 48 BC, guards holding bladed fasces guided [[Publius Servilius Vatia Isauricus (consul 48 BCE)|Vatia Isauricus]] to the tribunal of [[Marcus Caelius Rufus|Marcus Caelius]], and Vatia Isauricus used one to destroy Caelius's magisterial chair (''[[Curule Chair|sella curulis]]'').{{Clear}}

An occasional variation on the fasces was the addition of a [[laurel wreath]], symbolizing victory. This occurred during the celebration of a ''[[Roman triumph|Triumph]]'' - essentially a victory parade through Rome by a returning victorious general. Previously, all Republican Roman commanding generals had held high office with imperium, and so, already were entitled to the lictors and fasces.

==Usage==
The modern Italian word ''[[fascio]]'', used in the twentieth century to designate peasant cooperatives and industrial workers' unions, is related to ''fasces''.

Numerous governments and other authorities have used the image of the ''fasces'' as a [[symbol]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] since the end of the [[Roman Empire]]. It also has been used to hearken back to the Roman republic, particularly by those who see themselves as modern-day successors to the old republic or its ideals.

[[Coat of arms of Ecuador|The Ecuadorian coat of arms]] incorporated the fasces in 1830, although it had already been in use in the coat of arm of [[Gran Colombia]] since 1821.

[[Italian Fascism]], which derives its name from the ''fasces'', arguably used this symbolism the most in the twentieth century. The [[British Union of Fascists]] also used it in the 1930s. The ''fasces'', as a widespread and long-established symbol in the West, however, has avoided the [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with much of [[fascist symbolism]], and many authorities continue to display them, including the federal government of the United States.

===France===
A review of the images included in ''Les Grands Palais de France ''Fontainebleau'' ''&lt;ref&gt;''Les Grands Palais de France '''Fontainebleau''', I re Série, Styles Louis XV, Louis XVI, Empire, Labrairie Centrale D'Art Et D'Architecture, Ancienne Maison Morel, Ch. Eggimann, Succ, 106, Boulevard Saint Germain, Paris, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Les Grands Palais de France : Fontainebleau '', II me Série, Les Appartments D'Anne D'Autriche, De François I er, Et D'Elenonre La Chapelle, Labrairie Centrale D'Art Et D'Architecture, Ancienne Maison Morel, Ch. Eggimann, Succ, 106, Boulevard Saint Germain, Paris, 1912&lt;/ref&gt; reveals that French architects used the Roman fasces (''faisceaux romains'') as a decorative device as early as the reign of [[Louis XIII]] (1610–1643) and continued to employ it through the periods of [[Napoleon I]]'s Empire (1804–1815).

The fasces typically appeared in a context reminiscent of the [[Roman Republic]] and of the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[French Revolution]] used many references to the ancient [[Roman Republic]] in its imagery. During the [[French First Republic|First Republic]], topped by the [[Phrygian cap]], the fasces is a tribute to the Roman Republic and means that power belongs to the people. It also symbolizes the "unity and indivisibility of the Republic",&lt;ref name="elysee1"&gt;[http://www.elysee.fr/president/la-presidence/les-symboles-de-la-republique-francaise/le-faisceau-de-licteur/le-faisceau-de-licteur.5979.html Site of the French Presidency] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104072203/http://www.elysee.fr/president/la-presidence/les-symboles-de-la-republique-francaise/le-faisceau-de-licteur/le-faisceau-de-licteur.5979.html |date=November 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as stated in the [[French Constitution]]. [[French Revolution of 1848|In 1848]] and [[Government of National Defense|after 1870]], it appears on the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] of the French Republic, held by the goddess, [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]]. There is the fasces in the [[National Emblem of France|arms of the French Republic]] with the "RF" for ''République française'' (see image below), surrounded by leaves of [[olive tree]] (as a symbol of [[peace]]) and [[oak]] (as a symbol of [[justice]]). While it is used widely by French officials, this symbol never was officially adopted by the government.&lt;ref name="elysee1"/&gt;

The fasces appears on the helmet and the buckle insignia of the French Army's [[Autonomous Corps of Military Justice]], as well as on that service's distinct cap badges for the prosecuting and defending lawyers in a court-martial.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===United States===
[[File:National Guard Bureau (insignia).svg|thumb|[[National Guard Bureau]] insignia]]
Since the original founding of the United States in the 18th century, several offices and institutions in the United States have heavily incorporated representations of the ''fasces'' into much of their iconography.

==== Federal fasces iconography ====
* The reverse of the [[Mercury Dime]], the design used until the adoption of the current FDR dime in 1945, features a fasces.
* In the [[Oval Office]], above the door leading to the exterior walkway, and above the corresponding door on the opposite wall, which leads to the president's private office; note: the fasces depicted have no axes, possibly because in the [[Roman Republic]], the blade was always removed from the bundle whenever the ''fasces'' were carried inside the city, in order to symbolize the rights of citizens against arbitrary state power (see above)
* Two fasces appear on either side of the [[flag of the United States]] behind the podium in the [[United States House of Representatives]], and were added to the chamber's decor during the remodeling project of 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.house.gov/Exhibitions-and-Publications/Capitol/1951-Present/ US House of Representatives: Chamber, 1951–Present] history.house.gov website.  Downloaded Aug. 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Mace of the United States House of Representatives]] resembles fasces and consists of thirteen ebony rods bound together in the same fashion as the fasces, topped by a silver eagle on a globe 
* The official [[seal of the United States Senate]] has as one component a pair of crossed fasces
* Fasces ring the base of the [[Statue of Freedom]] atop the [[United States Capitol]] building 
* A frieze on the facade of the [[United States Supreme Court building]] depicts the figure of a Roman [[centurion]] holding a fasces, to represent "order"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c01_e.html The Supreme Court Historical Society&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051128162002/http://www.supremecourthistory.org/04_library/subs_volumes/04_c01_e.html |date=November 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] uses the fasces on the seal of the [[National Guard Bureau]], and it appears in the insignia of Regular Army officers assigned to National Guard liaison and in the insignia and unit symbols of National Guard units themselves; for instance, the regimental crest of the [[71st Infantry Regiment (New York)]] of the New York National Guard consisted of a gold fasces set on a blue background 
* At the [[Lincoln Memorial]], Lincoln's seat of state bears the fasces—without axes—on the fronts of its arms; fasces also appear on the pylons flanking the main staircase leading into the memorial 
* The official [[seal (device)|seal]] of the [[United States Tax Court]] bears the fasces at its center 
* Four fasces flank the two bronze plaques on either side of the bust of Lincoln memorializing his [[Gettysburg Address]] at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania 
* The seal of the United States Courts Administrative Office includes a fasces behind crossed quill and scroll
* In the Washington Monument, there is a statue of George Washington leaning on a fasces 
* A fasces is a common element in U.S. Army Military Police heraldry, most visibly on the shoulder sleeve insignia of the [[18th Military Police Brigade]] and the [[42nd Military Police Brigade]]
* A fasces also appears [[shoulder sleeve insignia]] of the [[United States Army Reserve Legal Command|U.S. Army Reserve Legal Command]]
* Seated beside George Washington, a figure holds a fasces as part of ''[[The Apotheosis of Washington]]'', a fresco mural suspended above the rotunda of the [[United States Capitol Building]].

==== State, local and other fasces iconography ====
* The main entrance hallways in the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] have lamps that are decorated with stone fasces motifs; in the woodwork before the podium of the speaker of the assembly, several double-bladed fasces are carved, but in the woodwork before the podium of the senate president are several single-bladed fasces 
* The grand seal of [[Harvard University]] inside Memorial Church is flanked by two inward-pointing fasces; the seal is located directly below the 112&amp;nbsp;m (368&amp;nbsp;ft) steeple and the [[Great Seal of the United States]] inside the Memorial Room; the walls of the room list the names of Harvard students, faculty, and alumni who gave their lives in service of the [[United States]] during [[World War I]] along with an empty tomb depicting [[Alma Mater]] holding a slain Harvard student

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33355">In a notable study of power conducted by [[social psychologist]]s [[John R. P. French]] and [[Bertram Raven]] in 1959, [[Power (social and political)|power]] is divided into five separate and distinct forms.  In 1965 Raven revised this model to include a sixth form by separating the informational power base as distinct from the expert power base.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2010, 2006). Group Dynamics. Belmont: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relating to [[social communication]] studies, ''power'' in [[social influence]] settings has introduced a large realm of research pertaining to [[persuasion]] tactics and leadership practices. Through social communication studies, it has been theorized that leadership and power are closely linked. It has been further presumed that different forms of power affect one's leadership and success. This idea is used often in [[organizational communication]] and throughout the workforce.  In a notable study of power conducted by social psychologists John R. P. French and Bertram Raven in 1959, power is divided into five separate and distinct forms.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt; They identified those five bases of power as ''coercive, reward, legitimate, referent, and expert''. This was followed by Raven's subsequent identification in 1965 of a sixth separate and distinct base of power: informational power.&lt;ref name=371-382&gt;Raven, B. H. (1965). Social influence and power. In I.D. Steiner &amp; M. Fishbein (Eds.),Current studies in social psychology (pp. 371–382). New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, French and Raven defined social influence as a change in the belief, attitude, or behavior of a person (the target of influence) which results from the action of another person (an influencing agent), and they defined social power as the potential for such influence, that is, the ability of the agent to bring about such a change using available resources.&lt;ref name=1242-49&gt;Raven, Bertram H. "Power, Six Bases of." Encyclopedia of Leadership.Ed. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2004. 1242-49. SAGE; Reference Online. Web. 30 Jan. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though there have been many formal definitions of leadership that did not include [[social influence]] and power, any discussion of leadership must inevitably deal with the means by which a leader gets the members of a group or organization to act and move in a particular direction.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

Whereby, this is to be considered "power" in social influential situations.

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Overview==
The original French and Raven (1959) model included five bases of power – reward, coercion, legitimate, expert, and referent – however, informational power was added by Raven in 1965, bringing the total to six.&lt;ref name=217-244&gt;Raven, Bertram H. (1992) "A power interaction model on interpersonal influence: French and Raven thirty years later". Journal of Social Behavior and Personality. Vol. 7, No. 2, 217-244&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the model has gone through very significant developments: coercion and reward can have personal as well as impersonal forms. Expert and referent power can be negative or positive. Legitimate power, in addition to position power, may be based on other normative obligations: reciprocity, equity, and responsibility. Information may be utilized in direct or indirect fashion.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

French and Raven defined social power as the potential for influence (a change in the belief, attitude or behavior of a someone who is the target of influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt;

As we know [[leadership]] and power are closely linked.  This model shows how the different forms of power affect one's leadership and success. This idea is used often in organizational communication and throughout the workforce. "The French-Raven power forms are introduced with consideration of the level of observability and the extent to which power is dependent or independent of structural conditions.  Dependency refers to the degree of internalization that occurs among persons subject to social control.  Using these considerations it is possible to link personal processes to structural conditions".&lt;ref name=Lazarsfeld&gt;Lazarsfeld, Paul. Menzel, Herbert. 1961. On the relation between individual and collective properties. pp 214–249 in Amitai Etzioni (ed.), Complex Organizations: A Sociological Reader. New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Original typology ==
The bases of social power have evolved over the years with benefits coming from advanced research and theoretical developments in related fields. On the basis of research and evidence, there have been many other developments and elaborations on the original theory. French and Raven developed an original model outlining the change dependencies and also further delineating each power basis.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Though it is a common understanding that most social influence can still be understood by the original six bases of power, the foundational bases have been elaborated and further differentiated.

==Bases of power==
As mentioned above, there are now six main concepts of power strategies consistently studied in social communication research. They are described as Coercive, Reward, Legitimate, Referent, Expert, and Informational.  Additionally, research has shown that [[source credibility]] has an explicit effect on the bases of power used in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Nesler, Mitchell S.; Aguinis, Herman; Quigley, Brian M.; Tedeschi, James T. (1993). "The Effect of Credibility on Perceived Power". Journal of Applied Social Psychology 23 (17): 1407–1425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Source credibility, the bases of power, and objective power, which is established based on variables such as position or title, are interrelated. The levels of each have a direct relationship in the manipulation and levels of one another.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

The bases of power differ according to the manner in which social changes are implemented, the permanence of such changes, and the ways in which each basis of power is established and maintained.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

The effectiveness of power is situational. Given there are six bases of power studied in the [[Communication]] field, it is very important to know the situational uses of each power, focusing on when each is most effective.  According to French and Raven, "it is of particular practical interest to know what bases of power or which power strategies are most likely to be effective, but it is clear that there is no simple answer.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

For example, a power strategy that works immediately but relies on surveillance (for example, reward power or coercive power) may not last once surveillance ends. One organizational study found that reward power tended to lead to greater satisfaction on the part of employees, which means that it might increase influence in a broad range of situations. Coercive power was more effective in influencing a subordinate who jeopardized the success of the overall organization or threatened the leader's authority, even though in the short term it also led to resentment on the part of the target. A power strategy that ultimately leads to private acceptance and long-lasting change (for example, information power) may be difficult to implement, and consume considerable time and energy. In the short term, complete reliance on information power might even be dangerous (for example, telling a small child not to run into the street unattended). A military officer leading his troops into combat might be severely handicapped if he had to give complete explanations for each move. Instead, he would want to rely on unquestioned legitimate position power, backed up by coercive power. Power resources, which may be effective for one leader, dealing with one target or follower, may not work for a different leader and follower. The manner in which the power strategy is utilized will also affect its success or failure. Where coercion is deemed necessary, a leader might soften its negative effects with a touch of humor. There have been studies indicating that cultural factors may determine the effectiveness of power strategies."&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;
             
=== Coercive power ===
{{Also|Coercive control}}
[[File:Blackbeard, Buccaneer - Cover.jpg|thumbnail|Blackbeard the infamous pirate]]
Coercive power uses the threat of force to gain [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] from another. Force may include physical, social, emotional, political, or economic means. Coercion is not always recognized by the target of influence.&lt;ref name=Petress&gt;{{cite web|last=Petress|first=Ken|date=2003|title=Power: Definition, Typology, Description, Examples, and Implications|format=PDF|url=http://uthscsa.edu/gme/documents/powerdefinitionstypologyexamples.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of power is based upon the idea of [[coercion]]. The main idea behind this concept is that someone is forced to do something that he/she does not desire to do. The main goal of coercion is compliance. Coercive power's influence is socially dependent on how the target relates to the change being desired by the influence agent.&lt;ref name=Pierro&gt;Pierro, A., Cicero, L., &amp; Raven, B. Motivated Compliance With Bases of Social Power. Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 38, 1921-1944.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, a person would have to be consistently watched by the influencing agent in order for the change to remain in effect.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt;

==== Impersonal ====
An example of impersonal coercion relates a person's belief that the influencing agent has the real power to physically threaten, impose a monetary fine or dismiss an employee.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Personal ====
An example of personal coercion relates to a threat of rejection or the possibility of disapproval from a person whom is highly valued.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

According to Changingminds.org "demonstrations of the harm are often used to illustrate what will happen if compliance is not gained".&lt;ref&gt;ChangingMinds. (2002–2009). Retrieved on May 5, 2009 from Changingminds.org&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2014}} The power of coercion has been proven to be related with [[Punishment (psychology)|punitive behavior]] that may be outside one's normal role expectations.&lt;ref name=Hinkin /&gt; However coercion has also been associated positively with generally punitive behavior and negatively associated to contingent [[Reward system|reward behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, D. A., &amp; Sims, H. P. Perceptions of managerial power as a consequence of managerial behavior and reputation. Journal of Management 1983, 9, 7-26.&lt;/ref&gt; This source of power can often lead to problems and in many circumstances it involves [[abuse]].  These type of leaders rely on the use of threats in their [[leadership style]]. Often the threats involve saying someone will be fired or demoted.

=== Reward power ===
{{Also|Operant conditioning|Reinforcement|Punishment (psychology)}}
Reward power is based on the right of some to offer or deny tangible, social, emotional, or spiritual [[Reward system|rewards]] to others for doing what is wanted or expected of them. Some examples of reward power (positive reward) are: (a) a child is given a dollar for earning better grades; (b) a student is admitted into an honor society for excellent effort; (c) a retiree is praised and feted for lengthy service at a retirement party; and (d) New York firefighters were heralded as heroes for their acts on 9-11-01.[[File:Money 555.jpg|thumbnail]] Some examples of reward power (negative reward) are: (a) a driver is fined for illegal parking; (b) a teenager grounded for a week for misbehaving; (c) a rookie player is ridiculed for not following tradition; and (d) [[President Harding]]'s name is commonly invoked whenever [[political scandal]] is mentioned. Some pitfalls can emerge when a too heavy reliance is placed on reward power; these include: (a) some people become fixated and too dependent on rewards to do even mundane activities; (b) too severe fears of punishment can immobilize some people; (c) as time passes, past rewards become insufficient to motivate or activate desired outcomes; and (d) negative rewards may be perverted into positive attention.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

==== Impersonal ====
An example of impersonal reward relates to promises of promotions, money and rewards from various social areas.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Personal ====
An example of personal reward relates to the reward of receiving approval from a desired person and building relationships with romantic partners.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

=== Legitimate power ===
{{Also|Legitimisation}}
[[File:Queen Elizabeth II - 1953-Dress.JPG|thumbnail|Queen Elizabeth II - 1953]]
Legitimate power comes from an elected, selected, or appointed position of authority and may be underpinned by [[social norms]].&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; This power which means the ability to administer to another certain feelings of [[obligation]] or the notion of responsibility.&lt;ref name=Hinkin /&gt; "Rewarding and Punishing subordinates is generally seen as a legitimate part of the formal or appointed leadership role and most managerial positions in work organizations carry with them, some degree of expected reward and punishment."&lt;ref&gt;Bass, B. M. (1990). Handbook of leadership (3rd ed.). New York: Free Press&lt;/ref&gt; This type of formal power relies on position in an authority [[hierarchy]]. Occasionally, those possessing legitimate power fail to recognize they have it, and may begin to notice others going around them to accomplish their goals.&lt;ref name="administration1998"&gt;Fuqua, E., Payne, K., &amp; Cangemi, J. (1998). Leadership and the effective use of power. National Forum of Educational Administration and Supervision Journal, 15E(4), 36-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Three bases of legitimate power are cultural values, acceptance of social structure, and designation.&lt;ref name=150-167&gt;French, J. and Raven, B. (1959). The Bases of Social Power. In Studies in Social Power, D. Cartwright, Ed., pp. 150-167. Ann Arbor, MI: Institute for Social Research.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural values comprise a general basis for legitimate power of one entity over another.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; Such legitimacy is conferred by others and this [[Legitimation|legitimacy]] can be revoked by the original granters, their designees, or their inheritors.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Legitimate power originates from a target of influence accepting the power of the influencing agent whereas behavioral change or [[compliance (psychology)|compliance]] occurs based on target's obligation.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; One who uses legitimate power may have a high need for power which is their motivator to use this base for change in behavior and influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; There may be a range of legitimate power.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt;

==== Position ====
The legitimate position power is based on the social norm which requires people to be obedient to those who hold superior positions in a formal or informal social structure.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Examples may include: a [[Police legitimacy|police officer's legitimacy]] to make arrests; a parent's legitimacy to restrict a child's activities; the President's legitimacy to live in the White House; and the Congress' legitimacy to declare war. Some pitfalls can arise when too heavy reliance is placed on legitimate power; these include: (a) unexpected exigencies call for non-legitimized individuals to act in the absence of a legitimate authority – such as a citizen's arrest in the absence of a police official; and (b) military legitimacy&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

==== Reciprocity ====
The legitimate power of reciprocity is based on the social norm of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]].&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Which states how we feel obligated to do something in return for someone who does something beneficial for us.&lt;ref&gt;Gouldner, A. (1960). The norm of reciprocity: A preliminary statement.
American Sociological Review, 47, 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B. (1993). Influence: Science and practice (3rd ed.). New York:
HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Equity ====
The legitimate power of equity is based on the social norm of equity (or [[compensatory damages]])&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; The social norm of equity makes people feel compelled to compensate someone who has suffered or worked hard.&lt;ref&gt;Walster, E., Walster, G. W., &amp; Berscheid, E. (1978). Equity theory and
research. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as someone whom we have harmed in some way is based on the premise that there is a wrong that can be made right, which may be a compensatory form of righting the wrong.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz&gt;Berkowitz, L. and Daniels, L. (1963).  The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology, Vol 66(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dependence  ====
The legitimate power of dependence is based on the social norm of [[social responsibility]].&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt; Social responsibility norm states how people feel obligated to help someone who is in need of assistance.&lt;ref name=Berkowitz/&gt;

People traditionally obey the person with this power solely based on their role, position or title rather than the person specifically as a leader. Therefore, this type of power can easily be lost and the leader does not have his position or title anymore. This power is therefore not strong enough to be one's only form of influencing/persuading.

=== Referent power ===
{{Main article|Referent power}}
Referent power is rooted in the affiliations we make and/or the groups and organizations we belong to.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Our affiliation with a group and the beliefs of the group are shared to some degree. As Referent power emphasizes similarity, respect for an agent of influence's superiority may be undermined by a target of influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Use of this power base and its outcomes may be negative or positive.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; An agent for change motivated with a strong need for affiliation and concern of likeability will prefer this power base and will influence their leadership style.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Ingratiation or flattery and sense of community may be used by an agent of influence to enhance their influence.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt;
[[File:Reagans with Billy Graham.jpg|thumbnail|Reagans with Rev. Billy Graham]]

==== Positive ====
Referent power in a positive form utilizes the shared personal connection or shared belief between the influencing agent and target with the intention of positively correlated actions of the target.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Negative ====
Referent power in a negative form produces actions in opposition to the intent of the influencing agent, this is the result from the agent's creation of [[cognitive dissonance]] between the referent influencing agent and the target's perception of that influence.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Examples of referent power include: (a) each of the last seven White House press secretaries have been paid handsomely for their memoirs relating to their presence at the seat of government; (b) Mrs. Hillary Clinton gained political capital by her marriage to the President; (c) Reverend Pat Robertson lost a bid for the Republican Party's nomination for President due, in significant part, to his religious affiliation; and (4) national firefighters have received vocational acclaim due to the association with the heroic NYC firefighters. Some pitfalls can occur related to referent assumptions; these include: (a) guilt or glory by association where little or no true tie is established; (b) associative traits tend to linger long after real association ends; (c) some individuals tend to pay dearly for associates' misdeeds or terrible reputations.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; It is important to distinguish between referent power and other bases of social power involving control or [[conformity]].&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; According to Fuqua, Payne, and Cangemi, referent power acts a little like [[role model]] power. It depends on respecting, liking, and holding another individual in high esteem. It usually develops over a long period of time.&lt;ref name="administration1998"/&gt;

The power of holding the ability to administer to another a sense of personal acceptance or personal approval.&lt;ref name=Hinkin&gt;Hinkin, T. R., &amp; Schriesheim, C. A. Development and application of new scales to measure the bases of social power. Journal of Applied Psychology, 1989 74, 561-567.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of power is strong enough that the power-holder is often looked up to as a role model.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, B. H. Political applications of the psychology of interpersonal influence and social power. Political Psychology, 1990, 11, 493-520.&lt;/ref&gt; This power is often regarded as admiration, or charm. The responsibility involved is heavy and the power easily lost, but when combined with other forms of power it can be very useful. Referent power is commonly seen in political and military figures, although celebrities often have this as well.

=== Expert power===
[[File:Julius Richmond, Surgeon General official photo.jpg|thumbnail|[[Julius Richmond]], [[Surgeon General of the United States]]]]
Expert power is based on what one knows, experience, and special skills or talents.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Expertise can be demonstrated by reputation, credentials certifying [[expertise]], and actions.  The effectiveness and impacts of the Expert power base may be negative or positive.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt; According to Raven, there will be more use of Expert power if the motive is a need for achievement.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; The ability to administer to another information, knowledge or expertise.&lt;ref name=French&amp;Raven&gt;French, J. R. P., Raven, B. The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright and A. Zander. Group dynamics. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; (Example: Doctors, lawyers). As a consequence of the expert power or knowledge, a leader is able to convince their subordinates to trust them.  The expertise does not have to be genuine – it is the [[perception]] of expertise that provides the power base.  When individuals perceive or assume that a person possesses superior skills or abilities, they award power to that person.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt;

==== Positive ====
Expert power in a positive form influences the target to act accordingly as instructed by the expert, based on the assumption of the expert's correct knowledge.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

====  Negative ====
Expert power in a negative form can result from a person acting in opposition to the experts instructions if the target feels that the expert has personal gain motives.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

Some examples include: (a) a violinist demonstrating through audition skill with music; (b) a professor submits school transcripts to demonstrate discipline expertise; (c) a bricklayer relies on 20+ years of experience to prove expertise. Some pitfalls can emerge when too heavy a reliance is made on expertise; these include: (a) sometimes inferences are made suggesting expertise is wider in scope than it actually is; for example, an expert in antique vases may have little expertise in antique lamps; (b) one's expertise is not everlasting; for example, a physician who fails to keep up with medical technology and advances may lose expertise; and (c) expertise does not necessarily carry with it [[common sense]] or [[ethics|ethical judgement]].&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

=== Informational power ===
French and Raven's original five powers brought about change after many years, by which Raven added a sixth base of power. Informational is the ability of an [[agent of influence]] to bring about change through the resource of information.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Raven arguably believed that power as a potential influence logically meant that information was a form of influence and the social power base of Information Power was derived.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Informational influence results in [[cognition]] and acceptance by the target of influence. The ability for altered behavior initiated through information rather than a specific change agent is called socially independent change.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; In order to establish Information Power, an agent of influence would likely provide a baseline of information to a target of influence to lay the groundwork in order to be effective with future [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; A link between informational power, control, cooperation, and satisfaction have been hypothesized and tested in a lab study. The findings indicate that a channel member's control over another's strategy increases with its informational power source.&lt;ref name=150-167/&gt; According to Raven, there will be more use of Information power if the motive is a need for achievement and can also be affected by an agent's [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Feldman summarizes informational power as the most transitory type of power. If one gives information away, then the power is given away, which differs from other forms of power because it's grounded in what you know about the content of a specific situation. Other forms of power are independent of the content.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, R.S. (1985). Social Psychology: Theories, Research, and Applications.  McGraw Hill Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information power comes as a result of possessing knowledge that others need or want.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; In the age of [[Information technology]], information power is increasingly relevant as an abundance of information is readily available.  There may be a [[cost-benefit analysis]] by an agent of influence to determine if Information Power or influence is the best strategy.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Informational influence or persuasion would generally be favorable however it may not be best suited if timing and effort lacks.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Information possessed that no one needs or wants is powerless. Information power extends to the ability to get information not presently held such as a case with a librarian or data base manager. Not all information is readily available; some information is closely controlled by few people.  Examples of information that is sensitive or limits accessibility: (a) national security data; (b) personnel information for government or business; (c) corporate trade secrets; (d) juvenile court records; (e) many privately settled lawsuit documents; (f) Swiss bank account owners; and (g) private phone conversations. Of course, legally obtained phone tap warrants, spying, eavesdropping, group and group member leaks can allow others not intended to be privy to information.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt; Possessing information is not, typically, the vital act; it is what one can and does do or potentially can do with the information that typically is of vital importance. Information can, and often is, used as a weapon as in a divorce, a child custody case, business dissolution, or in civil suits discoveries. Information has been used by some to extort action, utterance, agreement, or settlement by others.&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Information power is a form of personal or collective power that is based on controlling information needed by others in order to reach an important goal.  Our society is now reliant on information power as knowledge for influence, decision making, credibility, and control.  Timely and relevant information delivered on demand can be the most influential way to acquire power.  Information may be readily available through public records, research, and but information is sometimes assumed privileged or confidential. The target of influence accepts,comprehends and internalizes the change independently, without have to go back to the influencing agent.&lt;ref name=Pierro/&gt;

Informational power is based on the potential to utilize information.  Providing rational arguments, using information to persuade others, using facts and manipulating information can create a power base.  How information is used – sharing it with others, limiting it to key people, keeping it secret from key people, organizing it, increasing it, or even falsifying it – can create a shift in power within a group.&lt;ref name="Forsyth, D. R. 2010"/&gt;

==== Direct ====

Information presented by the influencing agent directly to the target of change.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Indirect ====

Information presented influencing agent indirectly to the target of change void of attempting influence, such as hints or suggestions.&lt;ref name=217-244/&gt;

==== Socially independent of change====

The ability for altered behavior initiated through information rather than a specific change agent is called socially independent change.&lt;ref name=371-382/&gt; Power socially independent of change may reflect the target continuing changed behavior without referring to, or even remembering, the supervisor or individual of authority as an agent of change because the target understands and accepts the reasoning of information received.&lt;ref name=1242-49/&gt;

==== Accessibility ====

Raven acknowledged leaders can attempt to influence subordinates by access and control of information. Information power may be used in both personal and positional classifications and is among the most preferable power bases.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, D. E. and Stahelski, A. J. The systematic measurement of French &amp; Raven's bases of social power in workgroups. Journal of Applied Social Psychology vol. 18 (1988) pp. 375–389&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tools/mechanisms ====

Informational power includes not only possessing information, but also the ability to obtain relevant information in a timely way to amass a power base.  The use of tools or technological mechanisms such as [[internet]], smart phones, and [[Social media]] progresses society's access to information but informational power as a base is derived by determining the usefulness and appropriateness of the information.&lt;ref&gt;Dessler, G. and Phillips, J. (2008). Managing Now. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Power as a function of leadership and leadership styles ==
Tradition power is that force that is exerted upon us to conform to traditional ways. Traditions, for the most part, are social constructs; they invite, seduce, or compel us to conform and act in predictable, patterned ways. Breaking with traditions put people at risk of social alienation. Traditions can blunt rationality; they can block innovation; and they can appear to outsiders as silly when original traditions' rationales become outdated or forgotten.

The power of traditions, rather than being typically vested in particular individuals, is ordinarily focused on group conformity&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

Charismatic power is that aura possessed by only a few individuals in our midst; it is characterized by super confidence, typical physical attractiveness, social adroitness, amiability, sharpened leadership skills, and heightened charm. Some [[charisma]] has dark and sinister overtones such as that shown by [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Jim Jones]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Osama bin Laden]], [[David Koresh]], and many [[confidence trickster]]s. Others demonstrate more positive displays of charisma such as that displayed by [[Jacqueline Kennedy]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], [[Michael Jordan]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]]. Charisma has, in many cases, short circuited rationality; that is, others have been fooled into or lulled into not rationally considering what a charismatic requests or demands but going along as a result of the charismatic attraction. It must be remembered that power is effective only when the target of powerful actions agrees [implicitly or explicitly] to the relevant power dynamic; we are all technically able to resist the power of others; at times, however, we may feel powerless to resist or the social, political, personal, and/or emotional price to be paid is too high or we fear failure in resisting&lt;ref name=Petress/&gt;

{{Governance}}
'''Governance''' comprises all of the processes of governing - whether undertaken by the [[government]] of a [[state (polity) | state]], by a [[market (economics) |market]] or by a [[social network| network]] - over a [[social system]] ([[family]], [[tribe]], [[formal organization |formal]] or [[informal organization]], a [[territory]] or across territories) and whether through the [[laws]], [[norm (social) |norm]]s, [[political power|power]] or [[language]] of an organized society.&lt;ref&gt;Compare: {{Cite book |last= Bevir |first= Mark |title= Governance: A very short introduction |year= 2012 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford, UK | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ozjcWIfhoO8C | quote = Governance refers, therefore, to all processes of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market, or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organization, or territory, and whether through laws, norms, power or language. Governance differs from government in that it focuses less on the state and its institutions and more on social practices and activities. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It relates to "the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of [[social norm]]s and [[institution]]s".&lt;ref name="Hufty 2011"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions.

A variety of entities (known generically as '''governing bodies''') can govern. The most formal is a '''government''', a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given [[geopolitical]] system (such as a [[sovereign state|state]]) by establishing [[law]]s. Other types of governing include an organization (such as a [[corporation]] recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group ([[chiefdom]], tribe, [[gang]], family, [[religious denomination]], etc.), or another, informal [[social group | group]] of people. In [[business sector | business]] and [[outsourcing]] relationships, [[Governance Frameworks|governance frameworks]] are built{{by whom?|date=September 2018}} into [[relational contract]]s that foster long-term collaboration and innovation.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and held [[accountability |accountable]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given [[organization]] and, externally, with its [[business partner]]s. As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. For instance, a government may operate as a [[democracy]] where citizens vote on who should govern and the [[public good]] is the goal, while a [[non-profit organization]] or a [[corporation]] may be governed by a small [[board of directors]] and pursue more specific aims.

In addition, a variety of external actors without decision-making power can influence the process of governing. These include [[lobbying |lobbies]], [[think tanks]], [[political parties]], [[non-government organizations]] , community and [[Media (communication) | media]].

==Origin of the word==
{{Disputed section|Origins of the word|date=August 2016}}
Like ''government'', the word ''governance'' derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb kubernaein [''kubernáo''] (meaning ''to steer'', the metaphorical sense first being attested in [[Plato]]). Its occasional use in English to refer to the specific activity of ruling a country can be traced to early modern England, when the phrase "governance of the realm" appears in works by [[William Tyndale]]&lt;ref name="TyndaleFrith1831"&gt;"When the king's grace came first to the right of the crown, and unto the governance of the realm young and unexpert..." {{cite book|author1=William Tyndale|author2=John Frith|title=The works of Tyndale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qoMAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA452|year=1831|publisher=Ebenezer Palmer|page=452}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in royal correspondence between [[James V of Scotland]] and [[Henry VIII of England]].&lt;ref&gt;"We have put all our confidence, has als actyflie with ye help of our derrest Modir takin on Ws ye governance of our Realme": {{cite book|title=State Papers: King Henry the Eighth; Part IV.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs0_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA95|year=1836|publisher=Murray|page=95|chapter=Letter of James V to Henry VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first usage in connection with institutional structures (as distinct from individual rule) is in [[Charles Plummer]]’s ''The Governance of England'' (an 1885 translation from a 15th-century Latin work by [[John Fortescue (judge)|John Fortescue]], also known as ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy''). This usage of governance to refer to the arrangements of governing became orthodox including in [[Sidney Low]]’s seminal text of the same title in 1904 and among some later British constitutional historians.

However, the use of the term ''governance'' in its current broader sense, encompassing the activities of a wide range of public and private institutions, acquired general currency only as recently as the 1990s, when it was re-minted by economists and political scientists and disseminated by institutions such as the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/governance/docs/doc5_fr.pdf Étymologie du terme "gouvernance"], document prepared by the [[European Commission]].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the term has steadily gained increasing usage.

==Types==
Governance often refers to a particular 'level' of governance associated with a type of organization (including public governance, global governance, non-profit governance, corporate governance, and project governance), a particular 'field' of governance associated with a type of activity or outcome (including environmental governance, internet governance, and information technology governance), or a particular 'model' of governance, often derived as an empirical or normative theory (including regulatory governance, participatory governance, multilevel governance, metagovernance, and collaborative governance).

Governance can also define normative or practical agendas. Normative concepts of fair governance or good governance are common among [[Politics|political]], [[public sector]], [[Volunteering|voluntary]], and [[private sector]] organizations.

===Governance as process===
{{Unreferenced section|date = December 2013}}In its most abstract sense, governance is a theoretical concept referring to the actions and processes by which stable practices and organizations arise and persist. These actions and processes may operate in formal and informal organizations of any size; and they may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not. Conceiving of governance in this way, one can apply the concept to [[State (polity)|states]], to [[corporation]]s, to [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]]s, to [[NGO]]s, to partnerships and other associations, to business relationships (especially complex [[outsourcing]] relationships), to [[project team]]s, and to any number of humans engaged in some purposeful activity.

Most theories of governance as process arose out of [[neoclassical economics]]. These theories build deductive models, based on the assumptions of modern economics, to show how rational actors may come to establish and sustain formal organizations, including firms and states, and informal organizations, such as networks and practices for governing the commons. Many of these theories draw on [[transaction cost]] economics.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," ''Journal of Law and Economics'': Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public governance===
{{main|Public administration}}
There is a distinction between the concepts of governance and [[politics]]. Politics involves processes by which a group of people (perhaps with divergent opinions or interests) reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group, and enforced as common [[policy]]. Governance, on the other hand, conveys the [[Public administration|administrative]] and process-oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones.&lt;ref&gt;Offe, Claus, (2009) Governance: An “Empty Signifier”? ''Constellations,'' 16: 550–62. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-8675.2009.00570.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an argument continues to assume the possibility of the traditional separation between "politics" and "administration". Contemporary governance practice and theory sometimes questions this distinction, premising that both "governance" and "politics" involve aspects of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[accountability]].

In general terms, public governance occurs in three broad ways:
* Through networks involving [[public-private partnership]]s (PPP) or with the collaboration of community organisations;
* Through the use of [[Market (economics)|market]] mechanisms whereby market principles of competition serve to allocate resources while operating under government regulation;
* Through top-down methods that primarily involve governments and the state [[bureaucracy]].

===Private governance===
Private governance occurs when non-governmental entities, including private organizations, [[dispute resolution organizations]], or other third party groups, make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the "quality of life and opportunities of the larger public."  Simply put, private—not public—entities are making [[public policy]]. For example, insurance companies exert a great societal impact, largely invisible and freely accepted, that is a private form of governance in society; in turn, reinsurers, as private companies, may exert similar private governance over their underlying carriers.&lt;ref&gt;Marcos Antonio Mendoza, "Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions", 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, 68–70 (2014) http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2573253&lt;/ref&gt; The term "public policy" should not be exclusively associated with policy that is made by [[government]]. Public policy may be created by either the private sector or the public sector. If one wishes to refer only to public policy that is made by government, the best term to use is "governmental policy," which eliminates the ambiguity regarding the agent of the policy making.

===Global governance===
{{main|Global governance}}
Global governance is defined as "the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, right and obligations are established, and differences are mediated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thakur|first1=Ramesh|last2=Van Langenhove|first2=Luk|title=Enhancing Global Governance through Regional Integration|journal=Global Governance|date=2006|volume=12|issue=3 July, September|pages=233–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the traditional meaning of "governance", some authors like [[James Rosenau]] have used the term "global governance" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority.&lt;ref&gt;James N. Rosenau, "Toward an Ontology for Global Governance", in Martin Hewson and Thomas Sinclair, eds., ''Approaches to Global Governance Theory'', SUNY Press, Albany, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The best example of this is the international system or relationships between independent states. The term, however, can apply wherever a group of free equals needs to form a regular relationship.

===Governance Analytical Framework===
The Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, where various stakeholders interact and make decisions regarding collective issues, thus creating or reinforcing social norms and institutions. It is postulated that governance processes can be found in any society, and unlike other approaches, that these can be observed and analysed from a non-[[normative]] perspective. It proposes a methodology based on five main analytical units: problems, actors, norms, processes and "nodal points". These logically articulated analytical units make up a coherent methodology aimed at being used as a tool for empirical [[social policy]] research.&lt;ref name="Hufty 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hufty |first=Marc |title=Governance: Exploring four approaches and their relevance to research. In: Wiesmann, U., Hurni, H., et al. editors. Research for Sustainable Development: Foundations, Experiences, and Perspectives. |year=2011 |location=Bern |publisher=Geographica Bernensia: 165–183.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spear, Cornforth &amp; Aiken, 2009. The governance challenges of social enterprises: Evidence from a UK empirical study. Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics, 89(2): 247–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonprofit governance===
Nonprofit governance has a dual focus: achieving the organization's social mission and the ensuring the organization is viable. Both responsibilities relate to fiduciary responsibility that a board of trustees (sometimes called directors, or Board, or Management Committee—the terms are interchangeable) has with respect to the exercise of authority over the explicit actions the organization takes. Public trust and accountability is an essential aspect of organizational viability so it achieves the social mission in a way that is respected by those whom the organization serves and the society in which it is located.

===Corporate governance===
{{main|Corporate governance}}
[[Corporation|Corporate organizations]] often use the word ''governance'' to describe both:
# The manner in which [[Board of directors|board]]s or their like direct a corporation
# The laws and customs (rules) applying to that direction

Corporate governance consists of the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions affecting the way people direct, administer or control a corporation. Corporate governance also includes the relationships among the many players involved (the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]) and the corporate [[goal]]s. The principal players include the [[shareholder]]s, [[management]], and the [[board of directors]]. Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers, banks and other lenders, regulators, the environment and the community at large.

The first documented use of the word "corporate governance" is by Richard Eells (1960, p.&amp;nbsp;108) to denote "the structure and functioning of the corporate polity". The "corporate government" concept itself is older and was already used in finance textbooks at the beginning of the 20th century (Becht, Bolton, Röell 2004).

===Project governance===
{{main|Project governance}}
Project governance is the management framework within which project decisions are made.

===Environmental governance===
{{main|Environmental governance}}

===Land governance===
Land governance is concerned with issues of land ownership and tenure. It consists of the policies, processes and institutions by which decisions about the access to, use of and control over land are made, implemented and enforced; it is also about managing and reconciling competing claims on land. In developing countries, it is relevant as a tool to contribute to equitable and sustainable development, addressing the phenomenon that is known as ‘[[land grabbing]]’.&lt;ref&gt;Focus on Land in Africa (http://www.focusonland.com/property-rights-issues/land-governance-and-law-1/)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTARD/Resources/335807-1194987153844/UNHABITATFricska.ppt Policy Paper: Good Land Governance]. Global Land Tool Network, no date.&lt;/ref&gt; The operational dimension of land governance is [[land administration]].

Security of land tenure is considered to contribute to poverty reduction and food security, since it can enable farmers to fully participate in the economy. Without recognized property rights, it is hard for small entrepreneurs, farmers included, to obtain credit or sell their business&lt;ref&gt;[[Hernando de Soto Polar|De Soto, Hernando]]. [http://www.basicbooks.com/full-details?isbn=9780465016150 The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else]. New York: Basic Books. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; - hence the relevance of comprehensive land governance.

There is constant feedback between land tenure problems and land governance.  For instance, it has been argued that what is frequently called '[[land grabbing]]', was partly made possible by the [[Washington Consensus]]-inspired liberalization of land markets in developing countries. Many land acquisition deals were perceived to have negative consequences, and this in turn led to initiatives to improve land governance in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers: [https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/the-global-land-grab/ The global land grab: beyond the hype], Zed Books, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of land governance depends on its practical implementation, which is known as [[land administration]]: ‘the way in which rules of land tenure are made operational’. And another factor is accountability:  the degree to which citizens and stakeholder groups are consulted and can hold to account their authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Mayke Kaag and Annelies Zoomers, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main international policy initiative to improve land governance is known as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/nr/tenure/voluntary-guidelines/en/ VGGT]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed by the [[Committee on World Food Security]] (CFS).

===Internet governance===
{{main|Internet governance}}

===Information technology governance===
{{main|Information technology governance}}
IT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management. The goal of clear governance is to assure the investment in IT generate business value and mitigate the risks that are associated with IT projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Smallwood | first= Deb | work= Tech Decision CIO Insights | title = IT Governance: A Simple Model | date = March 2009 | url = http://www.ebizq.net/blogs/insurance/2009/02/it_governance_a_simple_model.php
| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulatory governance===
{{main|Regulatory governance}}
Regulatory governance reflects the emergence of decentered and mutually adaptive policy regimes which rests on regulation rather than service provision or taxing and spending.&lt;ref&gt;David Levi-Faur, "Regulation &amp; Regulatory Governance", in David Levi-Faur, Handbook on the Politics of Regulation, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2011, pp. 1–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The term captures the tendency of policy regimes to deal with complexity with delegated system of rules. It is likely to appear in arenas and nations which are more complex, more global, more contested and more liberally democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Braithwaite, John, Cary Coglianese, and David Levi‐Faur. "Can regulation and governance make a difference?." Regulation &amp; Governance 1.1 (2007): 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; The term builds upon and extends the terms of the regulatory state on the one hand and governance on the other. While the term regulatory state marginalize non-state actors (NGOs and Business) in the domestic and global level, the term governance marginalizes regulation as a constitutive instrument of governance. The term regulatory governance therefore allows us to understand governance beyond the state and governance via regulation.

===Participatory governance===
Participatory governance focuses on deepening democratic engagement through the participation of citizens in the processes of governance with the state. The idea is that citizens should play a more direct roles in public decision-making or at least engage more deeply with political issues. Government officials should also be responsive to this kind of engagement. In practice, participatory governance can supplement the roles of citizens as voters or as watchdogs through more direct forms of involvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/publication/triumph-deficit-or-contestation-deepening-the-deepening-democracy-debate 'Triumph, Deficit or Contestation? Deepening the 'Deepening Democracy' Debate'] Institute of Development Studies (IDS) Working Paper 264 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contract governance===
(See also [[contract management]].) Emerging thinking about contract governance is focusing on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way.&lt;ref&gt;Unpacking Outsourcing Governance: How to Build a Sound Governance Structure to Drive Insight Versus Oversight|[http://www.vestedway.com/vested-library/]|2015|Vested Way|accessed 17 August 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure for a contract is the “framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided.” Adding further that “because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.”&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver E. (1979) "Transaction-Cost Economics: The Governance of Contractual Relations," Journal of Law and Economics: Vol. 22: No. 2, Article 3|accessible at: http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/jle/vol22/iss2/3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multilevel governance===
{{main|Multilevel governance}}

===Metagovernance===
"Metagovernance" is the "governing of governing".&lt;ref&gt;Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents the established ethical principles, or 'norms', that shape and steer the entire governing process. It is important to note that there are no clearly defined settings within which metagoverning takes place, or particular persons who are responsible for it. While some{{Who|date=January 2012}} believe metagoverning to be the role of the state which is assumed to want to steer actors in a particular direction, it can "potentially be exercised by any resourceful actor"&lt;ref&gt;Sorensen, E. Metagovernance: The Changing Role of Politicians in Processes of Democratic Governance. ''American Review of Public Administration.'' Volume 36 2006, pp. 98–114 (p. 103).&lt;/ref&gt; who wishes to influence the governing process. Examples of this include the publishing of codes of conduct at the highest level of international government,&lt;ref&gt;Onyango, P &amp; Jentoft, S. Assessing Poverty in small-scale fisheries in Lake Victoria, Tanzania.''Fish and Fisheries''. Volume 11 2010, pp. 250–63 (p. 258).&lt;/ref&gt; and media focus on specific issues&lt;ref name="evans"&gt;Evans, J. ''Environmental Governance''. Routledge 2012. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; at the socio-cultural level. Despite their different sources, both seek to establish values in such a way that they become accepted 'norms'. The fact that 'norms' can be established at any level and can then be used to shape the governance process as whole, means metagovernance is part of both the input and the output of the governing system.&lt;ref&gt;Kooiman, J. ''Governing as Governance''. Sage publications 2003. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborative governance===
{{See also|Collaborative governance}}
A collaborative governance framework uses a relationship management structure, joint performance and transformation management processes and an exit management plan as controlling mechanisms to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties.&lt;ref name="Vitasek"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vitasek|first=Kate|display-authors=etal |title=The Vested Outsourcing Manual|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=0230112684|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Security sector governance ===
{{See also|Security sector governance}}Security sector governance (SSG) is a subpart concept or framework of security governance that focuses specifically on decisions about [[security]] and their implementation within the [[National security|security sector]] of a single state. SSG applies the principles of [[good governance]] to the security sector in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dcaf.ch|title=Security Sector Governance|last=|first=|publisher=Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF)|year=2015|isbn=|series=SSR Backgrounder Series|location=Geneva|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a normative concept==

===Fair governance===

When discussing governance in particular organizations, the quality of governance within the organization is often compared to a standard of [[good governance]]. In the case of a [[business]] or of a [[non-profit organization]], for example, good governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, guidance, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility, and proper oversight and accountability. "Good governance" implies that mechanisms function in a way that allows the executives (the "agents") to respect the rights and interests of the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (the "principals"), in a spirit of [[democracy]].

===Good governance===
{{Main|Good governance}}
Good governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe various normative accounts of how public institutions ought to conduct public affairs and manage public resources. These normative accounts are often justified on the grounds that they are thought to be conducive to economic ends, such as the eradication of poverty and successful economic development. Unsurprisingly different organizations have defined governance and good governance differently to promote different normative ends.

The [[World Bank]] defines governance as:
{{quote|the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank, [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/03/07/000090341_20060307104630/Rendered/PDF/34899.pdf Managing Development – The Governance Dimension], 1991, Washington D.C., p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project of the World Bank defines governance as:
{{quote|the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/1740479-1150402582357/2661829-1158008871017/booklet_decade_of_measuring_governance.pdf A Decade of Measuring the Quality of Governance].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This considers the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies and the respect of citizens and the state of the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.

An alternate definition sees governance as:
{{quote|the use of institutions, structures of authority and even [[collaboration]] to allocate [[Resource (economics)|resources]] and coordinate or control activity in society or the economy''.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Stephen, 2002. Economic Governance and Institutional Dynamics, Oxford University Press, Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the [[United Nations Development Programme]]'s Regional Project on Local Governance for Latin America:

{{quote|Governance has been defined as the rules of the political system to solve conflicts between actors and adopt decision (legality). It has also been used to describe the "proper functioning of institutions and their acceptance by the public" (legitimacy). And it has been used to invoke the efficacy of government and the achievement of consensus by democratic means (participation).&lt;ref&gt;This is a very widely cited definition, as in [http://info.publicintelligence.net/ISAFgovernance.pdf Applebaugh, J. (rapporteur), "Governance Working Group", power-point presentation, National Defense University and ISAF, 2010, slide 22].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Measurement and assessment===

Since the early years of the 2000s (decade),{{When|date=January 2012}} efforts have been conducted in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the [[world]]. Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise. A distinction is therefore made between external assessments, peer assessments and self-assessments. Examples of external assessments are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations. An example of a peer assessment is the [[African Peer Review Mechanism]]. Examples of self-assessments are [http://gaportal.org/country-initiatives country-led assessments] that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level.

One of these efforts to create an internationally comparable measure of governance and an example of an external assessment is the [[Worldwide Governance Indicators]] project, developed by members of the World Bank and the [[World Bank Institute]]. The project reports aggregate and individual indicators for more than 200 countries for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, [[rule of law]], control of corruption. To complement the macro-level cross-country Worldwide Governance Indicators, the World Bank Institute developed the [[World Bank Governance Surveys]], which are country-level governance assessment tools that operate at the micro or sub-national level and use information gathered from a country’s own citizens, business people and public sector workers to diagnose governance vulnerabilities and suggest concrete approaches for fighting corruption.

A Worldwide Governance Index (WGI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111004144807/http://www.world-governance.org/spip.php?article469 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 4 October 2011 | year =  | title = World Governance Index 2009 Report | publisher = World Governance | accessdate = 3 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed in 2009 and is open for improvement through public participation. The following domains, in the form of indicators and composite indexes, were selected to achieve the development of the WGI: Peace and Security, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Participation, Sustainable Development, and Human Development. Additionally, in 2009 the Bertelsmann Foundation published the [[Sustainable Governance Indicators]] (SGI), which systematically measure the need for reform and the capacity for reform within the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries. The project examines to what extent governments can identify, formulate and implement effective reforms that render a society well-equipped to meet future challenges, and ensure their future viability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl = http://www.sgi-network.de/index.php?page=mission  | accessdate = | last = Empter  | first1 = Stefan  | first2 = Josef | last2 = Janning  | chapter=Sustainable Governance Indicators 2009 – An Introduction | editor-first  = Bertelsmann | editor-last = Stiftung | year = 2009| title = Policy Performance and Executive Capacity in the OECD | location = Gütersloh | publisher = Verlag Bertelsmann Stiftung}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20160413110418/http://xml.fido.gov/stratml/references/PL111-532StratML.htm#SEC10 Section 10] of the [[Government Performance and Results Act]] (GPRA) Modernization Act requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format.

The International Budget Partnership (IBP) launched the [http://internationalbudget.org/what-we-do/major-ibp-initiatives/open-budget-initiative/ Open Budget Initiative] in 2006 with the release of the first [http://internationalbudget.org/what-we-do/open-budget-survey/ Open Budget Survey (OBS)]. The OBS is a comprehensive analysis and survey that evaluates whether central governments give the public access to budget documents and provide opportunities for public participation in the budget process. To measure the overall commitment to transparency, the IBP created [http://survey.internationalbudget.org/#rankings Open Budget Index] (OBI), which assigns a score to each country based on the results of the survey. While the OBS is released biannually, the IBP recently released a new [http://www.obstracker.org/ OBS Tracker], which serves as an online tool for civil society, the media, and other actors to monitor in real time whether governments are releasing eight key budget documents. The Open Budget Index data are used by the [[Open Government Partnership]], development aid agencies, and increasingly investors in the private sector as key indicators of governance, particularly fiscal transparency and management of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;Castro, Michael, 12 September 2013, [http://www.opengovpartnership.org/blog/michael-castro/2013/09/12/open-budgets-key-open-government-next-steps-ogp-countries#sthash.cFZvst8q.dpuf Open Budgets Key to Open Government: Next Steps for OGP Countries], retrieved 2 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of country-led assessments include the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/indonesia Indonesian Democracy Index], monitoring of the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/mongolia Millennium Development Goal 9 on Human Rights and Democratic Governance in Mongolia] and the [http://www.gaportal.org/undp-supported/bhutan Gross National Happiness Index in Bhutan].

Publishing performance reports openly on the Web in a standard, machine-readable format is good practice for all organizations whose plans and reports should be matters of public record.

'''Jewish emancipation''' was the external (and [[Jewish Enlightenment|internal]]) process in various nations in [[Europe]] of eliminating [[Disabilities (Jewish)|Jewish disabilities]], e.g. [[Jewish quota]]s, to which [[European Jew|Jewish people]] were then subject, and the recognition of Jews as entitled to equality and [[citizenship]] rights on a communal, not merely individual, basis.&lt;ref name=mjl&gt;{{cite news|author=Eli Barnavi|title=Jewish Emancipation in Western Europe |url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Modern_History/1700-1914/Emancipation_and_Enlightenment/In_the_West.shtml|accessdate=25 September 2013|newspaper=My Jewish Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2016}} It included efforts within the community to integrate into their societies as citizens. It occurred gradually between the late 18th century and the early 20th century. Jewish emancipation followed the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the concurrent [[Haskalah|Jewish enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Shmuel Ettinger|title=Jewish Emancipation and Enlightenment|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Modern_History/1700-1914/Emancipation_and_Enlightenment.shtml|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various nations repealed or superseded previous discriminatory laws applied specifically against [[Jews]] where they resided. Before the [[Political emancipation|emancipation]], most Jews were [[Jewish ghettos in Europe|isolated]] in residential areas from the rest of the society; emancipation was a major goal of European Jews of that time, who worked within their communities to achieve [[Social integration|integration]] in the majority societies and broader education. Many became active politically and culturally within wider European [[civil society]] as Jews gained full citizenship. They emigrated to countries offering better social and economic opportunities, such as the [[Russian Empire]] and [[France]]. Some European Jews turned to [[Socialism]], others to Jewish nationalism: [[Zionism]].

==Background==
[[File:Royal decree proclaiming the emancipation of the Jews, France, 1791 - Musée d'art et d'histoire du Judaïsme.jpg|thumb|The 1791 law proclaiming the Emancipation of the Jews - [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme]]]]

Jews were subject to a wide range of restrictions throughout most of European history. Since the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215, Christian Europeans required Jews and Muslims to wear special clothing, such as the [[Judenhut]] and the [[yellow badge]] for Jews, to distinguish them from Christians. The practice of their religions was often restricted, and they had to swear special oaths (see [[Oath More Judaico]]). Jews were not allowed to vote, where vote existed, and some countries formally prohibited their entry, such as Norway, Sweden and [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]] after the expulsion in the late 15th century.

In contrast, in 1264, the Polish [[Bolesław the Pious|Prince Boleslaw the Pious]] issued the "[[Statute of Kalisz]]" – The General Charter of Jewish Liberties in Poland, an unprecedented document in medieval history of Europe that allows Jews personal freedom, legal autonomy and separate tribunal for criminal matters as well as safeguards against forced baptism and blood libel. The Charter was ratified again by subsequent Polish Kings: [[Casimir the Great]] of Poland in 1334, [[Casimir IV of Poland]] in 1453, and [[Sigismund I the Old]] of Poland in 1539. After massive expulsions of Jews from Western Europe (England, France, Germany, and Spain), they found a refuge in the lands of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. During the [[Jagiellon]] Era Poland became the home to Europe's largest Jewish population, as royal edicts warranting Jewish safety and religious freedom from the 13th century contrasted with bouts of persecution in Western Europe, especially following the [[Black Death]] of 1348–1349, blamed by some in the West on Jews themselves. Large parts of Poland suffered relatively little from the outbreak, while the Jewish immigration brought valuable manpower and skills to the rising state. The greatest increase in Jewish numbers occurred in the 18th century, when Jews came to make up 7% of the Polish population.

The rabbinate was the highest goal of many young Jewish men, and the study of the [[Torah]] (the first five books of the Bible) and the [[Talmud]] was the means to obtain the coveted position.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |History}}

Jewish involvement in gentile society began during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. [[Haskalah]], the Jewish movement supporting the adoption of enlightenment values, advocated an expansion of Jewish rights within European society. Haskalah followers advocated "coming out of the [[ghetto]]", not just physically but also mentally and spiritually.

On September 28, 1791, [[French revolution|revolutionary France]] became the second country of the world, after Poland 500 years earlier, to emancipate its Jewish population. The 40,000 Jews living in France at the time were the first to confront the opportunities and challenges offered by emancipation. The civic equality which the French Jews attained became a model for other European Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Paula E. Hyman, ''The Jews of Modern France'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Newfound opportunities began to be provided to the Jewish people, and they slowly pushed toward equality in other parts of the world. In 1796 and 1834, the Netherlands granted the Jews equal rights with gentiles. Napoleon freed the Jews in areas he conquered in Europe outside France (see [[Napoleon and the Jews]]). Greece granted equal rights to Jews in 1830. But, it was not until the revolutions of the mid-19th century that [[Jewish political movement]]s would begin to persuade governments in Great Britain, Central and Eastern Europe to grant equal rights to Jews.&lt;ref name=jvl&gt;{{cite web |title=EMANCIPATION |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0006_0_05916.html |work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emancipation movements==
The early stages of Jewish emancipation movements were part of the general progressive efforts to achieve freedom and rights for minorities. While this was a movement, it was also a pursuit for equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Judaism|last=Nicholas|first=de Lange|last2=Freud-Kandel|first2=Miri|last3=C. Dubin|first3=Lois|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=30–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the emancipation movement would be a long process.  The question of equal rights for Jews was tied to demands for constitutions and civil rights in various nations. Jewish statesmen and intellectuals, such as [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Jacoby]], [[Gabriel Riesser]], [[Berr Isaac Berr]], and [[Lionel Nathan Rothschild]], worked with the general movement toward liberty and political freedom, rather than for Jews specifically.&lt;ref name=ohio.edu/&gt;

In 1781, the Prussian civil servant [[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm|Christian Wilhelm Dohm]] published the famous script ''Über die bürgerliche Emanzipation der Juden''. Dohm disproves the antisemitic stereotypes and pleads for equal rights for Jews. Till this day, it is called the ''Bible of Jewish emancipation''.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger: Europa im Jahrhundert der Aufklärung. Stuttgart: Reclam, 2006 (2nd edition), 268.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the face of persistent [[anti-Jewish]] incidents and [[Blood libel against Jews|blood libels]], such as the [[Damascus affair]] of 1840, and the failure of many states to emancipate the Jews, Jewish organizations formed to push for the emancipation and protection of their people. The [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] under [[Moses Montefiore]], the [[Central Consistory]] in Paris, and the ''[[Alliance Israelite Universelle]]'' all began working to assure the freedom of Jews.

Jewish emancipation, implemented under Napoleonic rule in French occupied and annexed states, suffered a setback in many member states of the [[German Confederation]] following the decisions of the [[Congress of Vienna]]. In the final revision of the Congress on the rights of the Jews, the emissary of the [[Bremen (state)|Free Hanseatic City of Bremen]], [[Johann Smidt]] - unauthorised and unconsented to by the other parties - altered the text from "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them '''in''' the confederal states", by replacing a single word, which entailed serious consequences, into: "The confessors of Jewish faith are preserved the rights already conceded to them '''by''' the confederal states."&lt;ref&gt;In the German original: "Es werden den Bekennern des jüdischen Glaubens die denselben '''in''' ['''von''', respectively] den einzelnen Bundesstaaten bereits eingeräumten Rechte erhalten." Cf. [[Heinrich Graetz]], ''Geschichte der Juden von den ältesten Zeiten bis auf die Gegenwart'': 11 vols., Leipzig: Leiner, 1900, vol. 11: 'Geschichte der Juden vom Beginn der Mendelssohnschen Zeit (1750) bis in die neueste Zeit (1848)', p. 317. Emphasis not in the original. Reprint of the edition  revised by the author: Berlin: Arani, 1998, {{ISBN|3-7605-8673-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of German states used the altered text version as legal grounds to reverse the Napoleonic emancipation of Jewish citizens. The Prussian emissary [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] and the Austrian [[Klemens von Metternich]] promoted the preservation of Jewish emancipation, as maintained by their own countries, but were not successful in others.&lt;ref name="ohio.edu"&gt;Sharfman, Glenn R.,  [http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/jewemanc.htm Jewish Emancipation], in [http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/contents.htm Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Jewish emancipation was granted by the Basic Rights of the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] (Paragraph 13), which said that civil rights were not to be conditional on religious faith. But only some German states introduced the Frankfurt parliamentary decision as state law, such as Hamburg; other states were reluctant. Important German states, such as [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (1812), [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]] (1828), [[Electorate of Hesse]] (1833), and [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] (1842), had already emancipated their Jews as citizens. By doing so, they hoped to educate the gentiles, and terminate laws which sought to oppress the Jews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although the movement was mostly successful; some early emancipated Jewish communities continued to suffer persisting or new ''de facto'', though not legal, discrimination against those Jews trying to achieve careers in public service and education. Those few states that had refrained from Jewish emancipation were forced to do so by an act of the [[North German Federation]] on 3 July 1869, or when they acceded to the newly [[German Empire|united Germany]] in 1871. The emancipation of all Jewish Germans was reversed by [[Nazi Germany]] from 1933 through [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;

==Dates of emancipation==
In some countries, emancipation came with a single act. In others, limited rights were granted first in the hope of "changing" the Jews "for the better."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/beyond-the-pale/eng_captions/21-5.html |title=THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN ANTI-SEMITISM: images pg.21 |publisher=Friends-partners.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==

===The emancipation and the practice of Judaism===
{{editorial|date=September 2016}}The emancipation disrupted the relationship the Jews had with their religion, which could not govern any longer all the actions in their lives. Many considered a practice of Judaism more closely to the lifestyle of their non-Jewish fellow citizens. The emancipation in France, Italy, Germany, at least during the Empire, permitted many Jews to leave the ghettos and contribute, as a result of the [[Haskalah]], to the development of [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] during the 19th century. The emancipation contributed moreover to the assimilation of Jews and sometimes to their cultural disappearance when Jews merged through marriage in the surrounding society. It was not until Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] defined a modern vision of orthodox Judaism, enabling orthodox Jews to participate fully in a society.&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2016|reason=SR Hirsch's movement is not discussed in source}}{{ clarify | date = January 2016 | reason =sentence is a grammatical fragment, thought incomplete }} Ultimately, emancipation immersed the Jews into a new culture. In doing so, Jews were able to not only see themselves as members of a religious sect, but also as citizens within society. At the same time, however, some {{who|date=September 2016}} were concerned that leaders within the Jewish movement were seeking to position Judaism with an approach catered toward a new Western civilization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Judaism|last=C.

'''Land and Liberty''' ({{lang-es|"Tierra y Libertad"}}, {{lang-ru|Zemlya i Volya}}) is an [[anarchist]] slogan. It was originally used as a name of the Russian revolutionary organization [[Land and Liberty (Russia)|Zemlya i Volya]] in 1878, then by the revolutionary leaders of the [[Mexican Revolution]]; the revolution was fought over land rights, and the leaders such as [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] were fighting to give the land back to the natives from whom it was expropriated either by force or by some dubious manner. Without land, the peasants were at the mercy of landowners for subsistence.

Similarly, during the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the main concern of the peasants was to free themselves from subservience to landowners, to get a plot of land if they had none, or to expand on their land holdings. Consequently, the Russian peasants welcomed the Russian Revolution under the banner "Zemlya i Volya": "Land and Liberty".

The slogan of "Tierra y Libertad" was also used during the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] (1936–1939). In 1995, a film covering the [[Spanish Civil War]] was released with the title ''[[Land and Freedom]]''.

== Meaning ==

In a narrow sense, the possession of land meant freedom from the landowner. And this may have been the main concern of both the Mexican and Russian peasants.

In a broader sense, the slogan can be interpreted to mean that the necessary (though not the sufficient) condition of liberty is something like possession or access to subsistence land. If possession or access to land is a necessary condition of liberty, then its deprivation results in some form of slavery: [[tenancy]], [[sharecropping]], [[wage-slavery]]. Access to land is only a necessary condition because even with access, the government may impose taxes to such an extent that one is not free. For example, in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1932–1933, the government was removing from the peasants their agricultural products to the extant that it produced an artificial{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} famine which directly or indirectly killed roughly 2.582 million&lt;ref name="Vallin2"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jacques Vallin |author2=France Mesle |author3=Serguei Adamets |author4=Serhii Pyrozhkov  | doi=10.1080/00324720215934 |title=A New Estimate of Ukrainian Population Losses during the Crises of the 1930s and 1940s |journal=[[Population Studies]] |volume=56 |issue=3 |date=November 2002 |pages=249–264 |jstor=3092980 |pmid=12553326}}&lt;/ref&gt; people only in [[Ukraine]]. (See [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]].) So, the possession of or access to subsistence land is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition for liberty.

In the following passage, [[Friedrich Albert Lange]] points out the relation of the possession of land to liberty:
"In former times the marauding minority of mankind, by means of physical violence, compelled the working majority to render feudal services, or reduced them to a state of slavery or serfdom, or at least made them pay a tribute. Nowadays the dependence of the working classes is secured in a less direct but equally efficacious manner, viz. by means of the superior power of capital; the labourer being forced, in order to get his subsistence, to place his labour power entirely at the disposal of the capitalist. So there is a semblance of liberty; but in reality the labourer is exploited and subjected, because, all the land having been appropriated, he cannot procure his subsistence directly from nature, and, goods being produced for the market and not for the producer's own use, he cannot subsist without capital. Wages will rise above what is wanted for the necessaries of life, where the labourer is able to earn his subsistence on free land, which has not yet become private property. But wherever, in an old and totally occupied country, a body of labouring poor is employed in manufactures, the same law, which we see at work in the struggle for life throughout the organized world, will keep wages at the absolute minimum".&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Albert Lange]], ''Die Arbeiterfrage. Ihre Bedeutung für Gegenwart und Zukunft''. Vierte Auflage. 1861, pp.&amp;nbsp;12, 13. Quoted by H. J. Nieboer, [http://www.ditext.com/nieboer/title.html ''Slavery: As an Industrial System''] (Ethnological Researches), 2nd edition, 1909, p.&amp;nbsp;421.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appropriation as title ==
''Land and Liberty'' is the title of a publication produced in Britain by the supporters of the land value taxation programme described by Henry George in his book ''Progress and Poverty''. The journal was first published towards the end of the nineteenth century, originally under the name "Land Values". It was given its present title just before World War I. At present, the journal is quarterly. Articles are mostly about economics and political topics, with special reference to their relationship to land tenure and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;An almost-complete archive of Land Values and ''Land and Liberty'' is held at the library of [http://www.schooleconomicscience.org The School of Economic Science] in Mandeville Place, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[Mark J. Green]] coined the exact phrase in a 1974 article discussing the [[utility company]], [[Con Ed]].&lt;ref name=green74/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document|title=Lemon credit|last=Krugman|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Krugman|date=2 February 2009|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/lemon-credit/|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentiment was earlier expressed in the adage "[[Socialism for the rich and capitalism for the poor]]", which was in use by the 1960s, though the notion of privatizing profits and socializing losses dates at least to 1834 and [[Andrew Jackson]]'s closing of the [[Second Bank of the United States]].

== Other languages ==
{{expand section|date=December 2009}}
In [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], lemon socialism is known as "[[:is:Sósíalismi andskotans|Sósíalismi andskotans]]", meaning "the devil's socialism", a term coined by [[Vilmundur Jónsson]] (1889–1971, Iceland's Surgeon General) in the 1930s to criticize alleged [[crony capitalism]] in [[Landsbanki]], which term has gained renewed currency in the debate over the [[2008–2012 Icelandic financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.hi.is/~gylfason/Oslo%20financial%20crisis%202009.ppt |title=Icelandic banks 2008 in context|author=[http://www3.hi.is/~gylfason/inenglish.htm Thorvaldur Gylfason], grandson of Vilmundur Jónsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lemon socialism, or more precisely crony capitalism, is also referred to as [[:is:Pilsfaldakapítalismi|Pilsfaldakapítalismi]], meaning "skirt capitalism", ''pilsfaldur'' being the hemline of the skirt; and the term referring to children hiding behind their mothers' skirts after having done something wrong to criticize the alleged lack of transparency in dealings and reluctance to deal with bad consequences by themselves.

In constitutional usage in [[Commonwealth realms]] and in some other systems, a '''ministry''' (usually preceded by the [[definite article]], i.e., '''the ministry''') is a collective body of [[government]] [[minister (government)|minister]]s headed by a [[prime minister]] or [[premier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Wiktionary-inline|ministry}}: &amp;nbsp;"The complete body of government ministers (whether or not they are in cabinet) under the leadership of a head of government (such as a prime minister)"&lt;/ref&gt; and also referred to as the [[head of government]]. It is described by the [[Oxford Dictionary]] as "a period of government under one prime minister".&lt;ref&gt;{{Oxford Dictionaries|Ministry|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "[[cabinet (government)|cabinet]]" can in some circumstances be a synonym, a ministry can be a broader concept which might include office-holders who do not participate in cabinet meetings. Other titles can include "administration" (in the United States) or "government" (in common usage among most parliamentary systems) to describe similar collectives.

The term is primarily used to describe the successive governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which share a common [[Westminster model|parliamentary]] political heritage.&lt;ref name="DDs23"&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Dods Parliamentary Companion]] | publisher=Dod's Parliamentary Companion Ltd | year=1919 | page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, a new ministry begins after each election, regardless of whether the prime minister is re-elected, and whether there may have been a minor rearrangement of the ministry. For example, after winning the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] (as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]) formed the [[first Thatcher ministry]]. After being re-elected at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], she formed the [[second Thatcher ministry]], and so on. In Canada, a new ministry is only formed if the government loses an election.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Despite the use of the term "ministry" in this sense being rare in Portugal nowadays, until the first half of the 20th century, the term  was frequently used in this country to designate the collective body of government ministers. From 1911 to 1933, the official title of the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]] was even that of "President of the Ministry" ({{lang-pt|Presidente do Ministério}}), reflecting his role as the head of the collective ministry.

Writing for ''[[Politico]]'', Michael Hirsh described new nationalism as "a bitter [[Populism|populist]] rejection of the status quo that global elites have imposed on the international system since the [[Cold War]] ended, and which lower-income voters have decided—understandably—is unfair."&lt;ref name="Hirsh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldberg"/&gt; Michael Brendan Dougherty wrote in ''[[The Week]]'' that new nationalism is a "broad [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] revolt" against post-Cold War politics long "characterized by an orthodoxy of [[free trade]], nurturing the [[service economy]], [[neoliberal]] trading arrangements, and liberalized immigration policies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dougherty|first1=Michael Brendan|title=A new nationalism is rising.

Writing for ''The Week'', Damon Linker called the idea of neo-nationalism being racist "nonsense" and went on to say that "the tendency of progressives to describe it as nothing but 'racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia'—is the desire to delegitimize any particularistic attachment or form of solidarity, be it national, linguistic, religious, territorial, or ethnic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/649886/liberals-keep-denigrating-new-nationalism-racist-nonsense|title=Liberals keep denigrating the new nationalism as racist.

Regarding new nationalism, ''The Economist'' said that "Mr Trump needs to realise that his policies will unfold in the context of other countries’ jealous nationalism," and called nationalism itself a "slippery concept" that is "easy to manipulate".

The non-Zionists were willing to offer the fledgeling Jewish homeland fiscal and diplomatic counsel, not for their own benefit or spiritual comfort but for those Jews who chose to reside there."&lt;ref name = "Feldman"&gt;Egal Feldman, ''Catholics and Jews in Twentieth-Century America'', University of Illinois Press, 2001, p.40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference from anti-Zionists==
"There is a marked difference between non-Zionism and [[anti-Zionism]]. A non-Zionist may challenge the theoretical underpinning of the concept of an 'ingathering of the exiles' in an independent [[Jewish State]]. If Jewish, he will not choose to live in [[Israel]], nor will he approve of the notion of other Jews living there (...) but anti-Zionists do not find it sufficient to be dissatisfied with a decision made and implemented a long time ago. They are not content with a critical assessment of the situation confined to an historical (and, accordingly, a theoretical) framework. Not merely do they have an adverse opinion about the establishment of Israel in the past, but they contest the legitimacy of Israel as a State in the present time and the future."&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoram Dinstein]], ''Anti-Semitism, Anti-Zionism and the United Nations'' in ''Israel's Yearbook of Human Rights'', Faculty of Law, Tel-Aviv University, vol.17, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1987, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary definitions==

===Non-position===
Non-Zionism has also been defined in terms of a non-position on Zionism.  For example, Anthony Frosh on online Jewish magazine Galus Australis, has defined a non-Zionist Jews as a Jew "who does not have any particular political relationship (positive or negative) with the State of Israel, or at least little more of a relationship than they would have with some other 3rd party state."[http://galusaustralis.com/2009/08/non-zionism-an-under-recognised-non-position/]

=== Haredi non-Zionism===
Generally, those groups of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] (Western) [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews who participate in the Israeli government but do not believe in the religious ideology of Zionism are known as "non-Zionists".  The most prominent non-Zionist Haredi group is [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]]. This is in contrast to the [[Religious Zionism|religious Zionist]] [[Mizrachi (political party)|Mizrachi party]] (which believes the State of Israel to be the beginning of the redemption); and also in contrast to the anti-Zionist Haredi groups, such as Satmar and the Edah Charedis that openly oppose Zionism and have little to no interaction with the State of Israel, and no representation in government. Unlike the older definition, many live in the State of Israel. They tend to be extremely pro-Israel politically, as can be seen in such publications as [[Mishpacha]] and [[Hamodia]]. [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] Haredi Jews may refer to themselves as Zionist.

{{voting}}
"'''None of the above'''", or '''NOTA''' for short, also known as "'''against all'''" or a "'''scratch'''" vote, is a [[ballot]] option in some [[jurisdiction]]s or [[organization]]s, designed to allow the voter to indicate disapproval of the candidates in a [[voting system]]. It is based on the principle that [[consent]] requires the ability to withhold consent in an election, just as they can by voting "No" on [[referendum|ballot questions]].

Entities that include "None of the Above" on ballots as standard procedure include [[India]] ("None of the above"), [[Greece]] (λευκό, white), the [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]] ([[None of These Candidates]]), [[Ukraine]] (''Проти всіх'','' "against all"''), [[Spain]] (''voto en blanco'', "white vote"), and [[Colombia]] (''voto en blanco''). [[Russia]] had such an option on its ballots (''Против всех,'' "against all") until it was abolished in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/12773 |title=Russians Divided Over Electoral Reforms: Angus Reid Global Monitor |publisher=Angus-reid.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906002157/http://www.angus-reid.com/polls/index.cfm/fuseaction/viewItem/itemID/12773|archivedate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bangladesh]] introduced this option (''না ভোট''&lt;!---This needs an English translation---&gt;) in 2008.&lt;ref name=bd&gt;{{cite news|title=Bangladesh amends election law incorporating 'no' vote option|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-07-14/rest-of-world/27918086_1_general-elections-votes-amendment|accessdate=26 September 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=Jul 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan introduced this option on ballot papers for the [[Pakistani general election, 2013|2013 Pakistan elections]], but the [[Election Commission of Pakistan]] later rejected it.&lt;ref name="tribune"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/530557/none-of-the-above-vote-to-be-added-to-ballots-ecp/ |title='None of the above' vote to be added to ballots: ECP - The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the [[Bulgarian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], [[Bulgaria]] introduced a 'none of the above' option, which received 5.59% of the vote in the first round and 4.47% in the run-off.

When "None of the Above" is listed on a ballot, there is the possibility of NOTA receiving a [[majority]] or [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the vote, and so "winning" the election. In such a case, a variety of formal procedures may be invoked, including having the office remain vacant, having the office filled by appointment, re-opening [[nomination]]s or holding another election (in a body operating under [[parliamentary procedure]]), or it may have no effect whatsoever, as in India and the US state of Nevada, where the next highest total wins regardless.

==Soviet Union==
In the 1990 elections that led to the [[break-up of the Soviet Union]], the Soviet version of "none of above" led to new elections with new candidates in 200 races of the 1,500-seat [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies]].&lt;ref name=JFund /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arunachaltimes.in/wordpress/2013/10/09/nota-voting/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923174514/http://www.arunachaltimes.in/wordpress/2013/10/09/nota-voting/ |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 100 incumbents representing the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] were defeated in the run-off, leading to [[Boris Yeltsin]] to later say the "none of the above" option "helped convince the people they had real power even in a rigged election, and [it] played a role in building true democracy."&lt;ref name=JFund /&gt;

==Spain==

===Blank ballot===
Due to the Spanish voting regulations (''[[:es:Legislación electoral española|legislación electoral española]]''), {{es icon}} the blank ballot is recognized as 'none of the above' (''voto en blanco'') but has very little chance to influence the distribution of seats within a democratic election. It is mostly considered as a statistical indicator of candidatures' disapproval. The blank ballots only increase the amount of valid votes, raising the threshold of votes (3% and 5% depending on the election) which every political party has to overcome to be fully considered. The parties over the threshold get their seats according to the [[D'Hondt method]].

===Blank seats (''Escaños en blanco'')===
Since 1999, several political parties&lt;ref&gt;[https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico/partido_politicoDatos.html?nmformacion=2244] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico/partido_politicoDatos.html?nmformacion=2403] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico.html;jsessionid=FF84718865B5919798D2C716A220398B|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121218100841/https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico.html;jsessionid=FF84718865B5919798D2C716A220398B|deadurl=yes|title=Registro de Partidos Políticos|author=|date=18 December 2012|archivedate=18 December 2012|website=MIR.es|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico.html;jsessionid=0523926EC252D8B19A3526ACD78D64B5|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121218045639/https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico.html;jsessionid=0523926EC252D8B19A3526ACD78D64B5|deadurl=yes|title=Registro de Partidos Políticos|author=|date=18 December 2012|archivedate=18 December 2012|website=MIR.es|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121019030317/https://servicio.mir.es/nfrontal/webpartido_politico.html|title=Registro de Partidos Políticos|first=Ministerio del|last=Interior|website=webarchive.loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; have arisen in order to make visible the 'none of the above' option in the parliaments and force empty seats. "Blank Seats" ran for the Congress and Senate elections of 20 November 2011. Its programme is to leave empty the corresponding assigned seats by not taking full possession of their duties as congressperson, senator, etc. According to law, the seat remains assigned to the elected candidate until the possession act takes place, the elected candidate explicitly refuses or new elections are called. In this way, the political party and its candidates stay free from obligations and are not entitled to receive any money from the public funding scheme for politics.

By voting such option at the local elections in May 2011, the citizens of the villages of Gironella (Barcelona) and Foixà (Girona) were able to reduce the number of politicians in their councils by one and two respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europapress.es/catalunya/noticia-escons-blanc-dejara-tres-concejalias-vacias-catalunya-20110608174059.html |title=Escons en Blanc dejará tres concejalías vacías en Catalunya |language=es |website=Europapress.es |date=2011-06-08 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Empar Moliner |url=http://www.ara.cat/especials/eleccions22m/Escons-Blanc-aconsegueix-consistoris-catalans_0_486551938.html |title=Escons en Blanc aconsegueix que tres cadires quedin buides als consistoris catalans |website=Ara.cat |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, citizenship supported Blank Seats at different municipalities, including Barcelona, with 15,582 votes (averaging 1.71% of valid votes).

The [[Ciudadanos En Blanco]] (Citizens for Blank Votes) party aims to give blank ballots the meaning of representing empty seats if the votes indicate so as for any other party, disbanding the party when such law would be approved.

==United States==
The origins of the ballot option "None of the Above" in the United States can be traced to when the State of Nevada adopted "[[None of These Candidates]]" as a ballot option in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/none-of-the-above-ballot_n_3576469.html|title='None Of The Above' Ballot Option In Nevada Upheld By Federal Appeals Court|date=2015-11-25|access-date=2016-08-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125044018/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/none-of-the-above-ballot_n_3576469.html |archivedate=25 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1998 in California, citizen proponents of Proposition 23, titled the "None of the Above Act", qualified a new State ballot initiative through circulated petitions submitted to the Secretary of State,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=None of the Above Act|url=http://repository.uchastings.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1945&amp;context=ca_ballot_inits|website=University of California, Hastings|publisher=UC Hastings|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the measure was defeated in the March 2000 general election 64% to 36%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposition 23 election results|url=https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_23,_the_%22None_of_the_Above%22_Act_(2000)|website=BallotPedia|accessdate=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Were it to be passed by the voters, it was meant to require this new ballot option for all state and federal elective offices, exempting only local judicial races; in determining official election results, the "none of the above" voter tally would be discarded in favor of the candidate with the greatest number of votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/initiatives-by-title-and-summary-year.pdf |format=PDF |title=INITIATIVES BY TITLE AND SUMMARY YEAR |website=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2016-05-07 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907193230/http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ballot-measures/pdf/initiatives-by-title-and-summary-year.pdf |archivedate=7 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No similar options were known to have been permitted, much less approved, on any other state levels, least of all the federal level, as of the middle of August 2016.

The [[Election Commission of India]] told the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] in 2009 that it wished to offer the voter a "none of the above" option on ballots, which the government had generally opposed.&lt;ref name=ibn&gt;{{cite web |last=Bagriya |first=Ashok |title=EC suggests 'none of the above' option on the ballot |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/indiaelections/2009/04/2009418114915169787.html |publisher=IBN Live |date= 29 January 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]], a [[non-governmental organisation]], filed a [[public-interest litigation (India)|public-interest litigation]] statement in support of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sorabjee|first=Soli J.|title=Right of negative voting|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/right-of-negative-voting/429335/|accessdate=27 September 2013|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indonesian Law 10 of 2016 regulates local elections, and includes provisions for elections in which there is only one candidate. In such cases, the candidate contests the election against a NOTA option (commonly referred to as ''kotak kosong''/empty box), and is declared the winner if they manage to secure a majority of the valid votes. Otherwise, the election will be postponed to the next occurrence; the government of Indonesia appoints an acting office holder until the new election, in which the losing candidate is eligible to stand again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UU Nomor 10 Tahun 2016|url=http://www.mahkamahkonstitusi.go.id/public/content/jdih/UU_Nomor_10_Tahun_2016.pdf|publisher=Constitutional Court of Indonesia|accessdate=4 May 2018|page=26|language=id|quote=KPU Provinsi atau KPU Kabupaten/Kota menetapkan pasangan calon terpilih pada Pemilihan 1 (satu) pasangan calon sebagaimana dimaksud dalam Pasal 54C, jika mendapatkan suara lebih dari 50% (lima puluh persen) dari suara sah.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK electoral counting procedures require that all votes be counted and announced, including 'rejected' votes. 'Rejected votes' are classified into four categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Electoral Commission guide on 'Dealing with doubtful ballot papers'|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/87699/UKPE-doubtfuls-booklet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; protest votes are recorded with others rejected as 'voter's intention uncertain'.

===NOTA UK===
NOTA UK is a voluntary organisation set up in 2010 to campaign for a formal None Of The Above (NOTA) option to be added to ballot papers for all future UK elections. It has made numerous written evidence submissions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/political-and-constitutional-reform-committee/consultation-on-a-new-magna-carta/written/15588.html |title=Written evidence submitted by NOTA UK (AMC 49) |website=Data.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the parliamentary Political &amp; Constitutional Reform Committee (PCRC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/political-and-constitutional-reform-committee/inquiries/ |title=Political and Constitutional Reform Committee - Inquiries - UK Parliament |website=Parliament.uk |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the case for NOTA 'with teeth' i.e.: formalised consequences for the election result in the event of a NOTA 'win' (as opposed to 'faux' NOTA, whereby the next placed candidate takes office anyway as happens in India and elsewhere). As a result of these representations, the PCRC explicitly recommended in its final report on 'voter engagement', published February 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nota-uk.org/2015/02/05/the-nota-campaign-gets-a-massive-boost-from-parliamentary-select-committee |title=NOTA campaign gets massive boost from parliamentary select committee! &amp;#124; None of the Above UK |website=Nota-uk.org |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the next UK government should hold a public consultation before May 2016 solely on inclusion of NOTA on UK ballot papers. This in turn has led to increased support for and awareness of NOTA UK's campaign and its founder, recording artist and music producer [[Jamie Stanley]] (aka: Mailman), being asked to give a number of media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdiG9tCq-BU |title=None of the above campaign is 'essential to the concept of democracy' - Jamie Stanley |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-02-16 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; No public consultation materialised as the incoming Conservative government scrapped the PCRC, effectively disregarding all of its recommendations.

Since 2015, in part thanks to NOTA UK's lobbying, it has been a Green Party of England and Wales policy to get a form of NOTA (RON - Re-Open Nominations) on UK ballot papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nota-uk.org/2015/11/24/getting-nota-ron-on-all-uk-ballot-papers-now-official-green-party-policy/|title=Getting NOTA on UK ballot papers now official Green Party policy!|author=|date=24 November 2015|website=NOTA-UK.org|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to the 2017 UK general election, NOTA UK wrote to the Green party suggesting that they should reword the policy so that, instead of RON, it refers specifically to the more self-explanatory NOTA, and that they should also place the policy centre stage in their next manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nota-uk.org/2017/04/29/open-letter-to-the-green-party-re-ge-2017/|title=Open Letter to the Green Party re: GE 2017|author=|date=29 April 2017|website=NOTA-UK.org|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Above and Beyond===
[[File:Above and Beyond Party logo.jpg|thumb|right|The party's logo]]
The '''Above and Beyond Party''' was founded in 2015 and fielded eight candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], none of whom were elected. Their sole stated policy was to introduce a "none of the above" option on all UK ballot papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How we intend to force none of the above on to all ballot papers |url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/manifestolong-term-strategy.html |publisher=Above and Beyond Party |accessdate=24 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330030914/http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/manifestolong-term-strategy.html |archivedate=30 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why we must change our political system|url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/why-politics-must-change.html|publisher=Above &amp; Beyond|access-date=19 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151226135840/http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/why-politics-must-change.html|archivedate=26 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party's logo is based on the West African [[Adinkra symbol]] "Aya", "derived from a fern tree which famously grows in difficult-to-survive places", and a symbol of resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About our party logo|url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/about-our-party-logo.html|publisher=Above and Beyond Party|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics pointed out that their website and Facebook page at the time indicated that they had policy ideas and a political agenda beyond the single issue of NOTA and appeared to be jumping on the bandwagon of other NOTA campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nota-uk.org/2014/12/10/open-letter-to-mark-flanagan-notavote-the-nota-party-the-above-beyond-party/|title=Open Letter to Mark Flanagan (Notavote / The NOTA Party / The Above &amp; Beyond Party)|author=|date=10 December 2014|website=NOTA-UK.org|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inception and officers====
The party registered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] on 18 March 2015. The Electoral Commission listed the party leader, nominating officer and campaigns officer as Mark Flanagan and the treasurer was Karen Stanley.&lt;ref name="PP2551"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP2551|title=Registration Summary: The Above and Beyond Party|date=|website=|publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party chairman was Michael Ross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=View from the Chair|url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/view-from-the-chair|publisher=Above and Beyond Party|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was de-registered by the Electoral Commission on 3 November 2016.&lt;ref name="PP2551" /&gt;

====Electoral history====
Above and Beyond fielded four candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]]. The candidates stood in [[Clwyd West (UK Parliament constituency)|Clwyd West]], [[Cheadle (UK Parliament constituency)|Cheadle]], [[Sheffield Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Central]] and [[Leeds North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds North West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our eight target seats|url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/our-eight-target-seats.html|publisher=Above and Beyond Party|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sheffield Hallam (UK Parliament constituency)|Sheffield Hallam]] the party endorsed Carlton Reeve, an independent candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our 2015 General Election candidates |url=http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/our-candidates-so-far.html |publisher=Above and Beyond Party |accessdate=24 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222180418/http://www.voteaboveandbeyond.org/our-candidates-so-far.html |archivedate=22 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sheffield election candidate to be one of youngest|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/sheffield-election-candidate-to-be-one-of-youngest-1-7100855|accessdate=24 March 2015|work=[[Sheffield Star|The Star]]|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; No Above and Beyond candidate received 5% or more of the votes cast, therefore all lost their [[deposit (politics)#United Kingdom|deposit]].

====Finance====
The party raised funds partially through "AboveBeyond" music nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenhalf|first1=Jim|title=Musicians set to bring political message to the stage|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/leisure/tamusic/11808902.Musicians_set_to_bring_political_message_to_the_stage/|accessdate=24 March 2015|work=[[Telegraph &amp; Argus]]|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===No Candidate Deserves My Vote! party===
[[No Candidate Deserves My Vote!]] was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on 23 November 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=167&amp;frmType=partydetail |work=Electoral Commission |title=No Candidate Deserves My Vote! |access-date=9 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416164111/http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=167&amp;frmType=partydetail |archivedate=16 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The No Candidate Deserves My Vote party's single objective is to introduce a bill to Parliament to have a "none of the above" option added to every local and general election ballot paper of the future. They feel this will allow the UK electorate to exercise their democratic right to vote to say that none of the parties currently represents them, which will encourage their democratic responsibility to turn out to vote. If a candidate wins an election it is the intention to stay as a [[Member of Parliament]] until the change in the law is enacted. Only then will the candidate step down and the party be disbanded.

It is the intention of the party that, if a NOTA gains the majority vote, it should cause an automatic [[by-election]], the idea being that the majority will have given a [[Vote of No Confidence]] in the candidates. If the same candidates stand under the same policies, then the electorate simply votes NOTA until the candidates change their policies to something that the electorate can vote for.

In 2010, Stephen Phillips of [[Stevenage]] ran for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|UK general election]] on behalf of No Candidate Deserves My Vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steveofstevenage.org.uk ]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323011710/http://www.steveofstevenage.org.uk/ |date=23 March 2010 }} Steve of Stevenage&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips received 327 votes, or 0.7% of the vote, placing 7th out of 9 candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/election2010/results/constituency/e43.stm |title=Election 2010 &amp;#124; Constituency &amp;#124; Stevenage |publisher=BBC News |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NOTA party===
The NOTA Party, in recent years also known as Notavote, was registered as a political party with the UK Electoral Commission on 2 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://registers.electoralcommission.org.uk/regulatory-issues/regpoliticalparties.cfm?frmGB=1&amp;frmPartyID=867&amp;frmType=partydetail |work=Electoral Commission |title=NOTA |accessdate=2009-07-08 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the intention of the NOTA party to field candidates in every UK parliamentary constituency. The respective NOTA candidates would not have continued in office had they received the most votes, this was merely a mechanism to simulate the recording of a formal NOTA vote. The party was registered as 'NOTA' and not 'None of the Above' as the latter is a prohibited expression regarding registration as a party name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/147/made |title=Registration of Political Parties (Prohibited Words and Expressions) (Amendment) Order 2005 |website=Legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent attempt to re-register the NOTA party in 2014 was blocked by the Electoral Commission&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://notauk.org/2014/11/08/nota-banned-as-party-name-by-electoral-commission/ |title='NOTA' banned as party name by Electoral Commission &amp;#124; None of the Above UK |website=Notauk.org |date=2014-11-08 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that the acronym 'NOTA' is as good as the phrase 'None of the Above', the logic being that it would confuse voters into thinking it is possible to cast a formal vote for 'None of the Above' when they would in fact just be voting for another party, albeit one standing on a single issue NOTA platform.

===Zero, None Of the Above===
None Of The Above Zero was a candidate at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]] in [[Filton and Bradley Stoke (UK Parliament constituency)|Filton and Bradley Stoke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|British parliamentary elections of 2010]], a former boxer changed his name by [[deed poll]] from [[Terry Marsh (boxer)|Terry Marsh]] to "None Of The Above X", in order to run as a parliamentary candidate under that name in the constituency of [[South Basildon and East Thurrock (UK Parliament constituency)|South Basildon and East Thurrock]]. Claiming that he will not take the seat if he wins, he told BBC Essex: "I don't take it for one moment that it would be a vote for me. [..] I'm doing what I think the Electoral Commission should be doing and what should be on every ballot paper in any electoral process." BBC News reported that, while the Registration of Political Parties (Prohibited Words and Expressions) (Amendment) Order 2005 stipulates that no political party can be registered in the UK under the name "None of the Above", there is no legislation against a person changing their name by deed poll and appearing on the ballot paper as "None Of the Above".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/essex/8639348.stm Basildon boxer to fight election as 'None Of The Above'], BBC News, (27 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In the event he polled 0.3% of the vote, the lowest of any candidate standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/election2010/results/constituency/e08.stm |work=BBC News |title=BBC NEWS – Election 2010 – Basildon South &amp; Thurrock East}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
No electoral jurisdiction in Canada formally lists "none of the above" as a ballot option. However, in some provincial elections it is effectively possible to vote for "none of the above", by attending the polling station and formally "declining to vote".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arpacanada.ca/index.php/issuesresearch/canadian-politics/111-voting-for-none-of-the-above |title=Voting for none of the above |publisher=Arpacanada.ca |date=2007-11-08 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; These declined votes are actually counted and become part of the electoral record.

He came sixth of seven candidates with 0.977 percent of votes cast.

A resident of [[Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], formerly known as Sheldon Bergson, has legally changed his name to "Above Znoneofthe",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/vote-none-of-the-above-byelection-1.3426783 "Voters can pick 'none of the above' thanks to this Whitby-Oshawa byelection candidate"]. [[CBC News]] Toronto, January 29, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and has registered under that name as a candidate in several provincial and federal [[by-election]]s, most recently the [[By-elections to the 42nd Canadian Parliament#Markham.E2.80.94Thornhill|Markham—Thornhill]] by-election of March 3, 2017. His name order was chosen so that his name would always appear at the bottom of the ballot as "Znoneofthe, Above", although this only works federally as provincial election ballots do not list the candidates in surname order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/canadian-politics/meet-above-znoneofthe-the-fringe-candidate-who-keeps-running-in-ontario-by-elections "Meet Above Znoneofthe, the fringe candidate who keeps running in Ontario by-elections"]. ''[[National Post]]'', November 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ontario, the [[None of the Above Party of Ontario]] is a registered political party, although its stated mandate is for its candidates to serve in the legislature as [[independent (politics)|independent]] representatives who reflect the views and interests of their constituents, rather than simply as a "reject all of the candidates" placeholder.

==Norway==
The Norwegian election regulation makes it mandatory to present voters with blank ballots in addition to all of the approved parties and election lists. In the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2013|parliamentary election of 2013]], 12874 votes, which is 0.45% of the total votes given, were blank.

* In [[Serbia]], None of the above (Ниједан од понуђених одговора, НОПО) is a parliamentary political party, legally formed in 2010, which was mostly popularized on [[Facebook]] and less on other social networking websites. In [[Serbian parliamentary election, 2012]] they received 22,905 votes, and thus won one seat in the [[National Assembly of Serbia]].
* Geoff Richardson changed his full name to "Of The Above None" and stood as an independent for the seat of [[Division of Gilmore|Gilmore]] at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 Australian federal election]].

* In [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010]], a candidate Vasiliy Humeniuk changed his name to [[Vasily Protyvsih]] (Vasily Against-all).

* For the [[Pakistani general election, 2013|2013 Pakistani general election]], the [[Election Commission of Pakistan]] unilaterally decided that a 'none of the above' box would be available as a voting option on ballot papers.&lt;ref name="tribune" /&gt; However, they subsequently decided against it owing to the short amount of time remaining till the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/531463/ecp-decides-against-introducing-none-of-the-above-vote/ |title=ECP decides against introducing 'none of the above' vote - The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date=2013-04-05 |accessdate=2016-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was suggested to the Election Commission by Abid Hassan Manto, a constitutional expert and a senior lawyer of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Effective legislation proposed to ensure transparency in general elections|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/498106/effective-legislation-proposed-to-ensure-transparency-in-general-elections/|accessdate=23 January 2013|newspaper=Express Tribune|date=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Elections in South Ossetia]] have an "against all" option.

==Procedures that function like "none of the above"==
Most ballots do not have a formal "none of the above" option, but do have procedures that work in a similar way.

=== Argentina ===

In Argentina casting an envelope without a ballot in a [[ballot box]] counts as a blank vote.

===Poland===
In [[Polish legislative election, 1989|1989 legislative election in Poland]] voters were able to vote against the only candidate running, often from the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party]] by crossing out the candidate's name on the ballot.&lt;ref name=JFund&gt;{{cite news|last=Fund|first=John|title='None of the Above' Should Be on the Ballot|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/316376/none-above-should-be-ballot-john-fund|accessdate=12 September 2012|newspaper=National Review|date=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, voters defeated the sitting prime minister and dozens of leading Communists because they failed to get the required majority.&lt;ref name=JFund /&gt;

These include the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[University College Dublin Students' Union|UCD Student's Union]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. The difference is that RON is a vote against all candidates in FPTP ([[plurality voting system|first-past-the-post]]) and all subsequent candidates in an IRV or STV election.


RON is not strictly a '''none of the above''' candidate in transferable vote elections, as when RON is eliminated during the count its votes are transferred to other candidates if those preferences exist.

===Illegal ballots in ''Robert's Rules of Order''===
The American ''[[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order, Newly Revised (RONR)]]'' describes various forms of illegal ballots, which are ballots which do not count for any candidate. Blanks are treated as "scrap paper", and are of no effect, but "unintelligible ballots or ballots cast for an unidentifiable candidate or a fictional character are treated as illegal votes. All illegal votes cast by legal voters… are taken into account in determining the number of votes cast for purposes of computing the majority." RONR always requires a majority for election; thus, casting an illegal ballot or one for a hopeless candidate, whether on the ballot or as a write-in, is equivalent to voting No for all other candidates. "The principle is that a choice has no mandate from the voting body unless approval is expressed by more than half of those entitled to vote and registering any evidence of having some opinion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl |title= RONR|edition= 11th|year= 2011|pages= 415-416}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.robertsrules.com/interp_list.html#2006_5 |title= RONR Official Interpretations: 2006-5: Ballot Elections: Voting "No" or "None of the Above" |date= |access-date= |website= The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site |publisher= The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the film ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]],'' the protagonist Brewster (played by [[Richard Pryor]]) is required, under certain conditions, to spend 30 million dollars in 30 days. He joins the race for Mayor of [[New York City]] and throws most of his money at a protest campaign urging a vote for None of the Above. The two major candidates sue Brewster for his confrontational rhetoric, leading to a massive settlement which of course furthers their competitor's goal. Brewster is forced to end his campaign when he learns that he is leading in the polls as a write-in candidate and has to publicly announce that he if he won the mayoralty he wants to decline it but is surprised his "None of the Above" campaign became so popular. Neither candidate wins the election, and a new election with different candidates must be held.

'''Platformism''' is a tendency (or organized [[school of thought]]) within the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement. It stresses the need for tightly organized anarchist organizations that are able to influence working class and peasant movements.

"Platformist" groups reject the model of [[Leninism|Leninist]] [[vanguardism]]. They instead aim to "make anarchist ideas the leading ideas within the [[class struggle]]".&lt;ref name="WSM"&gt;Workers Solidarity Movement, 2012, [http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/once/join.html "Why You Should Join the Workers Solidarity Movement"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103053447/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/once/join.html# |date=2017-01-03 }}. Accessed 5 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to platformists, the four main principles by which an anarchist organisation should operate, are ideological unity, tactical unity, [[Collective action|collective responsibility]] and [[federalism]].

==Overview==
In general, platformist groups aim to win the widest possible influence for anarchist ideas and methods in the working class and peasantry&amp;mdash;like [[especifismo]] groups, platformists orient towards the working class, rather than to the [[far-left]]. This usually entails a willingness to work in single-issue campaigns, trade unionism and community groups; and to fight for immediate reforms while linking this to a project of building popular consciousness and organisation. They therefore reject approaches that they believe will prevent this, such as [[insurrectionary anarchism]], as well as "views that dismiss activity in the unions" or that dismiss anti-imperialist movements.&lt;ref name="Anarkismo statement"&gt;Anarkismo, 2012, [http://www.anarkismo.net/about_us "About Us"]. Accessed 5 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "platformist" derives from the 1926 ''Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)''.&lt;ref name=Platformtext&gt;{{cite book |last=''Dielo Truda'' group |authorlink=Dielo Truda |title=Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) |origyear=1926 |url=http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/newplatform/organizational.htm |accessdate=5 January 2012 |year=2006 |publisher=Nestor Makhno Archive |location=Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was published by the Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad, in their journal ''[[Dielo Truda]]'' ("Workers' Cause" in Russian). The group, which consisted of exiled [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchist]] veterans of the 1917 [[October Revolution]] (notably [[Nestor Makhno]] who played a leading role in the anarchist revolution in Ukraine of 1918&amp;ndash;1921),  based the ''Platform'' on their experiences of the revolution and the eventual victory of the [[Bolsheviks]] over the anarchists and other groups. The ''Platform'' attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] outside Ukraine. The document drew praise and criticism from anarchists worldwide and sparked a major debate within the anarchist movement.&lt;ref name="Black Flame"&gt;Schmidt, M. and [[Lucien van der Walt|van der Walt, L.]] 2009. [[Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter-Power vol. 1)]]. Edinburgh: [[AK Press]]. pp. 252-255&lt;/ref&gt;

Today platformism is an important current in international anarchism. Around thirty platformist and especifista organisations are linked together in the Anarkismo.net project, including groups from Africa, Latin America, North America and Europe.&lt;ref name="Anarkismo statement" /&gt; At least in terms of the number of affiliated organisations (if not in actual membership in some countries),&lt;ref&gt;"In reply to the Platform, supporters of the "synthesis" counter by pointing to the fact that "Platformist" groups are usually very small, far smaller than "synthesis" federations (for example, compare the size of the French Anarchist Federation with, say, the Irish Workers Solidarity Movement or the French-language Alternative Libertaire)"[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 "J.3.2 What are "synthesis" federations?" in] [[An Anarchist FAQ]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007160139/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 |date=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Anarkismo network is larger than other anarchist international bodies, like the [[Synthesis anarchism|synthesist]]&lt;ref&gt;"Most national sections of the International Anarchist Federation (IFA) are good examples of successful federations which are heavily influenced by "synthesis" ideas (such as the French and Italian federations)." [http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 "J.3.2 What are "synthesis" federations?" in] [[An Anarchist FAQ]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007160139/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 |date=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International of Anarchist Federations]] and the [[anarcho-syndicalist]] [[International Workers' Association]]. However, it is not a formal "international" and has no intention of competing with these other formations.

==Organisational ideas==
The ''Platform'' describes four key organisational features which distinguish platformism:
* Tactical unity — "A common tactical line in the movement is of decisive importance for the existence of the organisation and the whole movement: it avoids the disastrous effect of several tactics opposing each other; it concentrates the forces of the movement; and gives them a common direction leading to a fixed objective".&lt;ref&gt;From section on Tactical Unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Theoretical unity — "Theory represents the force which directs the activity of persons and organisations along a defined path towards a determined goal. Naturally it should be common to all the persons and organisations adhering to the General Union. All activity by the General Union, both overall and in its details, should be in perfect concord with the theoretical principles professed by the union".&lt;ref&gt;From section on theoretical unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Collective Responsibility — "The practice of acting on one's personal responsibility should be decisively condemned and rejected in the ranks of the anarchist movement. The areas of revolutionary life, social and political, are above all profoundly collective by nature. Social revolutionary activity in these areas cannot be based on the personal responsibility of individual militants".&lt;ref&gt;From section on Collective responsibility in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm The Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Federalism — "Against centralism, anarchism has always professed and defended the principle of federalism, which reconciles the independence and initiative of individuals and the organisation with service to the common cause".&lt;ref&gt;All sourced from the [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/organizational.htm From section Federalism within the Organizational Section of the original document]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Platform'' argues that "[w]e have vital need of an organisation which, having attracted most of the participants in the anarchist movement, would establish a common tactical and political line for anarchism and thereby serve as a guide for the whole movement". In short, unity meant unity of ideas and actions as opposed to unity on the basis of the anarchist label.

==Publication history==
The ''Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)'' was written in 1926 by the Group of Russian Anarchists Abroad, a group of exiled Russian and Ukrainian [[anarchists in France]] who published the ''Dielo Truda'' journal. The pamphlet is an analysis of basic anarchist beliefs, a vision of an anarchist society and recommendations as to how an anarchist organisation should be structured.

==Antecedents of the ''Platform''==
The authors of the ''Platform'' insisted that its basic ideas were not new, but had a long anarchist pedigree. Platformism is not therefore a revision away from classical anarchism, or a new approach, but a "restatement" of existing positions.&lt;ref name="Black Flame"/&gt;

They cited [[Peter Kropotkin]] arguing that "the formation of an anarchist organisation in Russia, far from being prejudicial to the common revolutionary task, on the contrary it is desirable and useful to the very greatest degree" and argued that [[Mikhail Bakunin]]'s "aspirations concerning organisations, as well as his activity" in the [[First International]], "give us every right to view him as an active partisan of just such an organisation". Indeed, "practically all active anarchist militants fought against all dispersed activity, and desired an anarchist movement welded by unity of ends and means".&lt;ref&gt;From section on Tactical Unity in [http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/platform/introduction.htm The Platform]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems caused by poor translations==
The ''Platform'' used to be known in English as the ''Organisational Platform of the Libertarian Communists'', a result of its having been translated from the French edition popularized in the early 1970s. In his book ''Facing the Enemy: A history of Anarchist Organization from Proudhon to May 1968'' (p.&amp;nbsp;131), [[Alexandre Skirda]] attributes much of the controversy about the ''Platform'' to the original 1926 French translation made by its opponent [[Voline]]. Later translations to French have corrected some of the mistranslations and the latest English translation, made directly from the Russian original, reflects this.

==Other terms==
Some platformist organisations today are unhappy with the designation, often preferring to use descriptions such as "anarchist communist", "social anarchist", "libertarian communist/socialist" or even [[especifist]]. Most agree that the 1926 ''Platform'' was sorely lacking in certain areas and point out that it was a draft document, never intended to be adopted in its original form. The Italian [[Federation of Anarchist Communists]] (FdCA), for example, do not insist on the principle of "tactical unity", which according to them is impossible to achieve over a large area, preferring instead "tactical homogeneity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fdca.it/fdcaen/organization/tesi.htm FdCA positions and theoretical documents], retrieved 2 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Revolutionary Confederation of Anarcho-syndicalists by the name of. N.I. Makhno]] (RKAS), which is an international anarcho-syndicalist, platformist confederation with sections and individual members in Ukraine, Russia, Georgia, Germany, Latvia, Bulgaria and Israel

Organisations inspired by the ''Platform'' were also among the founders of the now-defunct [[International Libertarian Solidarity]] network and its successor, the Anarkismo network, which is run collaboratively by roughly 30 platformist and especifista organisations around the world.

==Criticisms==
The ''Platform'' attracted strong criticism from some sectors on the anarchist movement of the time, including some of the most influential anarchists such as [[Voline]], [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Camillo Berneri]], [[Max Nettlau]], and [[Alexander Berkman]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Gregori Maximoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3#secj34|title=Why do many anarchists oppose the "Platform"?|publisher=[[An Anarchist FAQ]]|accessdate=Aug 12, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212653/http://www.infoshop.org/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3#secj34|archivedate=2013-10-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "synthesist" alternative==
As an alternative to platformism [[Voline]] and [[Sébastien Faure]] proposed [[Synthesis anarchism|synthesist anarchist]] federations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anarkismo.net/article/15329|title=Especifismo and Synthesis/ Synthesism|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they envisioned to form under the principles of [[anarchism without adjectives]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 "J.3.2 What are "synthesis" federations?" in [[An Anarchist FAQ]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007160139/http://www.infoshop.org/page/AnarchistFAQSectionJ3 |date=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In place of the ''Platform's'' stress on tight political and organisational unity, the "synthesist" approach argued for a far looser organization that would maximise numbers i.e. a [[big tent]] approach. Platformists view such organisations as weak despite their numbers as the lack of common views means an inability to undertake common actions&amp;mdash;defeating the purpose of a common organisation.&lt;ref name="Black Flame"/&gt;

==Malatesta's shift to "agreement" with collective responsibility==
While such criticisms indicated a direct rejection of the ''Platform's'' proposals, others seem to have arisen from misunderstandings.

Notably, Malatesta initially believed that the ''Platform'' was "typically authoritarian" and "far from helping to bring about the victory of anarchist communism, to which they aspire, could only falsify the anarchist spirit and lead to consequences that go against their intentions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/platform/malatesta_project.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980416051823/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/platform/malatesta_project.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 April 1998|title=A Project of Anarchist Organisation|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after further correspondence with Makhno—and after seeing a platformist group in formation—Malatesta concluded that he was actually in agreement with the positions of the ''Platform'', but had been confused by the language they had used: &lt;blockquote&gt;But all this is perhaps only a question of words.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In my reply to Makhno I already said: "It may be that, by the term collective responsibility, you mean the agreement and solidarity that must exist among the members of an association. And if that is so, your expression would, in my opinion, amount to an improper use of language, and therefore, being only a question of words, we would be closer to understanding each other."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
And now, reading what the comrades of the 18e say, I find myself more or less in agreement with their way of conceiving the anarchist organisation (being very far from the authoritarian spirit which the "Platform" seemed to reveal) and I confirm my belief that behind the linguistic differences really lie identical positions.&lt;ref&gt;Malatesta, On Collective Responsibility, http://www.nestormakhno.info/english/mal_rep3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5144">'''Political insult''' refers to a statement from a [[politician]] about another one which contains disdainful purpose or notorious offense. They are not defined in any [[Protocol (diplomacy)|political protocol]] and moreover are strongly recommended not to be used in [[diplomatic language]].

[[Image:Red flag II.svg|thumb|[[Red flag (politics)|Red flags]] associated with [[marxism]]]]
'''Political symbolism''' is symbolism that is used to represent a political standpoint.  The symbolism can occur in various media including [[banners]], [[acronyms]], [[pictures]], [[flags]], [[mottos]], and countless more. For example, [[Red flag (politics)|Red flags]] have traditionally been flown by [[socialists]], [[left-wing]] radicals, and [[communist]] groups to represent the "blood of the workers". Black flags have traditionally been flown by [[anarchists|anarchism]], and [[left-wing]] radicals to represent the absence of all oppressive structures. A combination of the two colors in a black flag represents social anarchism, such as [[anarchist communism]] and [[anarcho syndicalism]].

Many groups use the [[political colour]] associated with their political philosophy, for example blue, particularly dark blue, is often associated with [[Conservative political parties|Conservative parties]].

Cultural groups may use symbols in what many consider to be a political way, for example [[LGBT symbols]] like the [[Rainbow flag]] are used to promote the political goal of [[LGBT]] rights.

The '''politico-media complex''' ( '''PMC''', also referred to as the '''political-media complex''' ) is a name that has been given to the close, systematized, [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]]-like network&lt;ref name="network"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hacking reveals power network|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14846456 |publisher=[[The BBC]]|date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=November 15, 2011|quote=The story of the News of the World phone-hacking scandal has revealed a web of links between senior figures within politics, the police and the media.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; of relationships between a [[Sovereign state|state's]] [[politics|political]] and [[ruling class]]es, its [[media industry]], and any interactions with or dependencies upon [[interest group]]s with other domains and agencies, such as [[law]] (and its enforcement through the [[police]]&lt;ref name="filkin"&gt;{{cite news |title=Filkin report: Police warned over press links|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16411329 |publisher=[[The BBC]] |date=January 4, 2012 |accessdate=January 6, 2012|quote=The "close relationship" between parts of Scotland Yard and the media has caused "serious harm", a report says.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[corporation]]s and the [[Multinational corporation|multinationals]].

There is recent evidence to suggest that newer media portals (as opposed to those outlets of "traditional" [[mainstream media]] [MSM]) are turning, more readily, to using the PMC framework in critical analysis and interpretation of media behavior. One notable example of this is with regards to the [[Leveson Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="lse0"&gt;{{cite web | title=Leveson: Bloggers vs the Press | website=Media Policy Project | date=7 December 2012 | url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/mediapolicyproject/2012/12/07/leveson-bloggers-vs-the-press/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early media institutions==
Before [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in 1450, most information was delivered by town criers, ministers from the pulpit, or bartenders. [[Town criers]] spread information and news including royal edicts, police regulations, important community events and war news. These early methods of communication were often delivered by messengers on foot, and could be easily controlled by the ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American Media History |last=Fellow |first=Anthony |year=2005 |publisher=Michael Rosenberg |location=Boston, MA |isbn=978-0-495-56775-2 |page=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7THGKyvBXScC&amp;pg=PT19&amp;dq=%22town+criers%22+polical+media&amp;ei=3IgcS67kN57IzAT2k5iEDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of the printing press news began to be spread in writing. [[Corantos]], which were semi-regular pamphlets that reported news, are an example of the early politico-media complex. Popular in England, corantos reported mostly foreign news, as the royal government attempted to control what domestic news reached the masses. Corantos eventually would become regular periodicals that were subject to less political control, and mark one of the earlier forms of industrialized media.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Catherine. "Inventing the News." Engines of our Ingenuity. University of Houston. 2005. http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1983.htm. Dec. 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print==

===Global print media===
The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] states: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers".&lt;ref&gt;"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights". United Nations. 2009. [https://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/ UN.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the international papers present in the world today are national papers re-edited for a wider audience.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Because of this, there can be biases based on nationality.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} In any publication there is some sort of bias just from what news is covered and what stories are shown at the forefront of the publication.&lt;ref&gt;Tunstall, Jeremy. pg 12. The Media In Britain. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2013}}

Although print media in the West has suffered from declining advertising trends,&lt;ref name="printdecline"&gt;{{cite web | last=Fontevecchia | first=Agustino | title=New York Times Agonizes As Print Media Ad Revenues Continue To Slide | website=Forbes | date=12 September 2011 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/afontevecchia/2011/09/12/new-york-times-agonizes-as-print-media-ad-revenues-continue-to-slide/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; many newspapers and magazines in the [[Middle East]] continue to do well.&lt;ref&gt;"Middle East Newspapers Struggle in New Age".

Routledge. New York. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the independence from political influence, and dependability of newsprint is questionable in many countries. The [[Reporters Without Borders]] [[Press Freedom Index]] suggests that even in many first world countries the rights of the press are not fully respected, and that the press is not completely free to investigate or criticize the government, though the situation is far worse in third world or politically unstable nations.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}}&lt;ref name="press freedom index"&gt;"Press Freedom Index 2009".

====The West====
[[File:Newspapers-20080928.jpg|thumb|[[Newspapers]], as seen here, are easily available in many parts of the world.]]

Newspapers and magazines do have a back and forth between readers and journalists. Some studies have shown that the print media are more likely to reinforce existing political attitudes of the masses than change them.&lt;ref&gt;Byerly, Caroline. Ross, Karen. “Women and media: international perspectives”. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporters Without Borders, an international [[non-governmental organization]] that promotes [[freedom of the press]], produces an annual [[Press Freedom Index]] assessing countries' press freedom. Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Jean-François Julliard said at the release of the 2009 Press Freedom Index, "It is disturbing to see European democracies such as France, Italy and Slovakia fall steadily in the rankings year after year [...] Europe should be setting an example as regards civil liberties. How can you condemn human rights violations abroad if you do not behave irreproachably at home? The Obama effect, which has enabled the United States to recover 16 places in the index, is not enough to reassure us."&lt;ref name="press freedom index"/&gt;

====Asia====
The press is censored in the People's Republic of China by the [[Golden Shield Project]], known colloquially as the [[Great Firewall of China]].&lt;ref name=Norris&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Sentinel: News Media and Governance Reform |last=Norris |first=Pippa |authorlink=Pippa Norris |author2=World Bank Staff |year=2009 |publisher=[[World Bank Publications]] |location= |isbn=978-0-8213-8200-4 |page=360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xzFVxDDhfnkC&amp;pg=PA360 |accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Reporters Without Borders'' ranks [[Media of the People's Republic of China|China's press situation]] as "very serious," the worst possible ranking on their five-point scale.&lt;ref&gt;"The News by Country".

====The Middle East and North Africa====
Middle Eastern print media is mainly paid for by private funders, either a specific family or specific government party.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Some Middle Eastern newspapers and magazines have been accused of having obvious political ties.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. pg 11. The Middle East: A Brief History of the Last 2,000 Years. Britain.

===Struggles===
Where newspapers used to represent an exclusive connection between readers and advertisers, print media must now compete with the power of the entire Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan, Robert. The Krugman Paradox: newspaper websites' inability to generate economically sustainable advertising revenue. New York University. Fall 2008. pg. 18.[http://metaprinter.com/Projects/Robert_Ivan_MAthesis_2008NYU.pdf MA Thesis PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of declining advertising revenue and shrinking audiences, [[print press]] has been described as declining.&lt;ref name="printdecline" /&gt; Today a little more than half of Americans read a newspaper every day. However, a 2004 report notes that 55 million newspapers are still sold daily in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;"The State of the News Media 2004". [http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/ Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and newsprint still plays a significant role in the politico-media complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chozick|first1=Amy|title=Conservative Koch Brothers Turning Focus to Newspapers|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/business/media/koch-brothers-making-play-for-tribunes-newspapers.html|accessdate=9 April 2015|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to economic struggles and readership decline, newsprint has also struggled with losing readers' trust. Surveys have found that people tend to trust newspapers less than other news media, in part because they believe that newspaper journalists are "isolated and out of touch" and motivated by commercial interests.&lt;ref name="2004att"&gt;"The State of the News Media 2004". [http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/public-attitudes/ Stateofthemedia.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Most people believe their local and national news television stations more than their local and national newspapers.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt; The only news medium that people trust less than newspapers is print magazines.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt;

Some{{who|date=June 2013}} have speculated that the youth today are more visually inclined, and are therefore less likely to be influenced by written political news or propaganda.&lt;ref name="2004att" /&gt; One Pew Center study found that 28% of this generation read the paper on a given day, and average only 10 minutes of reading time. [[Harvard]] Professor Thomas Patterson has said: "What's happened over time is that we have become more of a viewing nation than a reading nation, and the internet is a little of both. My sense is that, like it or not, the future of news is going to be in the electronic media, but we don't really know what that form is going to look like."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Juston.

===History of political radio===

The early American radio industry was composed of commercial shipping companies that used radio for navigation, and amateur radio enthusiasts, who built radios at home.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Douglas B. Fireside Politics: Radio and Political Culture in the United States. pg 26. The [[Johns Hopkins University Press]]. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; This mixture of military, industry and community went unregulated until the [[Radio Act of 1912]], which required all ships to use radio communication and keep a constant radio watch, amateur users to be licensed, and began regulating the use of wavelengths for radio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;An Act to Regulate Radio Communication, August 13, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; This act represents one of the earliest interactions between the government and the radio media and also set a precedent for later radio legislation,{{OR|date=June 2013}} including the [[Radio Act of 1927]], which established the [[Federal Radio Commission]] and added further regulation to radio users, both commercial and amateur.&lt;ref&gt;Public Law No. 632, February 23, 1927, 69th Congress. An Act for the regulation of radio communications, and for other purposes.&lt;/ref&gt; Government regulation increased again with the American entrance into World War I, when President Woodrow Wilson ordered naval control of all radio stations, and ordered that amateurs cease all radio activity. [[Jonathan Reed Winkler]], a noted WWI historian, said “It was only during World War I that the United States first came to comprehend how a strategic communications network-the collection of submarine telegraph cables, and long-distance radio stations used by a nation for diplomatic, commercial and military purposes- was vital to the global political and economic interests of a great power in the modern world.”&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Jonathan Reed. Nexus: Strategic Communications and American Security in World War I. pg. 2. [[Harvard University Press]]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I radio was introduced to broader civilian audiences when Westinghouse released the Aeriola Jr. in 1919, and the [[Radio Corporation of America]] (RCA) released the Radiola in 1920. The Aeriola Jr. and Radiola helped established a new channel for the politico-media complex to enter into thousand of American homes.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} By 1919 the oldest licensed American radio station, KDKA, from Pittsburgh, PA began broadcasting regular music shows, and soon music, educational programming, sports coverage and eventually news coverage became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Edward. Now the News: the Story of Broadcast Journalism. pgs. 10, 13-16. [[Columbia University Press]]. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of politics quickly caught on across the countries, as stations began covering elections, and reporting news of government actions. The close politico-media complex between government and radio was finalized in 1924{{OR|date=June 2013}} when the Republican and Democratic National Conventions were covered, and candidates made eve of election speeches, the first instance of radio broadcasting that was meant to affect the American political process.&lt;ref&gt;Bliss, Edward. Now the News: the Story of Broadcast Journalism. pg. 18. Columbia University Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers of radio users exploded, by 1935 about 2 in 3 American homes owned a radio.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenherr, Steven E. "Golden Age of Radio,1935-1950" [http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/radio2.html Sandiego.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Politicians quickly learned to reach these huge audiences.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Franklin Delano Roosevelt's [[Fireside Chats]] are an example of the politico-media complex.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} In his series of informal broadcasts from 1933 to 1944, Roosevelt developed a comforting rapport with the American public.&lt;ref&gt;"Treasures of American History: The Great Depression and World War II."

Politicians would continue to use the radio in World War II, in which the radio was used primarily for news transmissions and the spread of [[propaganda]]. One example of radio propaganda came from Iva Toguri D'Aquino, Ruth Hayakawa, June Suyamawho, and Myrtle Lipton collectively known as [[Tokyo Rose]]. These women hosted anti-American programming intended to lower American soldiers' morale and illustrate the use of governments' use of the media to influence the public, or their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;"Famous Cases: Iva Toguri d'Aquino and 'Tokyo Rose.'" The Federal Bureau of Investigation. [https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/rose/rose.htm FBI.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; However, many people, such as [[Iva Toguri D'Aquino]] and Allied prisoners of war, were forced against their will to participate in these programs and worked hard to help Allied forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iva Toguri|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article652271.ece|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Willis Conover 1969.jpg|thumb|left|[[Willis Conover]], host of the [[Voice of America|VOA's]] Music USA program, 1969.]]
After WWII and throughout the [[Cold War]] era, Democratic nations used long-range radio waves to broadcast news into countries behind the Iron Curtain or otherwise information-compromised nations. The American international radio program, the [[Voice of America]], founded during World War II, became a critical part of Cold War era "public diplomacy," which aimed to spread democratic values, and popularize American policies abroad.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon Robert. "Channeling the Cold War: U.S. Overseas Broadcasting". The Foreign Service Journal. pg. 58. October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, President Harry S. Truman described the Cold War conflict as a "struggle, above all else, for the minds of men," which the American people would win by getting "the real story across to people in other countries." in other words, embracing the politico-media complex and using it to influence foreign listeners.&lt;ref&gt;Gorman, Lyn. McLean, David. Media and Society in the Twentieth Century: a historical introduction. pg. 107. Wiley Blackwell. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The Voice of America, operating under the authority of the [[United States Information Agency]], supported programming in forty five languages, broadcasting over 400 hours of programming a week.

===Modern political radio===
The Golden Age of Radio may have only lasted from 1935–1950, yet radio is still an active medium in the politico-media complex.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} Today there is extensive radio programming on politics. One notable example is the [[Rush Limbaugh Show]], which broadcasts the political commentary of Rush Limbaugh, referred to by listeners as "America's Truth Detector," the "Doctor of Democracy," and the "Most Dangerous Man in America."&lt;ref&gt;"About the Rush Limbaugh Show." Premier Radio Networks. [http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/about_the_show.guest.html RushLimbaugh.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rush Limbaugh Show has hosted numerous politicians, illustrating that politicians still use the radio to affect public opinion and the political process.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}} The [[Air America Media]] company, provides progressive political commentary and news coverage and has described itself as the "most recognized progressive talk radio network, providing an independent and unfiltered voice to a grateful listening nation."&lt;ref&gt;"About Air America." [http://AirAmerica.com/about/ AirAmerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Air America programs such as [[The Rachel Maddow Show (radio)|The Rachel Maddow Show]], The Lionel Show, and Live in Washington with Jack Rice discuss recordings of politicians, host politicians as live guests, and act as a connection between the political classes and the media.&lt;ref&gt;"About the Rachel Maddow Show", [http://airamerica.com/therachelmaddowshow/about/ AirAmerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"About the Lionel Show" [http://airamerica.com/lionel/about/ AirAmerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"About Live in Washington with Jack Rice" [http://airamerica.com/liveinmwashingtonwithjackrice/about/ AirAmerica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==

===National cinema===
One of film's most powerful political and sociological forms is '''[[national cinema]]''', for which there are entire books for individual countries and varying definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Hjort, Mette, and Scott MacKenzie, eds. Introduction. ''Cinema and Nation''. By Hjort and MacKenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Through the national cinema, ideological groups within specific countries can construct and reinforce their collective identities through film, as well as the identities of foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Choi, Jimmy. "Is National Cinema Mr. MacGuffin?" International Films The Institute of Communications Studies, [[University of Leeds]], UK. Available at [http://ics.leeds.ac.uk/papers/vp01.cfm?outfit=ifilm&amp;folder=17&amp;paper=22 Leeds.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, Charles and John A. Hall. "The Sociological Scope of National Cinema." ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p.22-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural politics===
Ulf Hedetoft has observed, "In the real world of politics and influence, certain nationalisms, cultures, ideas and interpretations are more transnationally powerful, assertive and successful than others. Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity."&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"&gt;Hedetoft, Ulf. "Contemporary Cinema: Between Cultural Globalisation and National Interpretation." ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its "national-cultural currency" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a "positive admixture" to other countries' cultures and identities or a "model for emulation."&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"/&gt; He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.&lt;ref name="Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280"/&gt;

===Propaganda===
{{Main article|Propaganda}}
Propaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"&gt;Furhammar, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt;

Such British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the "masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt;

[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 2.jpg|thumb|A scene from "[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]", the third installment of [[Why We Fight]], 1943.]]
When sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 152"/&gt; A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{OR|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 153"&gt;Furhammar, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the "reality" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI "Operation Abolition," 1960 - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The Führer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.&lt;ref&gt;Furhammar, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in "Breaking into the Movies," is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.&lt;ref name="Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31"&gt;Giroux, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; He argues, "We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values."&lt;ref name="Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31"/&gt;

Though feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.&lt;ref name="Furhammar, p. 153"/&gt;

===Anti-politics in film===
Despite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to "develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's "[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]" 1939.]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; After the hero of ''[[John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Lindholm and Hall observe that "the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Lindholm, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"&gt;Lindholm, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"/&gt; Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.&lt;ref name="Lindholm, p. 43"/&gt;

===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===
While films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Giroux, p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actor-politicians===
{{Main article|List of actor-politicians}}

==Television==

===Role of television in United States presidential elections===
The [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"&gt;Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"/&gt;

Rick Shenkman also analyzes the media’s impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that "politicians have repeatedly misled voters" by "[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation."&lt;ref name="Presidential Selection"/&gt;
[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]

Through setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation’s political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.&lt;ref name="agenda"&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.&lt;ref name="agenda" /&gt; When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.&lt;ref&gt;McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. "The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media." ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political influence on religion via television===
In his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in "shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present" in India.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"&gt;Rajagopal, Arvind. "Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India." Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that "television profoundly changes the context of politics".&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;24)&lt;/sup&gt;

The epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p.&amp;nbsp;43&lt;/sup&gt; This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.

Central to the BJP’s success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.&lt;ref name="Rajagopal"/&gt; This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.

===Television and politics around the world===
In the “Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,” Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation’s television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation’s television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod"&gt;Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.&lt;ref name="Abu-Lughod"/&gt;

Another group who studied the impact of television on politics included Holli Semetko and Patti Valenburg. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are "conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information."&lt;ref&gt;Neuman et al., 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;60&lt;/ref&gt; They set the parameters "in which citizens discuss public events."&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;IV&lt;/ref&gt; They are "persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Gitlin, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt; Framing is selecting "some aspects of a perceived reality" to enhance their salience "in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation."&lt;ref&gt;Entman, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;53&lt;/ref&gt; Frames are to help audiences "locate, perceive, identify, and label" the flow of information around themGoffman, 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;21 and to "narrow the available political alternatives."&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Semetko"&gt;Semetko, Holli A. and Valenburg, Patti M. “Framing European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.” Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

News frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&amp;nbsp;– such as its organization, content, or structure&amp;nbsp;– make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;Price et al., 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;486&lt;/ref&gt; Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt;

Like agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis "expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news."&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pan &amp; Kosicki, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;70; emphasis in the original&lt;/ref&gt; The results of Semetko and Valenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role.&lt;ref name="Semetko"/&gt; After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.

===Impact on political media===
The Internet - particularly in the form of the [[World Wide Web]] (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media. The Internet also opens up a world of commentary and criticism which in turn allows for new and better ideas to circulate amongst many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Handbook of Political Communication Research |last=Kaid |first=Lynda |year=2004 |publisher=Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3775-2 |page=508 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ffqEaH6UM7UC&amp;pg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives multidirectional communication, which allows people to stay in connection with organizations or people associated with politics more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Democracy online: The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet |last=Shane |first=Peter |year=2004 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-94864-9 |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are many controversies regarding the Internet with respect to the PMC as it (the Internet) can encourage and facilitate the practice of providing bits of information extracted from a far wider context or biased information, which leads to public cynicism toward the media.&lt;ref name=name&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Volume 1 |last= Kaid |first=Lynda |author2=Holtz-Bacha, Christina |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4129-1799-5 |page=334|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-woKG0HTstwC&amp;pg=PT350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative ease of entry into publishing through Internet/Web channels yields opportunities, for those so inclined, to become, in the extreme, one-person contributors/players, with a foot on both sides of the fence - politics ''and'' media - in the PMC (and sometimes information, placed into the public domain through such channels, about a political entity (politician, party etc.), being perhap less than flattering, may be 'adjusted' by one or more ''other'' entities (individuals, organizations etc.) with publishing identities that barely, if at all, conceal a relationship with the political entity in question).

For example, [[Wikipedia]] itself is a major global channel, currently being around the eighth most visited website, in 2009 found its objectivity being compromised at the highest levels with a 'conflict of interest' of a sitting member of the influential [[Wikipedia:AC|Arbitration Committee]](ArbCom). It was shown that David Boothroyd - a serving Labour Party Councillor for Westminster City

The impact of the internet on politics has been notable, as this form of media has more current information than others since it is constantly being updated. Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past. Political Information available on the internet covers every major activity of American politics. Users, nonetheless, remain susceptible to bias, especially on websites that represent themselves as objective sources.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

[[File:Bill Clinton (square).jpg|thumb|left|[[Bill Clinton]] was the first [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] to utilize the [[Internet]] in a national campaign and to appoint a Director of Email and Electronic Publishing.]]
[[E-mail]] has achieved a large scale of usage amongst numerous levels of government, political groups, and even media companies as a means of communicating with the public and thus plays a significant role in the political-media complex. The boom of e-mail hit the Internet and the public in the mid-1990s as a way to keep in touch with family and friends. Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day. In order to deal with the influx of e-mail a more sophisticated system was put in. In a six-month period, at one point, there were half a million e-mails sent to the president and vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=New Media and American Politics |last=Davis |first=Richard |author2=Owen, Diana |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc. |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-19-512060-4 |page=123 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f-Ka0nSKaFoC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=New+Media+and+American+Politics#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elections===
The United States [[President of the United States|Presidential]] [[United States presidential election, 1996|campaign]] in 1996 between sitting-President [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Bob Dole]] was one of the first campaigns to utilize the Internet on a national level in the US.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

With so many campaigns using the Internet it raises a significant amount of money in a shorter period of time than with any other method. The web sites are set up like advertising sites – there are links to click on to watch ads, information and background on the candidate, photos from the campaign trail, schedules, donation links, etc. E-mail gives a great low-cost way of connecting with the campaign trail and voters.&lt;ref name="name"/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] United States [[Presidential election]] between [[John McCain]] and [[Barack Obama]], the Internet was extensively utilized by both candidates. [[Facebook]], an Internet social network, was used heavily to give people the ability to support their views and share information with their friends. Both sent out messages daily to promote themselves and the issues at hand, for leverage against the other candidate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Discussion forums===
[[Blogs]] are a type of website, usually maintained by an individual with regular entries of commentary, descriptions of events, or other material such as graphics or video. Blogging started to become popular at the start of the millennium, and was used mostly by highly educated, highly paid, males. Around 2004 blogging became more mainstream and was typically used for political interaction. Many [[political campaign]]s use this as a stake in monitoring blogs and actively using them to spread information about their candidate.&lt;ref name=Tremayne &gt;{{cite book |title=Blogging, Citizenship, and the future of media |last=Tremayne |first=Mark |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group, LLC |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-97940-4 |page=266 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=a6zPnOn9i9oC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Internet creates a space in which people can voice their opinions and discuss political issues under the protection of anonymity. Some discussion forums are actually groups or organizations that set up discussion for a specific purpose about one issue or person in politics. Some problems with discussion forums include the lack of personal contact, which allows people not to take responsibility for posts, such as personal attacks on others.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Bias is another issue of online discussion forums because many websites attract like-minded individuals, making it less likely for alternative perspectives to be introduced.&lt;ref name=Tremayne/&gt;

===Electronic government===
An [[e-Government]] is a government that is inter-networked through digital technology for mass media distribution and communication for voters, taxpayers, schools, hospitals, etc. It has been described{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} as a new way to transform government programs by closing the gap between distance and time. This idea has been said to be a more cost effective and convenient way to form programs around the needs of citizens rather than civil servants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netzhausen.de/internet/indage_bureaucracy_final.pdf |title= The Digital Economy: Promise &amp; Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence

==UK media phone hacking scandal==
{{Main article|News International phone hacking scandal}}
In perhaps what is the beginning of the first major reappraisal of the relationship between a political elite/class and the media in a major modern Western PMC, with respect to the enervation of representative political and legal processes and the consequent erosion of and dangers to the public interest in a Western democracy, is captured in excerpts from three contributions to an emergency three-hour debate&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1534 Column 1534]. ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by members of parliament (MPs) in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] on the afternoon of the 6 July 2011.{{Synthesis inline|date=June 2013}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*We politicians have colluded for far too long with the media: we rely on them, we seek their favour, and we live and we die politically because of what they write and what they show, and sometimes that means we lack the courage or the spine to stand up when wrong has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Chris Bryant]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1540 Column 1540] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*As MPs, we depend on the media. We like to be liked by them; we need to be liked by them. We depend on the media, and that applies still more to Governments. It is an unavoidable observation that Parliament has behaved with extraordinary cowardice for many years...&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Zac Goldsmith]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0002.htm/#column_1569 Column 1569] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*We are faced with a scandal of expanding proportions, including hacking, allegations of interference in police investigations, and claims that payments have been made to officers. To restore faith and trust in the police and the media, we must lock up the guilty, establish a statutory inquiry, shine a cleansing light on the culture of the media and, if necessary, of the police, and implement the reforms necessary to ensure that the privacy of victims and citizens is never intruded on again. It is clear from today’s debate that this is the will of the House, and we are committed to making it happen.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 July 2011, Phone Hacking [[Tom Brake]], MP. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110706/debtext/110706-0003.htm/#column_1580 Column 1580] ''Emergency debate under the Standing Order No. 24''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These comments refer to the apparent effects of the relationships between the members of  (the UK) parliament and those that form the [[UK Government]], the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan police]] and [[News International]] (NI [UK subsidiary of [[News Corporation]] ]) and the influence, expressed as malign, of the latter organization on the former two institutions.

The debate was precipitated by the type of some of the information procurement methods found to have been used by a major British Sunday newspaper (the title is now shut down) – the ''[[News of the World]]'' (was owned by NI). Now known as the (News International) ‘[[News of the World phone hacking affair|phone hacking affair]]’, the consequences&lt;ref&gt;The first major consequence being the [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14070856 closure] of the 168 year old title of the ''News of the World'' from Sunday 10 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; for the British PMC and NI (as part of the world’s second largest media empire after [[The Walt Disney Company]]) are likely to be unfolding for some considerable time as new sectors of vulnerable members of British society subjected to the particular malicious practice are brought to light.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

The Parliamentary turmoil resulted in the UK government instituting a three-pronged public judicial examination into the relations and interactions between the media and the public, the media and the police and the media and the politicians. Known as the [[Leveson Inquiry]], its findings were published November 29, 2012 based on a spread of around eight months (November 2011 to June 2012) of probing into the relationships. While the Leveson findings are obviously oriented toward the PMC of the UK, some commentators argue that its findings will have global implications through their relevance to similar existing networks in other countries.&lt;ref name="lse1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lse2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lse3"&gt;{{cite web | title=Leveson Round-Up: Over Cosy?

==Noam Chomsky reaction==
Naming (as a 'complex')  points of intersection and apparent cooperative benefit, to some degree, of diverse, nominally independent, areas of public faced activity puts us in danger of missing a much more fundamental and general insight according to linguist and dissident [[Noam Chomsky]]. Such identifiable collaborations/collusions are almost to be expected and are a natural outcome to the working of the 'industrial system,' as it has evolved in the West, having the taxpayer-funded sector at its core (that is as opposed to the contemporary [[conventional wisdom]], with a hard and fast distinction between the state and private sectors - the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] has also argued that the "two sectors" represent an "innocent fraud")&lt;ref name="galbraith"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Bernhut|title=An Interview With John Kenneth Galbraith|url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/leadership/an-interview-with-john-kenneth-galbraith|work=Ivey Business Journal|date=May–June 2006|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=The myth of the two sectors, the public sector and the private sector... at a time when the private sector has taken over big chunks of the public sector, particularly in military operations and armament, defense budget. That's a very fairly central theme.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has blamed its existence on the [[corporate welfare|"socialization of costs and the privatization of profits"]].

Chomsky discusses the ''[[military-industrial complex]]'' (MIC)&lt;ref name="chomsky1"&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Barsamian|title=War Crimes and Imperial Fantasies|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/200408--.htm|work=International Socialist Review|issue=37|date=September–October 2004|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=...the military-industrial complex, as he (Eisenhower) called it, is actually the core of the modern economy. It’s not specifically military.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the "military" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.

Using the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.

Observing the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).

Chomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.

Chomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.

[[Edward S. Herman]] and Chomsky, together, advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' to accomplish this '[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media|manufacturing consent]]', showing the ways in which power and money filter the news and enable governments and dominant private interests to integrate the behavior of the citizenry into the structures of the industrial system. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, "All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news."&lt;ref name="orwell"&gt;{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.

Herman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.

Thus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) – a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.&lt;ref name="chomsky2"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sameer|last=Dossani|title=Chomsky:Understanding the Crisis -- Markets, the State and Hypocrisy|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/20090210.htm|work=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=It's true across the board from electronics to pharmaceuticals to the new biology-based industries.

The shadow that the corporations cast on the media through advertising (corroboration of Herman and Chomsky's propaganda model filters through advertising) was illustrated in the closure of News International's 168-year-old flagship Sunday title, the ''News of the World'', when major advertisers boycotted the paper as a consequence of the 'phone hacking scandal' – the corporations, understandably, not wishing to be seen associated with a paper whose production had been based on frequent engagement in serious criminal activity.&lt;ref name="nowad"&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon|last=Rogers|title=Top 50 News of the World advertisers - and what they spend|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jul/06/news-of-the-world-top-50-advertisers-spend |work=The Guardian |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mason"&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Mason|title=Murdoch: the network defeats the hierarchy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14093772|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=10 July 2011|accessdate=September 19, 2011|quote=The ''News of the World'' is closing - at least partly due to a strong campaign to make advertisers drop the title, following the latest phone hacking revelations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Chomsky's perspective, then, whatever set of interactions is being named by the term 'politico-media complex' (PMC) simply instantiates the propaganda model to manufacture consent in the service of the industrial system.

As a philosophy, secularism seeks to interpret life on principles taken solely from the material world, without recourse to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Livingstone |first1=E.A. |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191727214 |edition=2nd |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198614425.001.0001/acref-9780198614425}}&lt;/ref&gt; In political terms, secularism is the principle of the separation of government institutions and persons [[Mandate (politics)|mandated]] to represent [[State (polity)|the state]] from [[Religious organization|religious institution]] and [[Clergy|religious dignitaries]] (the attainment of such is termed [[secularity]]). Under a brief definition, Secularism means that governments should remain neutral on the matter of religion and should not enforce nor prohibit the free exercise of religion, leaving religious choice to the [[liberty]] of the people.  One manifestation of secularism is asserting the right to be free from religious rule and teachings, or, in a state declared to be neutral on matters of belief, from the imposition by government of religion or religious practices upon its people.&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;See also [[Separation of church and state]] and ''[[Laïcité]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another manifestation of secularism is the view that public activities and decisions, especially [[Politics|political]] ones, should be uninfluenced by religious beliefs or practices.&lt;ref&gt;"Secularism &amp; Secularity: Contemporary International Perspectives". Edited by Barry A. Kosmin and Ariela Keysar. Hartford, CT: Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC), 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;See also [[Public reason]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Secularism draws its intellectual roots from Greek and Roman philosophers such as [[Zeno of Citium]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]; from [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers such as [[Erasmus]], [[John Locke]], [[Denis Diderot]], [[Voltaire]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[James Madison]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Thomas Paine]]; and from more recent [[Freethought|freethinkers]] and [[Atheism|atheists]] such as [[Robert G. Ingersoll|Robert Ingersoll]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Christopher Hitchens]]. It shifts the focus from religion to other ‘temporal’ and ‘this-worldly’ things with emphasis on nature, reason, science, and development.&lt;ref&gt;Yaniv Roznai citing Domenic Marbaniang in "Negotiating the Eternal: The Paradox of Entrenching Secularism in Constitutions," ''Michigan State Law Review'' 253, 2017, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

The purposes and arguments in support of secularism vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Noah |authorlink=Noah Feldman |year=2005 |title=Divided by God |location=New York City |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |page=25. |quote="Together, early protosecularists (Jefferson and Madison) and proto-evangelicals (Backus, Leland, and others) made common cause in the fight for nonestablishment [of religion]{{spaced ndash}}but for starkly different reasons."}}&lt;/ref&gt; In European [[laicism]], it has been argued that secularism is a movement toward [[modernization]], and away from traditional religious values (also known as [[secularization]]). This type of secularism, on a social or philosophical level, has often occurred while maintaining an official [[state church]] or other state support of religion. In the [[United States]], some argue that [[#State secularism|state secularism]] has served to a greater extent to protect religion and the religious from governmental interference, while secularism on a social level is less prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;Yavuz, Hakan M. and John L. Esposio (2003) ‘’Turkish Islam and the Secular State: The Gulen Movement’’. Syracuse University, pp. xv–xvii. {{ISBN|0-8156-3040-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Noah |authorlink=Noah Feldman |year=2005 |title=Divided by God |location=New York City |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] |page=147 |quote=But with the Second World War just ahead, secularism of the antireligious type was soon to disappear from mainstream American society, to be replaced by a new complex of ideas that focused on secularizing the state, not on secularizing society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, [[Meiji era]] Japan maintained that it was secular and allowed [[freedom of religion]] despite enforcing [[State Shinto]] and continuing to prohibit certain "superstitions;" scholar of religion Jason Ānanda Josephson has labelled this conception of the secular "the Shinto Secular" and noted that it follows a pattern established in certain European constitutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephson|first=Jason Ānanda |title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|pages=132-139, 186-91|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|thumb|right|[[Italians|Italian]] law professor [[Alberico Gentili]] (1552–1608) first split secularism from [[canon law]] and [[Roman Catholic theology]].]]
The term "secularism" was first used by the [[United Kingdom|British]] writer [[George Jacob Holyoake]] in 1851.&lt;ref name="Holyoake" /&gt; Holyoake invented the term secularism to describe his views of promoting a social order separate from religion, without actively dismissing or criticizing religious belief. An [[agnostic]] himself, Holyoake argued that "Secularism is not an argument against Christianity, it is one independent of it. It does not question the pretensions of Christianity; it advances others. Secularism does not say there is no light or guidance elsewhere, but maintains that there is light and guidance in secular truth, whose conditions and sanctions exist independently, and act forever. Secular knowledge is manifestly that kind of knowledge which is founded in this life, which relates to the conduct of this life, conduces to the welfare of this life, and is capable of being tested by the experience of this life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Holyoake | first=G.J. | title=The Reasoner | publisher=Holyoake. | issue=v. 30 | year=1872 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2cA7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA100 | access-date=2017-10-04 | page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barry Kosmin]] of the [[Institute for the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture]] breaks modern secularism into two types: hard and soft secularism.  According to Kosmin, "the hard secularist considers religious propositions to be [[epistemological]]ly illegitimate, warranted by neither reason nor experience."  However, in the view of soft secularism, "the attainment of absolute truth was impossible and therefore skepticism and tolerance should be the principle and overriding values in the discussion of science and religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.trincoll.edu/NR/rdonlyres/9614BC42-9E4C-42BF-A7F4-0B5EE1009462/0/Kosmin_paper.pdf |title=Kosmin, Barry A.

==History==
The departure from reliance on religious faith to reason and science marks the beginning of the secularization of education and society in history. Among the earliest documentations of a secular form of thought is seen in the [[Charvaka]] system of philosophy, which held [[direct perception]], [[empiricism]], and conditional [[inference]] as proper sources of knowledge, and sought to reject the prevailing religious practices of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/govind-pansare-mm-kalburgi-gauri-lankesh-murder-5316465/|title=Indian rationalism, Charvaka to Narendra Dabholkar|date=2018-08-21|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Domenic Marbaniang, Secularism emerged in the West with the establishment of reason over religious faith as human reason was gradually liberated from unquestioned subjection to the dominion of religion and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;Ervin Budiselić, "Christian Witness for the 21st Century: Contemporary, yet Orthodox and Radical," ''Bogoslovni vestnik,'' 74 University of Ljlubljana, (2014) 3, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; Secularism first appeared in the West in the classical philosophy and politics of ancient Greece, disappeared for a time after the fall of Greece, but resurfaced after a millennium and half in the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Reformation]]. He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;An increasing confidence in human capabilities, reason, and progress, that emerged during the Italian Renaissance, together with an increasing distrust in organized and state supported religion during the Reformation, was responsible for the ushering of modernity during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which brought all facets of human life including religion under the purview of reason and thus became responsible for the freeing of education, society, and state from the domination of religion; in other words, the development of modern secularism.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, ''Secularism in India: A Historical Analysis'' SI: Domenic Marbaniang, 2011, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Harvey Cox explains that the Enlightenment hailed Nature as the "deep reality" that transcended the corrupted man-made institutions of men. Consequently, the rights of man were not considered as God-given but as the de facto benefits of Nature as revealed by Reason.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Cox, ''The Secular City: Secularization and Urbanization in Theological Perspective'' (Princeton University Press, 2013), p. xxiii&lt;/ref&gt;

In political terms, secularism is a movement towards the separation of religion and government (often termed the [[separation of church and state]]).  This can refer to reducing ties between a government and a [[state religion]], replacing laws based on scripture (such as [[Halakha]], [[Dominionism]], and [[Sharia]] law) with civil laws, and eliminating discrimination on the basis of religion.  This is said to add to democracy by protecting the rights of religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). p. 14. "[Legal secularists] claim that separating religion from the public, governmental sphere is necessary to ensure the full inclusion of all citizens."&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''On Temporal Authority (1523),'' [[Martin Luther]] argued for the division of the church and the state. He specified two distinct powers: ''weltliches Regiment'' (German word for ‘the kingdom of the world,’ ‘the State’) and ''geistliches Regiment'' (German word for ‘the kingdom of God,’ ‘the Church’) and argued that citizens need only subject to the ruler's edict as long as the edict conformed to God's divine will as revealed in the scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "The Kingdom in Secular Politics" in ''Basileia: A Theological Journal'', Itarsi: Central India Theological Seminary, Oct 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars, such as [[Jacques Berlinerblau]] of the Program for Jewish Civilization at the [[School of Foreign Service|Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]], have argued that the separation of church and state is but one possible strategy to be deployed by secular governments. What all secular governments, from the democratic to the authoritarian, share is a concern about the relationship between the church and the state. Each secular government may find its own unique policy prescriptions for dealing with that concern (separation being one of those possible policies; French models, in which the state carefully monitors and regulates the church, being another).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Berlinerblau|Berlinerblau, Jacques]], "How to be Secular," Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

A major impact on the idea of state religious liberty came from the writings of [[John Locke]] who, in his [[A Letter Concerning Toleration]] argued in favor of religious toleration. He argued that government must treat all citizens and all religions equally and that it can restrict actions but not the religious intent behind them.&lt;ref&gt;Elissa B. Alzate, ''Religious Liberty in a Lockean Society'', Palgrave Studies in Religion, Politics, and Policy, 2017, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maharaja Ranjeet Singh]] of the [[Sikh empire]] of the first half of the 19th century successfully established a [[Ranjit Singh#Secular Sikh rule|secular rule]] in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. This secular rule respected members of all races and religions and it allowed them to participate without discrimination in Ranjeet Singh's [[Durbar (court)|darbar]] and he had Sikh, Muslim and Hindu representatives heading the darbar.&lt;ref&gt;K.S. Duggal, ''Ranjit Singh: A Secular Sikh Sovereign'', Abhinav Publications (1989) {{ISBN|81-7017-244-6}}''&lt;/ref&gt; Ranjit Singh also extensively funded education, religion, and arts of various different religions and languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheikh|first=Majid|title=Destruction of schools as Leitner saw them|url=http://dawn.com/2010/10/31/destruction-of-schools-as-leitner-saw-them/|work=Dawn|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secularism is most often associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe and it plays a major role in [[Western culture|Western society]]. The principles, but not necessarily the practices, of [[separation of church and state in the United States]] and ''[[Laïcité]]'' in [[France]] draw heavily on secularism. Secular states also existed in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]] during the [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Islam and secularism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ira M. Lapidus (October 1975). "The Separation of State and Religion in the Development of Early Islamic Society", ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'' '''6''' (4), pp. 363–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due in part to the belief in the separation of church and state, secularists tend to prefer that politicians make decisions for secular rather than religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman Noah (2005). pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, policy decisions pertaining to topics like [[abortion]], [[contraception]], [[embryonic stem cell]] research, [[same-sex marriage]], and [[sex education]] are prominently focused upon by American secularist organizations such as the [[Center for Inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, November 15, 2006 [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/14/AR2006111401176.html "Think Tank Will Promote Thinking" ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfidc.org/declaration.html |title=Declaration in Defense of Science and Secularism |publisher=Cfidc.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117073312/http://www.cfidc.org/declaration.html |archive-date=2009-01-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Christian fundamentalism|Christian fundamentalists]] and scholars (notably in the United States) oppose secularism, often claiming that there is a "radical secularist" ideology being adopted in our current day and they see secularism as a threat to "Christian rights"&lt;ref name="christianpost-jerrys-kids"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could be a sign that ‘hard secularism’ is taking over from ‘soft secularism’ towards becoming the predominant ideological mindset. According to the terminologi of Barry Kosmin, described earlier in this article.

The most significant forces of religious fundamentalism in the contemporary world are [[Christian fundamentalism]] and [[Islamic fundamentalism]].  At the same time, one significant stream of secularism has come from religious minorities who see governmental and political secularism as integral to the preservation of equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Noah (2005). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the well known states that are often considered "[[constitution]]ally secular" are the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mount|first=Steve|title="The Constitution of the United States," Amendment 1 - Freedom of Religion, Press|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/const.html#Am1|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[France]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/coifiles/preamble.htm |title=Preamble of the Constitution of India |publisher=Indiacode.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Constitution of Mexico#Article 3|See article 3 of the 1917 Mexican constitution]], and [[Constitution of Mexico#Article 24|Article 24]]. See also Schmitt (1962) and Blancarte (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]], and [[Turkey]] although none of these nations have identical forms of governance with respect to religion.

Countries with state religion in northern Europe have a high degree of political secularism with systems build upon Protestant and democratic ideology. For example, the monarchy of Denmark have a constitutional right for the freedom of religion, freedom of speech and it is illegal to discriminate individually upon religion, ethnic origins etc.

One of the most wellknown countries with a religious political system is the Islamic republic of Iran.

== Secular society ==
In studies of religion, modern [[democracy|democracies]] are generally recognized as secular. This is due to the near-complete [[freedom of religion]] (beliefs on religion generally are not subject to legal or social sanctions), and the lack of authority of religious leaders over political decisions.  Nevertheless, it has been claimed that surveys done by [[Pew Research Center]] show Americans as generally being more comfortable with religion playing a major role in public life, while in Europe the impact of the church on public life is declining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2005/04/21/secular-europe-and-religious-america-implications-for-transatlantic-relations/ |title=Secular Europe and Religious America: Implications for Transatlantic Relations |last= |first= |date= |website= Pew Research Center|publisher= |access-date= 4 July 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[sociology]] has, since [[Max Weber]], often been preoccupied with the problem of [[authority]] in secularized societies and with [[secularization]] as a sociological or historical process.&lt;ref&gt;''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'', Max Weber, London, Routledge Classics, 2001, pp. 123–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth-century scholars, whose work has contributed to the understanding of these matters, include [[Carl L. Becker]], [[Karl Löwith]], [[Hans Blumenberg]], [[Meyer Howard Abrams|M. H. Abrams]], [[Peter L. Berger]], [[Paul Bénichou]] and [[D. L. Munby]], among others.

Some societies become increasingly secular as the result of social processes, rather than through the actions of a dedicated secular movement; this process is known as [[secularization]].

Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] maintained that the modern world can no longer be described as being secular or becoming increasingly secular, instead it can best be described as being pluralistic.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Berger and Ross Douthat, "Why Hasn't Religion Died Out?", 2015.

== Secular ethics ==
{{main|Secular ethics|Secular religion}}

[[George Holyoake]]'s 1896 publication ''English Secularism'' describes secularism as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Secularism is a code of duty pertaining to this life, founded on considerations purely human, and intended mainly for those who find theology indefinite or inadequate, unreliable or unbelievable. Its essential principles are three: (1) The improvement of this life by material means. (2) That science is the available Providence of man. (3) That it is good to do good. Whether there be other good or not, the good of the present life is good, and it is good to seek that good.&lt;ref&gt;Holyoake, G.J. (1896). p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DCg0dcD2bBAC&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=%22Secularism+is+a+code+of+duty+pertaining+to+this+life,+founded+on+considerations+purely+human,+and+intended+mainly+for+those+who+find+theology+indefinite+or+inadequate,+unreliable+or+unbelievable.+Its+essential+principles+are+three:%22 37].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Holyoake held that secularism and [[secular ethics]] should take no interest at all in religious questions (as they were irrelevant), and was thus to be distinguished from strong [[freethought]] and atheism. In this he disagreed with [[Charles Bradlaugh]], and the disagreement split the secularist movement between those who argued that anti-religious movements and activism was not necessary or desirable and those who argued that it was.

Contemporary ethical debate in the West is often described as "secular." The work of well known moral philosophers such as [[Derek Parfit]] and [[Peter Singer]], and even the whole field of contemporary bioethics, have been described as explicitly secular or non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher = Clarendon Press |isbn = 0-19-824615-3 |publication-place = Oxford [Oxfordshire] |title = Reasons and persons |url = https://openlibrary.org/books/OL3172889M/Reasons_and_persons |author = Derek Parfit |publication-date = 1984 |id = 0198246153 |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==American interpretation of secularism==
It has been argued that the concept of secularism has frequently been misinterpreted.&lt;ref name=uooavbjacq&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacques-berlinerblau/secularism-is-not-atheism_b_1699588.html|author=Jacques Berlinerblau|title=Secularism Is Not Atheism|journal=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=2012-07-28 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a July 2012 ''[[Huffington Post]]'' article titled ''Secularism Is Not Atheism'', Jacques Berlinerblau, Director of the Program for Jewish Civilization at Georgetown University, wrote that "Secularism must be the most misunderstood and mangled ism in the American political lexicon. Commentators on the right and the left routinely equate it with Stalinism, Nazism and Socialism, among other dreaded isms. In the United States, of late, another false equation has emerged. That would be the groundless association of secularism with atheism. The religious right has profitably promulgated this misconception at least since the 1970s."&lt;ref name=uooavbjacq /&gt;

== Secularism in late 20th century political philosophy ==
It can be seen by many of the organizations (NGO's) for secularism that they prefer to define ''secularism'' as the common ground for all [[life stance]] groups, religious or atheistic, to thrive in a society that honors freedom of speech and conscience. An example of that is the [[National Secular Society]] in the UK.  This is a common understanding of what secularism stands for among many of its activists throughout the world. However, many scholars of Christianity and conservative politicians seem to interpret secularism more often than not, as an antithesis of religion and an attempt to push religion out of society and replace it with [[atheism]] or a void of values, [[nihilism]]. This dual aspect (as noted above in "Secular ethics") has created difficulties in political discourse on the subject. It seems that most political theorists in philosophy following the landmark work of [[John Rawls|John Rawl]]´s ''Theory of Justice'' in 1971 and its following book, ''[[Political Liberalism]]'' (1993),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/948824118|title=Political Liberalism : Expanded Edition|last=Inc.|first=Recorded Books,|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=|isbn=9780231527538|location=|pages=457|oclc=948824118}}&lt;/ref&gt; would rather use the conjoined concept ''overlapping consensus'' rather than secularism. In the latter Rawls holds the idea of an overlapping consensus as one of three main ideas of [[Classical liberalism|political liberalism]]. He argues that the term ''secularism'' cannot apply; &lt;blockquote&gt;But what is a secular argument? Some think of any argument that is reflective and critical, publicly intelligible and rational, as a secular argument; [...], Nevertheless, a central feature of political liberalism is that it views all such arguments the same way it views religious ones, and therefore these secular philosophical doctrines do not provide public reasons. Secular concepts and reasoning of this kind belong to [[Metaphysics|first philosophy]] and [[Ethics|moral doctrine]], and fall outside the domain of the political.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Still, Rawl´s theory is akin to Holyoake´s vision of a tolerant democracy that treats all [[life stance]] groups alike. Rawl´s idea it that it is in everybody´s own interest to endorse "a reasonable constitutional democracy" with "principles of toleration". His work has been highly influential on scholars in political philosophy and his term, ''overlapping consensus'', seems to have for many parts replaced ''secularism'' among them. In textbooks on modern political philosophy, like Colin Farelly´s, ''An Introduction to Contemporary Political Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/290530058|title=Contemporary political theory : a reader|last=Patrick.|first=Farrelly, Colin|date=2004-01-01|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9780761949084|oclc=290530058}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and Will Kymlicka´s, ''Contemporary Political Philosophy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/611694157|title=Contemporary political philosophy : an introduction|last=Will.|first=Kymlicka,|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198782742|oclc=611694157}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term secularism is not even indexed and in the former it can be seen only in one footnote. However, there is no shortage of discussion and coverage of the topic it involves. It is just called ''overlapping consensus, [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralism]]'', ''[[multiculturalism]]'' or expressed in some other way. In The ''Oxford Handbook of Political Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/474737332|title=The Oxford handbook of political theory|last=1953-|first=Dryzek, John S.,|last2=Bonnie.|first2=Honig,|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199270033|location=|pages=636|oclc=474737332}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is one chapter called "Political secularism", by [[Rajeev Bhargava]]. It covers secularism in a global context and starts with this sentence: "Secularism is a beleaguered doctrine."

== Organizations ==
{{main|List of secularist organizations}}

Groups such as the [[National Secular Society]] (United Kingdom) and [[Americans United]] campaign for secularism are often supported by [[Humanism|Humanists]]. In 2005, the National Secular Society held the inaugural "Secularist of the Year" awards ceremony. The award's first winner was [[Maryam Namazie]], of the [[Worker-Communist Party of Iran]] and the [[Central Council of Ex-Muslims#Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain|Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain]]&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Scottish Secular Society]] is active in Scotland and is currently focused on the role of religion in education. In 2013 it raised a petition at the [[Scottish Parliament]] to have the [[Education (Scotland) Act 1980]]  changed so that parents will have to make a positive choice to opt into [[Religious Observance]].

Another secularist organization is the [[Secular Coalition for America]]. The Secular Coalition for America lobbies and advocates for separation of church and state as well as the acceptance and inclusion of Secular Americans in American life and public policy.  While Secular Coalition for America is linked to many secular humanistic organizations and many [[secular humanism|secular humanists]] support it, as with the Secular Society, some non-humanists support it.

Local organizations work to raise the profile of secularism in their communities and tend to include secularists, freethinkers, atheists, agnostics, and humanists under their organizational umbrella.

Student organizations, such as the [[Toronto Secular Alliance]], try to popularize nontheism and secularism on campus.  The [[Secular Student Alliance]] is an educational nonprofit that organizes and aids such high school and college secular student groups.

In Turkey, the most prominent and active secularist organization is [[Atatürkist Thought Association]] (ADD), which is credited for organizing the [[Republic Protests]] – demonstrations in the four largest cities in Turkey in 2007, where over 2 million people, mostly women, defended their concern in and support of secularist principles introduced by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]].

[[Leicester Secular Society]] founded in 1851 is the world's oldest secular society.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20757">'''State capture''' is a type of systemic [[political corruption]] in which private interests significantly influence a [[State (polity)|state's]] decision-making processes to their own advantage.

The term 'state capture' was first used by the [[World Bank]] (c 2000) to describe the situation in central Asian countries making the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|transition]] from [[Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet communism]].  Specifically it was applied to situations where small corrupt groups used their influence over government officials to appropriate government decision making in order to strengthen their own economic positions; these groups would later become known as [[Business oligarch|oligarchs]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.za/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=wJDhDgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT8&amp;dq=%22state+capture%22&amp;ots=8kplIzdID1&amp;sig=JcVONGmjfhSwfJXI2PkaCN3_ha0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22state%20capture%22&amp;f=false|title=Peru: Elite Power and Political Capture|last=Crabtree|first=John|last2=Durand|first2=Francisco|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|year=2017|isbn=978-1-78360-904-8|location=London, United Kingdom|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations of state capture have led to protests against the government in Bulgaria in 2013-2014 and Romania in 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.makeapoint.ro/en/open-letter-romanian-democracy-at-grave-danger/ |title=Romanian Democracy at Grave Danger}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have caused an ongoing controversy in [[South Africa]] beginning in 2016.

==Defining state capture==
The classical definition of state capture refers to the way formal procedures (such as laws and social norms) and government [[bureaucracy]] are manipulated by private individuals and firms so as to influence state policies and laws in their favour.  State capture seeks to influence the formation of laws to protect and promote influential private interests.  In this way it differs from most other forms of corruption which instead seek selective enforcement of already existing laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Duane_Edwards/publication/316608300_Corruption_and_State_Capture_under_two_Regimes_in_Guyana/links/59076cbc4585152d2e9c42ea/Corruption-and-State-Capture-under-two-Regimes-in-Guyana.pdf|title=Corruption and State Capture under two Regimes in Guyana|last=Edwards|first=Duane C.|date=1 May 2017|website=ResearchGate|publisher=University of the West Indies|access-date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State capture may not be illegal, depending on determination by the captured state itself,&lt;ref name="Kaufmann"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Daniel|last2=Vicente|first2=Pedro C|title=Legal Corruption (October 2005)|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTWBIGOVANTCOR/Resources/Legal_Corruption.pdf|accessdate=7 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and might be attempted through private lobbying and influence. The influence may be through a range of state institutions, including the legislature, executive, ministries and the judiciary, or through a corrupt electoral process. It is similar to [[regulatory capture]] but differs in the scale and variety of influenced areas and, unlike regulatory capture, the private influence is never overt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=World Bank| title=Anticorruption in Transition: Contribution to the Policy Debate | publisher=World Bank Publications| year=2000 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpBvS3O17S4C&amp;pg=PA3| isbn=9780821348024}}&lt;/ref&gt; The private influences cannot be discovered by lawful processes,{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} since the legislative process, judiciary, electoral process, and/or executive powers have been subverted.

A distinguishing factor from [[corruption]] is that, while in cases of corruption the outcome (of policy or regulatory decision) is not certain, in cases of state capture the outcome is known and is highly likely to be beneficial to the captors of the state.

Also, in cases of corruption (even rampant) there is plurality and competition of 'corruptors' to influence the outcome of the policy or distribution of resources. However, in state capture, decision-makers are usually more in a position of agents to the principals (captors) who function either in monopolistic or oligopolistic (non-competitive) fashion.

Protests in Bulgaria in 2013–14 against the [[Oresharski]] cabinet were prompted by allegations that it came to power due to the actions of an oligarchic structure (formerly allied to [[Boyko Borisov]]) which used underhand manouevres to discredit the [[Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria|GERB]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://iris-bg.org/files/stID.pdf |title=Политическата криза и дневният ред на промяната (pp.1–2) |accessdate=2 March 2014 |date=17 June 2013 |language=Bulgarian |publisher=iris.bg |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627000204/http://iris-bg.org/files/stID.pdf |archivedate=27 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 there were allegations of an overly close and potentially corrupt relationship between the wealthy [[Gupta family]] and the [[South Africa]]n president [[Jacob Zuma]], his family and leading members of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC).&lt;ref name="rdmAllies"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rdm.co.za/politics/2016/02/01/zuma-allies-break-ranks-with-him-over-guptas | title=Zuma allies 'break ranks' with him over Guptas | publisher=Rand Daily Mail | date=1 February 2016 | accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Symbol"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/stnews/2015/12/17/Gupta-family-seen-as-symbol-of-Zuma%E2%80%99s-failing-rule | title=Gupta family seen as symbol of Zuma's failing rule | publisher=Sunday Times | date=17 December 2015 | accessdate=9 February 2016 | author=Wild, Franz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcGupta"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-22513410 | title=Who are the Guptas? | publisher=BBC | date=14 May 2013 | accessdate=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DMgupta"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2016-02-01-keeping-up-with-the-guptas-whats-behind-the-anti-saxonwold-revolt | title=Keeping Up with the Guptas: What's behind the anti-Saxonwold revolt | publisher=[[Daily Maverick]] | date=1 February 2016 | accessdate=9 February 2016 | author=Munusamy, Ranjeni}}&lt;/ref&gt; South African Opposition parties have made claims of "State Capture" following allegations that the Guptas, said to be close to President Jacob Zuma, his family and other ANC leaders, had insinuated themselves into a position where they could offer Cabinet positions and influence the running of government.&lt;ref name="N24statecapture"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/Politics/parliament-must-deal-with-state-capture-da-20160327 | title= Parliament must deal with 'state capture' – DA | publisher=News24.com | date=27 March 2016 | accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These allegations were made in light of revelations by former ANC MP [[Vytjie Mentor]] and Deputy Finance Minister [[Mcebisi Jonas]] that they had been offered Cabinet positions by the Guptas at the family's home in Saxonwold, Johannesburg.&lt;ref name="N24zumarelationship"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/zuma-defends-relationship-with-guptas-report-20160323 | title= Zuma defends relationship with Guptas – report| publisher=News24.com | date=23 March 2016 | accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This came a few days before a cabinet reshuffle in which minister [[Barbara Hogan]] (then Minister of [[Department of Public Enterprises|Public Enterprises]]) was dismissed by Zuma.

Deputy Finance Minister [[Mcebisi Jonas]] said he had been offered a ministerial position by the Guptas shortly before the dismissal of Finance Minister [[Nhlanhla Nene]] in December 2015, but had rejected the offer as "it makes a mockery of our hard-earned democracy‚ the trust of our people and no one apart from the President of the Republic appoints ministers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/news/2016/03/16/full-statement-by-deputy-finance-minister-mcebisi-jonas-on-gupta-job-offer|title=Full statement by Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas on Gupta job offer|date=16 March 2016|publisher=The Sowetan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gupta family denied offering Jonas the job of Finance Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Gupta family denies offering Jonas South Africa's finance minister role |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN0WI2J7 |newspaper=Reuters |location= |date=16 March 2016 |access-date=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, Jacob Zuma denied the allegation of blocking an attempt to set up a commission of inquiry to probe state capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/special-features/the-zuma-era/zuma-denies-blocking-state-capture-probe-9381582|title=Zuma denies blocking state capture probe {{!}} IOL News|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guptas' alleged "state capture" was investigated by [[Public Protector (South Africa)|Public Protector]] [[Thuli Madonsela]]. President Zuma and Minister [[David van Rooyen|Des van Rooyen]] applied for a [[court order]] to prevent the publication of the report on 14 October 2016, Madonsela's last day in office.&lt;ref name=statecapture&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.enca.com/south-africa/zuma-interdicts-madonselas-state-capture-report|title=Zuma halts Madonsela's state capture report|date=13 October 2016|publisher=eNCA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van Rooyen's application was dismissed, and the President withdrew his application, leading to the release of the report on 2 November 2016. The report recommended establishment of a judicial commission of enquiry into the issues identified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ewn.co.za/2016/11/03/madonsela-broadens-investigating-scope-of-future-judicial-commission-of-inquiry|title=State Capture Report: What John Cena Wants Inquiry to Probe|publisher=EWN|date=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a full probe of Zuma's dealings with the Guptas, with findings to be published within 180 days.

On 25 November 2016, Zuma announced that the Presidency would be reviewing the contents of the state capture report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://city-press.news24.com/News/zuma-to-take-state-capture-report-on-review-20161125|title=Zuma to take state capture report on review|newspaper=CityPress|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said it "was done in a funny way" with "no fairness at all," and argued he was not given enough time to respond to the public protector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://citizen.co.za/news/news-national/1357691/zuma-take-madonselas-state-capture-report-review/|title=Zuma to launch a review on Madonsela's state capture report|last=Williams|first=Denise|newspaper=The Citizen|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 September 2017 the former Finance Minister, [[Pravin Gordhan]], estimated the cost of state capture at 250 billion Rand, in a presentation at the [[University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/1651069/r250bn-lost-to-state-capture-in-the-last-three-years-says-gordhan/|title=R250bn lost to state capture in the last three years, says Gordhan|last=reporter|first=Citizen|work=The Citizen|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 November 2017,  in an exclusive interview with [[ANN7]] (belonging to the [[Gupta Family]]), South African President [[Jacob Zuma]] said 'State Capture' was a fancy word used by media houses for propaganda proliferation. He said that a real state capture would include seizure of the three arms of the constitution - Legislative, Executive and Judiciary - which has never been the case in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Africa News Network 7 TV|title=#StraightTalk: ANN7 exclusive interview with Pres Jacob Zuma|date=2017-11-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MITFfskDJR4|accessdate=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book [[How to Steal a City]] details state capture within the [[Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality]] in South Africa and takes place during the Zuma government.

===Hungary===
The captured state of Hungary started after 2010. The former main opposition party won the 2/3rd of the mandates in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|parliamentary election]]. The manipulation of the constitutional law and the Constitutional Court became possible. The parliamentary election laws was later tailored also to the purpose of the new governmental party. Step by step, the different institutional applications, competitions, and tenders have been won almost exclusively by organisations and individuals loyal to the government. The winners have been frequently the relatives of the governmental staff or connected with them. The managements of different institutions have been filled with persons loyal to the government. Independent applicants have been rejected without explanation or by created formal causes. The incomes of the government independent media had been dried up. These have been ceased with scarce exemptions.&lt;ref name="bbcNepszabadsag"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-37596805 | title=Hungary's largest paper Nepszabadsag shuts, alleging pressure | publisher=BBC | date=11 October 2016 | accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reutersMN"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-election-media/major-hungarian-opposition-newspaper-to-close-after-orban-victory-idUSKBN1HH10S | title=Major Hungarian opposition newspaper to close after Orban victory | publisher=Reuters | date=10 April 2018 | accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subventions and advertisement expenditures of the state owned and government loyal companies have been directed to the purpose of the widely accessible propagandistic state media and to the government loyal press. The majority of the Hungarian population can only access government influenced radio stations. Only a single government independent television channel have been tolerated as a source of unfiltered news. The propaganda applies classical "[[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]]" cunnings. It regularly use war termini, and show up two typical imaginary public enemies: "[[Immigration|migrant]]s" and "[[George Soros]]".&lt;ref name="governmentinfo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kormany.hu/en/the-prime-minister/news/george-soros-and-his-network-are-doing-everything-possible-to-overthrow-governments-that-are-resisting-immigration | title=George Soros and his network are doing everything possible to overthrow governments that are resisting immigration | publisher=kormany.hu Cabinet Office of the Prime Minister | date=10 March 2018 | accessdate=8 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altogether these proceedings provided additional 2/3rd victories for the governmental party&lt;ref&gt;[[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2018]]&lt;/ref&gt; and more unrestricted possibilities for the administration.

'''Theories of political behavior''', as an aspect of [[political science]], attempt to quantify and explain the influences that define a person's political views, [[ideology]], and levels of political participation. Broadly speaking, behavior is political whenever individuals or groups try to influence or escape the influence of others. Political behavior is the subset of human behavior that involves politics and powers.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, William Roberts, Matt Golder, and Sona N. Golder. 2013. “Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.”&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists who have had an influence on this field include [[Karl Deutsch]] and [[Theodor Adorno]].

==Long-term influences on political orientation==
Interaction with the political views of parental figures is often thought of as the primary long-term influence on political orientation and willingness to take part in the political system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gidengil|first=Elisabeth|last2=Wass|first2=Hanna|last3=Valaste|first3=Maria|date=June 2016|title=Political Socialization and Voting: The Parent-Child Link in Turnout|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44018017|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=69|pages=373-383|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/14515/teens-stay-true-parents-political-perspectives.aspx|title=Teens Stay True to Parents' Political Perspectives|last=Inc.|first=Gallup,|work=Gallup.com|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Teacher]]s and other educational authority figures are also often thought to have a significant impact on political orientation. During the 2003-2004 school year, In the United States, students spent an average of 180.4 days in primary and secondary education each year, with a school day being defined as approximately 6.7 class hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/tables/table_2004_06.asp|title=Private School Universe Survey (PSS)|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that on average a student will spend around 1,208.68 hours in class each year. [[Post-secondary education]] appears to have an impact on both voting rates and political identification; as a study of 9,784,931 college students found that they voted at a rate of 68.5% in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://idhe.tufts.edu/nslve/2016|title=2016 NSLVE National Data|last=|first=|date=2017-09-18|website=Institute for Democracy &amp; Higher Education|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to the average of 46.1% for citizens aged 18-29 who voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html|title=Voting in America:  A Look at the 2016 Presidential Election|last=Bureau|first=US Census|work=The United States Census Bureau|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Peers also affect political orientation. Friends often, but not necessarily, have the advantage of being part of the same generation, which collectively develops a unique set of societal issues; Eric L. Dey has argued that "socialisation is the process through which individuals acquire knowledge, habits, and value orientations that will be useful in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Dey, Eric L., ''Undergraduate Political Attitudes: Peer Influence in Changing Social Contexts'', Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 68, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to relate on this common level is what fuels and enables future ideological growth.

Sociologists and political scientists debate the relationship between age and the formation of political attitudes. The [[impressionable years hypothesis]] postulates that political orientation is solidified during early adulthood. By contrast, the "increasing persistence hypothesis" posits that attitudes become less likely to change as individuals become older, while the "life-long openness hypothesis" proposes that the attitudes of individuals remain flexible regardless of age.&lt;ref name="krosnick1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krosnick|first1=Jon A.|last2=Alwin|first2=Duane F.|title=Aging and Susceptibility to Attitude Change|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1989|volume=57|issue=3|pages=416–425|url=https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/1989-Aging-and-Att-Change-Krosnick-and-Alwin.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short-term influences on political orientation==
Short-term factors also affect [[voting behavior]]; the [[mass media|media]] and the impact of individual [[election]] issues are among these factors. These factors differ from the long-term factors as they are often short-lived. However, they can be just as crucial in modifying political orientation. The ways in which these two sources are interpreted often relies on the individuals specific political ideology formed by the long-term factors.

Most [[political scientist]]s agree that the mass media have a profound impact on voting behavior. One author asserts that "few would argue with the notion that the institutions of the mass media are important to contemporary politics ... in the transition to liberal democratic politics in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern Europe]] the media was a key battleground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://guidetowinningelections.com/do-mass-media-influence-the-political-behavior-of-citizens/|title=Do Mass Media Influence the Political Behavior of Citizens|date=2013-11-26|work=The Guide to Winning Elections|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, there are election issues. These include campaign issues, debates and commercials. Election years and political campaigns can shift certain political behaviors based on the candidates involved, which have different degrees of effectiveness in influencing voters.

==The influence of social groups on political outcomes==
Recently, some political scientists have been interested in many studies which aimed to analyze the relation between the behavior of social groups and the political outcomes. Some of the social groups included in their studies have been age demographics, [[gender]], and [[ethnic groups]].

For example, in [[U.S. politics]], the effect of ethnic groups and gender has a great influence on the political outcomes.

[[Latin Americans]] have a profound social impact on the political outcome of their vote and are emerging as a strong up-and-coming political force. The most noticeable increase in Latin American voting was in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], although the votes did not share a socially common political view at that time. In the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 election]], the Latin American vote aided tremendously in the election of [[Florida]] [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[Mel Martinez]], although in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], about 44% of Latin Americans voted for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[George W. Bush]]. However, Latin Americans have the lowest voting rate in the United States, with only 47.6% voting in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2017/05/voting_in_america.html|title=Voting in America:  A Look at the 2016 Presidential Election|last=Bureau|first=US Census|work=The United States Census Bureau|access-date=2018-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently illegal immigration has been claiming the most attention and Latin Americans, although not completely unanimous, are concerned with the education, employment and deportation of illegal immigrants in the United States. Although the majority of Latin Americans vote for [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates, [[Cuban Americans]] are likely the most conservative of Latinos, with 54% of Cuban American voters casting ballots for [[Donald Trump]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]], compared to an average of 35% of all Latinos who voted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/15/unlike-other-latinos-about-half-of-cuban-voters-in-florida-backed-trump/|title=About half of Cuban voters in Florida backed Trump|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was represents a net decrease in support for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] among Cuban Americans, it continues a trend created by the [[Cuban exile|exile of many Cubans]] after the [[Cuban Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/op-ed/articles/2016-11-16/2016-highlighted-the-growing-complexity-of-the-cuban-american-vote|title=The Complex Cuban Vote|last=Lopez-Gottardi|first=Cristina|date=2016-11-16|work=U.S. News|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[African Americans]] have the second highest voting rates in the United States and even surpassed white voters in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential Election]], although this has declined in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 Presidential Election]]. In the 2008 Presidential Election and [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 Presidential election]], African Americans voted overwhelmingly for Democratic candidate, [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2008/|title=How Groups Voted in 2008 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/how-groups-voted-2012/|title=How Groups Voted in 2012 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend of African Americans voting for candidates of the Democratic Party continued into the 2016 Presidential Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/how-groups-voted/groups-voted-2016/|title=How Groups Voted 2016 - Roper Center|work=Roper Center|access-date=2018-11-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biology and political science ==
Interdisciplinary studies in [[biology and political science]] aim to identify correlates of political behavior with biological aspects, for example the linkage of [[biology and political orientation]], but also with other aspects like [[partisanship]] and [[voting behavior]].&lt;ref name="SomitPeterson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Albert Somit|author2=Steven A. Peterson|title=Biology and Political Behavior: The Brain, Genes and Politics - The Cutting Edge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__M0gG5kWg8C&amp;pg=PA232|year=2011|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-0-85724-580-9|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of study is typically referred to [[genopolitics]] although it is sometimes referred to as [[biopolitics]],&lt;ref name="Blank2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Blank|title=Biology and Political Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAXYIkbWxawC|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-20436-1|quote=This book demonstrates the increasing convergence of interest of some social scientists in the theories, research and findings of the life sciences in building a more interdisciplinary approach to the study of politics. It discusses the development of biopolitics as an academic perspective within political science, reviews the growing literature in biopolitics, and presents a coherent view of biopolitics as a framework for structuring inquiry across the current subfields of political science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the term has other meanings.

The study of possible genetic bases of political behavior has grown since the 1980s. The term [[genopolitics]] was coined by political scientist [[James H. Fowler|James Fowler]] in the early-2000s to describe research into identifying specific transporter/receptor genes responsible for ideological orientation beyond the sociopsychological realm of political socialisation.

==Political participation==

Political scientists also aim to understand what drives individuals to participate in the democratic process, either by voting, volunteering for campaigns, signing petitions or protesting. Participation cannot always be explained by rational behavior. The [[voting paradox]], for example, points out that it cannot be in a citizen's self-interest to vote because the effort it takes to vote will almost always outweigh the benefits of voting, particularly considering a single vote is unlikely to change an electoral outcome. Political scientists instead propose that citizens vote for psychological or social reasons. Studies show, for example, that individuals are more likely to vote if they see their friends have voted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Corbyn |first1=Zoe |title=Facebook experiment boosts US voter turnout |url=https://www.nature.com/news/facebook-experiment-boosts-us-voter-turnout-1.11401 |website=Nature |accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if someone in their household has received a nudge to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nickerson |first1=David |title=Is Voting Contagious?

This is a '''timeline of Philippine elections''', in which the parties of the [[President of the Philippines|President]], [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]], [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]] and [[Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives|House Speaker]] at the time of the elections are displayed.

Note that in-house "coups" are common in the bicameral legislature in which several members jump ship to another party which would alter the balance between the parties and can lead to new house leaders, or they simply refuse the follow their party lines. Also, with the advent of the multi-party system in 1986, not one party was able to form a majority hence they instead formed coalitions from other parties.

==Illustrated==
[[Jose P. Laurel]]'s term is marked as between the orange lines.

{{Wiktionary|unanimity|unanimous}}
'''Unanimity''' is agreement by all people in a given situation. Groups may consider unanimous decisions as a sign of agreement, solidarity, and unity. Unanimity may be assumed explicitly after a unanimous [[voting|vote]] or implicitly by a lack of objections. It does not necessarily mean uniformity and can sometimes be the opposite of majority in terms of outcomes.

==Voting==
Practice varies as to whether a vote can be considered unanimous if some voter [[abstention|abstains]]. In ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'', a "unanimous vote" is not specifically defined, although an abstention is not counted as a vote regardless of the voting threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.robertsrules.com/faq.html#6|title = Frequently Asked Questions about RONR (Question 6)|accessdate = 2015-12-27|website = The Official Robert's Rules of Order Web Site|publisher = The Robert's Rules Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in this book, action could be taken by "[[unanimous consent]]", or "general consent", if there are no objections raised.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 54–56|edition = 11th|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unanimous consent may not necessarily be the same as a unanimous vote (see [[Unanimous consent#Not the same as unanimous vote|Not the same as unanimous vote]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In either case, it does not take into account the members who were not present.

In contrast, a [[United Nations Security Council resolution]] is not considered "unanimous" if a member abstains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/4690652a351277438525634c006dce10!OpenDocument |title=Resolution 904 |date=18 March 1994 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Note 7: The result of the voting on the second and sixth preambular paragraphs of the draft resolution S/1994/280 was as follows: 14 in favour, none against and 1 abstention (United States of America); all the other paragraphs were approved unanimously. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210062143/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/4690652a351277438525634c006dce10!OpenDocument |archivedate=February 10, 2008 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[European Union]], the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] introduced the concept of "constructive abstention", where a member can abstain in a vote where unanimity is required without thereby blocking the success of the vote. This is intended to allow states to symbolically withhold support while not paralysing decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Philippart |first=E. |author2=Monika Sie Dhian Ho  |title=Nederland en de Europese grondwet |editor=Jacques Pelkmans |editor2=Monika Sie |editor3=Dhian Ho |editor4=Bas Limonard |publisher=[[Amsterdam University]] Press |location=Amsterdam |date=2003 |pages=128–136 |chapter=Flexibility and the new constitutional treaty of the European Union |isbn=90-5356-656-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracies===
The occurrence of unanimity in a [[representative democracy]] can be elusive with the [[Diversity (politics)|diversity]] and variety of opinions in a [[participatory democracy]]. Unanimity is often a political endeavor. Although governments and [[international organization]]s may occasionally achieve unanimous decisions, [[popular consent]] is most often a more achievable aspiration for elected officials.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; Agreements do occur between political parties, governments and international organizations, infrequent it may seem nevertheless.|date=October 2012}}

===Dictatorships===
The legitimacy supposedly established by unanimity has been used by dictatorial regimes in an attempt to gain support for their position. Participants in a legislature may be coerced or intimidated into supporting the position of a dictator, with the legislature becoming little more than a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]] for a more powerful authority.

[[One-party state]]s can restrict nominees to one per seat in elections and use [[compulsory voting]] or [[electoral fraud]] to create an impression of popular unanimity. The [[North Korean parliamentary elections, 1962]] reported a 100% [[Voter turnout|turnout]] and a 100% vote for the [[Workers' Party of Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=McFarlan |first=Donald |author2=[[Norris McWhirter]]  |title=[[Guinness Book of World Records]] |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |date=1990 |page=361 |chapter=Most One-Sided Elections |isbn=0-553-28452-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 100% votes have also been claimed by [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] in [[Guinea]] in 1975 and 1982, [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]] in [[Côte d'Ivoire]] in 1985, and [[Saddam Hussein]] in [[Iraq]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A37348-2002Oct16?language=printer |title=Claiming 100 Percent Vote for Hussein, Iraq Hails Its 'Democracy' |last=Chandrasekaran |first=Rajiv |date=2002-10-17 |work=[[Washington Post]] |page=A14 |accessdate=2009-01-30}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juries===
In [[criminal law]] [[jury trial]]s, many jurisdictions require a guilty verdict by a jury to be unanimous. This is not so in [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] jury trials.

The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Apodaca v. Oregon]]'' that the Due Process Clause of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] does not require jury unanimity in [[State court (United States)|state courts]], with a [[concurring opinion]] that the [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment to the Constitution]] mandates unanimity for a guilty verdict in a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] jury trial.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Apodaca v. Oregon]]'', {{ussc|406|404|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notwithstanding this, many U.S. states do require jury unanimity for a finding of guilty; for example, article 21 of the [[Maryland Constitution]]'s Declaration of Rights states:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/mdmanual/43const/html/00dec.html#20 |title=Maryland Constitution - Declaration of Rights |date=4 November 2008 |publisher=Maryland Government |accessdate=2009-01-30}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation|
That in all criminal prosecutions, every man hath a right to be informed of the accusation against him; to have a copy of the Indictment, or charge, in due time (if required) to prepare for his defence; to be allowed counsel; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have process for his witnesses; to examine the witnesses for and against him on oath; and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty.}}

[[Jury (England and Wales)|In England and Wales]], since the Juries Act 1974, a guilty verdict may be returned where not more than 2 jurors dissent.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''Universal Monarchy''' is a concept and a political situation where one monarchy is deemed to have either sole rule over everywhere (or at least the predominant part of a [[geopolitical]] area or areas) or to have a special supremacy over all other states (or at least all the states in a geopolitical area or areas).

==Concept==

Universal Monarchy is differentiated from ordinary [[monarchy]] in that a Universal Monarchy is beholden to no other state and asserts a degree of total sovereignty over an area, or predominance over other states.

The concept has arisen in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. The concept is linked to that of [[Empire]], but implies more than simply possessing ''[[imperium]]''.

The Latin phrase ''Dominus Mundi'', Lord of the World, encapsulates the concept. Though in practice no Universal Monarchy ever held rule over the whole world, it may have appeared to many people, particularly pre-modern, that it did.

Critical of the concept in Europe in the Middle Ages were philosophers such as [[Nicole Oresme]]&lt;ref&gt;Mastnak, Tomaž ''Crusading peace: Christendom, the Muslim world, and Western political order'' University of California Press (2002) p329&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erasmus]];&lt;ref&gt;Persson, Hans-Åke &amp;  Stråth, Bo ''Reflections on Europe: defining a political order in time and space'' Peter Lang (2007) pp51-52&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Dante]] and [[Guillaume Postel]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz, Marion Leathers ''Guillaume Postel, prophet of the restitution of all things: his life and thought'' Springer (1981) p171&lt;/ref&gt; were more favourable. Later, [[Protestants]] would seek to reject the concept, identifying it with [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Simms, Brendan &amp; Riotte, Torsten (Editors) ''The Hanoverian dimension in British History, 1714-1837'' Cambridge University Press (2007) pp168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe the expression of a Universal Monarchy as actual total ''imperium'' can be seen in the [[Roman Empire]], and as the predominate ‘sole sovereign’ state during its [[Byzantine]] period, where the Emperor by virtue of being the head of [[Christendom]] claimed a sovereignty over all other kings even though in practice this could not be enforced. The Byzantine conception went through two phases, initially as expounded by [[Eusebius]] that just as there was one God so there could only be one Emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, D.M. ''Byzantine political thought'' in Burns, J. H.  ''The Cambridge history of medieval political thought c. 350-c. 1450'' Cambridge University Press 1988 pp52-53&lt;/ref&gt; which developed in the 10th century into the conception of the Emperor as the ''[[paterfamilias]]'' of a family of kings who were the other rulers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, D.M. ''Byzantine political thought'' in Burns, J. H.  ''The Cambridge history of medieval political thought c. 350-c. 1450'' Cambridge University Press 1988 p57&lt;/ref&gt;  Such concepts were a feature of the [[Ottoman Empire]] successor state, particularly when military rule was augmented by the [[Caliphate]].

The idea of a sole sovereign Emperor would re-emerge in the West with [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, James ''The Holy Roman Empire'' p209&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of the Holy Roman Empire possessing a special sovereignty as a Universal Monarchy was respected by the surrounding powers and subject states, even when that Empire had undergone severe fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Brissaud, Jean ''A History of French Public Law'' John Murray (1915) p77&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbolism of the [[A.E.I.O.U.]] phrase of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] can be seen as an expression of the idea of all states being subject to one monarchy.

[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]’s empire, encompassing much of western Europe and the Americas “was the nearest the post-classical world would come to seeing a truly world-wide monarchy, and hence the closest approximation to universal imperium” since the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, David ''The Ideological Origins of the British Empire'' Cambridge University Press (2000) p32&lt;/ref&gt; It was envisaged by its supporters as a world empire that could be religiously inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Ocker, Christopher,  Printy ,Michael &amp;  Starenko, Peter (Editors) ''Politics and Reformations: Communities, Politics, Nations, and Empires'' Brill Academic Publishers (2007), 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the idea of a Universal Monarchy based on predominance rather than actual total rule would become synonymous with France attempting to establish hegemony over western Europe, particularly under [[Louis XIV]],&lt;ref&gt;Simms, Brendan &amp; Riotte, Torsten (Editors)''The Hanoverian dimension in British History, 1714-1837'' Cambridge University Press (2007) p168&lt;/ref&gt; exemplified by the concept of Louis XIV as the 'Sun King' around which all the other monarchs became subordinate satellites. In 1755, during the reign of Louis XIV's successor [[Louis XV]], Duke [[Adrien Maurice de Noailles]], a member of the Council of State and formerly a key foreign policy advisor to the king, warned of a British challenge for "the first rank in Europe" through the domination of Atlantic commerce. Noailles wrote "However chimerical the project of universal monarchy might be, that of a universal influence by means of wealth would cease to be a chimera if a nation succeeded in making itself sole mistress of the trade of America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shovlin |first=John |date=2010 |title=Selling American Empire on the Eve of the Seven Years War: The French Propaganda Campaign of 1755-1756 |journal=Past and Present |volume=206 |issue=1 |pages=121–149 |doi=10.1093/pastj/gtp046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal Monarchy would flourish at either end of Europe, in Britain and Russia. The Russian Universal Monarchy was [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Autocracy|autocratic]] and possessed a vast contiguous empire throughout Europe and Asia and can be seen to have similarities and differences with Byzantine rule.&lt;ref&gt;Gavrov, Sergey [http://ru.wikipedia.org/?oldid=48502217]''Modernization of the Empire. Social and Cultural Aspects of Modernization Processes in Russia'' URSS (2004) p50&lt;/ref&gt; The British Universal Monarchy was “[[Protestant]], commercial, maritime and free”&lt;ref&gt;see Armitage, David ''The Ideological Origins of the British Empire'' Cambridge University Press (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and was not composed of contiguous territory. It had both similarities and difference with the [[Spanish Empire]]. Whereas [[Catholicism]] provided ideological unity for the Spanish Empire, British Protestant diversity would lead to “disunity rather than unity”.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, David ''The Ideological Origins of the British Empire'' Cambridge University Press (2000) p66&lt;/ref&gt;  It was only later that [[federalism]] and economic control was seen as a means to provide unity where religious diversity could not, as with the idea of [[Imperial Federation]] as promoted by [[Joseph Chamberlain]].

[[Napoleon]] came close to creating something akin to a Universal Monarchy with his [[continental system]] and [[Napoleonic Code]], but he failed to conquer all of Europe. The last attempt to create a European Universal Monarchy was that attempted by [[Imperial Germany]] in [[World War I]]. If Germany had been victorious, the German Kaiser would have been suzerain over most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Fritz. ''Germany's Aims in the First World War''. (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niall, Ferguson, ''Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
A parallel process occurred in Asia. Whereas in the West the title of Emperor had by the 19th century largely been stripped of religious connotations and had come to be seen purely in political terms, the title in eastern Asia is almost entirely a religious one, commonly stated as "the [[son of heaven]]". Here the title denotes a higher, "heavenly" rule ("celestial empire"), in contrast to kings who rule between heaven and earth, and by extension today to presidents who are mere base earthly rulers. Imperial China was a Universal Monarchy where all other monarchs were regarded as tributary. The concept was taken up by the Mongols,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Robert''Storm from the East: from Genghis Khan to Khubilai Khan'' University of California Press (1993)p156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sicker, Martin ''The Islamic world in ascendancy: from the Arab conquests to the siege of Vienna'' Greenwood Press (2000) p107&lt;/ref&gt; who under [[Genghis Khan]] were able to enforce this concept more widely than China. The Japanese attempt to unify South East Asia in the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] under the [[Shōwa emperor]] follows the model set by Imperial Germany and Joseph Chamberlain of imperial rule based on economic union, matched with Japanese religious ideas.

The Hindu/Buddhist concept of the [[Chakravartin]] is a perfect illustration of the ideal of a Universal Monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Bhandarkar, D. R. ''Lectures on the Ancient History of India from 650–325 B.C.'' University of Calcutta (1919) pp85–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beér, Robert ''The encyclopedia of Tibetan symbols and motifs'' Serindia Publications 2nd Revised edition(2004) pp160–161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Pennsylvania Voter Laws==

If a citizen consistently votes in Pennsylvania, they do not need to re-register before the next election except to update information such as address, name, party if anything has changed. In order to become a registered voter in Pennsylvania, one must obtain US citizenship at least one month prior to the election date, be at least 18 years old by the next election date, and live in the district they will be voting in for at least 30 days prior to the election date. Those in prison for a felony are not permitted to vote, but one can vote if they are on parole or probation. To be eligible to vote, one must complete registration a minimum of 30 days prior to the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motor Voter Law|url=http://www.dmv.pa.gov/Information-Centers/Laws-Regulations/Pages/Motor-Voter-Law.aspx|website=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently in Pennsylvania, no identification is required if it is not one’s first time voting, and they should not be asked to provide any form of identification. If it is one’s first time voting, or voting in a particular district, they will be required to show some form of identification. Acceptable forms of identification include: driver’s license; US passport; military, student, or employee ID; voter registration card; firearm permit; current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck or government check; any other form of identification issued by the commonwealth or federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voting in Pennsylvania|url=https://www.pa.gov/guides/voting-and-elections/|website=PA.gov|publisher=Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no documents are required to vote in Pennsylvania, voters are asked to provide their signature to verify with a signature kept on file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Underhill|first1=Wendy|title=Voter Identification Requirements {{!}} Voter ID Laws|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/voter-id.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Voter ID Law==

On March 14th, 2012, Republican Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett signed a Voter ID bill into law, after it had been passed by the Pennsylvania State Legislature. The Voter ID law would require everyone who sought to vote to have specified types of photo identification before they could vote. The bill was pushed for and passed by Republican legislators who claimed that the bill was imperative to preventing voter fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Tracy|title=Voters Wrongly Asked for ID at the Polls in Pennsylvania|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/card/voters-wrongly-asked-id-polls-pennsylvania-n679791|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=NBC News|publisher=NBC News|date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, the Voter ID law was one of the most prohibitive in the entire country&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania's Voter ID Law Found Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclupa.org/news/2014/01/17/pennsylvanias-voter-id-law-found-unconstitutional|website=ACLU Pennsylvania|publisher=ACLU Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics of the law claimed that this would prevent groups such as the older population and minorities from voting as they would be less likely to possess or be able to obtain the kinds of identifications specified by the law. This was substantiated in 2014 when a 2012 video of then Majority Leader Mike Turzai was leaked. In the recording, he described the passage of the Voter ID law as a successful plan to help Mitt Romney’s chances of winning Pennsylvania in the 2012 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Everything you need to know about the Pennsylvania voter ID fight|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2012/10/02/the-pennsylvania-voter-id-fight-explained/|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=The Washington Post|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics also cited data from the Commonwealth that showed they had no evidence to corroborate the claim that voter fraud was a large issue as they had zero cases of a casting of a fraudulent vote on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania's Voter ID Law Found Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclupa.org/news/2014/01/17/pennsylvanias-voter-id-law-found-unconstitutional|website=ACLU Pennsylvania|publisher=ACLU Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

=== Constitutional challenge ===

When the Voter ID bill was taken to court in 2012, it was initially upheld by Commonwealth Judge Robert Simpson. Judge Simpson did say that Mike Turzai’s comments about the law concerned him, but despite his concern, he decided to uphold the law because regardless of what burdens it placed on people, the verbiage of the law and its implementation applied its stipulations to everybody in the state. He also argued that although he did see how it could impose upon the liberty of the voters, he felt that the actual purpose of the law was fair and outweighed the costs of its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richey|first1=W|title=Why judge refused to block Pennsylvania voter ID law|agency=The Christian Science Monitor|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court, but sent back to Simpson who then issued a decision saying that the law would not be implemented for the 2012 election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laslo|first1=B|title=Commentary: Real fraud is in Pennsylvania Voter ID law|agency=The Daily Record|publisher=The Daily Record}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Voter ID law while technically in effect was not enforced at polling places in 2012l&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pennsylvania's Voter ID Law Found Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclupa.org/news/2014/01/17/pennsylvanias-voter-id-law-found-unconstitutional|website=ACLU Pennsylvania|publisher=ACLU Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A group of civil rights and legal organizations banded together to contest the law in court. Their goal was to have the law struck down by the 2012 presidential elections, as they felt the law was more about Republican advantage than preventing voter fraud, however it was not decided until 2014{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}. The official lawsuit was Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The group of rights organizations represented 10 plaintiffs, all of which would be prevented from voting in the 2012 presidential election if the Voter ID law would be allowed to remain in place. Vic Walczak, a representative from the Pennsylvania ACLU, argued on behalf of these plaintiffs and pointed out that people who will not be able to produce the necessary forms of identification mostly fit into two categories: annual income of less than $20,000 and not possessing a GED. Hispanics and women were also populations with large amounts facing difficulty with obtaining these proper forms of identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gaynor|first1=Gerren Keith|title=Coalition files lawsuit against Pennsylvania voter ID law|agency=New York New Amsterdam Times|publisher=New York New Amsterdam Times|date=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was heard by Honorable Bernard L. McGinley. McGinley declared the law to be unconstitutional, and that it placed unfair pressure on the rights of the citizen to vote and participate in elections as it required such specific forms of identification to cast a ballot, types of IDs that were not necessarily feasible for everyone to obtain or were equally accessible. He ruled that the law could not be put into action. In his opinion, he alluded to the fact that although the law did not specifically target people through its language, it would disenfranchise certain groups and people who had more trouble obtaining the necessary identification required under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Full Order|url=https://www.pubintlaw.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Voter-ID-Final-Order.pdf|website=The Public Interest Law Center|publisher=The Public Interest Law Center|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGinley also said in his decision that the state’s argument that photo identification was necessary to prove people’s identities and protect the elections did not clearly show a link between photo IDs and safer, better elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malloy|first1=Allie|title=Judge strikes down Pennsylvania voter ID law, calls it burdensome|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/01/17/politics/pennsylvania-voter-id-law/index.html|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=CNN|publisher=CNN|date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fallout===
The decision in Applewhite v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania against the Voter ID law led to similar challenges to voter ID laws in Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Ari|title=Pennsylvania Ruling Shows the Problem With Voter ID Laws|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/pennsylvania-ruling-shows-problem-voter-id-laws/|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=The Nation|publisher=The Nation|date=January 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the 2012 Voter ID law in Pennsylvania had been struck down in 2014, people were still experiencing problems with being asked for identification beyond their voter card when they went to the polls for the 2016 presidential election. There were several reports from people across the state that they had been asked for some form of identification that was not required under law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Tracy|title=Voters Wrongly Asked for ID at the Polls in Pennsylvania|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/card/voters-wrongly-asked-id-polls-pennsylvania-n679791|accessdate=19 March 2018|agency=NBC News|publisher=NBC News|date=November 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
