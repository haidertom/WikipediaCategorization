They noted that raw food eaten by the patient may have been contaminated by rats. In 1955, Mackerass and Sanders identified the lifecycle of the worm in rats, defining snails and slugs as the intermediate hosts and noting the path of transmission through the blood, brain, and lungs in rats.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Epidemiology and pathogenesis==
Following World War II, ''A. cantonensis'' spread throughout Southeast Asia and Western Pacific Islands, including [[Australia]], [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], and [[Polynesia]]. Cases were soon reported in [[New Caledonia]], the [[Philippines]],  [[Rarotonga]], [[Saipan]], [[Sumatra]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Tahiti]]. In the 1960s, even more cases were reported from the region from locations such as [[Cambodia]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], [[Java]], [[Thailand]], [[Sarawak]], [[Vietnam]], and the New Hebrides ([[Vanuatu]]).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf|title=EOSINOPHILIC MENINGITIS|last=|first=|date=2018-03-09|website=louisiana.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615214313/http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-15|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, an [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] study of eosinophilic meningitis in humans was conducted by Rosen, Laigret, and Bories, who hypothesized that the parasite causing these infections was carried by fish. However, Alicata noted that raw fish was consumed by large numbers of people in Hawaii without apparent consequences, and patients presenting with meningitis symptoms had a history of eating raw snails or [[prawn]]s in the weeks before presenting with symptoms. This observation, along with epidemiology and [[autopsy]] of infected brains, confirmed ''A. cantonensis'' infection in humans as the cause of the majority of eosinophilic meningitis cases in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alicata|first=J.E.|title=The discovery of Angiostrongylus cantonensis as a cause of human eosinophilic meningitis|journal=Parasitology Today|volume=7|issue=6|pages=151–153|doi=10.1016/0169-4758(91)90285-v|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, cases of ''A. cantonensis'' infestations have appeared in  [[American Samoa]], Australia, [[Hong Kong]], [[Bombay]], [[Fiji]], Hawaii, [[Honshu]], [[India]], [[Kyushu]], [[New Britain]], [[Okinawa]], [[Ryukyu Islands]], [[Western Samoa]], and most recently mainland [[China]]. Other sporadic occurrences of the parasite in its rat hosts have been reported in [[Cuba]], [[Egypt]], [[Louisiana]], [[Madagascar]], [[Nigeria]], [[New Orleans]], and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2013, ''A. cantonensis'' was confirmed present in [[Florida]], USA, where its range and prevalence are expanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwanowicz DD, Sanders LR, Schill WB, Xayavong MV, da Silva AJ, Qvarnstrom Y, Smith T | title = Spread of the Rat Lungworm (Angiostrongylus cantonensis) in Giant African Land Snails (Lissachatina fulica) in Florida, USA | journal = Journal of Wildlife Diseases | volume = 51 | issue = 3 | pages = 749–53 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25973628 | doi = 10.7589/2014-06-160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a case was found in a [[New York City|New Yorker]], who had visited Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2-new-lungworm-cases-involves-n-y-teen-vacationed-hawaii-article-1.3931066|title=New York teen contracts rat lungworm during Hawaii vacation|last=|first=|date=|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-04-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413052417/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2-new-lungworm-cases-involves-n-y-teen-vacationed-hawaii-article-1.3931066|archive-date=2018-04-13|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the parasite has been shown to be proliferating at an alarming rate due to modern food-consumption trends and global transportation of food products. Scientists are calling for a more thorough study of the epidemiology of ''A. cantonensis'', stricter food-safety policies, and the increase of knowledge on how to properly consume products commonly infested by the parasite, such as snails and slugs that act as intermediate hosts or those that act as [[Host (biology)#Paratenic hosts|paratenic hosts]], such as fish, frogs, or [[Fresh water|freshwater]] prawns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lv S, Zhang Y, Steinmann P, Zhou XN | title = Emerging angiostrongyliasis in Mainland China | language = en-us | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 161–4 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18258099 | pmc = 2600175 | doi = 10.3201/eid1401.061529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alicata|first=Joseph E.|date=1967|title=Effect of Freezing and Boiling on the Infectivity of Third-Stage Larvae of Angiostrongylus cantonensis Present in Land Snails and Freshwater Prawns|jstor=3276839|journal=The Journal of Parasitology|volume=53|issue=5|pages=1064–1066|doi=10.2307/3276839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ash|first=Lawrence R.|date=1968|title=The Occurrence of Angiostrongylus cantonensis in Frogs of New Caledonia with Observations on Paratenic Hosts of Metastrongyles|jstor=3277060|journal=The Journal of Parasitology|volume=54|issue=3|pages=432–436|doi=10.2307/3277060}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingestion of food items that can be contaminated by the mucus excretions of intermediate or paratenic hosts, such as snails and slugs or by the feces of rats that act as definitive hosts, can lead to infection of ''A. cantonensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Richards CS, Merritt JW | title = Studies on Angiostrongylus cantonensis in molluscan intermediate hosts | journal = The Journal of Parasitology | volume = 53 | issue = 2 | pages = 382–8 | date = April 1967 | pmid = 6022396 | doi = 10.2307/3276595 | jstor = 3276595 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common route of infection of  ''A. cantonesis'' in humans is by ingestion of either intermediate or paratenic hosts of the [[larva]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell BG, Little MD | title = The finding of Angiostrongylus cantonensis in rats in New Orleans | journal = The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 568–73 | date = May 1988 | pmid = 3275136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unwashed fruits and vegetables, especially [[romaine lettuce]], can be contaminated with snail and slug mucus or can result in accidental ingestion of these intermediate and paratenic hosts.

==Pathogenesis of human angiostrongylosis==
The presence of parasitic worms burrowed in the neural tissue of the human [[central nervous system]] will cause obvious complications. All of the following will result in damage to the CNS:{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

==Eosinophilic meningitis==
{{See also|Eosinophilic meningitis}}
Although the clinical disease caused by ''Angiostrongylus'' invasion into the central nervous system is commonly referred to as "eosinophilic meningitis", the actual pathophysiology is of a meningoencephalitis with invasion not just of the [[meninges]], or superficial lining of the brain, but also deeper brain tissue. Initial invasion through the lining of the brain, the meninges, may cause a typical inflammation of the meninges and a classic meningitis picture of headache, stiff neck, and often fever. The parasites subsequently invade deeper into the brain tissue, causing specific localizing [[Neurological disorder|neurologic]] symptoms depending on where in the brain [[parenchyma]] they migrate. Neurologic findings and symptoms wax and wane as initial damage is done by the physical in-migration of the worms and secondary damage is done by the inflammatory response to the presence of dead and dying worms. This inflammation can lead in the short term to paralysis, bladder dysfunction, visual disturbance, and coma and in the long term to permanent nerve damage, mental retardation, nerve damage, permanent brain damage, or death.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang QP, Lai DH, Zhu XQ, Chen XG, Lun ZR | title = Human angiostrongyliasis | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 8 | issue = 10 | pages = 621–30 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18922484 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(08)70229-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eosinophilic meningitis is commonly defined by the increased number of [[eosinophil]]s in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF). In most cases, eosinophil levels rise to 10 or more eosinophils per μl in the CSF, accounting for at least 10% of the total CSF [[White blood cell|leukocyte]] (white blood cell) count.&lt;ref name="urlwww.dhh.louisiana.gov"&gt;[http://www.dhh.louisiana.gov/offices/miscdocs/docs-249/Manual/MeningitisEosinophilicManual.pdf "EOSINOPHILIC MENINGITIS"]. Revised 28 February 2006, accessed 1 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical analysis of the CSF typically resembles the findings in "[[aseptic meningitis]]" with slightly elevated protein levels, normal glucose levels, and negative bacterial cultures. Presence of a significantly decreased glucose on CSF analysis is an indicator of severe [[meningoencephalitis]] and may indicate a poor [[Prognosis|medical outcome]]. Initial CSF analysis early in the disease process may occasionally show no increase of eosinophils, only to have classical increases in eosinophils in subsequent CSF analysis. Caution should be advised in using eosinophilic meningitis as the only criterion for diagnosing angiostrongylus infestation in someone with classic symptoms, as the disease evolves with the migration of the worms into the CNS.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Eosinophils are specialized white blood cells of the [[Granulocyte|granulocytic]] cell line which contain granules in their [[cytoplasm]]. These granules contain proteins that are toxic to parasites. When these granules degranulate, or break down, chemicals are released that combat parasites such as ''A. cantonensis''. Eosinophils, which are located throughout the body, are guided to sites of inflammation by [[chemokine]]s when the body is infested with parasites such as ''A. cantonensis''. Once at the site of inflammation, type 2 cytokines are released from [[T helper cell|helper T cells]], which communicate with the eosinophils, signaling them to activate. Once activated, eosinophils can begin the process of [[degranulation]], releasing their toxic [[protein]]s in the fight against the foreign parasite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

===Clinical signs and symptoms===
According to a group [[case study]], the most common symptoms in mild eosinophilic meningitis tend to be headache (with 100% of people in the study suffering from this symptom), [[photophobia]] or visual disturbance (92%), neck stiffness (83%), fatigue (83%), [[hyperesthesia]]s (75%), vomiting (67%), and [[paresthesia]]s (50%).&lt;ref name="Murphy 35–40" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Incubation period]] is often 3 weeks, but can be 3–36 days&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and even 80 days.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tseng YT, Tsai HC, Sy CL, Lee SS, Wann SR, Wang YH, Chen JK, Wu KS, Chen YS | title = Clinical manifestations of eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis: 18 years' experience in a medical center in southern Taiwan | journal = Journal of Microbiology, Immunology, and Infection = Wei Mian Yu Gan Ran Za Zhi | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 382–9 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21524976 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmii.2011.01.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical conservative medical management including [[analgesic]]s and [[sedative]]s provide minimal relief for the headaches and hyperesthesias. Removing cerebrospinal fluid at regular 3- to 7-day intervals is the only proven method of significantly reducing [[intracranial pressure]] and can be used for symptomatic treatment of headaches.&lt;ref name="Slom 668–675"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Slom TJ, Cortese MM, Gerber SI, Jones RC, Holtz TH, Lopez AS, Zambrano CH, Sufit RL, Sakolvaree Y, Chaicumpa W, Herwaldt BL, Johnson S | title = An outbreak of eosinophilic meningitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis in travelers returning from the Caribbean | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 346 | issue = 9 | pages = 668–75 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11870244 | doi = 10.1056/nejmoa012462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diagnosis ===
The diagnosis of disease caused by ''A. cantonensis'' infestation is often difficult and relies heavily on the history of a likely ingestion of a commonly infested host and the presence of typical features of the disease. The presumptive diagnosis is particularly strong when eosinophilic meningoencephalitis can be confirmed. The diagnosis of eosinophilic meningitis can be arrived at through detection of elevated cranial pressure and increased numbers of eosinophils. The diagnosis of the cause of eosinophilic meningitis and the presence of ''A. cantonensis'' is remarkably more difficult. A [[Lumbar puncture|spinal tap]], or a sample of CSF, must be taken to search for ''A. cantonensis'' worms or larvae. ''A. cantonensis'' is undetectable in the CSF of more than half of the infected individuals. Current methods of detecting specific antigens associated with ''A. cantonensis'' are also unreliable. Consequently, alternative approaches to detect antigen-[[antibody]] reactions are being explored, such as [[Agglutination-PCR|immuno-PCR]].&lt;ref name="urlImmuno-PCR for Detection of Antigen to Angiostrongylus cantonensis Circulating Fifth-Stage Worms -- Chye et al. 50 (1): 51 -- Clinical Chemistry"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chye SM, Lin SR, Chen YL, Chung LY, Yen CM | title = Immuno-PCR for detection of antigen to Angiostrongylus cantonensis circulating fifth-stage worms | journal = Clinical Chemistry | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–7 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14709636 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1373/clinchem.2003.020867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A rapid dot-blot [[ELISA|ELISA test]] is also available for quick, effective, and economical on-site diagnosis of  ''A. cantonensis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eamsobhana P, Yong HS | title = Immunological diagnosis of human angiostrongyliasis due to Angiostrongylus cantonensis (Nematoda: Angiostrongylidae) | journal = International Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 425–31 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19117782 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijid.2008.09.021 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971208016834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players under 19 years of age are eligible to rank in the [[BWF World Junior Ranking]], which were introduced in January 2011. The following lists are the rankings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Junior ranking|url=http://bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=16443|website=Bwfbadminton.org|publisher=Badminton World Federation|access-date=2013-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130125839/http://www.bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=16443|archive-date=2010-11-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The ranking points are awarded based on the level and progress of the tournament from each player/pair. Ranking points calculated are based on the tournaments each players/pairs participate in from the last 52 weeks. If a player or pair has participated in ten or fewer World Ranking tournaments, then the ranking is worked out by adding together the points won at tournaments in the last 52 weeks. If a player or pair has participated in 11 or more World Ranking tournaments, only the 10 highest points scored in the tournaments during the 52-week period count towards their ranking. The highest possible ranking points are 116,000.&lt;ref name="ranking law" /&gt;&lt;ref name="World Ranking System"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview Ranking|url=http://bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=15370|website=Bwfbadminton.org|publisher=Badminton World Federation|access-date=2013-08-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814200157/http://www.bwfbadminton.org/page.aspx?id=15370|archive-date=2010-08-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.badmintonmonthly.com/best-badminton-players/| title= Best Badminton Players }} Thursday, September 21, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of a legally sanctioned [[corporation]] remains controversial for several reasons, most of which stem from the granting of corporations both limited liability on the part of its members and the status and rights of a [[Legal personality|legal person]]. Some opponents to this granting of "personhood" to an organization with no personal liability contend that it creates a legal entity with the extensive financial resources to co-opt public policy and exploit resources and populations without any moral or legal responsibility to encourage restraint.

==Divisions between labor, management, and owners==
[[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' criticized the [[joint-stock company]] corporate form because the separation of ownership and management could lead to inefficient management.

{{Quote|The directors of such [joint-stock] companies, however, being the managers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anxious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery frequently watch over their own.... Negligence and profusion, therefore, must always prevail, more or less, in the management of the affairs of such a company.}}

The context for Adam Smith's term for "companies" in ''The Wealth of Nations'' was the joint-stock company. In the 18th century, the joint-stock company was a distinct entity created by the King of Great Britain as [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]] trading companies. These entities were sometimes awarded legal [[monopoly]] in designated regions of the world, such as the British [[East India Company]].

Furthermore, the context of the quote points to the complications inherent in chartered joint-stock companies. Each company had a Courts of Governors and day-to-day duties were overseen by local managers. Governor supervision of day-to-day operations was minimal and was exacerbated by the poor communications of the 18th century.

Bribery and corruption were inherent in this type of corporate model as the local managers sought to avoid close supervision by the Courts of Governors, politicians, and Prime Ministers. In these circumstances, Smith did not consider joint-stock company governance to be honest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adamsmithslostlegacy.com/2007/02/18th-century-chartered-joint-stock.html Adam Smith The Lost Legacy.com]&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, the East India Company demonstrated inherent flaws in the corporate form. The division between owners and managers in a joint-stock company, and the limited legal liability this division was based on guaranteed that stockholders would be apathetic about a company's activities as long as the company continued to be profitable. Just as problematic, the [[law of agency|laws of agency]] upon which the corporate form was based allowed for boards of directors to be so autonomous from and unconstrained by stockholder wishes that directors became negligent and ultimately self-interested in the management of the corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations'' 741 (Clarendon, Oxford 1776).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychopathic behavior==
Legal Scholar and Professor of Law at the [[University of British Columbia]] [[Joel Bakan]] describes the modern corporate entity as 'an institutional psychopath' and a 'psychopathic creature.' In the documentary ''[[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'', Bakan claims that corporations, when considered as natural living persons, exhibit the traits of [[antisocial personality disorder]] or [[psychopathy]]. Also in the film, [[Robert A. G. Monks]], a former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate for Senate from [[Maine]], says:

{{quote|The corporation is an [[cost externalizing|externalizing]] machine (moving its operating costs to external organizations and people), in the same way that a shark is a killing machine.|Joel Bakan&lt;ref&gt;Bakan, Joel (writer) [http://www.thecorporation.com/ The Corporation (2003)] (Documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Analogy with totalitarian regime==
[[Noam Chomsky]] and others have criticized the legal decisions that led to the creation of the modern corporation:

{{quote|Corporations, which previously had been considered artificial entities with no rights, were accorded all the rights of persons, and far more, since they are "immortal persons", and "persons" of extraordinary wealth and power. Furthermore, they were no longer bound to the specific purposes designated by State charter, but could act as they choose, with few constraints.|Noam Chomsky&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barksky, [http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/1999----02.htm Noam Chomsky and the Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214111824/http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/1999----02.htm |date=2007-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|When the corporatization of the state capitalist societies took place a century ago, in part in reaction to massive market failures, conservatives &amp;ndash; a breed that now scarcely exists&amp;ndash; objected to this attack on the fundamental principles of classical liberalism. And rightly so. One may recall Adam Smith's critique of the "joint stock companies" of his day, particularly if management is granted a degree of independence; and his attitude toward the inherent corruption of private power, probably a "conspiracy against the public" when businessmen meet for lunch, in his acid view, let alone when they form collectivist legal entities and alliances among them, with extraordinary rights granted, backed, and enhanced by state power.|Noam Chomsky&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chomsky | first = Noam | title = Profit Over People: Neoliberalism and Global Order | publisher = Seven Stories Press | date = 1999 | location = New York, New York, United States | pages = 175 | isbn = 978-1-888363-82-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Chomsky contends that corporations transfer policy decisions out of the hands of the people and into corporate boardrooms, where public oversight is limited. The extensive financial resources of corporations and the extent to which they're employed to influence political campaigns in the United States has also been implicated as a way in which corporations undermine the democratic institutions in a society.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Resnikoff. 2007 [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20071022/resnikoff Corporations Versus Democracy]. The Nation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

"No other institution in American history—not even slavery—has ever been so consistently unpopular...with the American public. It was controversial from the outset, and it has remained controversial to this day."&lt;ref&gt;Irving Kristol. ''Reflections of a Neoconservative''. NY, 1983. p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D. Rockefeller]] was one of the first to experience that paradox in a spectacular and personal way.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Churchyard. [http://www.charleschurchyard.com/corporation.html "The Corporation and John D. Rockefeller's Bewilderment."]&lt;/ref&gt; By the last decade of the 19th century, Rockefeller found that he had become "the most hated man in the world."&lt;ref&gt;David F. Hawke. ''John D''. NY, 1980. Ch. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the middle of the 20th century, the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] noted that the corporate businesses which foreign visitors came to see and marvel at, as "showpiece[s] of American industrial achievement," were the very same ones that government attorneys scrutinized in their search for monopolistic wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Galbraith. ''American Capitalism''. NY, 1956. p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15189">'''Democratic globalisation''' is a [[social movement]] towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]].  This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate [[oligopolies]], ideological [[Non-governmental organisation|NGO]]s, cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]].  In the last decade he published a dozen books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire world. For some, '''democratic [[mundialisation]]''' is a variant of democratic globalisation stressing the need for the direct election of world leaders and members of global institutions by citizens worldwide; for others, it is just another name for democratic globalisation.

These proponents state that democratic globalisation's purpose is to:
* Expand [[globalisation]] and make people closer and more united. This expansion should differ from economic globalization and "make people closer, more united and protected"; because of a variety of opinions and proposals it is still unclear what this would mean in practice and how it could be realized.
* Have it reach all fields of activity and knowledge, including governmental and economic, since the economic one is crucial to develop the well-being of world citizens; and
* Give [[world citizen]]s democratic access and a say in those global activities. For example, presidential voting for [[United Nations Secretary-General]] by citizens and [[direct election]] of members of a [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]].

Supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions.
Some proponents in the "anti-globalization movement" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies, and suggests a form of "world government."

== Background ==
Democratic globalization supports the extension of political democratization to economic and [[Global financial system|financial globalization]]. It is based upon an idea that free international transactions benefit the global society as a whole. They believe in financially
open economies, where the government and [[central bank]] must be transparent in order to retain the confidence of the markets, since transparency spells doom for [[autocratic regime]]s. They promote democracy that makes leaders more accountable to the citizenry through the removal of restrictions on such transactions.

== Social movements ==
The democratic globalization movement started to get public attention when New York Times reported its demonstration to contest a [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in Seattle, Washington, November 1999. This gathering was to criticize unfair trade and undemocratic globalization of the WTO, [[World Bank]], [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF), the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Its primary tactics were public rallies, street theater and [[civil disobedience]].

Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic global institutions and changing [[international organization]]s (which are currently [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by world citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged democratic world government.

===Global democracy===
Thus, it supports the [[International Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, direct election of United Nations (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide.

==Difference to anti-globalization==
Some supporters of the democratic globalization movement draw a distinction between their movement and the one most popularly known as the '[[anti-globalization]]' movement, claiming that their movement avoids ideological agenda about economics and social matters although, in practice, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two camps.  Democratic globalization supporters state that the choice of political orientations should be left to the world citizens, via their participation in world democratic institutions and direct vote for world presidents (see [[presidentialism]]).

Some supporters of the "[[anti-globalization movement]]" do not necessarily disagree with this position. For example, [[George Monbiot]], normally associated with the anti-globalization movement (who prefers the term [[Global Justice Movement]]) in his work ''Age of Consent'' has proposed similar democratic reforms of most major global institutions, suggesting direct democratic elections of such bodies by citizens, and suggests a form of "[[federal world government]]".

==Procedure==
Democratic globalization, proponents claim, would be reached by creating democratic [[global institution]]s and changing international organizations (which are currently intergovernmental institutions controlled by the nation-states), into global ones controlled by voting by the citizens.  The movement suggests to do it gradually by building a limited number of democratic global institutions in charge of a few crucial fields of common interest. Its long-term goal is that these institutions federate later into a full-fledged [[democratic world government]].

They propose the creation of world services for citizens, like world [[civil protection]] and [[hazard prevention|prevention]] (from [[natural hazard]]s) services.

==Proponents==
The concept of democratic globalization has supporters from all fields. Many of the campaigns and initiatives for global democracy, such as the UNPA campaign, list quotes by and names of their supporters on their websites.&lt;ref&gt;
UNPA Campaign "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/quotes/index.php Quotes]" and "[http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php list of featured supporters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903154706/http://en.unpacampaign.org/appeal/support/ini_all_0.php |date=2010-09-03 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academics===
Some of the most prolific proponents are the [[United Kingdom|British]] political thinker [[David Held]] and the Italian political theorist [[Daniele Archibugi]].  In the last decade they published several books regarding the spread of democracy from territorially defined nation states to a system of [[global governance]] that encapsulates the entire planet. [[Richard Falk]] has developed the idea from an international law perspective, [[Ulrich Beck]] from a sociological approach and [[Jürgen Habermas]] has elaborate the normative principles.

===Politicians===
*In 2003 Bob Brown, the leader of the Australian Green Party, has tabled a move for global democracy in the Australian Senate: "I move: That the Senate supports global democracy based on the principle of `one person, one vote, one value'; and supports the vision of a global parliament which empowers all the world's people equally to decide on matters of international significance."&lt;ref&gt;
The Senate of Australia "[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansards%2F2003-06-16%2F0073%22 GLOBAL DEMOCRACY AND GLOBAL PARLIAMENT]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The current President of Bolivia [[Evo Morales]] and the Bolivian UN Ambassador [[Pablo Solón Romero]] have demanded a democratisation of the UN on many occasions. For example, Evo Morales at the United Nations, May 7, 2010: “The response to global warming is global democracy for life and for the Mother Earth.. … we have two paths: to save capitalism, or to save life and Mother Earth.”&lt;ref&gt;
Evo Morales "[http://climateandcapitalism.com/2010/05/11/2438/ United, the developing countries can save the world]".&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Graham Watson]] (Former member of the European Parliament and former leader of the [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]]) and [[Jo Leinen]] (Member of the European Parliament) are strong supporter of global democracy. They were among those presenting the “Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy” on February 23, 2010, at an event inside the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;
KDUN "[http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ Brussels Declaration on Global Democracy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606082234/http://www.kdun.org/782/brussels-declaration-on-global-democracy/ |date=2010-06-06 }}".&lt;/ref&gt;
*The appeals of the campaign for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly has already been endorsed by more than 700 parliamentarians from more than 90 countries.&lt;ref&gt;

===Grassroot movements===
Jim Stark has initiated a process for a Democratic World Parliament through a Global Referendum.  As of August 20, 2013, 22,126 people have voted. So far, the votes are 95.3% in favor of creating a democratic world parliament. Portable voting booths are available at http://voteworldparliament.org/shadowbox/getballot.html. Online voting at Mr. Stark's website is at voteworldparliament.org. Mr. Stark has published a companion book to the online referendum entitled "Rescue Plan for Planet Earth".

'''Democratization''' (or '''democratisation''') is the transition to a more democratic [[political regime]]. It also refers to substantive political changes moving in a democratic direction. It may be the transition from an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime to a full [[democracy]], a transition from an authoritarian political system to a semi-democracy or transition from a [[semi-authoritarian]] political system to a [[democracy|democratic]] political system. The outcome may be [[Democratic consolidation|consolidated]] (as it was for example in the [[United Kingdom]]) or democratization may face frequent reversals (as it has faced for example in [[Venezuela]]). Different patterns of democratization are often used to explain other political phenomena, such as whether a country goes to a war or whether its economy grows. Democratization itself is influenced by various factors, including economic development, history, and civil society. The ideal result from democratization is to ensure that the people have the right to vote and have a voice in their political system.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Causes==

There is considerable debate about the factors which affect or ultimately limit democratization. A great many things, including economics, culture, and history, have been cited as impacting on the process. Some of the more frequently mentioned factors are:


* '''Wealth'''. A higher [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP/capita]] correlates with democracy and some claim the wealthiest democracies have never been observed to fall into authoritarianism.&lt;ref name='przeworski'&gt;{{cite book | last = Przeworski | first = Adam | authorlink = Adam Przeworski| title = Democracy and Development: Political Institutions and Well-Being in the World, 1950-1990 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2000 | location = Cambridge|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of Hitler and of the Nazis in Weimar Germany can be seen as an obvious counter-example, but although in early 1930s Germany was already an advanced economy, by that time, the country was also living in a state of economic crisis virtually since the first World War (in the 1910s), a crisis which was eventually worsened by the effects of the Great Depression. There is also the general observation that democracy was very rare before the industrial revolution. Empirical research thus lead many to believe that economic development either increases chances for a transition to democracy ([[modernization theory]]), or helps newly established democracies consolidate.&lt;ref name='przeworski'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rice|first=Tom W.|last2=Ling|first2=Jeffrey|date=2002-12-01|title=Democracy, Economic Wealth and Social Capital: Sorting Out the Causal Connections |journal=Space and Polity|volume=6|issue=3|pages=307–325|doi=10.1080/1356257022000031995|issn=1356-2576}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study finds that economic development prompts democratization but only in the medium run (10–20 years). This is because development may entrench the incumbent leader but make it more difficult for him deliver the state to a son or trusted aide when he exits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Income, Democracy, and Leader Turnover|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12135/abstract|journal = American Journal of Political Science|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 1540-5907|pages = 927–942|volume = 59|issue = 4|doi = 10.1111/ajps.12135|language = en|first = Daniel|last = Treisman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the debate about whether democracy is a consequence of wealth, a cause of it, or both processes are unrelated, is far from conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Traversa | first1 = Federico | year = 2014 | title = Income and the stability of democracy: Pushing beyond the borders of logic to explain a strong correlation? | url = | journal = Constitutional Political Economy | volume =  26| issue = | pages =  121–136| doi = 10.1007/s10602-014-9175-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that economic development depends on the political stability of a country to promote democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=FENG|first1=YI|title=Democracy, Political Stability and Economic Growth|journal=British Journal of Political Science|date=July 1997|volume=27|issue=3|pages=416, 391–418|doi=10.1017/S0007123497000197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark, Robert and Golder, in their reformulation of Albert Hirschman's model of ''Exit, Voice and Loyalty'', explain how it is not the increase of wealth in a country ''per se'' which influences a democratization process, but rather the changes in the socio-economic structures that come together with the increase of wealth. They explain how these structure changes have been called out to be one of the main reasons several European countries became democratic. When their socioeconomic structures shifted because modernization made the agriculture sector more efficient, bigger investments of time and resources were used for the manufacture and service sectors. In England, for example, members of the gentry began investing more on commercial activities that allowed them to become economically more important for the state. This new kind of productive activities came with new economic power were assets became more difficult for the state to count and hence more difficult to tax. Because of this, predation was no longer possible and the state had to negotiate with the new economic elites to extract revenue. A sustainable bargain had to be reached because the state became more dependent of its citizens remaining loyal and, with this, citizens had now leverage to be taken into account in the decision making process for the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clark |first=William Roberts |first2=Matt |last2=Golder |first3=Sona N. |last3=Golder |year=2013 |title=Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game |work=Unpublished manuscript |publisher=University of Michigan and Pennsylvania State University |url=https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}

* '''Social equality'''. Acemoglu and Robinson argued that the relationship between [[social equality]] and democratic transition is complicated: People have less incentive to revolt in an egalitarian society (for example, [[Singapore]]), so the likelihood of democratization is lower. In a highly unequal society (for example, [[South Africa]] under [[Apartheid]]), the redistribution of wealth and power in a democracy would be so harmful to elites that these would do everything to prevent democratization. Democratization is more likely to emerge somewhere in the middle, in the countries, whose elites offer concessions because (1) they consider the threat of a revolution credible and (2) the cost of the concessions is not too high.&lt;ref name='acemoglu'&gt;{{cite book | last = Acemoglu | first = Daron |author2=James A. Robinson | title = Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2006 | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; This expectation is in line with the empirical research showing that democracy is more stable in egalitarian societies.&lt;ref name='przeworski'/&gt;

* '''Culture'''. It is claimed by some that certain cultures are simply more conductive to democratic values than others. This view is likely to be [[Ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]]. Typically, it is [[Western culture]] which is cited as "best suited" to democracy, with other cultures portrayed as containing values which make democracy difficult or undesirable. This argument is sometimes used by undemocratic regimes to justify their failure to implement democratic reforms. Today, however, there are many non-Western democracies. Examples include: India, Japan, Indonesia, Namibia, Botswana, Taiwan, and South Korea. Research finds that "Western-educated leaders significantly and substantively improve a country's democratization prospects".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Who Democratizes?

* '''Social Capital.''' Robert Putnam argues that certain characteristics make societies more likely to have cultures of civic engagement that lead to more participatory democracies.  Putnam argues that communities with denser horizontal networks of civic association are able to better build the "norms of trust, reciprocity, and civic engagement" that lead to democratization and well-functioning participatory democracies.  Putnam contrasts communities with dense horizontal networks, to communities built around vertical networks and patron-client relations which he asserts are unlikely to build the culture of civic engagement necessary for democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Putnam|first=Robert|date=March 1993|title=What makes democracy work?|url=|journal=National Civic Review|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Dictatorship type'''. The three dictatorship types, monarchy, civilian and military have different approaches to democratization as a result of their individual goals. Monarchic and civilian dictatorships seek to remain in power indefinitely through hereditary rule in the case of monarchs or through oppression in the case of civilian dictators. A military dictatorship seizes power to act as a caretaker government to replace what they consider a flawed civilian government. Military dictatorships are more likely to transition to democracy because at the onset, they are meant to be stop-gap solutions while a new acceptable government forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Living by the Sword and Dying by the Sword?

* '''Scrambled Constituencies.''' Mancur Olson theorizes that the process of democratization occurs when elites are unable to reconstitute an autocracy.  Olson suggests that this occurs when constituencies or identity groups are mixed within a geographic region.  He asserts that this mixed geographic constituencies requires elites to for democratic and representative institutions to control the region, and to limit the power of competing elite groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993|title=Dictatorship, Democracy and Development|url=|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=87 |issue=3 |pages=567–576 |doi=10.2307/2938736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Education.''' It has long been theorized that education promotes stable and democratic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Capitalism and Freedom|last = Friedman|first = Milton|publisher = |year = 1962|isbn = |location = |pages = 86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that education leads to greater political tolerance, increases the likelihood of political participation and reduces inequality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The democratizing effect of education |journal = Research &amp; Politics|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 2053-1680|pages = 2053168015613360|volume = 2|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/2053168015613360|language = en|first = Eduardo|last = Alemán|first2 = Yeaji|last2 = Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study finds "that increases in levels of education improve levels of democracy and that the democratizing effect of education is more intense in poor countries".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''Urbanization'''. There is research to suggest that greater urbanization, through various pathways, contributes to democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glaeser|first=Edward L.|last2=Steinberg|first2=Bryce Millett|date=2017|title=Transforming Cities: Does Urbanization Promote Democratic Change? |journal=Regional Studies |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=58–68 |doi=10.1080/00343404.2016.1262020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Natural Resources'''. University of California, Berkeley political scientist Thad Dunning proposes a plausible explanation for Ecuador’s return to democracy that contradicts the conventional wisdom that natural resource rents encourage authoritarian governments. Dunning proposes that there are situations where natural resource rents, such as those acquired through oil, reduce the risk of distributive or social policies to the elite because the state has other sources of revenue to finance this kind of policies that is not the elite wealth or income.&lt;ref&gt;Thad Dunning. 2008. Crude Democracy: Natural Resource Wealth and Political Regimes.Cambridge University Press. Ch. 1.Pp. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; And in countries plagued with high inequality, which was the case of Ecuador in the 1970s, the result would be a higher likelihood of democratization.&lt;ref&gt;Thad Dunning. 2008. Crude Democracy: Natural Resource Wealth and Political Regimes.Cambridge University Press. Ch. 1.Pp. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the military coup had overthrown the government in large part because of the fears of elites that redistribution would take place.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"&gt;Thad Dunning. 2008. Crude Democracy: Natural Resource Wealth and Political Regimes.Cambridge University Press. Ch. 1.Pp. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year oil became an increasing financial source for the country.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt; Although the rents were used to finance the military, the eventual second oil boom of 1979 ran parallel to the country’s re-democratization.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt; Ecuador’s re-democratization can then be attributed, as argued by Dunning, to the large increase of oil rents, which enabled not only a surge in public spending but placated the fears of redistribution that had grappled the elite circles.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt; The exploitation of Ecuador’s resource rent enabled the government to implement price and wage policies that benefited citizens at no cost to the elite and allowed for a smooth transition and growth of democratic institutions.&lt;ref name="Thad Dunning 2008. Pp. 34"/&gt;
 
* '''Foreign trade'''. A 2016 study found that preferential trade agreements "encourage the democratization of a country, in particular if the PTA partners are themselves democracies."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Coevolution of Trade Agreement Networks and Democracy |journal = Journal of Conflict Resolution|date = 2016-02-01|issn = 0022-0027|pages = 164–191|volume = 60|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0022002714535431|language = en|first = Mark S.|last = Manger|first2 = Mark A.|last2 = Pickup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Democracy protests'''. Research indicates that democracy protests are associated with democratization. A 2016 study found that about a quarter of all cases of democracy protests between 1989-2011 lead to democratization.&lt;ref name='brancati'&gt;{{cite book | last = Brancati | first = Dawn | title = Democracy Protests: Origins, Features and Significance | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2016 | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Threat of civil conflict.''' Research suggests that the threat of civil conflict encourages regimes to make democratic concessions. A 2016 study found that drought-induced riots in Sub-Saharan Africa lead regimes, fearing conflict, to make democratic concessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aidt|first=Toke S.|last2=Leon|first2=Gabriel|date=2016-06-01|title=The Democratic Window of Opportunity Evidence from Riots in Sub-Saharan Africa |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|language=en|volume=60|issue=4|pages=694–717|doi=10.1177/0022002714564014|issn=0022-0027}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* '''Overthrow of dictators'''. Rebels may overthrow their dictators with the aim of establishing a democratic government, but this method is rarely successful. The death of a dictator rarely ushers in democracy. One analysis found that "of the 79 dictators who have died in office (1946-2014)... in the vast majority (92%) of cases, the regime persists after the autocrat's death."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/10/when-dictators-die/| title = When Dictators Die| website = Foreign Policy

* '''International cooperation'''. A 2002 study found that membership in international organizations "is correlated with transitions to democracy during the period from 1950 to 1992."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Democracy from the Outside-In? International Organizations and Democratization |journal = International Organization|date = 2002-06-01|issn = 1531-5088|pages = 515–549|volume = 56|issue = 03|doi = 10.1162/002081802760199872|first = Jon C.|last = Pevehouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Foreign intervention'''. Democracies have often been imposed by military intervention, for example in Japan and Germany after WWII.&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Göran|last=Therborn|authorlink=Göran Therborn|year=1977|title=The rule of capital and the rise of democracy: Capital and suffrage (cover title) | journal=[[New&amp;nbsp;Left Review]]|series=I|volume=103|issue=[http://www.newleftreview.org/?issue=100 The advent of bourgeois democracy]|ref=harv|url=http://www.newleftreview.org/?view=1453|pages=3–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=47&amp;articleID=599 ''The Independent'']&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, [[decolonization]] sometimes facilitated the establishment of democracies that were soon replaced by authoritarian regimes. For example, Syria, after gaining independence from [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandatory control]] at the beginning of the [[Cold War]], failed to [[Democratic consolidation|consolidate]] its democracy, so it eventually collapsed and was replaced by a [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'athist dictatorship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://sam.gov.tr/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/katarzyna_krokowska.pdf|title = The Fall of Democracy in Syria|last1 = Krokowska|first1 = Katarzyna|year = 2011|journal = Perceptions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, most attempts to establish democracy by military means have failed.&lt;ref name="Keen2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keen |first1=David |title=Endless War? Hidden Functions of the War on Terror |date=2006 |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''War-making'''. Jeffrey Herbst, in its acclaimed paper "War and the state in Africa", explains how democratization in European states was achieved through war making and how it is a cause of state formation missing in Africa today. He exemplifies how war caused the state to become more efficient in revenue collection, it forced leaders to improve administrative capabilities; and created and environment where populations could develop a sense of unification. European states where under constant threat of being invaded and bursting into war with their neighboring countries. This demand to be constantly vigilant enabled the development of effective revenue collection systems and, those states that did not raise sufficient revenue for war perished. War also created a common and powerful association between the state and its people, given that citizens felt threatened as a nation and, it was only as a nation that they would thrive. Fighting wars made people feel more associated with the state.&lt;ref&gt;Herbst, Jeffrey. “War and the State in Africa.” ''International Security'' (1990): 117-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Peace and security'''. Wars may contribute to the [[state building]] that precedes a transition to democracy, but war is also a serious obstacle to democratization. While adherants of the [[democratic peace theory]] believe that democracy comes before peace, historical evidence shows the opposite. In almost all cases, peace has come before democracy. There is little support for the hypothesis that democracy causes peace, but strong evidence for the opposite hypothesis that peace leads to democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gibler |first1=Douglas M. |last2=Owsiak |first2=Andrew |title=Democracy and the Settlement of International Borders, 1919–2001 |journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution |date=2017 |doi=10.1177/0022002717708599}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gat |first1=Azar |title=The Causes of War and the Spread of Peace: Will War Rebound? |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian Welzel|Christian Welzel's]] [[Freedom Rising|human empowerment theory]] posits that existential security leads to emancipative cultural values and support for a democratic political organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Welzel |first1=Christian |title=Freedom Rising: Human Empowerment and the Quest for Emancipation |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is in agreement with theories based on [[evolutionary psychology]]. The so-called regality theory finds that people develop a psychological preference for a strong leader and an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] form of government in situations of war or perceived collective danger. On the other hand, people will support [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] values and a preference for democracy in situations of peace and safety. The consequence of this is that a society will develop in the direction of [[autocracy]] and an authoritarian government when people perceive collective danger, while the development in the democratic direction requires collective safety.&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why almost all attempts to establish democracy by violent means have failed&lt;ref name="Keen2006" /&gt;

==Transitions==

Democracy development has often been slow, violent, and marked by frequent reversals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/gratis/Berman-18-1.pdf ''Journal of Democracy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688 established a strong Parliament that passed the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], which codified certain rights and liberties for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|url=http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|publisher=British Library|accessdate=27 November 2015|quote=The key landmark is the Bill of Rights (1689), which established the supremacy of Parliament over the Crown....

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth.

The [[American Revolution]] (1765–1783) created the United States. The new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] established a relatively strong federal national government that included an [[President of the United States|executive]], a [[United States Supreme Court|national judiciary]], and a bicameral [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] that represented states in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the population in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="Wood, 1992"&gt;Wood, ''The Radicalism of the American Revolution'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene and Pole (1994) chapter 70&lt;/ref&gt; In many fields, it was a success ideologically in the sense that a relatively true republic was established that never had a single dictator, but [[Voting rights in the United States|voting rights]] were initially restricted to [[White American|white]] male property owners (about 6% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expansion of Rights and Liberties - The Right of Suffrage|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|website=Online Exhibit: The Charters of Freedom|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=April 21, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160706144856/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/charters_of_freedom_13.html|archivedate=July 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was not abolished in the southern states until the constitutional [[Reconstruction Amendments|Amendments]] of the [[Reconstruction Era]] following the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865) and the [[Civil Rights Movement|Civil Rights]] given to African-Americans were only achieved in the 1960s.

The [[French Revolution]] (1789) briefly allowed a wide franchise. The [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] lasted for more than twenty years. The [[French Directory]] was more oligarchic. The [[First French Empire]] and the [[Bourbon Restoration]] restored more autocratic rule. The [[Second French Republic]] had universal male suffrage but was followed by the [[Second French Empire]]. The [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870–71) resulted in the [[French Third Republic]].

The [[German Empire]] was created in 1871. It was followed by the [[Weimar Republic]] after [[World War I]]. [[Nazi Germany]] restored autocratic rule before the defeat in [[World War II]] .

The [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]], after the unification of Italy in 1861, was a [[constitutional monarchy]] with the King having considerable powers. [[Italian fascism]] created a dictatorship after the World War I. World War II resulted in the [[Italian Republic]].

The [[Meiji period]], after 1868, started the modernization of Japan. Limited democratic reforms were introduced. The [[Taishō period]] (1912–1926) saw more reforms. The beginning of the [[Shōwa period]] reversed this until the end of World War II.

===Since 1972===

According to a study by [[Freedom House]], in 67 countries where dictatorships have fallen since 1972, nonviolent civic resistance was a strong influence over 70 percent of the time. In these transitions, changes were catalyzed not through foreign invasion, and only rarely through armed revolt or voluntary elite-driven reforms, but overwhelmingly by democratic civil society organizations utilizing nonviolent action and other forms of civil resistance, such as strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience, and mass protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=70&amp;release=275 Study: Nonviolent Civic Resistance Key Factor in Building Durable Democracies, May 24, 2005 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indicators==
One influential survey in democratization is that of [[Freedom House]], which arose during the Cold War. Freedom House, today an institution and a think tank, produces one of the most comprehensive "freedom measures" nationally and internationally and by extension a measure of democratization. Freedom House categorizes all countries of the world according to a seven-point value system with over 200 questions on the survey and multiple survey representatives in various parts of every nation. The total raw points of every country places the country in one of three categories: Free, Partly Free, or not Free.

One study simultaneously examining the relationship between market economy (measured with one [[Index of Economic Freedom]]), economic development (measured with GDP/capita), and political freedom (measured with the Freedom House index) found that high [[economic freedom]] increases GDP/capita and a high GDP/capita increases economic freedom. A high GDP/capita also increases political freedom but political freedom did not increase GDP/capita. There was no direct relationship either way between economic freedom and political freedom if keeping GDP/capita constant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ken Farr |author2=Richard A.

==Views==
[[Francis Fukuyama]] wrote another classic in democratization studies entitled ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' which spoke of the rise of [[liberal democracy]] as the final form of human government.  However it has been argued that the expansion of liberal economic reforms has had mixed effects on democratization.  In many ways, it is argued, democratic institutions have been constrained or "disciplined" in order to satisfy international capital markets or to facilitate the global flow of trade.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Alasdair S.,''Empowerment or Discipline? Two Logics of Governmental Reform'' (December 23, 2008). Available at [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1319792 http://ssrn.com/abstract=1319792 SSRN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel P. Huntington]] wrote ''[[The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late 20th century|The Third Wave]]'', partly as response to Fukuyama, defining a global democratization trend in the world post WWII. Huntington defined three waves of democratization that have taken place in history.&lt;ref name='huntington'&gt;{{cite book | last = Huntington | first = Samuel P. | authorlink = Samuel P. Huntington | title = Democratization in the Late 20th century | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | year = 1991 | location = Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first one brought democracy to Western Europe and Northern America in the 19th century. It was followed by a rise of dictatorships during the [[Interwar period]]. The second wave began after [[World War II]], but lost steam between 1962 and the mid-1970s. The latest wave began in 1974 and is still ongoing. Democratization of [[Latin America]] and the former [[Eastern Bloc]] is part of this [[Third Wave Democracy|third wave]].

A very good example of a region which passed through all the three waves of democratization is the Middle East. During the 15th century it was a part of the Ottoman Empire. In the 19th century, "when the empire finally collapsed [...] towards the end of the First World War, the Western armies finally moved in and occupied the region".&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Bromley. ''Rethinking Middle East Politics: State Formation and Development''. (Polity Press, Cambridge, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; This was an act of both European expansion and state-building in order to democratize the region.  However, what Posusney and Angrist argue is that, "the ethnic divisions [...] are [those that are] complicating the U.S. effort to democratize Iraq". This raises interesting questions about the role of combined foreign and domestic factors in the process of democratization. In addition, Edward Said labels as 'orientalist' the predominantly Western perception of "intrinsic incompatibility between democratic values and Islam". Moreover, he states that "the Middle East and North Africa lack the prerequisites of democratization".&lt;ref&gt;ed by Marsha, Pripstein Posusney and Michele, Penner Angrist. ''Authoritarianism in the Middle East: Regimes and Resistance''. ([[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], Inc., USA, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fareed Zakaria]] has examined the security interests benefited from [[democracy promotion]], pointing out the link between levels of democracy in a country and of terrorist activity. Though it is accepted that poverty in the Muslim world has been a leading contributor to the rise of terrorism, Zakaria has noted that the primary terrorists involved in the [[9/11]] attacks were among the upper and upper-middle classes. Zakaria has suggested that the society in which [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists lived provided easy money, and therefore there existed little incentive to modernize economically or politically.&lt;ref&gt;Fareed Zakaria, The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad, W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2007, 138.&lt;/ref&gt; With little opportunity to express themselves in the political sphere, scores of young Arab men were "invited to participate"&lt;ref&gt;Fareed Zakaria, The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad, W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; through another avenue: the culture of [[Islamic fundamentalism]]. The rise of Islamic fundamentalism and its violent expression on September 11, 2001 illustrates an inherent need to express oneself politically, and a democratic government or one with democratic aspects (such as political openness) is quite necessary to provide a forum for political expression.

Larry Pardy observed that governments are motivated by political power, which is generated by two factors: legitimacy and means.  The legitimacy of a democratic government is achieved through the consent of the population through fair and open elections while its financial means are derived from a healthy tax base generated by a vibrant economy.  Economic success is based on a free market economy with the following elements: property rights, a fair and independent judiciary, security, and the rule of law. The core elements that support economic freedom convey the same basic rights onto individuals.  Conversely, there can be no rule of law for investors when governments crack down on political opponents and no property rights for industry when personal wealth can be arbitrarily seized.

According to Clark, Golder, and Golder, an application of  [[Albert O. Hirschman]]'s exit, voice, and loyalty model is that if individuals have plausible exit options, then a government may be more likely to democratize. [[James C. Scott]] argues that governments may find it difficult to claim a sovereignty over a population when that population is in motion.&lt;ref name="C. 2010 7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/872296825|title=The Art of not being governed : an anarchist history of upland Southeast Asia|last=C.|first=Scott, James|date=2010|publisher=NUS Press|year=|isbn=9780300152289|location=|pages=7|oclc=872296825}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott additionally asserts that exit may not solely include physical exit from the territory of a coercive state, but can include a number of adaptive responses to coercion that make it more difficult for states to claim sovereignty over a population.  These responses can include planting crops that are more difficult for states to count, or tending livestock that are more mobile.  In fact, the entire political arrangement of a state is a result of individuals adapting to the environment, and making a choice as to whether or not to stay in a territory.&lt;ref name="C. 2010 7"/&gt; If people are free to move, then the exit, voice, and loyalty model predicts that a state will have to be of that population representative, and appease the populous in order to prevent them from leaving.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf|title=Power and politics: insights from an exit, voice, and loyalty game.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If individuals have plausible exit options then they are better able to constrain a government’s arbitrary behaviour through threat of exit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, [[Alex Tabarrok]] argues that the reverse of this occurred in [[Ferguson, Missouri]]; those who could left the township, but ultimately the local government abused its power as people could not exit in part due to a string of excessive fines which forced them to stay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/03/the-ferguson-kleptocracy.html|title=The Ferguson Kleptocracy|last=Tabarrok|first=Alex|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sustainable democracy has to involve far more than fair and open elections.  It rests on a solid foundation of economic and political freedom that, for Western nations, had to be pried from governments over centuries.  It goes back at least to 1215 when King John accepted limits on his powers and conceded certain rights in the Magna Carta.   Then, as now, governments will be motivated to support rights and freedoms only when it directly impacts the government's ability to maintain and exercise political power.  It does not arise with idealistic notions of democracy and freedom, implied fiscal contracts with citizens, exhortations from donor states or pronouncements from international agencies.  Fukyama was essentially correct with his assertion regarding the end of history – that Western liberal democracy represents the endpoint of mankind's ideological evolution.  It represents a mechanism whereby our free market system efficiently allocates resources in our economy while co-existing in a symbiotic relationship with our democratic system of government.   Our governments are incentivized to protect the economy while the foundations for that economy create the conditions for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Pardy, Larry D.  Understanding the Determinants of Democracy: Opening the Black Box.  Amherst, NS: October 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by political scientist Daniel Treisman, influential theories of democratization posit that autocrats "deliberately choose to share or surrender power. They do so to prevent revolution, motivate citizens to fight wars, incentivize governments to provide [[public goods]], outbid elite rivals, or limit factional violence. Examining the history of all democratizations since 1800, I show that such deliberate choice arguments may help explain up to one third of cases. In about two thirds, democratization occurred not because incumbent elites chose it but because, in trying to prevent it, they made mistakes that weakened their hold on power. Common mistakes include: calling elections or starting military conflicts, only to lose them; ignoring popular unrest and being overthrown; initiating limited reforms that get out of hand; and selecting a covert democrat as leader. These mistakes reflect well-known cognitive biases such as [[Overconfidence effect|overconfidence]] and the [[illusion of control]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treisman|first=Daniel|date=October 2017|title=Democracy by mistake|work=NBER Working Paper No. 23944 |doi=10.3386/w23944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other contexts==
Although democratization is most often thought of in the context of national or regional politics, the term can also be applied to:

===International bodies===
* International bodies (e.g. the [[United Nations]]) where there is an ongoing call for reform and altered voting structures and [[voting system]]s.

===Corporations===
The concept of democratization can also be applied in [[corporation]]s where the traditional power structure was top-down direction and the boss-knows-best (even a "[[Pointy-Haired Boss]]");   This is quite different from consultation, [[empowerment]] (of lower levels) and a diffusion of [[decision making]] (power) throughout the firm, as advocated by [[workplace democracy]] movements.

===The Internet===
The loose anarchistic structure of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] and the [[Internet]] itself have inspired some groups to call for more democratization of how [[domain name]]s are held, upheld, and lost.  They note that the [[Domain Name System]] under [[ICANN]] is the least democratic and most centralized part of the Internet, using a simple model of first-come-first-served to the names of things. [[Ralph Nader]] called this "corporatization of the dictionary."

===Knowledge===
The [[democratization of knowledge]] is the spread of knowledge among common people, in contrast to knowledge being controlled by elite groups.

===Design===
The trend that products from well-known designers are becoming cheaper and more available to masses of consumers. Also, the trend of companies sourcing design decisions from end users.&lt;ref&gt;Harry (2007). [http://mocoloco.com/the-democratization-of-design/ The Democratization of Design]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dependency theory''' is the notion that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and [[Developing country|underdeveloped states]] to a "core" of [[Developed country|wealthy states]], enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[world system]]".

The theory arose as a reaction to [[modernization theory]], an earlier [[development theory|theory of development]] which held that all societies progress through similar stages of development, that today's underdeveloped areas are thus in a similar situation to that of today's developed areas at some time in the past, and that, therefore, the task of helping the underdeveloped areas out of [[poverty]] is to accelerate them along this supposed common path of development, by various means such as [[investment]], [[technology transfer]]s, and closer integration into the [[World economy|world market]]. Dependency theory rejected this view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Newschool, [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm "Economic Development"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714063027/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/schools/develop.htm|date=14 July 2009}}, retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency theory no longer has many proponents as an overall theory, though some writers have argued for its continuing relevance as a conceptual orientation to the global division of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=1997|last1=James|first1=Paul|authorlink2=Paul James (academic)|title=Post-Dependency: The Third World in an Era of Globalism and Late Capitalism|url=https://www.academia.edu/7311042/Post-Dependency_The_Third_World_in_an_Era_of_Globalism_and_Late_Capitalism|journal=Alternatives: Social Transformation and Human Governance|volume=22|issue=2|pages=205–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Dependency theory originates with two papers published in 1949 – one by [[Hans Singer]], one by [[Raúl Prebisch]] – in which the authors observe that the [[terms of trade]] for underdeveloped countries relative to the developed countries had deteriorated over time: the underdeveloped countries were able to purchase fewer and fewer [[Final good|manufactured goods]] from the developed countries in exchange for a given quantity of their raw materials exports. This idea is known as the [[Prebisch–Singer hypothesis|Prebisch–Singer thesis]]. Prebisch, an Argentine economist at the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|United Nations Commission for Latin America]] (UNCLA), went on to conclude that the underdeveloped nations must employ some degree of [[protectionism]] in trade if they were to enter a self-sustaining development path. He argued that [[Import substitution industrialization|import-substitution industrialisation]] (ISI), not a [[Export-oriented industrialization|trade-and-export orientation]], was the best strategy for underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref&gt;Short [http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/prebisch.htm Prebisch biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812085123/http://homepage.newschool.edu/het/profiles/prebisch.htm |date=2009-08-12 }} at Newschool; retrieved July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory was developed from a [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] perspective by [[Paul A. Baran]] in 1957 with the publication of his ''The Political Economy of Growth''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matias Vernengo|url=http://www.econ.utah.edu/activities/papers/2004_06.pdf|title=Technology, Finance and Dependency: Latin American Radical Political Economy in Retospect|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317085658/http://www.econ.utah.edu/activities/papers/2004_06.pdf|archivedate=17 March 2012|year=2004|page=5}}Working Paper No. 2004-06, University of Utah Dept. of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; Dependency theory shares many points with earlier, Marxist, theories of [[imperialism]] by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]], and has attracted continued interest from Marxists. Some authors identify two main streams in dependency theory: the Latin American Structuralist, typified by the work of Prebisch, [[Celso Furtado]], and [[Aníbal Pinto Santa Cruz|Aníbal Pinto]] at the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLAC, or, in Spanish, CEPAL); and the American Marxist, developed by [[Paul A. Baran]], [[Paul Sweezy]], and [[Andre Gunder Frank]].

Using the Latin American dependency model, the Guyanese Marxist historian [[Walter Rodney]], in his book ''How Europe Underdeveloped Africa'', described in 1972 an Africa that had been consciously exploited by European imperialists, leading directly to the modern underdevelopment of most of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney, W. (1972). How Europe underdeveloped Africa. Beyond borders: Thinking critically about global issues, 107-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory was popular in the 1960s and 1970s as a criticism of modernization theory, which was falling increasingly out of favor because of continued widespread poverty in much of the world. It was used to explain the causes of [[overurbanization]], a theory that urbanization rates outpaced industrial growth in several developing countries.&lt;ref name=Shandra&gt;Shandra, John M., Bruce London, and John B. Williamson. "Environmental Degradation, Environmental Sustainability, and Overurbanization in the Developing World: A Quantitative, Cross-National Analysis." Sociological Perspectives 46, no. 3 (1 September 2003): 309–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin American Structuralist and the American Marxist schools had significant differences but agreed on some basic points:{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}&lt;blockquote&gt;[B]oth groups would agree that at the core of the dependency relation between center and periphery lays [lies] the inability of the periphery to develop an autonomous and dynamic process of technological innovation. Technology &lt;span role="presentation"&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; the Promethean force unleashed by the [[Industrial Revolution]] &lt;span&gt;–&lt;/span&gt; is at the center of stage. The Center countries controlled the technology and the systems for generating technology. Foreign [[Capital (economics)|capital]] could not solve the problem, since it only led to limited transmission of technology, but not the process of innovation itself. Baran and others frequently spoke of the [[international division of labour]] – skilled workers in the center; unskilled in the periphery – when discussing key features of dependency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Baran placed surplus extraction and [[capital accumulation]] at the center of his analysis. Development depends on a population's producing more than it needs for bare subsistence (a surplus). Further, some of that surplus must be used for capital accumulation – the purchase of new [[means of production]] – if development is to occur; spending the surplus on things like luxury consumption does not produce development. Baran noted two predominant kinds of economic activity in poor countries. In the older of the two, plantation agriculture, which originated in [[Colonialism|colonial times]], most of the surplus goes to the landowners, who use it to emulate the consumption patterns of wealthy people in the developed world; much of it thus goes to purchase foreign-produced luxury items –automobiles, clothes, etc. – and little is accumulated for investing in development. The more recent kind of economic activity in the periphery is industry—but of a particular kind. It is usually carried out by foreigners, although often in conjunction with local interests. It is often under special [[tariff]] protection or other government concessions. The surplus from this production mostly goes to two places: part of it is sent back to the foreign [[shareholder]]s as [[Profit (economics)|profit]]; the other part is spent on conspicuous consumption in a similar fashion to that of the plantation aristocracy. Again, little is used for development. Baran thought that political revolution was necessary to break this pattern.

In the 1960s, members of the Latin American Structuralist school argued that there is more latitude in the system than the Marxists believed. They argued that it allows for partial development or "dependent development"&amp;ndash;development, but still under the control of outside decision makers. They cited the partly successful attempts at [[industrialisation]] in Latin America around that time (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico) as evidence for this hypothesis. They were led to the position that dependency is not a relation between commodity exporters and industrialised countries, but between countries with different degrees of industrialisation. In their approach, there is a distinction made between the economic and political spheres: economically, one may be developed or underdeveloped; but even if (somewhat) economically developed, one may be politically autonomous or dependent.&lt;ref&gt;So, Alvin Y. 1990. Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory. Newbury Park, London and New Delhi: Sage Publications
&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Guillermo O'Donnell]] has argued that constraints placed on development by [[neoliberalism]] were lifted by the military coups in Latin America that came to promote development in authoritarian guise (O'Donnell, 1982).&lt;ref&gt;G O'Donnell, ''El Estado Burocrático Autoritario: Triunfos, Derrotas y Crisis'', Buenos Aires, Universidad de Belgrano, written 1982, published 1996, cited in Vernengo, ''Technology, Finance and Dependency'', p 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of [[multinational corporation]]s and state promotion of technology were emphasised by the Latin American Structuralists.

Fajnzybler has made a distinction between systemic or authentic competitiveness, which is the ability to compete based on higher productivity, and spurious competitiveness, which is based on low wages.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Vernengo, p 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Debt of developing countries|third-world debt]] crisis of the 1980s and continued stagnation in Africa and Latin America in the 1990s caused some doubt as to the feasibility or desirability of "dependent development".&lt;ref&gt;Vernengo, p 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''sine qua non'' of the dependency relationship is not the difference in technological sophistication, as traditional dependency theorists believe, but rather the difference in financial strength between core and peripheral countries&amp;ndash;particularly the inability of peripheral countries to borrow in their own currency. He believes that the [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] position of the United States is very strong because of the importance of its financial markets and because it controls the international [[reserve currency]] &amp;ndash; the [[United States dollar|US dollar]]. He believes that the end of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international financial agreements]] in the early 1970s considerably strengthened the United States' position because it removed some constraints on their financial actions.

"Standard" dependency theory differs from Marxism, in arguing against [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] and any hope of progress in less developed nations towards industrialization and a liberating revolution. Theotonio dos Santos described a "new dependency", which focused on both the internal and external relations of less-developed countries of the periphery, derived from a Marxian analysis. Former Brazilian President [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] (in office 1995&amp;ndash;2002) wrote extensively on dependency theory while in political exile during the 1960s, arguing that it was an approach to studying the economic disparities between the centre and periphery. Cardoso summarized his version of dependency theory as follows:
*there is a financial and technological penetration by the developed capitalist centers of the countries of the periphery and semi-periphery;
*this produces an unbalanced economic structure both within the peripheral societies and between them and the centers;
*this leads to limitations on self-sustained growth in the periphery;
*this favors the appearance of specific patterns of [[Social class|class]] relations;
*these require modifications in the role of the state to guarantee both the functioning of the economy and the political articulation of a society, which contains, within itself, foci of inarticulateness and structural imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso &amp; Faletto, 1979, cited in Tausch, ''Sustainable Development and Turkey's Accession'', about 1/6 of way through.&lt;/ref&gt;

The analysis of development patterns in the 1990s and beyond is complicated by the fact that capitalism develops not smoothly, but with very strong and self-repeating ups and downs, called cycles. Relevant results are given in studies by Joshua Goldstein, Volker Bornschier, and Luigi Scandella.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

With the economic growth of India and some East Asian economies, dependency theory has lost some of its former influence. It still influences some [[NGO]] campaigns, such as [[Make Poverty History]] and the [[fair trade]] movement.

==Other theorists and related theories==
Two other early writers relevant to dependency theory were [[François Perroux]] and [[Kurt W. Rothschild|Kurt Rothschild]]. Other leading dependency theorists include Herb Addo, [[Walden Bello]], Ruy Mauro Marini, Enzo Faletto, Armando Cordova, Ernest Feder, Pablo González Casanova, [[Keith Griffin (economist)|Keith Griffin]], [[Kunibert Raffer]], Paul Israel Singer, and Osvaldo Sunkel. Many of these authors focused their attention on Latin America; the leading dependency theorist in the Islamic world is the Egyptian economist [[Samir Amin]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tausch|first=Arno|date=2003|title=Social Cohesion, Sustainable Development and Turkey's Accession to the European Union: Implications from a Global Model|url=http://alternativesjournal.net/article/view/5000159492/5000143927|journal=[[Alternatives: Turkish Journal of International Relations]]|volume=2|issue=1|doi=|pmid=|via=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827004744/http://alternativesjournal.net/article/view/5000159492/5000143927|archivedate=27 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tausch,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; based on works of Amin from 1973 to 1997, lists the following main characteristics of periphery capitalism:
#Regression in both agriculture and small scale industry characterizes the period after the onslaught of foreign domination and colonialism
#Unequal international specialization of the periphery leads to the concentration of activities in export-oriented agriculture and or mining. Some industrialization of the periphery is possible under the condition of low wages, which, together with rising productivity, determine that unequal exchange sets in (double factorial terms of trade &lt; 1.0; see Raffer, 1987)
#These structures determine in the long run a rapidly growing tertiary sector with hidden unemployment and the rising importance of rent in the overall social and economic system
#Chronic current account balance deficits, re-exported profits of foreign investments, and deficient business cycles at the periphery that provide important markets for the centers during world economic upswings
#Structural imbalances in the political and social relationships, inter alia a strong '[[wikt:comprador|compradore]]' element and the rising importance of state capitalism and an indebted state class&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The American sociologist [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] refined the Marxist aspect of the theory and expanded on it, to form [[world-systems theory]]. This postulates a third category of countries, the ''semi-periphery'', intermediate between the core and periphery. Wallerstein believed in a tri-modal rather than a bi-modal system because he viewed the world-systems as more complicated than a simplistic classification as either core or periphery nations. To Wallerstein, many nations do not fit into one of these two categories, so he proposed the idea of a semi-periphery as an in between state within his model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory|last=So|first=Alvin|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|year=1990|isbn=|location=Newbury Park, London|pages=169-199|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, the semi-periphery is industrialized, but with less sophistication of technology than in the core; and it does not control finances. The rise of one group of semi-peripheries tends to be at the cost of another group, but the unequal structure of the world economy based on unequal exchange tends to remain stable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tausch&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; traces the beginnings of world-systems theory to the writings of the Austro-Hungarian socialist [[Karl Polanyi]] after the [[World War I|First World War]], but its present form is usually associated with the work of Wallerstein.

Dependency theory has also been associated with [[Johan Galtung]]'s structural theory of imperialism.

Dependency theorists hold that short-term spurts of growth notwithstanding, long-term growth in the periphery will be imbalanced and unequal, and will tend towards high negative [[current account]] balances.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Cyclical fluctuations also have a profound effect on cross-national comparisons of economic growth and societal development in the medium and long run. What seemed like spectacular long-run growth may in the end turn out to be just a short run cyclical spurt after a long recession. Cycle time plays an important role. [[Giovanni Arrighi]] believed that the logic of accumulation on a world scale shifts over time, and that the 1980s and beyond once more showed a deregulated phase of world capitalism with a logic, characterized - in contrast to earlier regulatory cycles - by the dominance of financial capital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It is argued that, at this stage, the role of [[unequal exchange]] in the entire relationship of dependency cannot be underestimated.{{Clarify|date=August 2016}} Unequal exchange is given if double factorial terms of trade of the respective country are &lt; 1.0 (Raffer, 1987, Amin, 1975).

The former ideological head of the [[Blekingegade Gang]] and political activist [[Torkil Lauesen]] argues in his book ''The Global Perspective'' that political theory and practice stemming from dependency theory are more relevant than ever.&lt;ref&gt;Lauesen, Torkil. ''The Global Perspective: Reflections on Imperialism and Resistance''. Montreal: Kersplebedeb, 2018. p. 321ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He postulates that the conflict between countries in the core and countries in the periphery has been ever-intensifying and that the world is at the onset of a resolution of the core-periphery contradiction – that humanity is "in for an economic and political rollercoaster ride".&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Economic policies based on dependency theory has been criticized by [[Free market|free-market]] economists such as [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]] and [[Martin Wolf]] and others:&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Korotayev A., Zinkina J.

Market economists cite a number of examples in their arguments against dependency theory. The improvement of [[India]]'s economy after it moved from state-controlled business to open trade is one of the most often cited (''see also'' [[economy of India]], ''[[The Commanding Heights]]''). India's example seems to contradict dependency theorists' claims concerning comparative advantage and mobility, as much as its economic growth originated from movements such as [[outsourcing]] – one of the most mobile forms of capital transfer. [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]] provide another example of trade-based development vs. autocratic self-sufficiency. Following the Korean War, North Korea pursued a policy of [[import substitution industrialization]] as suggested by dependency theory, while South Korea pursued a policy of [[export-oriented industrialization]] as suggested by comparative advantage theory. In 2013, South Korea's per capita GDP was 18 times that of North Korea. In Africa, states which have emphasized import-substitution development, such as [[Zimbabwe]], have typically been among the worst performers, while the continent's most successful non-oil based economies, such as [[Egypt]], [[South Africa]], and [[Tunisia]], have pursued trade-based development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/economic_studies/whats_driving_africas_growth&lt;/ref&gt;

According to economic historian Robert C. Allen, dependency theory's claims are "debatable", and that the protectionism that was implemented in Latin America as a solution ended up failing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oupcanada.com/catalog/9780199596652.html|title=Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction {{!}} Robert C.

'''Digital Radio Mondiale''' ('''DRM'''; ''mondiale'' being [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] for "worldwide") is a set of [[digital radio|digital audio broadcasting]] technologies designed to work over the bands currently used for analogue radio broadcasting including [[AM broadcasting]], particularly [[shortwave]], and [[FM broadcasting]]. DRM is more spectrally efficient than AM and FM, allowing more stations, at higher quality, into a given amount of [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], using various [[MPEG-4]] [[audio coding format]]s.

Digital Radio Mondiale is also the name of the international [[non-profit]] [[consortium]] that has designed the platform and is now promoting its introduction. [[Radio France Internationale]], [[TéléDiffusion de France]], [[BBC World Service]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Voice of America]], [[Telefunken]] (now [[Transradio]]) and Thomcast (now [[Ampegon]]) took part at the formation of the DRM consortium.

The principle of DRM is that bandwidth is the limited element, and computer processing power is cheap; modern [[Central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive audio compression techniques enable more efficient use of available bandwidth, at the expense of processing resources.

==Features==

DRM can deliver up to [[frequency modulation|FM]]-comparable sound quality{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} on frequencies below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[long wave]], [[medium wave]] and [[short wave]]), which allow for very-long-distance signal propagation. The modes for these lower frequencies are often collectively known under the term "DRM30". In the VHF bands, the term "DRM+" is used. DRM+ is able to use available broadcast spectra between 30 and 300&amp;nbsp;MHz; generally this means band I (47 to 68&amp;nbsp;MHz), band II (87.5 to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz) and band III (174 to 230&amp;nbsp;MHz). DRM has been designed to be able to re-use portions of existing analogue [[transmitter]] facilities such as antennas, feeders, and, especially for DRM30, the transmitters themselves, avoiding major new investment. DRM is robust against the fading and interference which often plague conventional broadcasting in these frequency ranges.

The encoding and decoding can be performed with [[digital signal processing]], so that a cheap [[embedded system|embedded]] computer with a conventional transmitter and receiver can perform the rather complex encoding and decoding.

As a digital medium, DRM can transmit other data besides the audio channels ([[datacasting]]) &amp;mdash; as well as [[RBDS|RDS]]-type [[metadata]] or [[program-associated data]] as [[Digital Audio Broadcasting]] (DAB) does. DRM services can be operated in many different network configurations, from a traditional AM one-service one-transmitter model to a multi-service (up to four) multi-transmitter model, either as a [[single-frequency network]] (SFN) or [[multi-frequency network]] (MFN). Hybrid operation, where the same transmitter delivers both analogue and DRM services simultaneously is also possible.

DRM incorporates technology known as Emergency Warning Features that can override other programming and activates radios which are in standby in order to receive emergency broadcasts.

==Status==
The technical standard is available free-of-charge from the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute|ETSI]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_es/201900_201999/201980/04.01.01_60/es_201980v040101p.pdf|title=DRM System specification|author=|date=|website=etsi.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] has approved its use in most of the world. Approval for [[ITU region|ITU region 2]] is pending amendments to existing international agreements. The inaugural broadcast took place on June 16, 2003, in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], at the ITU's [[World Radio Conference]].

Current broadcasters include [[All India Radio]], [[BBC World Service]], [[BitExpress]], [[Radio Exterior de España]], [[Radio New Zealand International]], [[Vatican Radio]], [[Radio Romania International]] and Radio Kuweit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm.org/?page_id=151|title=Digital Radio Mondiale -   Broadcast Schedule|author=|date=|website=www.drm.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until now DRM receivers have typically used a [[personal computer]]. A few manufacturers have introduced DRM receivers which have thus far remained niche products due to limited choice of broadcasts. It is expected that the transition of national broadcasters to digital services on DRM, notably All India Radio, will stimulate the production of a new generation of affordable, and efficient receivers.

[[Chengdu NewStar Electronics]] is offering the DR111 from May 2012 on which meets the minimum requirements for DRM receivers specified by the DRM consortium and is sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DR111 DRM Radio |publisher=Chengdu NewStar Electronics &amp;#124; 成都纽斯达电子公司: |year=2014 |url=http://www.cdnse.com/products/dr111 |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Overseas Service of [[All India Radio]] broadcasts daily in DRM to Western Europe on 9.95&amp;nbsp;MHz at 17:45 to 22:30 UTC.&lt;ref&gt;http://allindiaradio.gov.in/Services/Digital%20Transmission/Pages/simple.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  [[All India Radio]] is in the process of replacing and refurbishing many of its domestic AM transmitters with DRM. The project which began in 2012 is scheduled to complete during 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm.org/?page_id=2494|title=Digital Radio Mondiale -   DRM India Page|author=|date=|website=www.drm.org|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Broadcasting Corporation [[BBC]] has trialed the technology in the [[United Kingdom]] by broadcasting [[BBC Radio Devon]] in the Plymouth area in the MF band. The [http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/digitalmediumwave/faqs_feature.shtml trial] lasted for a year (April 2007 – April 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2009/05/11/digital_medium_wave_report_feature.shtml|title=Digital medium wave trial report|first=|last=BBC|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[BBC]] also trialed DRM+ in the FM band in 2010 from the [[Craigkelly transmitting station]] in [[Fife]], Scotland, over an area which included the city of [[Edinburgh]]. In this trial, a previously used 10&amp;nbsp;kW (ERP) FM transmitter was replaced with a 1&amp;nbsp;kW DRM+ transmitter in two different modes and the coverage compared with FM &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/whp/whp-pdf-files/WHP199.pdf|title=BBC Research White Paper WHP199|author=|date=|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Digital Radio Mondiale was included in the 2007 [[Ofcom]] consultation on the future of radio in the [[United Kingdom]] for the AM medium wave band.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/futureradio/ The Future of Radio (Ofcom, 2007)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616043938/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/consult/condocs/futureradio/ |date=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTÉ has also run single and multiple programme overnight tests during a similar period on the 252&amp;nbsp;kHz LW transmitter in Trim, Co.Meath, Ireland which was upgraded to support DRM after [[Atlantic 252]] closed.

The Fraunhofer Institute for integrated circuits IIS offers a package for software defined radios which can be licensed to radio manufacturers. [http://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en/pr/2016/20160310_KS_Software_DRM.html]

===International regulation===
On 28 September 2006, the [[Australia]]n spectrum regulator, the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]], announced that it had "placed an embargo on frequency bands potentially suitable for use by broadcasting services using Digital Radio Mondiale until spectrum planning can be completed" "those bands being "5,950–6,200; 7,100–7,300; 9,500–9,900; 11,650–12,050; 13,600–13,800; 15,100–15,600; 17,550–17,900; 21,450–21,850 and 25,670–26,100&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]]: [http://www.acma.gov.au/webwr/radcomm/frequency_planning/spectrum_embargoes/embargo44.pdf Embargo on new frequency assignments to support domestic broadcasting services using DRM tecxhnology]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States]] [[Federal Communications Commission]] states in {{CodeFedReg|47|73|758}} that:  "For digitally modulated emissions, the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) standard shall be employed."  Part 73, section 758 is for [[high frequency|HF]] broadcasting only.

==Technological Overview==

===Audio source coding===
Useful bitrates for DRM30 range from 6.1 kbit/s (Mode D) to 34.8 kbit/s (Mode A) for a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth (±5&amp;nbsp;kHz around the central frequency). It is possible to achieve bit rates up to 72 kbit/s (Mode A) by using a standard 20&amp;nbsp;kHz (±10&amp;nbsp;kHz) wide channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.drm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DRM-guide-artwork-9-2013-1.pdf
|format=PDF; 6.7&amp;nbsp;MB
|title=DRM Introduction and Implementation Guide
|page=22
|publisher=DRM
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For comparison, pure digital [[HD Radio]] can broadcast 20 kbit/s using channels 10&amp;nbsp;kHz wide and up to 60 kbit/s using 20&amp;nbsp;kHz channels.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiquity.com/i/pdfs/Waveforms_AM.pdf |title=The Structure and Generation of Robust Waveforms for AM In-Band On-Channel Digital Broadcasting |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206042040/http://www.ibiquity.com/i/pdfs/Waveforms_AM.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Useful bitrate depends also on other parameters, such as:
* desired robustness to errors ([[Forward error correction|error coding]])
* power needed ([[modulation]] scheme)
* robustness in regard to propagation conditions ([[multipath propagation]], [[doppler effect]]), etc.

When DRM was originally designed, it was clear that the most robust modes offered insufficient capacity for the then state-of-the-art audio coding format [[MPEG-4]] [[HE-AAC]] (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). Therefore, the standard launched with a choice of three different audio coding systems (source coding) depending on the bitrate:
*[[MPEG-4]]  [[HE-AAC]] (High Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding). AAC is a perceptual coder suited for voice and music and the High Efficiency is an optional extension for reconstruction of high frequencies (SBR: spectral bandwidth replication) and stereo image (PS: Parametric Stereo). 24&amp;nbsp;kHz or 12&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling frequencies can be used for core AAC (no SBR) which correspond respectively to 48&amp;nbsp;kHz and 24&amp;nbsp;kHz when using SBR oversampling.
*[[MPEG-4]] [[CELP]] which is a parametric coder suited for voice only (vocoder) but that is robust to errors and needs a small bit rate.
*[[MPEG-4]] [[HVXC]] which is also a parametric coder for speech programs that uses an even smaller bitrate than CELP.

However, with the development of [[MPEG-4]] [[xHE-AAC]], which is an implementation of MPEG [[Unified Speech and Audio Coding]], the DRM standard was updated and the two speech-only coding formats, CELP and HVXC, were replaced. USAC is designed to combine the properties of a speech and a general audio coding according to bandwidth constraints and so is able to handle all kinds of programme material. Given that there were few CELP and HVXC broadcasts on-air, the decision to drop the speech-only coding formats has passed without issue.

Many broadcasters still use the [[HE-AAC]] coding format because it still offers an acceptable audio quality, somewhat comparable to [[FM broadcasting|FM broadcast]] at bitrates above about 15 kbit/s. However, it is anticipated that in future, most broadcasters will adopt [[xHE-AAC]].

Additionally, as of v2.1, the popular Dream software can broadcast using the [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] coding format. Whilst not within the current DRM standard the inclusion of this codec is provided for experimentation. Aside from perceived technical advantages over the MPEG family such as low latency (delay between coding and decoding), this codec provides an open source (therefore free to use) alternative to the proprietary MPEG family whose use is permitted at the discretion of the patent holders, unfortunately it has a substantially lower audio quality than xHE-AAC on low bitrates, which are a key to conserve bandwidth. In fact, at 8Kbps Opus actually sounds worse than analog shortwave radio. A video showing the comparison between Opus and xHE-AAC is available [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEUwScTX-R4 here]. Equipment manufacturers currently pay royalties for incorporating the MPEG codecs.

===Bandwidth===
DRM broadcasting can be done using a choice of different bandwidths:

*4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a [[simulcast]] and use the lower-sideband area of a 9&amp;nbsp;kHz raster channel for [[amplitude modulation|AM]], with a 4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/102500_102599/102509/01.01.01_60/ts_102509v010101p.pdf |title=See section 5: "DRM/AM single channel simulcast"}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is not good.
*5&amp;nbsp;kHz. Gives the ability for the broadcaster to do a [[simulcast]] and use the lower-sideband area of a 10&amp;nbsp;kHz raster channel for AM, with a 5&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM signal occupying the area traditionally taken by the upper-sideband. However the resulting bit rate and audio quality is marginal (7.1–16.7&amp;nbsp;kbit/s for 5&amp;nbsp;kHz). This technique could be used on the [[short wave]] bands throughout the world. 
*9&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region&amp;nbsp;1 long wave or medium wave broadcast channel.
*10&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies half the standard bandwidth of a region&amp;nbsp;2 broadcast channel. could be used to simulcast with analogue audio channel restricted to NRSC5. Occupies a full worldwide short wave broadcast channel (giving 14.8–34.8 kbit/s)
*18&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region&amp;nbsp;1 long wave or medium wave channels according to the existing frequency plan. This offers better audio quality.
*20&amp;nbsp;kHz. Occupies full bandwidth of region&amp;nbsp;2 or region 3 AM channel according to the existing frequency plan. This offers highest audio quality of the DRM30 standard (giving 30.6–72&amp;nbsp;kbit/s).
* 100&amp;nbsp;kHz for DRM+. This bandwidth can be used in band I, II, and III and DRM+ can transmit four different programs in this bandwidth or even one low definition digital video channel.

===Modulation===
The modulation used for DRM is coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ([[COFDM]]), where every carrier is modulated with quadrature amplitude modulation ([[QAM]]) with a selectable error coding.

The choice of transmission parameters depends on signal robustness wanted and propagation conditions. Transmission signal is affected by noise, interference, multipath wave propagation and [[Doppler effect]].

It is possible to choose among several error coding schemes and several modulation patterns: 64-QAM, 16-QAM and 4-QAM. OFDM modulation has some parameters that must be adjusted depending on propagation conditions. This is the carrier spacing which will determine the robustness against Doppler effect (which cause frequencies offsets, spread: Doppler spread) and OFDM guard interval which determine robustness against multipath propagation (which cause delay offsets, spread: delay spread). The DRM consortium has determined four different profiles corresponding to typical propagation conditions:
*A: Gaussian channel with very little multipath propagation and Doppler effect. This profile is suited for local or regional broadcasting.
*B: multipath propagation channel. This mode is suited for medium range transmission. It is nowadays frequently used.
*C: similar to mode B, but with better robustness to Doppler (more carrier spacing). This mode is suited for long distance transmission.
*D: similar to mode B, but with a resistance to large delay spread and Doppler spread. This case exists with adverse propagation conditions on very long distance transmissions. The useful bit rate for this profile is decreased.

The trade-off between these profiles stands between robustness, resistance in regards to propagation conditions and useful bit rates for the service. This table presents some values depending on these profiles. The larger the carrier spacing, the more the system is resistant to Doppler effect (Doppler spread). The larger the guard interval, the greater the resistance to long multipath propagation errors (delay spread).

The resulting low-[[bit rate]] digital information is [[modulation|modulated]] using [[COFDM]]. It can run in [[simulcast]] mode by switching between DRM and AM, and it is also prepared for linking to other alternatives (e.g., [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] or FM services).

DRM has been tested successfully on [[shortwave]], [[mediumwave]] (with 9 as well as 10 [[kHz]] [[channel spacing]]) and [[longwave]].

There is also a lower bandwidth two-way communication version of DRM as a replacement for SSB communications on HF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://n1su.com/windrm/|title=WinDRM] - software for Audio and Fast Data over HF SSB |author=|date=|website=n1su.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; - note that it is ''not'' compatible with the official DRM specification. It may be possible in some future time for the 4.5&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth DRM version used by the Amateur Radio community to be merged with the existing DRM specification.

The Dream software will receive the commercial versions and also limited transmission mode using the FAAC AAC encoder.

===Error coding===
Error coding can be chosen to be more or less robust.

This table shows an example of useful bitrates depending on protection classes
* OFDM propagation profiles (A or B)
* carrier modulation (16QAM or 64QAM)
* and channel bandwidth (9 or 10&amp;nbsp;kHz)

The lower the protection class the higher the level of error correction.

==DRM+ ==
While the initial DRM standard covered the broadcasting bands below 30&amp;nbsp;MHz, the DRM consortium voted in March 2005 to begin the process of extending the system to the VHF bands up to 108&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110611151234/http://www.drm.org/uploads/files/drm_plus_pres.pdf DRM+ Presentation], DRM.org, accessed 2009-02-02&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 August 2009, DRM+ (Mode E) became an official broadcasting standard with the publication of the technical specification by the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]; this is effectively a new release of the whole DRM spec with the additional mode permitting operation above 30&amp;nbsp;MHz up to 174&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;ETSI ES 201 980 V3.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Wider bandwidth channels are used, which allows radio stations to use higher bit rates, thus providing higher audio quality. A 100&amp;nbsp;kHz DRM+ channel has sufficient capacity to carry one low-definition 0.7 megabit/s wide mobile TV channel: it would be feasible to distribute [[mobile TV]] over DRM+ rather than [[Digital Multimedia Broadcasting|DMB]] or [[DVB-H]]. However, DRM+ (DRM Mode E) as designed and standardized only provides bitrates between 37.2 and 186.3&amp;nbsp;kbit/s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= DRM Introduction and Implementation Guide | publisher=DRM Consortium | date=13 September 2013 | url=http://www.drm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/DRM-guide-artwork-9-2013-1.pdf | pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://drm-forum.de/images/drm-forum/drm-workshop-2016/Use_of_DRMplus_in_the_FM_Band.pdf | title=Use of DRM+ in the FM Band 87.5-108MHz | pages=6 | first=Jens | last=Schroeder | date=April 2016 | publisher=Deutsches DRM-Forum }}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on robustness level, using 4-QAM or 16-QAM modulations and 100&amp;nbsp;kHz bandwidth.

DRM+ has been successfully tested in all the VHF bands, and this gives the DRM system the widest frequency usage; it can be used in band I, II and III. DRM+ can coexist with DAB in band III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drm-radio-kl.eu/symposium2010/symposium2010en.htm|title=Symposium DRM+ im VHF-Band III in Kaiserslautern|author=|date=|website=www.drm-radio-kl.eu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also the present FM-band can be utilized. The ITU has published three recommendations on DRM+, known in the documents as Digital System G. This indicate  the introduction of the full DRM system (DRM 30 and DRM+).
ITU-R Rec. BS.1114 is the ITU recommendation for sound broadcasting in the frequency range 30&amp;nbsp;MHz to 3&amp;nbsp;GHz. DAB, HD-Radio and ISDB-T were already recommended in this document as Digital Systems A, C and F respectively.

In 2011, the paneuropean organisation Community Media Forum Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmfe.eu|title=Community Media Forum Europe - Information and Lobbying for the Community Media Sector|author=|date=|website=cmfe.eu|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has recommended to the European Commission that DRM+ should rather be used for small scale broadcasting (local radio, community radio) than DAB/DAB+.

==Publications==

===''DCP1''===

The first edition of ''Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries'', commonly referred to as ''DCP1'', was published in 1993.&lt;ref name=pubdates/&gt; ''DCP1'' is cited in the 1993 [[World Development Report]].

''DCP1'' is organized into five parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries |editor1-last=Jamison |editor1-first=Dean T. |editor2-last=Mosley |editor2-first=W. Henry |editor3-last=Measham |editor3-first=Anthony R. |editor4-last=Bobadilla |editor4-first=José Luis |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Introduction
* The Unfinished Agenda, I · Infectious Disease
* The Unfinished Agenda, II · Reproductive Health and Malnutrition
* Emerging Problems
* Conclusion

Each part has chapters within it; there are 29 chapters in all. The report spans more than 700 pages and has as contributors 79 authors in addition to the four editors.

===''DCP2''===

The second edition of ''Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries'', commonly referred to as ''DCP2'' and sometimes referred to as "the DCP2 Report", was published in 2006.&lt;ref name=pubdates/&gt; ''DCP2'' is organized into 73 chapters, and is a 1400-page report by more than 350 specialists around the world with the goal of providing policy recommendations to reduce global disease burdens.&lt;ref name=dcp2report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCP |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123153101/http://www.dcp2.org/pubs/DCP |archivedate=January 23, 2013 |title = Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries (2nd Edition)|publisher = Disease Control Priorities Project|accessdate = 2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is in English, but translations for some of the chapters to [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are available. The report has been released under the [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons attribution license (CC-BY)]] and a copy of ''DCP2'' can be downloaded from the [[World Bank]]'s Open Knowledge Repository.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/7242|title = Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, Second Edition|publisher = Disease Control Priorities Project (mirrored on the World Bank website)|accessdate = 2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full text of the report can also be read online on the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] ([[National Institutes of Health]]) website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11728/|title = Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2nd edition|publisher = Disease Control Priorities Project (mirrored on the NCBI website)|accessdate = 2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to ''DCP1'', ''DCP2'' is more systematic in its coverage.&lt;ref name=dcp2_fm/&gt;{{rp|xviii}}

===''DCP3''===

For third edition, the name of the report was shortened to ''Disease Control Priorities''. The third edition is commonly referred to as ''DCP3'', and is under preparation and is expected to be published over the time period 2015–2016. It has nine separate volumes. The final and summary volume will be published in 2016. Separate volumes on [[cancer]] and [[surgery]] will be published earlier. [[Toby Ord]] of [[Giving What We Can]] is on the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2014-05-13/toby-ord-and-dcp3|title = Toby Ord and DCP3|last = Hutchinson|first = Michelle|date = May 13, 2014|accessdate = May 14, 2014|publisher = [[Giving What We Can]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of April 2016, four of nine volumes of ''DCP3'' have been published online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dcp-3.org/news/press-releasedisease-control-priorities-3rd-edition-releases-fourth-volume-mental-neurological |date=April 11, 2016 |title=PRESS RELEASE: Disease Control Priorities, 3rd Edition Releases Fourth Volume: Mental, Neurological, and Substance Use Disorders |publisher=DCPP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine volumes are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dcp-3.org/disease-control-priorities-third-edition |title=About Disease Control Priorities, Third Edition |publisher=DCPP |accessdate=May 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The [[Science Education Resource Center]], [[Carleton College]], offers the following description: "Earth system science embraces chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics and applied sciences in transcending disciplinary boundaries to treat the Earth as an integrated system. It seeks a deeper understanding of the physical, chemical, biological and human interactions that determine the past, current and future states of the Earth. Earth system science provides a physical basis for understanding the world in which we live and upon which humankind seeks to achieve sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/introgeo/earthsystem/nutshell/|title=Earth System Science in a Nutshell|publisher=[[Carleton College]] |accessdate=2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
For millennia, humans have speculated how the physical and living elements on the surface of the Earth combine, with gods and goddesses frequently posited to embody specific elements. The notion that the Earth, itself, is alive was a regular theme of Greek philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name="Tickell"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tickell |first=Crispin |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ebulletin-archive/ebulletin/features/2000-2009/2006/11/nparticle.2006-11-20.html |title=Earth Systems Science: Are We Pushing Gaia Too Hard? |work= 46th Annual Bennett Lecture - University of Leicester |location=London |publisher=University of Leicester |date=2006 |accessdate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early scientific interpretations of the Earth system began in the field of [[geology]], initially in the Middle East&lt;ref&gt;Fielding H. Garrison, ''An introduction to the history of medicine'', W.B. Saunders, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; and China,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Age of Achievement: A.D. 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century : The Achievements |series=History of civilizations of Central Asia |editor1-first=M.

As [[History of geology|geology developed as a science]], understanding of the interplay of different facets of the Earth system increased, leading to the inclusion of factors such as the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's interior]], [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|planetary geology]] and [[Biosphere|living systems]].

In many respects, the foundational concepts of Earth system science can be seen in the holistic interpretations of nature promoted by the 19th century geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |journal=Science |title=Alexander von Humboldt and the General Physics of the Earth |first=Stephen T. |last=Jackson |volume=324 |pages=596-597 |url=http://faculty.jsd.claremont.edu/dmcfarlane/bio176mcfarlane/pdf%20papers/Humboldt%20hsitory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, [[Vladimir Vernadsky]] (1863–1945) saw the functioning of the [[biosphere]] as a geological force generating a dynamic disequilibrium, which in turn promoted the diversity of life. In the mid-1960s, [[James Lovelock]] first postulated a regulatory role for the biosphere in [[feedback]] mechanisms within the Earth system. Initially named the "Earth Feedback hypothesis",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Kasting| first1=James| title=The Gaia Hypothesis is Still Giving Us Feedback| url=http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/the-gaia-hypothesis-is-still-giving-us-feedback| accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Publications/PDF_Papers/GAIA_hypothesis.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Gaia Hypothesis and Earth System Science |last=Schneider |first=Stephen |last2=Boston |first2=Penelope |work=University of Florida |publisher=MIT Press |date=1992 |accessdate=2015-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Highfield| first1=Roger| title=Unlocking Lovelock, science's greatest maverick| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/10735286/Unlocking-James-Lovelock-sciences-greatest-maverick.html| website=The Telegraph| publisher=The Telegraph| accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock later renamed it the [[Gaia hypothesis]],&lt;ref name="Tickell"/&gt; and subsequently further developed the theory with American evolutionary theorist [[Lynn Margulis]] during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Gribbon| first1=John and Mary| title=James Lovelock: In Search of Gaia| date=2009| publisher=Princeton University Press| location=Princeton, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the field of [[systems science]] was developing across numerous other scientific fields, driven in part by the increasing availability and [[Computer performance|power]] of [[computer]]s, and leading to the development of [[climate model]]s that began to allow the detailed and interacting [[numerical weather prediction|simulation]]s of the Earth's [[weather]] and [[climate]].&lt;ref name=edwards2010&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edwards |first=P.N. |date=2010 |title=History of climate modelling |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.95/abstract |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |volume=2 |issue= |pages=128–139 |doi=10.1002/wcc.95 |access-date=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent extension of these models has led to the development of "Earth system models" (ESMs) that include facets such as the cryosphere and the biosphere.&lt;ref name=washington2009&gt;{{cite journal |last=Washington |first=W.M. |last2=Buja |first2=L. |last3=Craig |first3=A. |date=2009 |title=The computational future for climate and Earth system models: on the path to petaflop and beyond |url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/367/1890/833 |journal=Phil.

As an integrative field, Earth system science assumes the histories of a vast range of scientific disciplines, but as a discrete study it evolved in the 1980s, particularly at [[NASA]], where a committee called the Earth System Science Committee was formed in 1983. The earliest reports of NASA's ESSC, [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112104410706;view=1up;seq=3 ''Earth System Science: Overview''] (1986), and the book-length [https://books.google.com/books?id=Vj4rAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA173&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Earth System Science: A Closer View''] (1988), constitute a major landmark in the formal development of Earth system science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Mooney| first1=Harold| title=Evolution of natural and social science interactions in global change research programs| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| date=February 26, 2013| volume= 110| issue = Supplement 1, 3665-3672| pages=3665–3672| doi=10.1073/pnas.1107484110| url=http://www.pnas.org/content/110/Supplement_1/3665.full| accessdate=7 September 2015| display-authors=etal| pmid=23297237| pmc=3586612| bibcode=2013PNAS..110.3665M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early works discussing Earth system science, like these NASA reports, generally emphasized the increasing human impacts on the Earth system as a primary driver for the need of greater integration among the life and geo-sciences, making the origins of Earth system science parallel to the beginnings of [[global change]] studies and programs.

== Climate science ==
[[File:Ocean &amp; Earth System.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The dynamic interaction of the Earth's [[ocean]]s, [[climate|climatological]], [[Geochemical cycle|geochemical systems]].]]
Climatology and climate change have been central to Earth system science since its inception, as evidenced by the prominent place given to climate change in the early NASA reports discussed above. The Earth's climate system is a prime example of an emergent property of the whole planetary system which cannot be fully understood without regarding it as a single integrated entity. It is also a property of the system where human impacts have been growing rapidly in recent decades, lending immense importance to the successful development and advancement of Earth system science research. As just one example of the centrality of climatology to the field, leading American climatologist [[Michael E. Mann]] is the Director of one of the earliest centers for Earth system science research, the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, and its mission statement reads, "the Earth System Science Center (ESSC) maintains a mission to describe, model, and understand the Earth's climate system".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mann|first1=Michael|title=Earth System Science Center|url=http://www.essc.psu.edu/|publisher=Penn State University|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Gaia hypothesis==
{{Main|Gaia hypothesis}}
The Gaia hypothesis posits that living systems interact with physical components of the Earth system to form a [[homeostasis|self-regulating]] whole that maintains conditions that are favourable for life. Developed initially by James Lovelock, the hypothesis attempts to account for key features of the Earth system, including the long period (several billion years) of relatively favourable climatic conditions against a backdrop of [[Sun#Main sequence|steadily increasing]] [[Solar irradiance|solar radiation]]. Consequently, the Gaia hypothesis has important implications for Earth system science, as noted by NASA's Director for Planetary Science, James Green, in October 2010: "Dr. Lovelock and Dr. Margulis played a key role in the origins of what we now know as Earth system science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NASA|first1=50th Anniversary Symposium: Seeking Signs of Life|title=Opening Keynote - 'Exobiology in the Beginning'|url=http://original.livestream.com/astrobiology50th/video?clipId=pla_89adff36-bad9-43a2-b416-29a41cb9fab1|website=livestream.com|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Gaia hypothesis and Earth system science take an interdisciplinary approach to studying systems operations on a planetary-scale,&lt;ref name="Schneider 1992"/&gt; they are not synonymous with one another. A number of potential Gaian feedback mechanisms have been proposed—such as the [[CLAW hypothesis]]&lt;ref name="CLAW87"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/326655a0 |author=[[Robert Jay Charlson|Charlson, R.

== Education ==
Earth system science can be studied at a postgraduate level at some universities, with notable programs at such institutions as the [https://www.ess.uci.edu/ University of California, Irvine], [http://www.essc.psu.edu/ University of Pennsylvania], and [https://earth.stanford.edu/ess Stanford University]. In general education, the [[American Geophysical Union]], in cooperation with the [[Keck Geology Consortium]] and with support from five divisions within the [[National Science Foundation]], convened a workshop in 1996, "to define common educational goals among all disciplines in the Earth sciences". In its report, participants noted that, "The fields that make up the Earth and space sciences are currently undergoing a major advancement that promotes understanding the Earth as a number of interrelated systems". Recognizing the rise of this [[systems approach]], the workshop report recommended that an Earth system science curriculum be developed with support from the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |title=Shaping the Future of Undergraduate Earth Science Education |publisher=American Geophysical Union |accessdate=2009-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916214004/http://www.agu.org/sci_soc/spheres/intro.htm |archivedate=16 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Earth System Science Education Alliance was begun, and currently includes the participation of 40+ institutions, with over 3,000 teachers having completed an ESSEA course as of fall 2009".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Earth System Science Education Alliance|url=http://essea.strategies.org/background.html|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''English-language radio''' refers to radio stations that broadcast primarily in the English language and are located in countries where English is not an official language or majority language. Often referred to as "English-speaking radio" or "Expat radio" the broadcasts enables expats, vacationers and travelers to listen to radio in their native language while traveling abroad. The idea is that stations broadcast in English to popular holiday destinations such as [[Pattaya]] or the [[French Riviera]] or places with high [[Expatriate|expat]] communities. English language broadcasting also takes the form of military-backed radio such as the [[American Forces Network]]. However English-language radio based in foreign countries has to now compete with the introduction of [[internet radio]] and satellite technology that has increased listener's access to English-language radio based in "home" counties.

==History==

The first English-language radio in a foreign country transmission was thought to be in 1925 when Radio Paris broadcast from the [[Eiffel Tower]], a show about fashion design, sponsored by [[Selfridges]] of London.

With end of [[World War II]] [[American military|American]] and [[British military|British]] forces began occupation of bases within regions of conquered [[Axis powers|Axis]] countries such as [[Germany]] and [[Okinawa]] for the enjoyment and informative power radio bring to both the troops and their families. Today traditions remain as the [[American Forces Network]] and the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]] continue to provide English-language entertainment and information to troops stationed abroad in their respective countries or areas.

Non-military English broadcasting gained momentum with the increase in [[globalization]] after World War II. As English-speaking business personnel and [[Expatriate|expat]] communities grew because of international trade and investment, so did the demand for English language entertainment. As the number of global English speakers has grown, demand from the local native market has grown as well. Stations that actively reach out to the local community such as [[International Community Radio Taipei]] have been on the rise.

==Location==

The location of most English-language radio stations can be determined by their proximity to large populations of English speakers. [[Geneva, Switzerland]], for example, has many English speakers and [[expatriate]]s, also the Spanish coastal areas, and thus English radio broadcasts. Radio stations in places such as [[Baja California]] and [[Costa Rica]] also serve the increasing number of English speakers.

'''Environmental globalization'''  refers to the internationally coordinated practices and regulations (often in the form of [[international treaties]]) regarding [[environmental protection]].&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt; An example of environmental globalization would be the series of International Tropical Timber Agreement treaties ([[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1983|1983]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 1994|1994]], [[International Tropical Timber Agreement, 2006|2006]]), establishing [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] and promoting [[sustainable management]] of [[tropical forests]]. Environmental globalization is usually supported by [[non-governmental organization]]s and governments of [[developed countries]], but opposed by governments of [[developing countries]] which see pro-environmental initiatives as hindering their economic development.

Environmental globalization is related to [[economic globalization]], as economic development on a global scale has environmental impacts on such scale, which is of concern to numerous organizations and individuals.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BenyonDunkerley2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Benyon|author2=David Dunkerley|title=Globalization: The Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doB9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=1 May 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-78240-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; While economic globalization has environmental impacts, those impacts should not be confused with the concept of environmental globalization.&lt;ref name=Grainger&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/abstract|title=Environmental Globalization|last=Grainger|first=Alan|date=1 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|isbn=9780470670590|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470670590.wbeog170/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some regards, environmental globalization is in direct opposition to economic globalization, particularly when the latter is described as encouraging trade, and the former, as promoting pro-environment initiatives that are an impediment to trade.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-240"/&gt; For that reason, an environmental activist might be opposed to economic globalization, but advocate environmental globalization.&lt;ref name="DobratzWaldner2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Betty Dobratz|author2=Lisa K Waldner|author3=Timothy Buzzell|title=Power, Politics, and Society: An Introduction to Political Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoK9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA346|date=14 October 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-34529-9|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Grainger has discussed that environmental globalization in the context of international agreements on pro-environmental initiatives. According to him, precursors to modern environmental globalization can be found in the [[colonial era]] [[forestry|scientific forestry]] (research into how to create and restore forests).&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-57"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K. Gills|title=The Globalization of Environmental Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EULjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96896-2|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern initiatives contributing to environmental globalization include the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]],&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-58"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K. Gills|title=The Globalization of Environmental Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EULjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96896-2|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; came from the [[World Bank]] 1980s requirements that development projects need to protect indigenous peoples and conserve biodiversity.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-59"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

Stearns|title=Globalization in World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVOOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|date=20 October 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-25993-8|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Steven Yearley states that it was around that time that the [[environmental movement]] started to organize on the international scale focus on the global dimension of the issues (the first [[Earth Day]] was celebrated on 1970).&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-240"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA240|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporters and opponents==
According to Grainger, environmental globalization (in the form of pro-environmental international initiatives) is usually supported by various [[non-governmental organization]]s&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-60"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K. Gills|title=The Globalization of Environmental Crisis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EULjAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60|date=31 October 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-96896-2|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and governments of [[developed countries]], and opposed by governments of [[developing countries]] ([[Group of 77]]), which see pro-environmental initiatives as hindering their economic development.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-59"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-62"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan Grainger|chapter=Environmental Globalization and Tropical Forests|editor1=Jan Oosthoek|editor2=Barry K.

[[World Trade Organization]] has also been criticized as focused on economic globalization (liberalizing trade) over concerns of environmental protection, which are seen as impeding the trade.&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-61"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OosthoekGills2013-62"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-247"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA247|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-248"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA248|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Yearley states that WTO should not be described as "anti-environmental", but its decisions have major impact on environment worldwide, and they are based primarily on economic concerns, with environmental concerns being given secondary weight.&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-250"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steve Yearly|chapter=Globalization and the Environment|editor=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKnmvRATtfAC&amp;pg=PA250|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''FIH World Ranking''' is a ranking system for men's and women's national teams in [[field hockey]]. The teams of the member nations of [[International Hockey Federation]] (FIH), field hockey's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results. The rankings were introduced in October 2003.&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;{{cite news|title=FIH to introduce world rankings|url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/09/03/stories/2003090300141900.htm|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=2 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses of the rankings ==
The rankings were introduced to overcome the criticism of fixing when drawing the pools for each tournament. It also determines the quotas for tournaments such as the [[Field hockey at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and also the [[Hockey World Cup|World Cup]].&lt;ref name=system&gt;{{cite web|title=FIH World Ranking System|url=http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/World%20Ranking/World%20Ranking%20Explanatory%20note.pdf|work=International Hockey Federation|publisher=FIH.ch|accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calculation method ==
=== Overview ===
All of the FIH-recognised, including qualifying and continental tournaments for last four years are included in ranking points calculation. However, the past results will be deducted by the percentage set by the FIH as shown by the tabulated below.

{| class=wikitable

|-
|Year 3

|-
|Year 2

|-
!colspan=2|Total points
|}

=== Continental championships ===
FIH had set the total allocated points for continental tournament. However, a different percentage was set to differ the standard of regional field hockey. Currently, only Europe had full 100% points allocation for all classification while the others had only several finishers with full points allocation. Africa is the sole continent with neither men's or women's tournament had full points allocation.

'''Feed My Starving Children''' is a Christian [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] that coordinates the packaging and distribution of food to people in [[Developing country|developing nations]]. Founded in 1987, it has reached out to more than 70 countries.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fmsc.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding===
Richard Proudfit, a Minneapolis business man and philanthropist, founded the organization after visiting Honduras after a hurricane. Proudfit witnessed dying starving children all around him and was moved to start Feed My Starving Children in 1987. Proudfit risked his life in war zones around the world to feed starving children. Proudfit passed away November 13th, 2018. Together with his second foundation Kids against hunger the two organizations feed over 1 billion children annually. Proudfit received the [[Jefferson Award for Public Service]] in 2012joining the ranks of Bill Gates and Paul Newman.&lt;ref&gt;http://m.startribune.com/feed-my-starving-children-founder-dies-at-88/500424401/&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization recruits volunteers including school children to assist in packing. They also employ paid staff to supervise the operations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fmsc.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GMA News TV''' (GNTV) (visually rendered in its logo in all [[capital letter]]s) is a [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial broadcast]] [[television network]] in the [[Philippines]]. It is owned and operated by [[DWDB-TV|Citynet Network Marketing and Productions Inc.]], a wholly owned subsidiary of [[GMA Network, Inc.]], together with [[ZOE Broadcasting Network|ZOE Broadcasting Network Inc.]] (ZOE TV) of [[Jesus Is Lord Church]] leader [[Eddie Villanueva]] as its main content provider. Launched on February 28, 2011, GNTV is the second television network joint-ventured between ZOE and GMA after its predecessor [[Q (TV network)|QTV]], which in turn was launched in 2005. Its flagship station is [[DZOE-TV|DZOE-TV Channel 11]], a frequency currently owned by ZOE Broadcasting, and it is beamed through provincial relay stations run by GMA Network. Its studios are located at the 22/F Strata 2000 Building, F. Ortigas Jr. Road (formerly Emerald Avenue), [[Ortigas Center]], [[Pasig City]] and [[GMA Network Center]], [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]] corner Timog Avenue, [[Diliman]], [[Quezon City]]; with its transmitter facilities (also owned by ZOE-TV) located at [[Tower of Power (transmitter)|GMA Tower of Power]], Tandang Sora, Barangay Culiat, Quezon City.

==History==
GMA News TV was created as a replacement for "[[Q (TV network)|Q]]", a network which primarily featured imported dramas and lifestyle-oriented programming aimed towards women. Both GMA News TV and Q are products of an agreement between ZOE-TV and GMA's subsidiary Citynet in 2005, allowing the latter to lease the entire airtime of ZOE-TV Channel 11, in exchange of upgrading the former's facilities and a offpeak timeslot for its programs on Channel 11 and its affiliate [[GMA Network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2005/04/28/275585/gma-network-partners-zoe-broadcasting-channel-11|title=GMA Network partners with Zoe Broadcasting Channel 11|publisher=[[The Philippine Star]]|date=April 28, 2005|accessdate=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; GMA News TV was unveiled on February 7, 2011, and Q was discontinued on February 20, 2011 in preparation for the launch of the new service, which occurred on February 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pep.ph/guide/tv/7578/gma-network-launches-gma-news-tv-on-channel-11 PEP Entertainment Guide/Television&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gmanews.tv/story/212269/gma-network-launches-gma-news-tv GMA News Online, Business Top Stories&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/214089/gma-news-tv-goes-on-air GMA News TV goes on air] retrieved via www.gmanews.tv 02-28-2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3YoYOiPz84 GMA News TV Station ID 2011] retrieved via www.youtube.com via gmatv user 09-10-2012&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its agreement to operate [[DZOE-TV]] as a carrier of GMA News TV (dating back to the establishment of Q), it also airs religious programming produced by [[ZOE Broadcasting Network|ZOE]] during off-peak hours.

==International==
Later in 2011, GMA would also launch a 24-hour international feed of GMA News TV, as a compliment to its two other international channels ([[GMA Pinoy TV]] and [[GMA Life TV]]). It began to be offered as a preview channel in Australia on FetchTV, IPS/AccessTV in Japan, GUdTV in Guam and on [[OSN]], with an official launch planned for the third quarter of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/226308/business/gma-network-launches-third-international-channel|title=GMA Network launches third international channel|work=GMA News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmapinoytv.com.ph/ver1/article.php?aid=328|title=gmapinoytv.com.ph|work=gmapinoytv.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmapinoytv.com.ph/ver1/article.php?aid=612|title=gmapinoytv.com.ph|work=gmapinoytv.com.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/220742/business/earnings-gma-network-posts-18-growth-in-q1-revenues|title=EARNINGS: GMA Network posts 18% growth in Q1 revenues|work=GMA News Online|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822165431/http://www.gmanews.tv/story/220742/business/earnings-gma-network-posts-18-growth-in-q1-revenues|archivedate=2011-08-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Handwashing Day''' ('''GHD''') is a campaign to motivate and mobilize people around the [[world]] to improve their [[Hand washing|handwashing]] habits.  Washing hands at critical points during the day and washing with [[soap]] are both important. 

Global Handwashing Day occurs on 15 October of each year. The global campaign is dedicated to raising awareness of handwashing with soap as a key factor in [[Preventive healthcare|disease prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=20091015004104007&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Lae Marks Global Handwashing Day|last = Rai|first = Frank|date = 12 August 2009|work = Post-Courier (Papua New Guinea)|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Respiratory and intestinal diseases can be reduced by 25-50%.

==Implementation and management==
The Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) (formerly called "[[Public-private partnership|Public Private Partnership]]&amp;nbsp;for Handwashing" (PPPHW)) established Global Handwashing Day in 2008 as a way to promote a global and local vision of handwashing with soap.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=12 October 2012|title=Global Handwashing Day|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=82513752&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=61|issue=40|page=821|doi=|pmid=|access-date=24 July 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steering Committee members of the GHP include Colgate-Palmolive; FHI 360; The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Procter &amp; Gamble; UNICEF; Unilever; University at Buffalo; USAID; the Water and Sanitation Programme at the World Bank; and the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=The Global Handwashing Partnership|website=globalhandwashing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued research on handwashing habits and practices is commissioned in conjunction with GHD. In 2011, [[Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget]] (SCA), sponsored a study to assess the handwashing habits of American and Canadian adults, finding that many were not using soap when washing their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=bizwire.c37268574&amp;site=ehost-live|title = New Research Reveals Poor Handwashing Practices|last = |first = |date = 14 October 2011|work = Business Wire|access-date = 10 August 2015|via = Regional Business News – EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aims===
The aims of Global Handwashing Day are to:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Foster and support a general culture of handwashing with soap in all societies
* Shine a spotlight on the state of handwashing in each country
* Raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing with soap.

==Activities==
Each year, over 200 million people celebrate Global Handwashing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://concern-universal.org/get-involved/campaigns-appeals/global-handwashing-day/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208100034/http://concern-universal.org/get-involved/campaigns-appeals/global-handwashing-day |archivedate=8 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Sometimes, groups choose to celebrate GHD on other dates than 15 October. In [[Ethiopia]], 300 people celebrated Global Handwashing Day in [[Addis Ababa]] on 1 November in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://unicefethiopia.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/ethiopia-celebrates-global-handwashing-day/|title = Ethiopia Celebrates Global Handwashing Day|last = Bizuwork|first = Demissew|date = 4 November 2013|work = UNICEF Ethiopia|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 15 October 2015, Lupok Central Elementary School, Guiuan Eastern Samar, Philippines celebrated the Global Handwashing Day by doing the proper handwashing before starting classes.

==History==
Global Handwashing Day was initiated by the Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) in August 2008 at the annual [[World Water Week]] in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/our-history/|title = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing – Our History|date = |accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the first Global Handwashing Day took place on 15 October 2008. The date was appointed by the UN General Assembly.

===Themes===
*The focus for Global Handwashing Day's inaugural year in 2008 was school children. In that year, the members pledged to get the maximum number of school children handwashing with soap in more than 70 countries. In [[India]] in 2008, [[cricket]] legend [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and his teammates joined an estimated 100 million schoolchildren around the country in lathering up for better health and hygiene as part of the first Global Handwashing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/india_45974.html|title = Star Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar Promotes Handwashing in India|last = Walker|first = Angela|date = 16 October 2008|work = UNICEF|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was initiated to reduce childhood mortality rates and related [[respiratory]] and [[Diarrhea|diarrheal diseases]] by introducing simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[handwashing]] with [[soap]]. This simple action can reduce the [[mortality rate]] of respiratory disease by 25%. Death from diarrheal diseases can be reduced by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Val|last2=Cairncross|first2=Sandy|date=May 2003|title=Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=3|issue=5|pages=275–281|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6|pmid=12726975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the world, more than 60 percent of health workers do not adhere to proper hand hygiene. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US health care providers, on average, wash their hands less than half of the time they should. On any given day, one in 25 US hospital patients has at least one health care-associated infection.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings |url=https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of handwashing ===
{{Main article|Handwashing}}
{{tone|section|date=April 2018}}
Handwashing with soap is very effective and the least expensive way to prevent [[diarrhea]] and [[acute respiratory infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=6FI3204107250&amp;site=ehost-live|title=MOH Celebrates Global Handwashing Day|last=|first=|date=15 October 2009|work=Arabia 2000|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pneumonia]], a major ARI (acute respiratory infection), is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, killing an estimated 1.8&amp;nbsp;million children per year. [[Diarrhea]] and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5&amp;nbsp;million child deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/The_State_of_the_Worlds_Children_2008.pdf|title=The State of the World’s Children 2008. Child Survival. UNICEF|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handwashing with soap is estimated to reduce cases of diarrhea by 30% and respiratory infections by 21% in children under the age of five.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is important to make handwashing into a [[habit]]. Good handwashing with soap before [[eating]] and after using the toilet into a regular habit can save more lives than any single [[vaccine]] or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute [[respiratory infection]]s by one-quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2013/today-is-global-handwashing-day/|title=Today is Global Handwashing Day|last=Larsen|first=Linda|date=15 October 2013|work=Food Poisoning Bulletin|access-date=24 July 2015|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handwashing is usually done together with other [[sanitation]] interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene [[WASH]] programmes.

The Global Handwashing Day helps raise awareness of the importance of washing with soap, but it also makes it fun for children to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=wapo.ea30fbe0-e86a-11e0-8a05-c10ec107dc66&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Getting All Lathered Up|last=Sawyer|first=Kem Knapp|date=10 October 2011|work=The Washington Post|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Regional Business News – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper hygiene requires that individuals know the importance of good hygiene and develop the habits to carry it out.  There are people with plenty of money but nonetheless, they lack the important habits of timely handwashing with soap, and thereby unknowingly endanger themselves and others around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/global-handwashing-day-in_b_5989280.html|title=Global Handwashing Day in the Time of Ebola|author=Jeffrey Sachs|author2=Myriam Sidibe|date=15 October 2014|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peer pressure|Peer influence]] is significant to seeing increased handwashing among students. In a study conducted in [[Kenya]], researchers found that students were much more likely to wash their hands when another student is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickering|first=Amy J.|last2=Blum|first2=Annalise G.|last3=Breiman|first3=Robert F.|last4=Ram|first4=Pavani K.|last5=Davis|first5=Jennifer|date=27 March 2014|title=Video Surveillance Captures Student Hand Hygiene Behavior, Reactivity to Observation, and Peer Influence in Kenyan Primary Schools|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92571|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|pmc=3968003|pmid=24676389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer influence is only successful, however, when students know that handwashing is a desirable action.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) celebrates a  World Hand Hygiene Day on 5 May. In 2018 the theme was prevention of [[sepsis]] in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/infection-prevention/campaigns/clean-hands/5may2018/en/|title=Infection prevention and control|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the year before was to combat [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]] (AMR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/infection-prevention/campaigns/clean-hands/2017/en/|title=Infection prevention and control|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global HealthShare® initiative (GHS) is a program launched in June 2010 by the [[University of California, Davis]] Center of Excellence for [[Nutritional genomics|Nutritional Genomics]]. The program plans to share resources to improve the health in [[developing countries]]. Alliances with other research institutions, humanitarian organizations and private companies around the world have been made to meet this goal.

The organization will use a multidisciplinary approach against [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] and [[Infectious disease|infectious]] disease, breaking down their efforts into two main research "cores": the Nutrition Core and Mucosal Immunity Core. The former focuses on fighting [[malnutrition]] and the latter on developing new ways to deliver [[vaccines]] more effectively to developing countries. The program differentiates itself from others like it by focusing on the delivery of the beneficial product to the end-user rather than the academic research process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7518">The '''Global Polio Eradication Initiative''' is an initiative created in 1988, just after the [[World Health Assembly]] resolved to [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eradicate the disease poliomyelitis]] by the year 2000. It was described by the [[World Health Organization]] as the largest public health initiative in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hale/Held|first1=Thomas/David|title=The Handbook of Transnational Governance: Institutions and Innovations|publisher=Polity press|isbn=978-0-7456-5060-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
The strategy for the eradication of polio rests on immunizing every at risk child until there is no one left for the disease to transmit to and the disease eventually dies out. The Initiative is spearheaded by the following Organizations:

*WHO ([[World Health Organization]]) who are responsible for planning, technical direction, surveillance and eradication certification. 
*[[Rotary International]] whose responsibilities include fundraising, advocacy, and volunteer recruitment.
* The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] who are in charge of deploying scientists and public health experts to WHO and [[UNICEF]].
* [[UNICEF]] is in charge of the distribution of the vaccine and helping countries develop communication and awareness strategies.
* [[The Gates Foundation]] as well provided a large portion of the funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unicef's Engagement in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative|url=http://www.unicef.org/partners/files/Partnership_profile_2012_Polio_revised.pdf|website=Unicef.org|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key tactics used by the GPEI include strengthening childhood immunization through oral vaccines, conducting surveillance 
through investigation of [[acute flaccid paralysis]] cases among children under 15 years old (in order to determine areas where the virus is truly eradicated), and conducting "mop up" campaigns in areas where cases of polio have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wassilak/Orenstein|first1=Steven/Walter|title=Challenges faced by the global polio eradication initiative|journal=Expert Review of Vaccines|date=2010|doi=10.1586/erv.10.45|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1586/erv.10.45|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
By 2012 the GPEI had raised 9 billion dollars in funding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study on the Impact of Polio Eradication on Strengthening (Routine Immunization and Primary Health Care|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/polio_eradication_impacts_study/files/2012/12/Fact-Sheet-Polio-Eradication-Impacts-Study.pdf|publisher=Middlebury College|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in alone 2011 the GPEI received a 1.1 billion dollars, for a budget of 0.98 billion dollars. 30% of their funding came from the [[Gates Foundation]] 30% from developed governments, 27% from countries at risk of polio, and the rest was made up of donations from non profits, private funders, and other foundations. It is likely that the GPEI will become almost entirely funded by private organizations in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaccination funding landscape|url=http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/vaccination-organizations#Eradicationinitiatives|website=Givewell.org|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
In 1995 a Global Certification Commission was created to oversee the certification of the eradication of wild-type poliovirus transmissions. Certification for the six WHO regions requires all of the countries in that region to be certified by the commission. By the year 2000 both the regions of the Western Pacific and the Americas met the criteria to be certified free of polio transmissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Technical Consultative Group to the World Health Organization on the Global Eradication of Poliomyelitis|title="Endgame" Issues for the Global Polio Eradication Initiative|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=2002|volume=34|pages=72–77|doi=10.1086/338262|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/72.abstract|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 the initial number of estimated cases in 1988 of 350,000 across 125 endemic countries has dropped to 650 confirmed cases. In addition the 3 of the six WHO regions are now certified polio eradicated (Europe, the Americas, The West Pacific). [[India]], which many thought would face the greatest challenge to eradication was removed from the list of endemic countries. According to the most recent study by the GPEI, in 2016, there are only three countries still listed as endemic, [[Nigeria]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Monitoring|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx|website=Global Polio Eradication Initiative|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is owing to this dramatic reduction that the funding for the GPEI will likely soon come entirely from private donors and foundations such as the [[Gates Foundation]] instead of from individual countries. In fact [[Bill Gates]] has listed polio eradication as one of his "Top Personal Priorities".

A 2011 study by [[Middlebury College]] (commissioned by the [[Gates Foundation]]) indicated a list recommendations for how the GPEI should operate moving forward:

*  Include surveillance for other diseases in AFP (polio) surveillance systems
* Use integrated campaigns to reach marginalized populations
* Standardize and compile polio’s maps of marginalized populations to provide them with additional services
* Fund routine immunization in locations with frequent polio campaigns
* Build staff capacity in a variety of areas beyond polio
* Share pertinent information gathered during polio campaigns with other health programs
* Add questions on key health indicators of interest to post campaign monitoring
* Communicate to workers why repeated campaigns are necessary in high intensity areas
* Raise monetary incentives for campaign workers to a living wage or eliminate them entirely
* Conduct cross planning sessions to determine how programs and services can be integrated to reduce workforce burden without compromising programmatic objectives
* Conduct polio campaigns only where and when they are necessary
*  Mitigate the most serious effects of service interruption with strategic planning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study on the Impact of Polio Eradication on Strengthening (Routine Immunization and Primary Health Care|url=http://sites.middlebury.edu/polio_eradication_impacts_study/files/2012/12/Fact-Sheet-Polio-Eradication-Impacts-Study.pdf|publisher=Middlebury College|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endgame==
The final steps of polio eradication for the GPEI, or what is known as the "endgame" are as follows:
#  Detect and interrupt all poliovirus transmissions
# Strengthen immunization systems and withdraw oral polio vaccine
#  Contain poliovirus and certify interruption of transmission
# Ensure the remaining investments made to eradicate polio go to the greater cause of improving global health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013–2018|url=http://www.polioeradication.org/resourcelibrary/strategyandwork.aspx|website=Polio Eradication Initiative|accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28518">'''Global citizenship education''' ('''GCE''') is a form of [[civics|civic learning]] that involves students' active participation in projects that address [[global issue|global]] [[global issue|issue]]s of a social, political, economic, or environmental nature. The two main elements of GCE are '[[global consciousness]]';  the moral or ethical aspect of global issues, and 'global competencies', or skills meant to enable learners to participate in changing and developing the world. The promotion of GCE was a response by governments and NGOs to the emergence of [[supranational institution]], [[trade bloc|regional economic blocs]], and the development of [[information and communications technology|information and]] [[information and communications technology|communications technologies]]. These have allresulted in the emergence of a more globally oriented and collaborative approach to education. GCE addresses themes such as peace and human rights, intercultural understanding, citizenship education, respect for diversity and tolerance, and inclusiveness.Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for students

== Definition and origins ==
[[Global citizenship]] consists of voluntary practices oriented to human rights, social justice, and environmentalism at the local, regional, and global level. Unlike national citizenship, global citizenship does not denote any legal status  or allegiance to an actual form of government.  The emergence of regional economic blocs, supra-national political institutions such as the [[European Union|European]] [[European Union|Union]], and the advancement of ICTs, has caused governments to try to prepare national populations to be competitive in the global jobs market. This has led to the introduction of global citizenship education  programs at primary, secondary, and tertiary level, but also at independent [[NGO]]s, [[grass roots]] organizations, and other large scale educational organizations, such as the [[International Baccalaureate Organization]] and [[UNESCO]].

The most important features of global citizenship education are voluntary action that can extend from local to international collectives; the practice of cultural empathy; and a focus on active participation in social and political life at the local and global level. In the late 1990s, [[OXFAM]] UK designed a curriculum for global citizenship education
which stressed "the 'active' role of global citizens".In this approach, individuals and groups both inside and outside the educational sector might take action that addresses human rights, trade, poverty, health, and environmental issues, for example. This is sometimes called the 'global consciousness' aspect of GCE. However, organizations such as UNESCO have also begun to emphasize 'global competencies', including science and technology into their GCE [[curricula]], to "strengthen linkages between education and economic development".

== Emergence and development ==
In the present era of [[globalization]], the recognition of global interdependence on the part of the general public has led to a higher degree of interest in global citizenship in education. No Though modern schooling may have been oriented to education suitable for the nation-state throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, in the 21st century, citizenship is understood in global terms, so that schooling might improve individual nations' global competitiveness. Many universities worldwide have responded to the need for a globally oriented education by sending their students to study abroad in increasing numbers, and some have announced that this will soon become a mandatory degree requirement.

Many governments also now promote GCE for the cohesion of society. The large numbers of people migrating across national borders means that the  diversity of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups, "has raised [...] complex and difficult questions about citizenship, human rights, democracy, and education".   In addition, global issues related to [[sustainability]], such as the world's future energy arrangements, have also been incorporated into the domain of global citizenship education.

== Competences ==
While GCE can take different forms, it has some common elements, which include fostering in learners the following competences:&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. ''Global Citizenship Education. Preparing Learners for the Challenges of the 21st Century''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An attitude supported by an understanding of multiple levels of identity, and the potential for a collective identity that transcends individual cultural, religious, ethnic or other differences (such as a sense of belongingness to common humanity, and respect for diversity);
* A deep knowledge of global issues and universal values such as justice, equality, dignity and respect (such as understanding of the process of globalization, interdependence/ interconnectedness, the global challenges which cannot be adequately or uniquely addressed by nation states, sustainability as the main concept of the future);
* Cognitive skills to think critically, systemically and creatively, including adopting a multi-perspective approach that recognizes different dimensions, perspectives and angles of issues (such as reasoning and problem-solving skills supported by a multi-perspective approach);
* Non-cognitive skills, including social skills such as empathy and con ict resolution, and communication skills and aptitudes for networking and interacting with people of different backgrounds, origins, cultures and perspectives (such as global empathy, sense of solidarity); and
* Behavioural capacities to act collaboratively and responsibly to find global solutions to global challenges, and to strive for the collective good.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Pedagogy ==

Most educators agree that "global citizenship is a learned and nurtured behavior",&lt;ref&gt;Tarrant, 2010:442&lt;/ref&gt; and the most widely used classroom strategy for developing global skills is project-based learning. This pedagogical technique can be utilized in the case of almost any school subject, "[and] is the primary pedagogical strategy in the discourse of global competencies. Educators see it as an important method for developing the tools- technical and emotional- for success in the global society".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:14&lt;/ref&gt; With the aim of nurturing students' potential to be both learners and citizens, the project-based approach has been used successfully in community-based learning, for example.&lt;ref&gt;Melaville &amp; Berg et al, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important pedagogical feature of GCE is learning through communicative practices outside the classroom that "harness […] the educational force of the wider culture".&lt;ref name="Catalano, 2013:3"&gt;Catalano, 2013:3&lt;/ref&gt; If students are encouraged "to see themselves as political agents",&lt;ref name="Catalano, 2013:3"/&gt; educators assume they are more likely to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities that enable them to  become agents of change.&lt;ref&gt;Catalano, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Another important element of the student-centered participatory nature of GCED, is that students, through their engagement with others via [[Social network services|Social Network Services]], create their own forms of global citizenship through dialogue, learning, and action.&lt;ref&gt;Bourn, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This is  an important element, for example, in the activities of grassroots organizations like 'GIN' ([[Global Issues Network]]), which involves students and teachers in projects that address global issues such as human rights, trade rules, and deforestation.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"&gt;Dill, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Such student-driven, student-led projects combine both the 'global consciousness' and 'global competence' aspects of GCED.

;'Global consciousness' and 'global competence'

Organizations implementing GCE programs, such as UNESCO, now emphasize the importance of expanding both students' 'global consciousness' and 'global competence'.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"/&gt; 'Global consciousness' represents the ethical or moral dimension of global citizenship, whereas 'global competence' "features a blend of the technical-rational and the dispositional or attitudinal".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:11&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some view global consciousness and global competence as being closely related.&lt;ref&gt;Grudinski Hall, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The OECD, for instance, focuses on global competencies called 'psychosocial resources', of which there are three main types: "using tools interactively (technology and language skills), interacting in heterogeneous groups (cooperation, empathy), and acting autonomously (realizing one's identity, conducting life plans, defending and asserting rights".&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013: 12&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key learner attributes ==
GCE identifies three learner attributes, which refer to the traits and qualities that global citizenship education aims to develop in learners and correspond to the key learning outcomes mentioned earlier. These are: informed and critically literate; socially connected and respectful of diversity; ethically responsible and engaged. The three learner attributes draw on a review of the literature and of citizenship education conceptual frameworks, a review of approaches and curricula, as well as technical consultations and recent work by UNESCO on global citizenship education.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf|title=Global Citizenship Education: topics and learning objectives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100102-4|location=|pages=20–21, 44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Informed and critically literate ===
Learners develop their understanding of the world, global themes, governance structures and systems, including politics, history and economics; understand the rights and responsibilities of individuals and groups (for example, women’s and children’s rights, indigenous rights, corporate social responsibility); and, recognise the interconnectedness of local, national and global issues, structures and processes. Learners develop the skills of critical inquiry (for example, where to find information and how to analyse and use evidence), [[media literacy]] and an understanding of how information is mediated and communicated. They develop their ability to inquire into global themes and issues (for example, globalisation, interdependence, migration, peace and conflict, sustainable development) by planning investigations, analysing data and communicating their findings. A key issue is the way in which language is used and, more specifically, how critical literacy is affected by the dominance of the English language and how this influences non-English speakers’ access to information.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Socially connected and respectful of diversity ===
Learners learn about their identities and how they are situated within multiple relationships (for example, family, friends, school, local community, country), as a basis for understanding the global dimension of citizenship. They develop an understanding of difference and diversity (for example, culture, language, gender, sexuality, religion), of how beliefs and values influence people’s views about those who are different, and of the reasons for, and impact of, inequality and discrimination. Learners also consider common factors that transcend difference, and develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes required for respecting difference and living with others.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Ethically responsible and engaged ===
Learners explore their own beliefs and values and those of others. They understand how beliefs and values inform social and political decision-making at local, national, regional and global levels, and the challenges for governance of contrasting and conflicting beliefs and values. Learners also develop their understanding of social justice issues in local, national, regional and global contexts and how these are interconnected. Ethical issues (for example, relating to [[climate change]], [[consumerism]], [[Economic globalization|economic globalisation]], [[fair trade]], migration, poverty and wealth, sustainable development, [[terrorism]], war) are also addressed. Learners are expected to reflect on ethical conflicts related to social and political responsibilities and the wider impact of their choices and decisions. Learners also develop the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to care for others and the environment and to engage in civic action. These include compassion, empathy, collaboration, dialogue, social entrepreneurship and active participation. They learn about opportunities for engagement as citizens at local, national and global levels, and examples of individual and collective action taken by others to address global issues and social injustice.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== High Resolves, Australia ===
[https://highresolves.org/ High Resolves] is a secondary school educational initiative (implemented by the FYA, the only national, independent non-profit organisation for young people in Australia) consisting of a Global Citizenship Programme for Year 8 students and a Global Leadership Programme for Year 9 and 10 students. It aims to enable students to consider their personal role in developing their society as a global community through workshops, simulations, leadership skills training and hands-on action projects.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== ''Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum,'' England ===
In England, the Department for Education and Skills produced ''Developing the global dimension in the school curriculum'', a publication for head teachers, teachers, senior managers and those with responsibility for curriculum development. It aims to show how the global dimension can be integrated in the curriculum and across the school. It provides examples of how to integrate the global dimension from age 3 to age 16, outlining eight key concepts – global citizenship, conflict resolution, diversity, human rights, interdependence, sustainable development, values and perceptions, and social justice. For example, it gives guidance for the promotion of personal, social and emotional development of the youngest learners through discussion of photographs of children from around the world, activities, stories, and discussion of different places children have visited.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Activate, South Africa ===
'''Activate''' is a network of young leaders in South Africa which aims to bring about change though creative solutions to problems in society. Youth from all backgrounds and provinces in the country participate in a two-year programme. In the first year, there are three residential training programmes, working on a particular task. In the second year, participants form action groups on specific tasks, taking their work into the public domain. In one example, an Activator describes how he works in his local community to discourage young people away from joining gangs and engaging in substance abuse. He draws on his own negative experiences with gangs and drugs, having served seven years in jail. On being interviewed, he states: “My vision for South Africa is to see young people standing up and becoming role models... Be yourself, be real and pursue your dreams”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.activateleadership.co.za/blog/5-mins-with-fernando#sthash.dRCXMqPx.dpuf|title=Activate Change Drivers|last=|first=|date=|website=Activate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Council for Global Citizenship Education, India (and global) ===
[https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/council-for-gced Council for Global Citizenship Education] — part of the [https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/ Global Citizenship Foundation], a non-profit organisation based in India — is an initiative for schools to adopt a participatory whole-school approach to global citizenship education. The initiative fosters continuous professional development (CPD) of educators; teacher led contextualization, design, and development of GCED curriculum; engagement of children through the '[https://www.globalcitizenshipfoundation.org/hundred-acts 100 Acts of Global Citizenship]' School Challenge; and community through a Global Citizenship Festival at '100 Acts of Global Citizenship' participating schools. It has also been implemented in 10 States of India.

Peace First, a non-profit organisation based in the United States, has a programme in which youth volunteers work with children to design and implement community projects in a participatory way. The rationale is that children are natural creative thinkers and problem solvers. The programme focuses on developing social and emotional skills of self- awareness, empathy, inclusivity and relationships. It has also been implemented in rural areas of Colombia through a partnership between local governments and Colombian NGOs. Peace First has additionally developed a curriculum that can be used in schools. It addresses themes such as friendship, fairness, cooperation, con ict resolution and consequences of actions through experiential activities and cooperative games. For example, 1st graders learn about communicating their feelings, 3rd graders develop skills and awareness around communication and cooperation, 4th graders practice courage and taking a stand and 5th graders explore how to resolve and de-escalate conflicts.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation, Japan (and global) ===
'''Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation''' is an education-services organization that provides capstone education programs free of charge to engineering students and other stakeholders. These programs are intended to complement—but not to replace—coursework required by academic degree programs of study. The programs are educational opportunities, and students are not paid money for their participation. All correspondence among members is completed via e-mail, and all meetings are held via Skype, with English as the language of instruction and publication. Students and other stakeholders are never asked to travel or leave their geographic locations, and are encouraged to publish organizational documents in their personal, primary languages, when English is a secondary language.

== Connection to Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) ==
{{Main|Education for sustainable development}}

GCE and ESD pursue the same vision: It is all about empowering learners of all ages to become proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive and sustainable world. Both GCED and ESD:
* focus not only on the content and outcome of what is learned, but also on the process of how it is learned and in what type of environment it is learned.
* emphasize action, change and transformation.
* place importance on acquiring values and attitudes relevant to addressing global challenges.
* foster skills for collaboration, communication and critical thinking.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002463/246352e.pdf|title=Schools in action, global citizens for sustainable development: a guide for students|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100179-6|location=|pages=10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objections ==

Some fundamentalist critics believe GCE might undermine religious education and promote secular values.&lt;ref name="Schattle, 2008"&gt;Schattle, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Others are concerned that the pedagogical approach of most global citizenship education curricula are too often produced in particular Northern, Western contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Andreotti and de Souza, 2012:18&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics claim that GCE curricula promote values that are too individualistic.&lt;ref name="Dill, 2013"/&gt; Dill,&lt;ref&gt;2013&lt;/ref&gt; for example, claims that "the majority of the world experiences social and communal life not in terms of isolated individuals, but as collective identities and traditions. For many of these groups, the dominant forms of global citizenship education and its moral order will be experienced as coercive and unjust',&lt;ref&gt;Dill, 2013:33&lt;/ref&gt; so 'global' citizenship curriculum should be seen as a local practice, "which diverse cultures will conceptualize and construct differently".&lt;ref&gt;Myers, 2006:13&lt;/ref&gt;

*March 2009 FISC ruling showing a consistent pattern of misrepresentations of the bulk telephone metadata collection program by the government to the Court. It also held that the data was being routinely queried in ways that did not meet "reasonable articulatable suspicion", demonstrating inadequate safeguards in the software and training of analysts. Showing that "thousands of violations resulted from the use of identifiers that were not "RAS-approved by analysts who were not even aware that they were accessing BR metadata," and that in 2006 "there was no single person [in the NSA] who had a complete understanding of the BR FISA system architecture," a situation which persisted until February 2009 or later. RAS is shorthand for Reasonable Articulatable Suspicion. The Court nonetheless reapproved the collection of bulk phone metadata, while mandating additional safeguards and training, and "end-to-end system engineering reviews," and reports from the review.

The data has not been scrubbed to eliminate US persons, it asks Israel not to deliberately target US persons, however the agreement allows Israel to retain US person data for one full year. The memorandum is not legally binding. A separate document states "And there are other kinds of CI threats that are right on our midst. For example, one of NSA's biggest threats is actually from friendly intelligence services, like Israel.", it continues "Balancing the SIGINT exchange between US and Israeli needs has been a constant challenge. In the last decade, it arguably tilted heavily in favor of Israeli security concerns. 9/11 came and went, and with NSA's only true Third Party CT relationship being driven almost entirely driven by the needs of the partner."&lt;ref name=guardianIsrael&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/nsa-americans-personal-data-israel-documents|title=NSA shares raw intelligence including Americans' data with Israel|authors=[[Glenn Greenwald]], [[Laura Poitras]], and [[Ewen MacAskill]]|date =September 11, 2013|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his opinion, he wrote, "a bulk telephony metadata collection program [is] a wide net that could find and isolate gossamer contacts among suspected terrorists in an ocean of seemingly disconnected data" and noted that a similar collection of data prior to 9/11 might have prevented the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bazzle |first=Steph |title=Judge Says NSA's Data Collection Is Legal |url=http://www.indyposted.com/227717/judge-says-nsas-data-collection-legal/ |publisher=Indyposted |accessdate=28 December 2013 |date=27 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228162843/http://www.indyposted.com/227717/judge-says-nsas-data-collection-legal/ |archivedate=December 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III also ruled that Congress legally set up the program and that it does not violate anyone's constitutional rights. The judge also concluded that the telephone data being swept up by NSA did not belong to telephone users, but to the telephone companies. And further he ruled that, when NSA obtains such data from the telephone companies, and then probes into it to find links between callers and potential terrorists, this further use of the data was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment. He also concluded that the controlling precedent is [[Smith v. Maryland]]: "Smith's bedrock holding is that an individual has no legitimate expectation of privacy in information provided to third parties," Judge Pauley wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Upholds N.S.A.'s Bulk Collection of Data on Calls|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/us/nsa-phone-surveillance-is-lawful-federal-judge-rules.html?ref=us&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=28 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 December 2013|author1=Adam Liptak |author2=Michael S.

*Numerous reports relating to drones, including "Threats to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles", a report summarizing attempts to shoot down, intercept, control or otherwise spoof drones. While the report details vulnerabilities of specific aircraft, the document itself has not been published, but only excerpts described. Other reports detail American spin efforts, suggesting that the phrases "drone strike," "kill list," "robot warfare," "Aerial Assassins" be avoided, offering "lethal UAV operations" instead, and also terms like "Pre-emptive and Preventive Military Action" and "Inherent Right of Self Defense." Likewise, reports detail efforts by Al-Qaeda to spin, portraying attacks as cowardly and immoral. Analysts also questioned whether America was losing rhetorical battle in courts, media, and public opinion. Another report stated that drone strikes "could be brought under increased scrutiny, perceived to be illegitimate, openly resisted or undermined."&lt;ref name="wapo20130903"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-documents-detail-al-qaedas-efforts-to-fight-back-against-drones/2013/09/03/b83e7654-11c0-11e3-b630-36617ca6640f_story_3.html|title=U.S. documents detail al-Qaeda's efforts to fight back against drones|authors= Craig Whitlock and Barton Gellman|date=September 3, 2013|accessdate=September 3, 2013|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suggested protective measures from surveillance ==

=== Encryption ===
In [[cryptography]], [[encryption]] is the process of encoding information in such a way that eavesdroppers or hackers cannot read it, but that authorized parties can. According to Snowden's recommendations published by ''The Guardian Edward'' in September 2013,&lt;ref name="Encryp" /&gt; properly implemented strong [[Cryptosystem|crypto systems]] were among the few things which one can rely on. However, [[Communication endpoint|endpoint]] security is often too weak to prevent the [[NSA]] from finding ways around it.&lt;ref name="Encryp"&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA surveillance: A guide to staying secure|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/05/nsa-how-to-remain-secure-surveillance|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|accessdate=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underground bunkers ===
In September 2013, it was reported by the press that a number of countries deemed by the US and its allies to be [[rogue state]]s, such as [[Syria]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]], had successfully evaded U.S. government surveillance by constructing secret bunkers deep below the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|last=Narayan Lakshman|title=Secret bunkers, a challenge for U.S. intelligence|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/secret-bunkers-a-challenge-for-us-intelligence/article5164833.ece?ref=relatedNews|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''|accessdate=September 24, 2013|location=Chennai, India|date=September 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[China]]'s underground megaproject, the [[816 Nuclear Military Plant]] in [[Chongqing]] (now declassified and opened to tourists), was reported to be "most worrying" for the U.S. [[Defense Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

[[Libya]] evaded surveillance by building "hardened and buried" bunkers at least 40 feet below ground level.&lt;ref name="thehindu"/&gt;

'''Globalization''' [[-ise vs -ize|or]] '''[[wiktionary:globalisation#English|globalisation]]''' is the process  of [[foreign relations|interaction]] and integration between people, companies, and governments [[world]]wide. Globalization has grown due to advances in [[transportation]] and [[communication]] technology. With increased global interactions comes the growth of international [[trade]], [[idea]]s, and [[culture]]. Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that's associated with social and cultural aspects. However, [[wiktionary:conflict|conflicts]] and [[diplomacy]] are also large parts of the [[history of globalization]], and modern globalization.

Economically, globalization involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology, and data.&lt;ref name="Albrow"&gt;Albrow, Martin and Elizabeth King (eds.) (1990).

==Etymology and usage==
The term ''globalization'' derives from the word ''globalize'', which refers to the emergence of an international network of economic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=globalization|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest known usages of the term as a noun was in a 1930 publication entitled ''Towards New Education'', where it denoted a holistic view of human experience in education.&lt;ref name=oed&gt;{{cite web|title=Globalization|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50297775?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=Globalization&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|date=September 2009|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'globalization' had been used in its economic sense at least as early as 1981, and in other senses since at least as early as 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/business/06levitt.html | title=Theodore Levitt, 81, Who Coined the Term 'Globalization', Is Dead | date=6 July 2006 | accessdate=23 April 2014 | author=Feder, Barnaby J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodore Levitt is credited with popularizing the term and bringing it into the mainstream business audience in the later half of the 1980s. Since its inception, the concept of globalization has inspired competing definitions and interpretations. Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and [[empire]] across [[Asia]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] from the 15th century onward.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G. (ed.). (2004). ''Globalization in World History.'' London: Norton, pp. 4–8. {{ISBN|978-0393979428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakari13"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bakari|first=Mohamed El-Kamel|title=Globalization and Sustainable Development: False Twins?|journal=New Global Studies|volume=7|issue=3|pages=23–56|issn=1940-0004|doi=10.1515/ngs-2013-021|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the complexity of the concept, various research projects, articles, and discussions often stay focused on a single aspect of globalization.&lt;ref name="GCSP"&gt;Al-Rodhan, R.F. Nayef and Gérard Stoudmann. (2006). [http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf Definitions of the Globalization: A Comprehensive Overview and a Proposed Definition.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119215401/http://www.sustainablehistory.com/articles/definitions-of-globalization.pdf|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sociology|Sociologists]] [[Martin Albrow]] and Elizabeth King define globalization as "all those processes by which the people of the world are incorporated into a single world society."&lt;ref name="Albrow" /&gt; In ''The Consequences of Modernity'', [[Anthony Giddens]] writes: "Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide [[social relation]]s which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony. (1991). ''The Consequences of Modernity'' Cambridge: Polity Press. p. 64. {{ISBN|9780745609232}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Roland Robertson]], professor of sociology at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and an early writer in the field, described globalization as "the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization : social theory and global culture|last=Robertson|first=Roland|publisher=Sage|year=1992|isbn=0803981872|edition= Reprint.|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Global Transformations'', [[David Held]] and his co-writers state:
{{quote|text=Although in its simplistic sense globalization refers to the widening, deepening and speeding up of global interconnection, such a definition begs further elaboration. ... Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional. At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions. Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents. Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term. ... A satisfactory definition of globalization must capture each of these elements: extensity (stretching), intensity, velocity and impact.&lt;ref&gt;Held, David; Goldblatt, David; McGrew, Anthony; Perraton, Jonathan (1999). ''Global Transformations'' Cambridge: Polity Press. {{ISBN|9780745614984}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=|}}

Held and his co-writers' definition of globalization in that same book as "transformation in the spatial organization of social relations and transactions—assessed in terms of their extensity, intensity, velocity and impact—generating transcontinental or inter-regional flows" was called "probably the most widely-cited definition" in the 2014 [[Pankaj Ghemawat|DHL Global Connectiveness Index]].&lt;ref name="DHL"/&gt;

Swedish journalist Thomas Larsson, in his book ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'', states that globalization:
{{quote|is the process of world shrinkage, of distances getting shorter, things moving closer. It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Larsson, Thomas. (2001). ''The Race to the Top: The Real Story of Globalization'' Washington, D.C.: Cato Institute. p. 9. {{ISBN|978-1930865150}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] defines globalization with a more direct and historically contextualized emphasis:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Globalization is the extension of social relations across world-space, defining that world-space in terms of the historically variable ways that it has been practiced and socially understood through changing world-time.&lt;ref name=James2005&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2005 | last=James |first=Paul | title=  ‘Arguing Globalizations: Propositions Towards an Investigation of Global Formation’ | url= https://www.academia.edu/5246805/Arguing_Globalizations_Propositions_Towards_an_Investigation_of_Global_Formation | journal= Globalizations | volume= 2 | issue=  2 | pages=193–209 | doi=10.1080/14747730500202206}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Manfred Steger]], professor of [[global studies]] and research leader in the [[Global Cities Institute]] at [[RMIT University]], identifies four main empirical [[dimensions of globalization]]: economic, political, cultural, and [[Ecology|ecological]]. A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four. The ideological dimension, according to Steger, is filled with a range of [[Norm (social)|norms]], claims, beliefs, and narratives about the phenomenon itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Globalization: A Very Short Introduction|last=Steger|first=Manfred|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-19-955226-9|location=New York|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James and Steger stated that the concept of globalization "emerged from the intersection of four interrelated sets of '[[Community of practice|communities of practice]]' ([[Étienne Wenger|Wenger]], 1998): academics, journalists, publishers/editors, and librarians."&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt;{{Rp|424}} They note the term was used "in education to describe the global life of the mind"; in [[international relations]] to describe the extension of the [[European Economic Community|European Common Market]]; and in journalism to describe how the "American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com" /&gt; They have also argued that four different forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.&lt;ref name=James2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2013|title=‘Levels of Subjective Globalization: Ideologies, Imaginaries, Ontologies’|url=https://www.academia.edu/4311113/Levels_of_Subjective_Globalization_Ideologies_Imaginaries_Ontologies|journal=Perspectives on Global Development and Technology|volume=12|issue=1–2|author1=Manfred B. Steger|author2=Paul James}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people. A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and [[Polity|polities]], including [[Imperialism|imperial]] agents. Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of [[Commodity|commodities]] and other objects of exchange. He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization. James holds that this series of distinctions allows for an understanding of how, today, the most embodied forms of globalization such as the movement of [[refugee]]s and [[Immigration|migrants]] are increasingly restricted, while the most disembodied forms such as the circulation of financial instruments and codes are the most [[Deregulation|deregulated]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2014|title=‘Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens’|url=https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens|journal=Citizenship Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=208–23|doi=10.1080/13621025.2014.886440|pmid=|access-date=|via=|last1=James|first1=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist [[Thomas L. Friedman]] popularized the term [[The World Is Flat|"flat world"]], arguing that [[Global trade|globalized trade]], [[outsourcing]], [[supply chain|supply-chaining]], and political forces had permanently changed the world, for better and worse. He asserted that the pace of globalization was quickening and that its impact on business organization and practice would continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas L.

Economist [[Takis Fotopoulos]] defined "economic globalization" as the opening and deregulation of [[Commodity market|commodity]], [[Capital market|capital]], and [[Labour economics|labor markets]] that led toward present [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] globalization. He used "political globalization" to refer to the emergence of a transnational [[élite]] and a phasing out of the [[nation-state]]. Meanwhile, he used "cultural globalization" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture. Other of his usages included "[[Ideology|ideological]] globalization", "[[Technology|technological]] globalization", and "social globalization".&lt;ref&gt;Fotopoulos, Takis. (2001).

Lechner and Boli (2012) define globalization as more people across large distances becoming connected in more and different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner,  Frank J. and John Boli (eds.) (2011). ''The Globalization Reader.'' New Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Globophobia" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the [[balloon phobia|fear of balloons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henwood|first1=Doug|title=Beyond Globophobia|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/beyond-globophobia|work=[[The Nation]]|date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Ross|title=Globophobia|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/columnists/12049/globophobia-17/|work=[[The Spectator]]|date=20 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008"&gt;{{cite book|editor=George Ritzer|editorlink=George Ritzer|title=The Blackwell Companion to Globalization|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=XKnmvRATtfAC|page=16}}|date=15 April 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-76642-2|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of globalization}}
{{See also|Timeline of international trade}}

There are both [[Proximate and ultimate causation|distal and proximate causes]] which can be traced in the historical factors affecting globalization. Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Rourke |first=Kevin H. |first2=Jeffrey G. |last2=Williamson |year=2002 |title=When Did Globalization Begin? |journal=European Review of Economic History |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=23–50 |doi=10.1017/S1361491602000023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaic===
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|The 13th century world-system, as described by [[Janet Abu-Lughod]]]]
{{Main|Archaic globalization}}

Archaic globalization conventionally refers to a phase in the history of globalization including globalizing events and developments from the time of the earliest [[civilization]]s until roughly the 1600s. This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.&lt;ref name="M 45"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt; With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.&lt;ref name="M 45"/&gt;

Also posited is a "multi-polar" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] of the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Hans Köchler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], 17th-century Japanese [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]]]]

The German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|B.C.E.]]  This archaic globalization existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture that reached from [[India]] to [[Spain]], including [[Alexandria]] and the other [[Alexander the Great|Alexandrine]] cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of [[import]]ing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade. Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.&lt;ref name="GL-H-09"&gt;Frank, Andre Gunder. (1998). ''ReOrient: Global economy in the Asian age.''

Trade on the [[Silk Road]] was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, [[South Asian history|Indian subcontinent]], [[Persia]], Europe, and [[Arabia]], opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and [[religion]]s, [[syncretic]] philosophies, and various technologies, as well as [[disease]]s, also traveled along the Silk Routes. In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilizations along its network.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Bentley, Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, [[Missionary|missionaries]], robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, [[language]]s, and new technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/legacy-silk-road | title = The Legacy of the Silk Road | publisher = Yale Global | date = 25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early modern===
{{Main|Proto-globalization}}

"[[Early modern period|Early modern]]-" or "proto-globalization" covers a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800. The concept of "proto-globalization" was first introduced by [[historian]]s [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]]. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high "modern globalization" in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, A.G., ed., 2003. Globalization in World History. New York City, NY: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-97942-3}} pp. 4–5, 7&lt;/ref&gt; This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 16th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire]]s, and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhuri, K.N. (1965\1999). ''The English East India Company: The Study of an Early Joint-stock Company 1600–1640 (Vol. 4).'' London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of [[expansionism]], the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. European, [[Muslim]], Indian, [[Southeast Asia]]n, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.

===Modern===
According to economic historians Kevin H. O'Rourke, Leandro Prados de la Escosura, and Guillaume Daudin, several factors promoted globalization in the period 1815-1870:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-economic-history-of-modern-europe/trade-and-empire/BE789F27408634F4749D61F013897C04|title=Trade and empire (Chapter 4) - The Cambridge Economic History of Modern Europe|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|pages=100–101|language=en|access-date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars brought in an era of relative peace in Europe.
* Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
* New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires.
* A gradual move towards greater liberalization in European countries.
During the 19th century, globalization approached its form as a direct result of the [[industrial revolution|Industrial Revolution]]. [[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] allowed [[standardization|standardized]] production of household items using [[economies of scale]] while rapid [[population growth]] created sustained [[demand]] for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and [[railroads]] made inland transportation cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; More nations embraced [[international trade]].&lt;ref name="When Did Globalization Begin" /&gt; Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] such as in [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]]. The invention of [[shipping container]]s in 1956 helped advance the globalization of commerce.&lt;ref name="Levinson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/how-the-invention-of-a-box-changed-our-world/2006/06/11/1149964409162.html%0A|title=How the invention of a box changed our world – Business – smh.com.au|last=Gittins|first=Ross|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=17 February 2013|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], work by politicians led to the agreements of the [[Bretton Woods Conference]], in which major governments laid down the framework for [[International monetary systems|international monetary policy]], commerce, and finance, and the founding of several [[international institution]]s intended to facilitate economic growth by lowering [[trade barrier]]s. Initially, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process. Exports nearly doubled from 8.5% of total gross world product in 1970 to 16.2% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | title = World Exports as Percentage of Gross World Product | publisher=[[Global Policy Forum]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712023541/http://www.globalpolicy.org/socecon/trade/tables/exports2.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2008 | accessdate =11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the [[Doha Development Round]] of trade negotiation. Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 [[South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement]].

Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to [[middle class]]es in [[developed countries]]. [[Open skies]] policies and [[low-cost carrier]]s have helped to bring [[Competition (economics)|competition]] to the [[Market (economics)|market]]. In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between different countries. More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location. This included accounting, software development, and engineering design.

[[Student exchange program]]s became popular after [[World War II]], and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons. Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.&lt;ref name=varghese/&gt;

''Globalization: The Essentials.''  NY: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[revolutions of 1989]] and subsequent [[liberalization]] in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness. The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process. In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled. Most migration occurred between the [[Developing country|developing countries]] and [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs).&lt;ref name =Saggi2002&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saggi | first1 = Kamal | year = 2002 | title = Trade, Foreign Direct Investment, and International Technology Transfer: A Survey | url = | journal = World Bank Research Observer | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 191–235 | doi = 10.1093/wbro/17.2.191 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy.  The collapse of the Soviet Union not only ended the Cold War's division of the world- it also left the United States its sole policeman and an unfettered advocate of free market. It also resulted in the growing prominence of attention focused on the movement of diseases, the proliferation of popular culture and consumer values, the growing prominence of international institutions like the UN, and concerted international action on such issues as the environment and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The World Transformed 1945 to present|last=Hunt|first=Michael H.|publisher=|year=2004|isbn=|location=|page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other developments as dramatic were the Internet has become influential in connecting people across the world. {{As of|2012|6}}, more than 2.4 billion people—over a third of the world's human population—have used the services of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treese.org/intindex/95-11.htm |title=The Open Market Internet Index |publisher=Treese.org |date=11 November 1995 |accessdate=15 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601045949/http://www.treese.org/intindex/95-11.htm |archivedate=1 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm|title=World Stats|date=30 June 2012|work=Internet World Stats|publisher=Miniwatts Marketing Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth of globalization has never been smooth.

Economic globalization is the increasing economic interdependence of national economies across the world through a rapid increase in cross-[[border]] movement of goods, services, technology, and capital.&lt;ref name="Joshi, Rakesh Mohan 2009"&gt;Joshi, Rakesh Mohan, (2009) International Business, Oxford University Press, New Delhi and New York {{ISBN|0-19-568909-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as [[tariff]]s, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing [[economic integration]] between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, T: "Year 12 Economics", p. 9. Tim Riley Publications, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon. Economic globalization comprises: Globalization of production; which refers to the obtention of goods and services from a particular source from different locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality. Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace. Economic globalization also includes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864808614|title=International business: competing in the global marketplace|last=Hill|first=Charles W.

Current globalization trends can be largely accounted for by developed economies integrating with less developed economies by means of [[foreign direct investment]], the reduction of trade barriers as well as other economic reforms, and, in many cases, [[immigration]].

[[International standard]]s have made trade in goods and services more efficient. An example of such standard is the [[intermodal container]].

EU policies aim to ensure the [[Single market|free movement of people, goods, services, and capital]] within the internal market,&lt;ref name="Europa Internal Market"&gt;{{cite web|title=The EU Single Market: Fewer barriers, more opportunities |publisher=Europa web portal |author=European Commission |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm |accessdate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001122551/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/index_en.htm |archivedate=1 October 2007 |df= }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|title=Activities of the European Union: Internal Market |publisher=Europa web portal |url=http://europa.eu/pol/singl/index_en.htm |accessdate=29 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trade facilitation]] looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximise efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives.

Global trade in services is also significant. For example, in [[India]], [[business process outsourcing]] has been described as the "primary engine of the country's development over the next few decades, contributing broadly to [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth, employment growth, and poverty alleviation".&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuruvilla |first=Sarosh |last2=Ranganathan |first2=Aruna |title=Economic Development Strategies And Macro- And Micro-Level Human Resource Policies: The Case Of India's "Outsourcing" Industry|journal=Industrial &amp; Labor Relations Review|date=October 2008|volume=62|issue=1|pages=39–72|ref=harv |doi=10.1177/001979390806200103|url=http://ilr.sagepub.com/content/62/1/39.full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/15777592?story_id=E1_TVSSSVJN|accessdate=16 April 2011|title=Outsourcing to Africa: The world economy calls &amp;#124; The Economist|date=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William I. Robinson]]'s theoretical approach to globalization is a critique of Wallerstein's World Systems Theory.  He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.  Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|journal=International Sociology|volume=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.  This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six different countries, each contributing to a part of the production process.

{{Main|Cultural globalization}}

Cultural globalization refers to the transmission of ideas, meanings, and values around the world in such a way as to extend and intensify social relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=James|first=Paul|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, [[popular culture]] media, and international travel. This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, ‘Ideologies of Globalism’, in Paul James and Manfred B. Steger, eds, [https://uws.academia.edu/PaulJames Globalization and Culture: Vol. 4, Ideologies of Globalism], Sage Publications, London, 2010.  {{Cite book|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|last1=Inda|first1=Jonathan|last2=Rosaldo|first2=Renato|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|chapter=Introduction: A World in Motion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cross-cultural communication]] is a field of study that looks at how people from differing cultural backgrounds communicate, in similar and different ways among themselves, and how they endeavour to communicate across cultures. [[Intercultural communication]] is a related field of study.

[[Cultural diffusion]] is the spread of [[culture|cultural]] items—such as [[idea]]s, [[fashion|styles]], [[religion]]s, [[technology|technologies]], [[contact linguistics|languages]] etc.
Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities. For example, [[sushi]] is available in Germany as well as Japan, but [[Disneyland Paris|Euro-Disney]] outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for "authentic" French pastry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/policy_report/v25n3/globalization.pdf |title=Globalization and Culture |last1=Cowen |first1=Tyler |last2=Barber |first2=Benjamin |journal=Cato Policy Report |date=May–June 2003 |accessdate=15 March 2017|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadeem, S (2009) [http://nadeem.commons.gc.cuny.edu/files/2010/04/CS_Nadeem.pdf Macaulay's (Cyber) Children: The Cultural Politics of Outsourcing in India].

Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television.

Religions were among the earliest cultural elements to globalize, being spread by force, migration, [[evangelism|evangelists]], imperialists, and traders. [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and more recently sects such as [[Mormonism]] are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins.&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Elizabeth. 2005.

The term globalization implies transformation. Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments. Fusion genres can become interesting fields of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, Thomas. 2004. "Competing Conceptions of Globalization" Revisited: Relocating the Tension between World-Systems Analysis and Globalization Analysis. In: Comparative Education Review, vol. 48, no. 3, pp. 274–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music has an important role in economic and cultural development during globalization. Music genres such as [[jazz]] and [[reggae]] began locally and later became international phenomena. Globalization gave support to the [[world music]] phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Throsby, David. (2002.) "The music industry in the new millennium: Global and Local Perspectives."

[[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]] claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity. Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 [[UNESCO]] report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/template/pdf/cscl/IntlFlows_EN.pdf |title=International Flows of Selected Goods and Services |format=PDF |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that cultural exchange is becoming more frequent from Eastern Asia, but that Western countries are still the main exporters of cultural goods. In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.

Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia — Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization is a diverse phenomenon which relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries. The Indian experience particularly reveals the [[Cultural pluralism|plurality]] of the impact of cultural globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Ghosh, Biswajit (2011).

In general, globalization may ultimately reduce the importance of [[nation state]]s. [[Supranational]] institutions such as the [[European Union]], the [[WTO]], the [[G8]] or the [[International Criminal Court]] replace or extend national functions to facilitate international agreement.&lt;ref name="Scholte, 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholte|first=Jan-Aart|title=Globalization: A Critical Introduction |chapter=Chapter 6: Globalization and Governance|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could ultimately lead to a [[global union]], based on the [[European Union]] model.&lt;ref name="mcclintock1"&gt;John McClintock (2010). "The Uniting of Nations: An Essay on Global Governance (3rd ed. revised and updated)". Publisher: P.I.E. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intergovernmentalism]] is a term in [[political science]] with two meanings. The first refers to a theory of regional integration originally proposed by [[Stanley Hoffmann]]; the second treats states and the national government as the primary factors for integration.&lt;ref name="japss2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Contribution of the Neofunctionalist and Intergovernmentalist Theories to the Evolution of the European Integration Process|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/14._Mogaarticle.pdf|publisher=Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Teodor Lucian Moga|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Multi-level governance]] is an approach in [[political science]] and [[public administration theory]] that originated from studies on [[European integration]]. Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.  It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.

Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states. [[Multiple citizenship]], also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or  dual nationality, is a person's [[citizenship]] status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one [[Sovereign state|state]] under the laws of those states.

Increasingly, [[non-governmental organization]]s influence public policy across national boundaries, including [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian aid]] and [[International development|developmental efforts]].&lt;ref name="globall"&gt;Pawel Zaleski ''Global Non-governmental Administrative System: Geosociology of the Third Sector'', [in:] Gawin, Dariusz &amp; Glinski, Piotr [ed.]: "Civil Society in the Making", IFiS Publishers, Warszawa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], [[Accion International]], the Acumen Fund (now [[Acumen Fund|Acumen]]) and the [[Echoing Green]] have combined the [[business model]] with [[philanthropy]], giving rise to business organizations such as the [[Global Philanthropy Group]] and new associations of philanthropists such as the [[Global Philanthropy Forum]].  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Vaccine-Delivery|title=Vaccine Delivery|work=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hudson Institute]] estimates total private philanthropic flows to developing countries at [[US$]]59 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudson.org/files/publications/2012IndexofGlobalPhilanthropyandRemittances.pdf ''The Index of Global Philanthropy and Remittances 2012''.

As a response to globalization, some countries have embraced [[isolationism|isolationist]] policies. For example, the [[North Korea]]n government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.&lt;ref name=nkr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northkoreanrefugees.com/2008-exodus.htm |title=North Korean Refugees NGO |publisher=Northkoreanrefugees.com |date=20 October 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=unhcr&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,,,PRK,4562d8cf2,487ca236c0,0.html |title=UNHCR Freedom in the World 2008 – North Korea |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2 July 2008 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018022844/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country%2C%2C%2C%2CPRK%2C4562d8cf2%2C487ca236c0%2C0.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dimensions==
Scholars also occasionally discuss other, less common dimensions of globalization, such as [[environmental globalization]] (the internationally coordinated practices and regulations, often in the form of international treaties, regarding environmental protection)&lt;ref name="Zimmerer2006-1"&gt;{{cite book|first=Karl S. |last=Zimmerer|title=Globalization &amp; New Geographies of Conservation|url={{google books|id=UdLK-UGj7YkC|page=1|plainurl=yes}}|year=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-98344-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[military globalization]] (growth in global extent and scope of security relationships).&lt;ref name="Krishnan2016"&gt;{{cite book|first=Armin |last=Krishnan|title=War as Business: Technological Change and Military Service Contracting|url={{google books|id=1ymrCwAAQBAJ|page=PA157|plainurl=yes}}|date=3 March 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-00049-5|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: [[economic globalization]], [[cultural globalization]] and [[political globalization]].&lt;ref name="Ritzer2008-146"/&gt;

===Movement of people===
[[File:World-airline-routemap-2009.png|thumb|Scheduled [[airline]] traffic in 2009]]
An essential aspect of globalization is movement of people, and state-boundary limits on that movement have changed across history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James| first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Faces of Globalization and the Borders of States: From Asylum Seekers to Citizens | url= https://www.academia.edu/7773440/Faces_of_Globalization_and_the_Borders_of_States_From_Asylum_Seekers_to_Citizens | journal= Citizenship Studies | volume=  18 | issue=  2 | pages= 208–23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century. As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century. For example, travel across the [[Atlantic ocean]] used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Boustan, Adain May . "Fertility and Immigration." UCLA. 15 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable.

[[Tourism]] is travel for pleasure. The developments in technology and transport infrastructure, such as [[Wide-body aircraft|jumbo jets]], [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airlines]], and more [[accessible tourism|accessible]] [[airport]]s have made many types of tourism more affordable. International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.&lt;ref name="Barom2012"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |title=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |publisher=[[World Tourism Organization]] |journal=UNWTO World Tourism Barometer |date=January 2013 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=9 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228162347/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/pdf/unwto_barom13_01_jan_excerpt_0.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Travel visa|visa]] is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country. Some countries – such as those in the [[Schengen Area]] – have agreements with other countries allowing each other's citizens to travel between them without visas. The [[World Tourism Organization]] announced that the number of tourists who require a visa before traveling was at its lowest level ever in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/travel/visa-requirements-for-tourism-eased-around-the-world-says-un-agency-365446391.html Visa requirements for tourism eased around the world, says UN agency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |title=Visa Openness Report 2015 January 2016 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123123959/http://dtxtq4w60xqpw.cloudfront.net/sites/all/files/docpdf/2015visaopennessreportonline.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigration]] is the international movement of people into a destination [[country]] of which they are not natives or where they do not possess [[citizenship]] in order to settle or reside there, especially as [[Permanent residency|permanent residents]] or [[Naturalization|naturalized]] citizens, or to take-up [[employment]] as a [[migrant worker]] or temporarily as a [[foreign worker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/immigration|title=immigration|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immigration| title=immigrate|publisher=Merriam-Webster, In.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCUK"&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's who: Definitions|url=http://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/policy_research/the_truth_about_asylum/the_facts_about_asylum|first=|last=|publisher=Refugee Council|location=London, England|year=2016|access-date= 7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[International Labour Organization]], {{as of|2014|lc=y}} there were an estimated 232 million international migrants in the world (defined as persons outside their country of origin for 12 months or more) and approximately half of them were estimated to be economically active (i.e. being employed or seeking employment).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mainstreaming of Migration in Development Policy and Integrating Migration in the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/genericdocument/wcms_220084.pdf|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development. For example, [[freedom of movement for workers in the European Union]] means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country.

Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in [[international education]].  More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many [[international student]]s now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.&lt;ref name="gribble"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gribble | first1 = C | year = 2008 | title = Policy options for managing international student migration: the sending country's perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 25–39 | doi=10.1080/13600800701457830}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contributions that [[foreign student]]s make to host nation economies, both culturally and financially has encouraged major players to implement further initiatives to facilitate the arrival and integration of overseas students, including substantial amendments to [[immigration]] and visa policies and procedures.&lt;ref name="varghese"&gt;Varghese, N.V. 2008, 'Globalization of higher education and cross-border student mobility', International Institute for Educational Planning, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[transnational marriage]] is a [[marriage]] between two people from different countries. A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to [[citizenship]] and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships.
In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries. Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.

===Movement of information===

{{Internet users by region}}
Before electronic communications, long-distance communications relied on [[mail]]. Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century. The [[electric telegraph]] was the first method of instant long-distance communication. For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean. The first [[transatlantic telegraph cable|transatlantic cable]] reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day. Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866. The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.

The [[Internet]] has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries. For example, [[Facebook]] is a [[social networking service]] which has more than [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million active users|1.65 billion monthly active users]] {{as of|2016|3|31|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name="Facebook-Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Info – Facebook Newsroom|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/|publisher=Facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization can be spread by Global journalism which provides massive information and relies on the internet to interact,  "makes it into an everyday routine to investigate how people and their actions, practices, problems, life conditions etc. in different parts of the world are interrelated. possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Berglez |date=2008 |title=WHAT IS GLOBAL JOURNALISM? |journal=Journalism Studies |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=845–858 &lt;!--was originally "5" but that's confusing--&gt; |doi=10.1080/14616700802337727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{See also|List of globalization-related indices}}

One index of globalization is the ''KOF Index of Globalization'', which measures three important dimensions of globalization:  economic, social, and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalization.kof.ethz.ch/ | title=KOF Index of Globalization | publisher=The KOF Swiss Economic Institute | work=ethz.ch | date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[A.T.

Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as [[trade]], [[Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI), [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP), [[portfolio investment]], and [[income]].  However, newer indices attempt to measure globalization in more general terms, including variables related to political, social, cultural, and even environmental aspects of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vujakovic | first1 = Petra | year = 2010 | title = How to Measure Globalization?

==Support and criticism==
{{See also|Criticisms of globalization}}
Reactions to processes contributing to globalization have varied widely with a history as long as extraterritorial contact and trade. [[philosophy|Philosophical]] differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of [[ideology|ideologies]] and [[social movements]].  Proponents of [[economic growth]], [[economic expansion|expansion]] and [[economic development|development]], in general, view globalizing processes as desirable or necessary to the well-being of human [[society]].&lt;ref name=Sen1970&gt;Sen, Amartya K. (1970).  ''Collective choice and social welfare.'' San Francisco, CA: Holden-Day.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antagonists view one or more globalizing processes as detrimental to social well-being on a global or local scale;&lt;ref name=Sen1970 /&gt; this includes those who social or [[natural environment|natural]] [[sustainability]] of long-term and continuous economic expansion, the social [[structural inequality]] caused by these processes, and the [[Colonialism|colonial]], [[Imperialism|imperialistic]], or [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] [[ethnocentrism]], [[cultural assimilation]] and [[cultural appropriation]] that underlie such processes.

Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures. [[Xenophobia]] is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/xenophobia?q=xenophobia|title=Definition of xenophobia in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xenophobia|title=Define Xenophobia at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and [[perception]]s of an [[ingroup]] towards an [[Outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]], including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Guido Bolaffi. ''Dictionary of race, ethnicity and culture''. SAGE Publications Ltd., 2003. p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs. They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the [[Gini coefficient]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20238991~menuPK:492138~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html|title=Poverty Analysis – Measuring Inequality|work=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Happy Planet Index]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happyplanetindex.org/ |title=The Happy Planet Index |publisher=Neweconomics.org |accessdate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and point to a "multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"&lt;ref name="The Hidden Connections"&gt;{{cite book | last = Capra | first = Fritjof | year = 2002 | title = The Hidden Connections | publisher=Random House | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-385-49471-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they claim are the [[unintended consequences]] of globalization. Others point out that, while the forces of globalization have led to the spread of western-style democracy, this has been accompanied by an increase in inter-ethnic tension and violence as free market economic policies combine with democratic processes of universal suffrage as well as an escalation in militarization to impose democratic principles and as a means to conflict resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorrells, Kathryn. Intercultural Communication: Globalization and Social Justice. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE, 2013. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion on globalization===

A 2005 study by Peer Fiss and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior. In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"&gt;Fiss, Peer and Hirsch, Pal: "The Discourse of Globalization: Framing and Sensemaking of an Emerging Concept. American Sociological Review, February 2005. vol. 70 no 1: 29–52.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999. This increase occurred during a period when the total number of articles concerning globalization nearly doubled.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;

A number of international polls have shown that residents of Africa and Asia tend to view globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably.&lt;ref&gt;"Africans and Asians Tend to View Globalization Favorably. Europeans and Americans are More Skeptical". World Public Opinion.org. 7 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC found that 50% of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly, while 35% believed it was proceeding too slowly.&lt;ref name=bbc08&gt;{{cite web| title = Widespread Unease about Economy and Globalization – Global poll| author = BBC World Service| date = 2008| accessdate = 24 March 2015| url = http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140903173226/http://www.worldpublicopinion.org/pipa/pdf/feb08/BBCEcon_Feb08_rpt.pdf| archivedate = 3 September 2014| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Philip Gordon stated that "a clear majority of Europeans believe that globalization can enrich their lives, while believing the European Union can help them take advantage of globalization's benefits while shielding them from its negative effects." The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists. Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004. The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts. Social spending was much higher than in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Philip. 2004. [http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace "Globalization: Europe's Wary Embrace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629191739/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/globalization-europes-wary-embrace|date=29 June 2011}}. Yale Global, 1 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In a Danish poll in 2007, 76% responded that globalization is a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1684528,00.html Why Denmark Loves Globalisation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiss, ''et al.'', surveyed US opinion in 1993. Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization. When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad. At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers. Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.&lt;ref name="Fiss 2005"/&gt;
Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization. Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents. The situation changed after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis of 2007]]. According to a 1997 poll 58% of college graduates said globalization had been good for the US. By 2008 only 33% thought it was good. Respondents with high school education also became more opposed.&lt;ref name="ip08"&gt;Greg Ip: "The Declining Value Of Your College Degree", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi, {{as of|1998|lc=y}} there was a perception in Japan that the economy was "Small and Frail". However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials. Anxiety over their position caused terms such as ''[[internationalization]]'' and ''globalization'' to enter everyday language. However, Japanese tradition was to be as self-sufficient as possible, particularly in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Takenaka Heizo and Chida Ryokichi. 1998. "Japan," ''Domestic Adjustments to Globalization''; (ed, Charles E. Morrison and Hadi Soesastro), Tokyo: Japan center for International Exchange, 1998, pp. 76–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many in developing countries see globalization as a positive force that lifts them out of poverty.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"/&gt; Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism. Opponents consider governments as agents of [[neo-colonialism]] that are subservient to [[multinational corporations]].&lt;ref name="visuality.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shoa |first=S.

In the book ''[[The End of Poverty]]'', Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government [[Political corruption|corruption]]; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as [[AIDS]] and [[malaria]]; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; [[protectionism]]; and geographic barriers.&lt;ref name="The End of Poverty"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sachs | first = Jeffrey | year = 2005 | title = The End of Poverty | publisher=The Penguin Press | location = New York, New York | isbn = 1-59420-045-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jagdish Bhagwati]], a former adviser to the U.N. on globalization, holds that, although there are obvious problems with overly rapid development, globalization is a very positive force that lifts countries out of poverty by causing a virtuous economic cycle associated with faster economic growth.&lt;ref name="bhagwati"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bhagwati | first = Jagdish | title = In Defense of Globalization | publisher=Oxford University Press | year = 2004 | location = Oxford, New York | url =| isbn =978-0195330939}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist.

The flow of migrants to advanced economic countries has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge. An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.&lt;ref name="12th April 2000: IMF Publications"/&gt; Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization. Technological innovations (or technological transfer) is conjectured to benefit most the developing and least developing countries (LDCs), as for example in the adoption of [[mobile phones]].&lt;ref name="Saggi2002" /&gt;

There has been a rapid economic growth in Asia after embracing [[market orientation]]-based economic policies that encourage private [[property rights]], free enterprise and competition. In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url= http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.

Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.&lt;ref name="Wolf2004"&gt;{{cite book|url= http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0300102529|accessdate= 6 April 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130510120230/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300107777|archivedate= 10 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]]. Thus, despite seemingly unequal [[distribution of income]] within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole.

Per capita [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) growth among post-1980 globalizing countries accelerated from 1.4 percent a year in the 1960s and 2.9 percent a year in the 1970s to 3.5 percent in the 1980s and 5.0 percent in the 1990s. This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s. This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial.&lt;ref name="DDollar"&gt;{{cite web|author=Dollar, David|author2=Kraay, Aart|title=Trade, Growth, and Poverty|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2001/09/dollar.htm|work=Finance and Development|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic [[interdependence]] promotes peace.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{cite web |title=Globalisation promotes peace

Keynes had colourfully described the globalization before World War I in ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'', Macmillan, 1919, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some opponents of globalization see the phenomenon as a promotion of corporate interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Laurence|last=Lee|title=WTO blamed for India grain suicides|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2ED53A8B-1058-49CF-B9FF-3D96639456D1.htm|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=17 May 2007|accessdate=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claim that the increasing autonomy and strength of [[corporate entity|corporate entities]] shapes the political policy of countries.&lt;ref name="The Corporation"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bakan | first = Joel | authorlink =Joel Bakan | year = 2004 | title = The Corporation | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York, New York | isbn = 0-7432-4744-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Confessions of an Economic Hit Man"&gt;{{cite book | last = Perkins | first = John | authorlink = John Perkins (author)| year = 2004 | title = Confessions of an Economic Hit Man | publisher=Berrett-Koehler | location = San Francisco, California | isbn = 1-57675-301-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They advocate global institutions and policies that they believe better address the moral claims of poor and working classes as well as environmental concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forumsocialmundial.org.br/index.php?cd_language=2&amp;id_menu= |title=Fórum Social Mundial |publisher=Forumsocialmundial.org.br |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic arguments by [[fair trade]] theorists claim that unrestricted free trade benefits those with more [[Leverage (finance)|financial leverage]] (i.e. the rich) at the expense of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epi.org/publication/webfeatures_viewpoints_nafta_legacy_at10/|title=NAFTA at 10|work=Economic Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization allows corporations to [[outsource]] manufacturing and service jobs from high cost locations, creating economic opportunities with the most competitive wages and worker benefits.&lt;ref name="Kuruvilla 2008 39–72"/&gt; Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries. While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers. The main export of poorer countries is usually [[agricultural production]]s. Larger countries often subsidize their [[Agricultural subsidy|farmers]] (e.g., the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]]), which lowers the market price for foreign crops.&lt;ref name="Hurst E.

===Global democracy===
{{Main|Democratic globalization}}

'''Democratic globalization''' is a movement towards an institutional system of global [[democracy]] that would give world citizens a say in political organizations. This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological [[Non-governmental organization]]s (NGO), political cults and mafias.  One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker [[David Held]]. Advocates of [[democratic globalization]] argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building [[International political economy|global political institutions]]. Dr. [[Francesco Stipo]], Director of the United States Association of the [[Club of Rome]], advocates unifying nations under a [[world government]], suggesting that it "should reflect the political and economic balances of world nations. A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usacor.org/archive/index.html |title=USACOR.org |publisher=USACOR.org |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senator]] [[Douglas Roche]], [[Order of Canada|O.C.]], viewed globalization as inevitable and advocated creating institutions such as a [[direct election|directly elected]] [[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] to exercise oversight over unelected international bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche|first=Douglas|title=The Case for a United Nations  Parliamentary Assembly|url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|publisher=The World Federalist Movement–Institute for Global Policy|accessdate=28 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531054746/http://www.wfm-igp.org/site/files/Roche_UN_Parliamentary_Assembly_2002.pdf|archivedate=31 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global civics===
{{Main|Global civics|Multiculturalism}}
{{See also|Global citizenship}}

Global civics suggests that [[civics]] can be understood, in a global sense, as a [[social contract]] between [[Global citizenship|global citizens]] in the age of interdependence and interaction. The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altinay |first=Hakan |title=The Case for Global Civics |journal=Global Economy and Development at Brookings |year=2010 |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603104201/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2010/03_global_civics_altinay.aspx |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World citizen]] has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional [[geopolitical]] divisions derived from national [[citizenship]]. An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in [[Socrates]], whom [[Plutarch]] quoted as saying: "I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcitizens.org.au|title=World Citizens Association Australia|work=World Citizens Association Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an increasingly interdependent world, world citizens need a compass to frame their mindsets and create a shared consciousness and sense of global responsibility in world issues such as environmental problems and [[nuclear proliferation]].&lt;ref name = feasible&gt;{{cite journal | last = Altinay| first = Hakan| title= A Global Civics: Necessary?

Baha'i-inspired author Meyjes, while favoring the single world community and emergent global consciousness, warns of globalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter = Language and Universalization: a ‘Linguistic Ecology’ Reading of Bahá’í Writ | first = Gregory Paul | last = Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes) | title = The Journal of Bahá’í Studies | publisher = Association for Bahá’í Studies | series = | volume =Volume IX (1) | year =1999 | location = Ottawa | pages = 51–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a cloak for an expeditious economic, social, and cultural Anglo-dominance that is insufficiently inclusive to inform the emergence of an optimal world civilization. He proposes a process of "[[Universalism#Non-religious Universalism|universalization]]" as an alternative.

[[Cosmopolitanism]] is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single [[community]] based on a shared [[morality]]. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmopolitan|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cosmopolitan?s=t|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations. The cosmopolitan community is one in which individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect. For instance, [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Kwame Anthony Appiah, "Cosmopolitan Patriots," Critical Inquiry 23, no. 3 (Spring, 1997): 617–639.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian philosopher [[Marshall McLuhan]] popularized the term ''[[Global village (term)|Global Village]]'' beginning in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall McLuhan and Bruce R. Powers (17 September 1992) The Global Village: Transformations in World Life and Media in the 21st century .

===International cooperation===
'''Military cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– Past examples of international cooperation exist. One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society. Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see [[START I]], [[START II]], [[START III]], and [[New START]]) and the establishment of [[NATO]]'s Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the [[G8]] Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization. The US–Russian cooperation was further strengthened by anti-terrorism agreements enacted in the wake of 9/11.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/brookings-audit/international-cooperation-stepping-stone-world-government |title=International cooperation as a stepping-stone to a world government &amp;#124; Global Policy Journal – Practitioner, Academic, Global Governance, International Law, Economics, Security, Institutions, Comment &amp; Opinion, Media, Events, Journal |publisher=Global Policy Journal |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental cooperation'''&amp;nbsp;– One of the biggest successes of environmental cooperation has been the agreement to reduce chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions, as specified in the [[Montreal Protocol]], in order to stop ozone depletion. The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do. Thirdly, significant achievements in IC can be observed through development studies.&lt;ref name="globalpolicyjournal1"/&gt;

In ''The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy'', [[Christopher Lasch]] analyzes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/the-treachery-of-the-lites-elite-sense-of-irresponsibility-1610879.html |title=The treachery of the lites Elite sense of irresponsibility |publisher=The Independent |date=1995-03-10 |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the widening gap between the top and bottom of the social composition in the United States. For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations.
Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The de-nationalisation of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as "world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of  national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have "withdrawn from common life".
Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues. 
However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.

D.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D. A., Soule, S. A., &amp; Kriesi, H. (2004). The Blackwell companion to social movements. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most infamous tactics of the movement is the [[Battle of Seattle (1999)|Battle of Seattle]] in 1999, where there were protests against the World Trade Organization's Third Ministerial Meeting. All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8).&lt;ref name="stwr.org"/&gt; Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.

===Opposition to capital market integration===
{{Main|Anti-capitalist movements}}
[[File:Worldbank protest jakarta.jpg|thumb|World Bank Protester, [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]

Capital markets have to do with raising and investing money in various human enterprises.  Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of  Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425–51|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944|registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues  are especially disturbed by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards. Common targets include the [[World Bank]] (WB), [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and [[free trade]] treaties like the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] (FTAA), the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] (MAI) and the [[General Agreement on Trade in Services]] (GATS). In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the "North" in opposition to the developing world's "South").{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Anti-corporatism and anti-consumerism===

[[Corporatism|Corporatist]] ideology, which privileges the rights of corporations ([[Legal personality|artificial or juridical persons]]) over those of [[natural person]]s, is an underlying factor in the recent rapid expansion of global commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2001/09/01/corporatism-goes-global | title=Corporatism Goes Global | author=Ottaway, Marina | journal=Global Governance: A Review of Multilateralism and International Organizations | volume=7 | issue=3 | date=September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there have been an increasing number of books ([[Naomi Klein]]'s 2000 ''[[No Logo]]'', for example) and films (''e.g. [[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' &amp; ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus]]'') popularizing an [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] [[ideology]] to the public.

A related contemporary ideology, [[consumerism]], which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Lived effects of the Contemporary Economy: Globalization, Inequality, and Consumer Society. | author=Storper Michael | journal=Public Culture | year=2000 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=375–409 | doi=10.1215/08992363-12-2-375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of [[consumer education]] into school [[curriculum|curricula]]. Social activists hold materialism is connected to [[Big-box store|global retail merchandizing]] and [[supplier convergence]], [[war]], greed, [[anomie]], [[crime]], environmental degradation, and general social [[malaise]] and discontent.

The global justice movement is the loose collection of individuals and groups—often referred to as a "[[movement of movements]]"—who advocate [[fair trade]] rules and perceive current institutions of global economic integration as problems.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mertes, "A Movement of Movements", New York: Verso, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media. Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are [[anti-globalization]], insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power.&lt;ref&gt;della Porta, D. 2005.

Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face. A few very popular and well known [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs) include: [[War Child (charity)|War Child]], [[Red Cross]], [[Free The Children]] and [[CARE International]]. They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts.

====Social inequality====
{{Main|Social inequality|International inequality}}

The economies of the world have [[Development theory|developed]] unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly [[developing countries]], [[life expectancies]] began to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24835822 | title=How much do you know about the world? | publisher=BBC | date=2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Rosling, Hans| work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally.  Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark. With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind.&lt;ref name="Stiglitz"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/inequality-is-a-choice/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs | title=Inequality is a Choice | date=13 October 2013 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | author=Stiglits Joseph E. | location=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2013, a tiny elite of multibillionaires, 85 to be exact, had amassed wealth equivalent to all the wealth owned by the poorest half (3.5 billion) of the world's total population of 7 billion.&lt;ref name="WEF2014"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GAC_GlobalAgendaOutlook_2014.pdf | title=Outlook on the Global Agenda 2014 | publisher=World Economic Forum | accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of globalization argue that globalization results in weak [[trade union|labor unions]]: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever-growing number of companies in transition weakened labor unions in high-cost areas. Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.&lt;ref name="Hurst E. Charles P.41"/&gt; They also cite an increase in the exploitation of [[child labour|child labor]]: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them. Examples include [[quarry]]ing, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography.&lt;ref name="Edmonds_Pavcni"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pavcnik | first = Nina |date=September 2005 | title = Child Labor in the Global Economy | journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–220 | doi = 10.1257/0895330053147895 | last2 = Pavcnik | first2 = Nina | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women often participate in the workforce in [[precarious work]], including [[export-oriented employment]].  Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]] remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seguino|first1=Stephanie|last2=Grown|first2=Caren|date=November 2006|title=Gender equity and globalization: macroeconomic policy for developing countries|journal=Journal of International Development|volume=18|issue=8|pages=1081–104|doi=10.1002/jid.1295|ref=harv|author-link1=Stephanie Seguino|citeseerx=10.1.1.589.4614}} [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Seguino_GrownGenderEquityandGlobalizationJID.pdf Pdf version – via the World Bank.]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the intersectionality of gender, race, class, and more remain overlooked when assessing the impact of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender, development, and globalization : economics as if all people mattered|last=Lourdes|first=Benería|others=Berik, Günseli,, Floro, Maria|isbn=9780415537483|edition= Second|location=New York|oclc=903247621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a study published by the IMF posited that [[neoliberalism]], the ideological backbone of contemporary globalized capitalism, has been "oversold", with the benefits of neoliberal policies being "fairly difficult to establish when looking at a broad group of countries" and the costs, most significantly higher income inequality within nations, "hurt the level and sustainability of growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Foroohar |first=Rana |date=June 3, 2016 |title=Globalization's True Believers Are Having Second Thoughts|url=http://time.com/4356816/neoliberalism-imf-globalization/|work=TIME|location= |access-date=July 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-global governance===
{{Main|Global governance}}

Beginning in the 1930s, opposition arose to the idea of a world government, as advocated by organizations such as the [[World Federalist Movement]] (WFM). Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Paul. (2006.) ''The Parliament of Man: The Past, Present, and Future of the United Nations.'' New York: Harper Collins. {{ISBN|978-0375501654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent. Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the [[League of Nations]] and, later, the [[United Nations]].

===Environmentalist opposition===
[[File:Madagascar highland plateau.jpg|thumb|[[Deforestation]] of the [[Madagascar]] Highland Plateau has led to extensive [[siltation]] and unstable flows of western [[river]]s.]]
{{Main|Environmentalism}}
{{See also|Global warming|Climate change|Deforestation}}

[[Environmentalism]] is a broad philosophy, ideology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ideology.html |title=Ideology and Sustainability |publisher=Formal.stanford.edu |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ronald Bailey from the February 2002 issue |url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/02/01/debunking-green-myths |title=Debunking Green Myths |publisher=Reason.com |accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gibson. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and social movement regarding concerns for environmental [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as [[global warming]], [[climate change]], global [[water supply]] and [[Water crisis|water crises]], inequity in [[energy consumption]] and [[energy conservation]], transnational [[air pollution]] and pollution of the [[world ocean]], [[overpopulation]], world [[habitat]] [[sustainability]], [[deforestation]], [[biodiversity]] and [[species extinction]].

One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Low, Nicholas. (2002). ''Global Ethics and Environment''. Routledge Science. {{ISBN|978-0415197359}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy. Globalization is thus leading to a type of" environmental [[apartheid]]".&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Frank J., and John Boli. 2012. ''The Globalization Reader'', 4th ed. Wiley-Blackwell. {{ISBN|978-0470655634}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], the director and founder of Local Futures/[[International Society for Ecology and Culture]], criticizes globalization in many ways. In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that "centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization." She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0871566435|edition= Sierra Club Books paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).&lt;ref name="Unmaskingthe"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M. Scott Taylor|title=Unmasking the Pollution Haven Effect|journal=[[International Economic Review]]|year=2008|volume=49|issue=1|pages=223–54|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2354.2008.00478.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices. Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent [[Environmental law|environmental regulations]], and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards.  Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest [[environmental standard]]s or weakest enforcement.

== Food security ==
{{Main|Food security}}
The globalization of food production is associated with a more efficient system of food production. This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions. This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i5160e.pdf|title=Food Security and International Trade Unpacking disputed narratives|last=Clapp|first=J|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
Norway's limited crop range advocates globalization of food production and availability. The northern-most country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met. The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Flaten and Hisano, 2007. Food Security Policy in a Food Importing Country: The Case of Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4535">'''Health systems strengthening''' (also '''health system strengthening''', abbreviated '''HSS''') is a term used in [[global health]] that roughly means to improve the health care system of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/healthsystems/hss_glossary/en/index5.html |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |title=Health Systems Strengthening Glossary |publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this general definition, it can mean increasing funding for health infrastructure, improving health policy, trying to achieve [[universal healthcare]],&lt;ref name="glassman"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Amanda%20Glassman%208-27-13.pdf |title=Conversation with Amanda Glassman on August 27, 2013 |accessdate=June 14, 2016 |last=Glassman |first=Amanda |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or any number of other health measures.

There has been some effort to use a [[systems thinking]] approach to health systems strengthening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hfgproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/New-Perspectives-in-Health-Systems-Strengthening-Executive-Summary.pdf |publisher=USAID |title=New Perspectives in Health Systems Strengthening}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="systems-thinking-book"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44204/1/9789241563895_eng.pdf |title=Systems Thinking for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=World Health Organization |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that use health systems strengthening==

Various health organizations have claimed to use health systems strengthening (while not necessarily agreeing on the definition). Some of these are:

* [[World Health Organization]]
* [[US Agency for International Development]] (USAID, uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report);&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt; USAID states that HSS has been "at the core of [its] mission in health for the last 20 years", and defines HSS as "initiating activities in the six internationally accepted core HSS functions – human resources for health; health finance; health governance; health information; medical products, vaccines, and technologies; and service delivery".&lt;ref name=usaid&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/documents/1864/HSS-Vision.pdf |title=USAID's Vision for Health Systems Strengthening |publisher=USAID |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[GAVI Alliance]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* The [[Global Fund]]&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[PEPFAR]] (though less developed)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Stop TB Partnership]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;
* [[Roll Back Malaria]] (uses different definition from the one in a 2006 Global Fund-commissioned WHO report)&lt;ref name=marchal/&gt;

==Reception==

Both the idea of health systems strengthening and the term itself have received attention.

Even advocates of health systems strengthening admit that it can often seem like a "distant, even abstract aim".&lt;ref name=systems-thinking-book/&gt;

Marchal et al., writing in 2009, called the term "vague" and argued that "most current HSS strategies are selective (i.e., they target a specific disease), and their effects may undermine progress towards the long-term goal of effective, high-quality, and inclusive health systems."&lt;ref name="marchal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000059#s2 |title=Global Health Actors Claim To Support Health System Strengthening—Is This Reality or Rhetoric? |authors=Marchal B, Cavalli A, Kegels G |date=April 28, 2009 |publisher=''[[PLOS Medicine]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://karengrepin.com/2009/04/are-health-system-strengthening-efforts.html |title=Are health system strengthening efforts just hype? |date=April 29, 2009 |author=Karen Grepin |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Berman]], who was the lead health economist at the [[World Bank]], has pointed out that "Almost any support to health interventions can be considered HSS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTHSD/Resources/376278-1114111154043/1011834-1246449110524/062509BermanUnpackingHealthSystemStrengthening.pdf |author=Peter Berman |date=June 2009 |publisher=World Bank |title=Unpacking Health System Strengthening |accessdate=June 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The five dimensions consist of [[ethnoscape]]s, [[mediascape]]s, [[technoscape]]s, [[Financescape|financescapes]], and '''ideoscapes'''. The suffix -''scape'' denotes that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, linguistic, and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: "[[nation-states]], multinationals, diasporic communities, as well as subnational groupings and movements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy|date=1990|publisher=John WIley &amp; Sons, Ltd|pages=1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can either be religious, political, or economic.

The '''Infectious Disease Research Institute''' ('''IDRI''') is a [[non-profit organization]] based in [[Seattle]], in the United States, and which conducts [[global health]] research on [[infectious diseases]].

==History==
IDRI was founded in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idri.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaria vaccine==

On February 2012, IDRI launched the world’s first [[clinical trial]] of the [[visceral leishmaniasis]] vaccine.  The vaccine is a recombinant form of two fused Leishmania parasite proteins with an [[adjuvant]].  Two phase 1 clinical trials with healthy volunteers are to be conducted.  The first one takes place in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and is followed by a trial in [[India]].  The trials are funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiercevaccines.com/story/worlds-first-kala-azar-vaccine-enters-clinic/2012-02-23|title=World’s first kala azar vaccine enters the clinic|author=Elvidge, Suzanne|publisher=FierceVaccines.com|date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 2008 by Nathan Taback, Christina Willie and Robin Coupland, '''Insecurity Insight''' is a [[Geneva]]-based non-profit organisation that has developed the ”Taback-Coupland model of armed violence”, a model that is used to generate data on the impact of armed [[violence]] and insecurity on people's lives and wellbeing with a view to generating preventive policies.

==History==
While working in conflict zones as a [[general surgeon]] treating war wounds (1987-1995), Coupland developed a [[theory]] about armed violence and its effects. The theory states that the effects of use of [[weapons]] on [[health]] have certain identifiable determinants:&lt;ref name=pmid15690624&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/1362369042000315032 |title=Towards Collation and Modelling of the Global Cost of Armed Violence on Civilians |year=2005 |last1=Taback |first1=Nathan |last2=Coupland |first2=Robin |journal=Medicine, Conflict and Survival |volume=21 |pmid=15690624 |pages=19–27 |issue=1}}{{psc|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the victim's vulnerability;
*the [[Lists of weapons|type of weapon]] or weapons used;
*the potential number of weapons in use;
*the psychological aspect of how the violence is perpetrated.

While teaching a course at the [[Harvard School of Public Health]] (2003), Coupland began collaborating with Taback, a statistician with an interest in [[global health]]. Their collaboration involved refining Coupland's original theory and developing the means to make quantifiable the various determinants for a given outcome of armed violence. The result has come to be known as the Taback-Coupland model of armed violence.&lt;ref name="blogspot2007"&gt;{{cite web|last=Insight |first=Disarmament |url=http://disarmamentinsight.blogspot.com/2007/09/analyzing-armed-violence-taback.html |title=Disarmament Insight: Analyzing armed violence: the Taback - Coupland model |publisher=Disarmamentinsight.blogspot.com |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}{{MEDRS|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coupland and Taback later met Wille while she was working for the [[Small Arms Survey]] (2006), and applied the model to map the nature and extent of armed violence on a geographical basis. Willie worked on refining the model further and the structure of the corresponding [[databases]] to allow application of the model to analyze different kinds of violent events. Later Taback, Willie and Coupland founded Insecurity Insight (2008).

==Activities==
The core activity of Insecurity Insight is to promote, use and make available to others the Taback-Coupland model. Because the model can be applied to any act of violence using any weapons resulting in any effect, the model has been applied to subjects such as [[explosion|explosive force]] in populated areas,&lt;ref name="slideshare1"&gt;Action on Armed Violence (2009). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/02-13093711 Explosive Violence: The Problem of Explosive Weapons].”&lt;/ref&gt; attacks on [[journalists]]&lt;ref&gt;Taback, Nathan and Robin Coupland (2006). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/09-13093705 Security of Journalists: Making the Case for Modelling Armed Violence as a Means to Promote Human Security].” Thinking Outside the Box in Multilateral Disarmament and Arms Control Negotiations by John Borrie and Vanessa Martin Randin (eds), 2006, United Nations publication, Sales No.GV.E.06.0.16; pp. 191–206.{{psc|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexual violence]] in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.300.6.653 |title=Sexual Violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo |year=2008 |last1=Taback |first1=N. |last2=Painter |first2=R. |last3=King |first3=B. |journal=JAMA |volume=300 |issue=6 |pmid=18698063 |pages=653–4}}{{psc|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Zimbabwe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Electing to Rape: Sexual Terror in Mugabe's Zimbabwe | publisher=[[AIDS-Free World]] | year=December 2009 | pages=52 | url=http://www.aidsfreeworld.org/Publications-Multimedia/Reports/Electing-to-Rape.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attacks on [[health care workers]] and [[Health care facilities|facilities]].&lt;ref name="slideshare2"&gt;Coupland Robin, Christina Wille, Nathan Taback and Simon Regard, ICRC (2011). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/03-13093712 Sixteen Country Study: Health Care in Danger].”&lt;/ref&gt;

A major ongoing project is the building of the “Security in Numbers Database.” This is a collaborative effort initiated by Insecurity Insight involving a number of major [[International nongovernmental organization|international humanitarian NGOs]]. By taking part in this project, these organisations share their security incidents with Insecurity Insight on a confidential basis; this permits analysis of these incidents by the model and therefore comparison of any single agency’s security issues with what is known globally about aid worker security. This has already generated findings.&lt;ref&gt;Wille, Christina and Larissa Fast (2011). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/06-13093715 Security Facts for Humanitarian Agencies: Aid, Gender and Security: The Gendered Nature of Security Events Affecting Aid Workers and Aid Delivery].”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wille, Christina and Larissa Fast (2010) ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/05-13093714 Is Terrorism an Issue for Humanitarian Agencies?]” Perspectives 3 by the Security Management Initiative.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wille Christina and Larissa Fast (2010). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/07-13093717 Security Facts for Humanitarian Agencies: How do security events affecting humanitarian agencies differ between rural and urban environments?]”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taback-Coupland model of armed violence==
[[File:Taback Coupland.png|thumb|right|400px|The "Taback-Coupland model of armed violence."]]

Based on a standard [[public health]] model, the Taback-Coupland model takes as a starting point that use of weapons has a health impact and that this health impact is amenable to a preventive approach as any other public health issue. By generating data about threats to and vulnerabilities of people’s lives and well-being through violence and weapons, appropriate preventive policies can be proposed.&lt;ref name="blogspot2007"/&gt;

The model is constructed around four “[[risk factors]]” or determinants for any given effects of armed violence. The four determinants are the nature of the weapon, the number of weapons used (or potentially used), the way the weapon is used (the psychological aspect of the violence), and the victims’ vulnerability. An example is the lethality of attacks with [[firearms]]. This will be determined by:

*the kind of firearms (death is more likely if a larger [[caliber|calibre]] weapon is used, because the [[wound]] will be bigger);
*how many firearms are being shot against the victim(s);
*whether the user is standing close to (e.g. 5 metres) or further away (e.g. 200 metres) from the victim(s);
*whether the victim(s) of the attack are cornered, tied up, can run away or take cover.

This example also shows the important interaction at a psychological level between how the weapon is used, the other determinants and perceptions of the potential outcome. (Whether the trigger is pulled to cause a fatal injury is influenced, for example, by whether the user of the firearm believes he or she can hit the victim(s) with it, whether there are others similarly armed, how easy it is to hit the victim(s) in that context, and whether the victim(s) have already been hit.)

===How to use the model===
The method uses written reports of real incidents of armed violence as the source for the necessary values. Information from a report on an individual incident is entered into a spreadsheet specially designed to capture and process information about the people committing violence and about the victim(s) or potential victim(s). In this way, qualitative sources of data about violence i.e., reports, can be fed into a specially prepared relational database; this uses [[binaries]] and surrogates to give a numeric value to determinants such as intent and vulnerability. (For example, for vulnerability: Were the people herded into a confined space before being shot? Yes / No) A “report” can be a very short text as indicated by the following sentence: “Two masked men entered Hospital X last night and shot dead a sleeping patient.” In terms of entry into the database, this can be read as: Two masked men [number of people armed] entered Hospital X [where] last night [when] and shot [weapon (firearms)] dead [outcome] a [outcome] sleeping patient [vulnerability]. ("Shot dead" is also a comment on intent.)

When the database has been fed with a sufficient number of reports of real events about a certain issue, this permits an “evidence-based” dialogue about the perpetrators and their intents and about the victims and their vulnerabilities. Taback and Coupland tested the model using [[global news]] reports about violence in general&lt;ref name=pmid15690624/&gt; and about attacks on journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Taback, Nathan and Robin Coupland (2006). ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/09-13093705 Security of Journalists: Making the Case for Modelling Armed Violence as a Means to Promote Human Security].”{{psc|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They went further and termed such an approach “the science of human security.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/13623690601084518 |title=The science of human security |year=2007 |last1=Taback |first1=Nathan |last2=Coupland |first2=Robin |journal=Medicine, Conflict and Survival |volume=23 |pmid=17370855 |pages=3–9 |issue=1}}{{psc|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All important limitations of the data gathering method based on the model relate to the completeness and accuracy of the qualitative reports which are fed into the model. However, as Taback and Coupland have pointed out, reports, especially media reports may be the only information available about a given context or form of violence in multiple contexts. It is nevertheless possible to generate policy-relevant quantitative data from such sources. Further, they point out that while there are international surveillance systems for monitoring [[outbreak|infectious disease outbreaks]], no such system exists (yet) to evaluate on a regular basis the effects of armed violence on peoples’ lives. With that in mind, the method developed by Taback and Coupland is a useful contribution to international efforts to enhance [[human security]], including in [[disarmament]].&lt;ref name="blogspot2007"/&gt;

===Use of the Taback-Coupland model===
The model has generated original and policy-relevant data in relation to subjects such as explosive force in populated areas,&lt;ref name="slideshare1"/&gt; and sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Aids-Free World. (2009) ”[http://www.slideshare.net/insecurityinsight/04-13093713 Electing to Rape: Sexual Terror in Mugabe's Zimbabwe].”&lt;/ref&gt; A major study involving analysis of 655 attacks on health care workers and facilities was commissioned by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC);&lt;ref name="slideshare2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.d4671 |title=Delivering healthcare in situations of conflict or violence |year=2011 |last1=Nathanson |first1=V. |journal=BMJ |volume=343 |pages=d4671 |pmid=21831934}}&lt;/ref&gt; its publication marked the launch of the ICRC’s “Health Care in Danger” project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/icrc/d/70209252-Red-Cross-Red-Crescent-Magazine-No-2-2011 Red Cross, Red Crescent Magazine.

The '''Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation''' ('''IHME''') is a research institute working in the area of [[global health]] statistics and impact evaluation at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle. The Institute is headed by Dr. [[Christopher J.L. Murray]], a physician and health economist, and professor at the [[University of Washington Department of Global Health]], which is part of the [[School of Medicine]]. IHME's goal, as stated on the Institute's website, is "to identify the best strategies to build a healthier world. By measuring health, tracking program performance, finding ways to maximize health system impact, and developing innovative measurement systems, IHME provides a foundation for informed decision-making that ultimately will lead to better health globally" IHME (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute for Heath Metrics and Evaluation|url=http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/research|accessdate=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IHME conducts research and trains scientists, policymakers, and the public in health metrics concepts, methods, and tools. Its mission includes judging the effectiveness and efficacy of health initiatives and national health systems. IHME's work seeks to be complementary to the [[United Nations]]' work in the [[World Health Organization]] in that it shares many tasks but is independent from member countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNiel|first1=Donal|title=Gates Foundation's Influence Criticized|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/16/science/16malaria.html?_r=0|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=New York Times|date=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2008_doughton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doughton|first1=Sandi|title=Seattle institute aims to help cure world-health data disorder|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/seattle-institute-aims-to-help-cure-world-health-data-disorder/|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=Seattle Times|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IHME gathers health-related data from all available sources. It develops innovative analytical tools to track trends in mortality, diseases, and risk factors, and capsulizes many of its research findings in data visualizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Visualizations|url=http://www.healthdata.org/results/data-visualizations|website=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It evaluates interventions such as vaccines, malaria control policies, cancer screenings, and birth care. To enable researchers to replicate IHME's work and to foster new research, IHME created the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) where methods and results are cataloged and freely accessible. IHME is also committed to expanding the field of health metrics by training students at the post-baccalaureate and post-graduate levels.

==History==

IHME was launched in June 2007 based on a core grant of $105 million primarily funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paulson|first1=Tom|title=$105 million Gates gift helps start global health center|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/105-million-Gates-gift-helps-start-global-1239473.php|accessdate=9 May 2010|publisher=Seattle PI|date=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its earliest projects was to produce new estimates of mortality rates, which were published in ''The Lancet'' in September 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=CJL|last2=Laakso|first2=T|last3=Shibuya|first3=K|last4=Lopez|first4=AD|title=Can we achieve Millennium Development Goal 4?

==Research==
IHME also has launched policy reports on a wide range of topics, including a June 2010 report on child and maternal mortality. The findings were updated in 2014. In 2009, IHME launched its series of Financing Global Health policy reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ravishankar|first1=N|last2=Gubbins|first2=P|last3=Cooley|first3=RJ|last4=Leach-Kemon|first4=K|last5=Michaud|first5=CM|last6=Jamison|first6=DT|last7=Murray|first7=CJL|title=Financing of global health: tracking development assistance for health from 1990 to 2007|journal=The Lancet|date=20 June 2009|volume=373|pages=2113–2124|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(09)60881-3|pmid=19541038}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lu|first1=C|last2=Schneider|first2=MT|last3=Gubbins|first3=P|last4=Leach-Kemon|first4=K|last5=Jamison|first5=D|last6=Murray|first6=CJL|title=Public financing of health in developing countries: a cross-national systematic analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=17 April 2010|volume=375|pages=1375–1387|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60233-4|pmid=20381856}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial report led to meetings with staff from the US House Foreign Affairs Committee and with a task force appointed by US President Barack Obama to guide the funding of his new Global Health Initiative.

In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2010, a worldwide consortium of 500 researchers, coordinated by IHME measured the impact of more than 290 health conditions and 67 health risk factors worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The story of GBD 2010: a "super-human" effort|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2962174-6/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62174-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GBD enterprise produced estimates in 21 regions around the world for disability-adjusted life years by age and sex for the past two decades. Part of this research has involved conducting in-person surveys in several countries and gathering health information through a website survey. The team created a cause of death database that includes 60 years of data, or almost 800 million deaths. To illustrate the findings, IHME released a suite of interactive data visualizations, which are available to the public.

The aim is to allow policymakers and other decision-makers to "compare the effects of different diseases – such as cancer versus depression – that kill people prematurely and cause ill health," to show disease trends over time, and to inform policy, IHME states on its website.

It has been labeled "the most comprehensive review of the state of humanity's health ever undertaken."&lt;ref name="2013_doughton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doughton|first1=Sandi|title=Gates, UW teaming up on massive health study|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/gates-uw-teaming-up-on-massive-health-study/ |accessdate=January 27, 2017 |publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]'' |date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK and China are among the countries working with IHME to generate subnational burden of disease estimates at the county and province levels.

In January 2014, IHME began releasing updates to the work, called the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study 2013. The work generated over 1 billion estimates of health outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GBD History|url=http://www.healthdata.org/gbd/about/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; GBD estimates are now being updated annually.

Some of the findings have been controversial. In 2012, IHME researchers estimated 1.2 million people died from malaria in 2010, double the WHO's estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New estimates of malaria deaths: concern and opportunity|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2960169-X/fulltext|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60169-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelland|first1=Kate|title=Analysis: Health by numbers: A statistician's challenge|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-statistics-idUSBRE84D0KD20120514 |accessdate=January 25, 2017|agency=Reuters|date=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease Control Priorities Network===

{{further|Disease Control Priorities Project}}

The Disease Control Priorities Network project generates cost-effectiveness estimates for a range of health interventions. A team of demographers, statisticians, economists, and other experts are studying how to improve the allocation of resources among interventions, technologies, hospitals, and other service delivery platforms. They are working in multiple countries, including the US, India, and South Africa.
Their cost-effectiveness work has revealed some hidden connections. For example, a 2010 report showed improving girls' education in poor countries is the most effective way to reduce child mortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gakidou|first1=E|last2=Cowling|first2=K|last3=Lozano|first3=R|last4=Murray|first4=CJL|title=Increased educational attainment and its effect on child mortality in 175 countries between 1970 and 2009: a systematic analysis|journal=The Lancet|date=18 September 2010|volume=376|pages=959–974|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61257-3|pmid=20851260}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 February 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which was a surprise for some people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paulson|first1=Paul|title=Number crunchers say the evidence is: Transparency strengthens global health|url=http://www.humanosphere.org/basics/2011/06/number-crunchers-say-the-evidence-is-transparency-strengthens-global-health/|publisher=NPR Humanosphere|accessdate=30 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An effort launched in 2011 called Access, Bottlenecks, Costs, and Equity (ABCE) involves collecting evidence and analyzing data to improve the cost-effectiveness and equity of health systems in Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Lebanon, Uganda, and Zambia. The project examines four components that affect health care delivery: access (to health facilities), bottlenecks (limitations on the supply side), costs, and equity (across populations). The work includes in-depth facility surveys and inventories across a range of service delivery platforms; additional data is collected in countries with high HIV/AIDS burdens through exit interviews and chart extraction.

A 2013 report concluded that neonatal and maternal mortality in Ghana could be best improved not with sophisticated maternity care but with better transportation infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Travel time to maternity care and its effect on utilization in rural Ghana: a multilevel analysis|url=http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/travel-time-maternity-care-and-its-effect-utilization-rural-ghana-multilevel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population Health Metrics Research Consortium project===
The Population Health Metrics Research Consortium created new methods for tracking health intervention coverage in low-resource settings. The methods have been used to measure mortality, causes of death, and incidence of major illnesses where data are incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population Health Metrics Research Consortium gold standard verbal autopsy validation study: design, implementation, and development of analysis datasets|url=https://www.healthdata.org/research-article/population-health-metrics-research-consortium-gold-standard-verbal-autopsy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers collected data in India, Mexico, the Philippines, and Tanzania.

IHME's work on estimating mortality has been at times controversial. In 2009, IHME published a study on maternal mortality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogan|first1=MC|last2=Foreman|first2=KJ|last3=Naghavi|first3=M|last4=Ahn|first4=SY|last5=Wang|first5=M|last6=Makela|first6=SM|last7=Lozano|first7=R|last8=Lopez|first8=AD|last9=Murray|first9=CJL|title=Maternal mortality for 181 countries, 1980-2008: a systematic analysis of progress towards Millennium Development Goal 5|journal=The Lancet|date=8  May 2010|volume=375|pages=1609–1623|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)60518-1|pmid=20382417}}&lt;/ref&gt; which some advocacy groups tried to suppress – worried that results showing a decline in mortality would make it harder to fund-raise. The WHO also initially disagreed with the new results, but later revised their estimates in agreement with those of IHME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paulson|first1=Tom|title=Number crunchers say the evidence is: Transparency strengthens global health|url=http://www.humanosphere.org/basics/2011/06/number-crunchers-say-the-evidence-is-transparency-strengthens-global-health/|publisher=NPR Humanosphere|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malaria Control Policy Assessment project===

The Malaria Control Policy Assessment project evaluates the effectiveness of malaria-control interventions in Uganda and Zambia by analyzing their effect on child mortality and producing estimates at the national and local levels.

===United States public health research===

IHME conducts US research, including estimates of mortality, life expectancy, risk factors, health disparities, and disease prevalence. IHME has compiled national and local health trends and integrated multiple data sources to monitor disparities in chronic diseases.

A 2013 report, the State of US Health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of US Health: Innovations, Insights, and Recommendations from the Global Burden of Disease Study|url=http://www.healthdata.org/policy-report/state-us-health-innovations-insights-and-recommendations-global-burden-disease-study|website=IHME}}&lt;/ref&gt; looked at trends in premature deaths due to injury or disease, and demonstrated the major health threat stemming from behavioral risk factors such as poor diet and sedentary lifestyles. It concluded that dietary factors cause more deaths each year than cancer or smoking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The State of US Health, 1990-2010 Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors|journal=JAMA|date=10 July 2013|volume=310|url=http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1710486|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.13805|pages=591–608|pmid=23842577|pmc=5436627 | last1 = Murray | first1 = CJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results included life expectancy trends broken down by state and county.

First Lady Michelle Obama cited the research in her campaign to improve Americans' diets and increase their level of physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthy Diet Important For Increasing Years of Healthy Life, New Study Says|url=http://www.letsmove.gov/blog/2013/07/11/healthy-diet-important-increasing-years-healthy-life-new-study-says}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper published in the journal Population Health Metrics in June 2011 showed that life expectancy was rising in some poorer US counties – especially in the South&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kulkarni|first1=SC|last2=Levin-Rector|first2=A|last3=Ezzati Murray CJL.|first3=M|last4=Murray|first4=CJL|title=Falling behind: life expectancy in US counties from 2000 to 2007 in an international context|journal=Population Health Metrics|date=15 June 2011|url=http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/content/9/1/16|doi=10.1186/1478-7954-9-16|volume=9|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a surprising result which was widely discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pallarito|first1=Karen|title=Life expectancy in U.S. trails top nations|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/15/life.expectancy.united.states/|accessdate=28 February 2015|publisher=CNN|date=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research projects include the Salud Mesoamérica 2015 Initiative, which focuses on inequalities in health outcomes and access in southern Mexico and Central America; Gavi Full Country Evaluations, which evaluates immunization programs in Bangladesh, India, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia; and HealthRise, a partnership with Medtronic Philanthropy to evaluate programs targeting diabetes and heart disease, and sponsor small grants to make improvements.

In 2014, IHME announced the establishment of the University of Washington Center for Demography and Economics of Aging, funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA). It is one of 14 NIA Demography Centers at leading universities and policy organizations around the United States.

===Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx)===

In March 2011, IHME launched the Global Health Data Exchange (or GHDx), which indexes and hosts information about microdata, aggregated data, and research results with a focus on health-related and demographic datasets. At launch, the site listed about 1,000 datasets; as of 2015, there are more than 30,000. As part of a partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), GHDx includes 35 years of CDC data on child and maternal health. GHDx uses the Drupal 7 open source content management system and Apache SOLR for search. The site includes visualization and GIS tools, and has been noted by the health and global health communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Dam|first1=Andrew|title=Institute launches global health data clearinghouse|url=http://healthjournalism.org/blog/2011/04/institute-launches-global-health-data-clearinghouse/|publisher=Association of Health Care Journalists|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Degree Programs==
IHME offers two types of global health fellowships, plus master's degrees and PhD programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Programs in Health Metrics and Evaluation|url=http://www.healthdata.org/get-involved/degree-programs|website=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation|publisher=University of Washington|accessdate=27 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funders==
IHME receives core grant funding from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paulson|first1=Tom|title=$105 million Gates' gift helps start global health center|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/105-million-Gates-gift-helps-start-global-1239473.php|accessdate=27 February 2015|publisher=Seattle PI|date=4 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the state of Washington. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); Inter-American Development Bank; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health; Medtronic Philanthropy; and the National Institute on Aging have also contributed funding through project grants and contracts.

==Reception==

Initially, some within the [[World Health Organization]] had criticized IHME for trying to do the work that WHO already does. There had also been tension between [[UNICEF]] and IHME because a report from the latter showed "lackluster progress" on child death rates.&lt;ref name="2008_doughton" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2017_doughton" /&gt;

The 2010 Global Burden of Disease report was criticized for its lack of transparency of methods and data as well as its use of complex statistical methods to fill in data gaps when reliable statistics were unavailable. Thomas Bollyky, a senior fellow at the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], called for more transparency. The report was also criticized for its use of [[Verbal autopsy|verbal autopsies]] because many diseases have similar symptoms, leading to potential mistakes.&lt;ref name="2013_doughton" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthdata.org/verbal-autopsy |title=Verbal Autopsy (VA) |publisher=Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Igor Rudan and Kit Yee Chan argue that the emergence of IHME introduced competition to the field of global health metrics, which was previously a field where WHO maintained a monopoly: "The GBD initiative has emerged as a well-organised and rapidly growing collaboration that is now seriously challenging WHO's role in generating global health estimates".&lt;ref name="2014_rudan"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3406781/RudanComment2013GBD.pdf |first1=Igor |last1=Rudan |first2=Kit Yee |last2=Chan |title=Global health metrics needs collaboration and competition |date=December 18, 2014 |accessdate=January 27, 2017 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)62006-7 |journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=385 |pages=92–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudan and Chan also note that IHME "struggled to generate support, legitimacy, and acceptable for their findings" after publishing the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study, due to concerns of lack of transparency, as well as the existence of parallel estimates of disease burden from WHO.&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;

The World Health Organization did not acknowledge the GBD 2010 estimates.&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2017_doughton" /&gt;

The Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2013 expanded collaboration and increased transparency but "[fell] short of allowing full independent replication of all results".&lt;ref name="2014_rudan" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25198">An '''intergovernmental organization''' or '''international governmental organisation''' ('''IGO''') is an [[organization]] composed primarily of [[sovereign state]]s (referred to as ''[[member state]]s''), or of other intergovernmental organizations. Intergovernmental organizations are  called [[international organization]]s, although that term may also include [[international non-governmental organization]] such as international [[nonprofit organization]]s or [[multinational corporation]]s.
 
Intergovernmental organizations are an important aspect of [[public international law]]. IGOs are established by a treaty that acts as a [[charter]] creating the group. Treaties are formed when lawful representatives (governments) of several states go through a [[ratification]] process, providing the IGO with an international [[legal personality]].

Intergovernmental organizations in a legal sense should be distinguished from simple groupings or coalitions of states, such as the [[G8]] or the [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]]. Such groups or associations have not been founded by a constituent document and exist only as [[task force|task group]]s.

Intergovernmental organizations must also be distinguished from treaties. Many treaties (such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], or the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] before the establishment of the [[World Trade Organization]]) do not establish an organization and instead rely purely on the parties for their administration becoming legally recognized as an ''[[ad hoc]]'' commission. Other treaties{{which|date=March 2016}} have established an administrative apparatus which was not deemed to have been granted international legal personality.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

==Types and purpose==
Intergovernmental organizations differ in function, membership, and membership criteria. They have various goals and scopes, often outlined in the treaty or [[charter]]. Some IGOs developed to fulfill a need for a neutral forum for debate or negotiation to resolve disputes. Others developed to carry out mutual interests with unified aims to preserve peace through [[conflict resolution]] and better [[international relations]], promote international cooperation on matters such as [[List of supranational environmental agencies|environmental protection]], to promote [[human rights]], to promote [[Social change|social development]] (education, [[health care]]), to render [[humanitarian aid]], and to [[economic development]]. Some are more general in scope (the United Nations) while others may have subject-specific missions (such as Interpol or the [[International Organization for Standardization]] and other [[standards organization]]s). Common types include:

* Worldwide or global organizations - generally open to nations worldwide as long as certain criteria are met. This category includes the [[United Nations]] (UN) and its specialized agencies, the [[Universal Postal Union]], [[Interpol]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), the [[World Customs Organization]] (WCO), and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). It also includes globally operating intergovernmental organisations that are not an agency of the UN, including for example the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]], a globally operating intergovernmental organisation based in [[The Hague]] that pursues the progressive unification of [[Conflict of laws|private international law]].
* Cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical organizations - open to members based on some cultural, linguistic, ethnic, religious, or historical link. Examples include the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Arab League]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]], [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], [[Turkic Council]], [[International Organization of Turkic Culture]],  [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], and [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS).
* Economic organizations - based on economic organization. Some are dedicated to [[free trade]] and the reduction of trade barrier, e.g. [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], [[International Chamber of Commerce]]. Others are focused on [[International Development Research Centre|international development]]. International [[cartel]]s, such as [[OPEC]], also exist. The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) was founded as an economics-focused organization. An example of a recently formed economic IGO is the [[Bank of the South]].
* Educational organizations - centered around tertiary level study. [[Academy of European Law]] offers training in European law to lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors, in-house counsel and academics. [[EUCLID (university)]] chartered as a university and umbrella organization dedicated to sustainable development in signatory countries and [[United Nations University]] efforts to resolve the pressing global problems that are the concern of the United Nations, its Peoples and Member States.
* Health and Population Organizations- based on the common perceived health and population goals and to address those challenges collectively. An example is the intergovernmental partnership for population and development [http://www.partners-popdev.org/ Partners in Population and Development].
* [[Regional organization]]s - open to members from a particular continent region or other specific region of the world. This category includes the [[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CLACS), [[Council of Europe]] (CoE), [[European Union]] (EU), [[Eurasian Economic Union]] (EAEU), [[Energy Community]], [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[African Union]] (AU), [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS), [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), Islamic Development Bank, [[Union of South American Nations]], [[Asia Cooperation Dialogue]] (ACD), [[Pacific Islands Forum]], and the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS)
[[Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD).

==History==
While treaties, [[Political alliance|alliances]], and [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] conferences had existed for centuries, IGOs only began to be established in the 19th century. Among the first were the [[Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine]], initiated in the aftermath of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the International Telegraph Union (the future [[International Telecommunication Union]]), which was founded by the signing of the International Telegraph Convention by 20 countries in May 1865. Of notable significance was the emergence of the [[League of Nations]] following World War One, designed as an institution to foster collective security in order to sustain peace.

==Expansion and growth==
Held and McGrew (2002) counted thousands of IGOs worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;Held and McGrew, 2002: Introduction, pp. 1-21&lt;/ref&gt; and this number continues to rise. This increase may be attributed to globalization, which increases and encourages the cooperation among and within states. Globalization has also provided easier means for IGO growth, as a result of increased international relations. This is seen economically, politically, militarily, as well as on the domestic level. Economically, IGOs gain material and non-material resources for economic prosperity. IGOs also provide more political stability within the state and among differing states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lundgren|first=Magnus|year=2016|title=Which type of international organizations can settle civil wars?|journal=Review of International Organizations|volume=12|issue=4|pages=613–641|doi=10.1007/s11558-016-9253-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military alliances are also formed by establishing common standards in order to ensure security of the members to ward off outside threats. Lastly, the formation has encouraged autocratic states to develop into democracies in order to form an effective and internal government.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Megan. "The Expansion of International Organizations" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Hilton Chicago and the Palmer House Hilton, Chicago, IL, Sep 02, 2004 &lt;Not Available&gt;. 2009-05-26 [http://www.allacademic.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125043303/http://www.allacademic.com/ |date=2009-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation and involvement==
There are several different reasons a state may choose membership in an intergovernmental organization. But there are also reasons membership may be rejected. These reasons are explored in the sections below.

Reasons for participation:
# Economic rewards: In the case of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), many different countries receive economic benefits from membership in the free trade agreement. For example, Mexican companies are given better access to [[United States|U.S.]] markets due to their membership.
# Political influence: Smaller countries, such as [[Portugal]] and [[Belgium]], who do not carry much political clout on the international stage, are given a substantial increase in influence through membership in IGOs, such as the [[European Union]]. Also for countries with more influence such as [[France]] and [[Germany]] they are beneficial as the nation increases influence in the smaller countries' internal affairs and expanding other nations dependence on themselves, so to preserve allegiance 
# Security: Membership in an IGO such as [[NATO]] gives security benefits to member countries. This provides an arena where political differences can be resolved.
# Improve democracy and the likelihood of democratic survival: It has been noted that member countries experience a greater degree of democracy and those democracies survive longer.
 
Reasons for rejecting membership:
# Loss of [[sovereignty]]: Membership often comes with a loss of state sovereignty as treaties are signed which require cooperation on the part of all member states.
# Insufficient benefits: Often membership does not bring about substantial enough benefits to warrant membership in the organization.

==Privileges and immunities==
Intergovernmental organizations are provided with privileges and immunities that are intended to ensure their independent and effective functioning. They are specified in the treaties that give rise to the organization (such as the [[Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations]] and the [[Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court]]), which are normally supplemented by further multinational agreements and national regulations (for example the [[International Organizations Immunities Act]] in the United States). The organizations are thereby immune from the jurisdiction of national courts.

Rather than by national jurisdiction, legal [[accountability]] is intended to be ensured by legal mechanisms that are internal to the intergovernmental organization itself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Parish | first = Matthew | title = An essay on the accountability of international organizations | journal = International Organizations Law Review | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 277–342 | doi= 10.1163/157237410X543332 | ssrn = 1651784 | date = 2010 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and access to administrative tribunals. In the course of many court cases where private parties tried to pursue claims against international organizations, there has been a gradual realization  that alternate means of dispute settlement are required, as states have [[fundamental human rights]] obligations to provide plaintiffs with access to court in view of their [[right to a fair trial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Heitz | first = André | title = UN Special number 645 | url = http://www.unspecial.org/UNS645/t32en.html | quote = The French court said… The right to a day in court prevails over jurisdictional immunity | date = November 2005 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019071051/http://www.unspecial.org/UNS645/t32en.html | archivedate = 2013-10-19 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shadow"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reinisch |first1=August |last2=Weber |first2=Ulf Andreas |title=In the shadow of Waite and Kennedy – the jurisdictional immunity of international organizations, the individual's right of access to the courts and administrative tribunals as alternative means of dispute settlement |journal=International Organizations Law Review |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=59–110 |doi=10.1163/1572374043242330 |date=2004 |ref=harv }} [http://zsu-schmelz.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/int_beziehungen/Personal/Publikationen_Reinisch/waite_kennedy_iolr_2004.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019171912/http://zsu-schmelz.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/int_beziehungen/Personal/Publikationen_Reinisch/waite_kennedy_iolr_2004.pdf |date=2013-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77}} Otherwise, the organizations' immunities may be put in question in national and international courts.&lt;ref name="Shadow" /&gt;{{rp|72}} Some organizations hold proceedings before tribunals relating to their organization to be confidential, and in some instances have threatened disciplinary action should an employee disclose any of the relevant information. Such confidentiality has been criticized as a lack of [[Transparency (social)|transparency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brettonwoodslaw.com/the-success-of-which-we-cannot-speak/ The success of which we cannot speak] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019133530/http://www.brettonwoodslaw.com/the-success-of-which-we-cannot-speak/ |date=2013-10-19 }}, brettonwoodlaw.com, 11 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strengths and weaknesses==
{{refimprove|date=April 2017}}
These are some of the strengths and weaknesses of IGOs:

Strengths:
# They hold state authority.
# Their institutions are permanent.
# They provide a forum for discussion.
# They are issue specific.
# They provide information.
# They allow multilateral cooperation.

Weaknesses:
# Membership is limited. Prohibits the membership of private citizens. This makes IGOs undemocratic. In addition, not all IGOs allow universal membership.
# IGOs often overlap resulting in a complex network.
# States have to give up part of their sovereignty, which weakens the state's ability to assert its authority.
# Inequality among state members creates biases and can lead powerful states to misuse these organizations.

They can be deemed unfair as countries with a higher percentage voting power have the right to veto any decision that is not in their favor, leaving the smaller countries powerless.

'''International education''' refers to a dynamic concept that involves a journey or movement of people, minds, or ideas across political and cultural frontiers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moran Hansen|first=Holly|date=2002|title=Defining international education|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/he.41|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|language=en|volume=2002|issue=117|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/he.41|issn=0271-0560}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is facilitated by the [[globalization]] phenomenon, which increasingly erases the constraints of geography on economic, social and cultural arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook on Globalization and Higher Education|last=King|first=Roger|last2=Marginson|first2=Simon|last3=Naidoo|first3=Rajani|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781848445857|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept involves a broad range of learning, covering, for instance, [[Formal learning|formal education]] and [[informal learning]] (e.g. training, [[Student exchange program|exchange programs]], [[cross-cultural communication]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annual Review of Comparative and International Education 2017|last=Wiseman|first=Alexander|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781787437661|location=Bingley, WA|pages=211-212}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could also involve a reorientation of academic outlook such as the pursuit of “worldmindedness” as a goal so that a school or its academic focus is considered [[International school|international]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities|National Association of State Universities]] prescribes the adoption of "proper education" that reflects the full range of international, social, political, cultural, and economic dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management (ETEEEM 2014), Hong Kong, 15-16 November 201|last=Tan|first=Deyao|publisher=CRC Press|year=2015|isbn=9781138027800|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The emergence of international education as a discipline may be attributed to the international and intercontinental initiatives of the past, which aimed to achieve education, learning, and intellectual exchange. This is demonstrated in the formalized academic relations between countries in the form of bilateral and scientific agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of International Education and Development|last=McGrath|first=Simon|last2=Gu|first2=Qing|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780415747547|location=Oxon|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, international education is considered a mechanism of international cooperation and, in some cases, it stems from the recognition that different cultures offer different outlooks and styles of learning and teaching in addition to the transfer of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhancing Asia-Europe Co-operation Through Educational Exchange|last=Wessala|first=Georg|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9780415481946|location=Oxon|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are scholars who associate the development of international education with [[comparative education]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Education: The Dialectic of the Global and the Local|last=Arnove|first=Robert|last2=Torres|first2=Carlos Alberto|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2007|isbn=0742559858|location=Lanham, MD|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is concerned with the evaluation and scrutiny of different educational systems in various countries for the purpose of developing an education and educational structures that are global in scope and application. This concept is considered ancient, having been used in [[classical Greece]], while the actual term was first used by [[William Russell (educator)|William Russell]] in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Handbook of Comparative Education|last=Cowen|first=Robert|last2=Kazamias|first2=Andreas|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9781402064029|location=Dordrecht|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; International education diverged from it as it assumed the form of more organized programs that bring together learners and teachers from different countries to learn from each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Definitions ==
International education can be seen as developing ‘international-mindedness,’ or enhancing international attitude and awareness &lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cambridge *|first=James|last2=Thompson|first2=Jeff|date=2004|title=Internationalism and globalization as contexts for international education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0305792042000213994|journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=161–175|doi=10.1080/0305792042000213994|issn=0305-7925|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. From an ideological perspective, international education has a focus on moral development, by influencing the creation of “positive attitudes towards peace, international understanding and responsible world citizenship”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

From a pragmatic approach, international education can relate to economic and cultural globalization&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. For instance, there are increasing demands for education qualifications to be transferable between schools and education systems&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. Furthermore, there is a “spread of global quality standards through quality assurances procedures such as accreditation”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

Overall, international education can be viewed as the following:  

* Promoting international understanding/international-mindedness and/or global awareness/understanding&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Being active in global engagement/global or world citizenship&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tate|first=Nicholas|date=2013|title=International education in a post-Enlightenment world|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|journal=Educational Review|language=en|volume=65|issue=3|pages=253–266|doi=10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|issn=0013-1911|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increasing intercultural understanding and respect for difference&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Encouraging tolerance and commitment to peace &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Direct examples of international education include facilitating students’ entry into universities outside of their home countries&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayden|first=Mary|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shona|date=2018-02-06|title=International education: the transformative potential of experiential learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=403–413|doi=10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|issn=0305-4985|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, temporarily studying abroad is another illustration of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Program is seen as an influence in the development of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. The IB Diploma Program encourages students to learn and understand different cultures, languages, and points of view&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. This idea is incorporated into elements of the program e.g. Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. CAS requires students to participate in activities promoting each of these three components. Through such activities, the intention is that global issues will affect students’ understanding of the world in a meaningful way&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Specifically, these non-formal, non-academic experiences should enhance students’ comprehension of world issues in a manner that, for instance, reading books or participating in lessons may not &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Based on student engagement and involvement, two general meanings emerge. The first refers to education that transcends national borders through the exchange of people. A good example would be students traveling to study at an [[international branch campus]], as part of a [[study abroad]] program or as part of a [[student exchange program]].{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} The second is a comprehensive approach to education that intentionally prepares students to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}}

The [[International Baccalaureate]] however, defines the term according to a certain criteria. This criteria include the development of citizens of the world in accordance with culture, language, and social cohesion, building a sense of identity and cultural awareness, encrypting recognition and development of universal human values, encouraging discovery and enjoyment of learning, equipping students with collectivist or individualistic skills and knowledge that can be applied broadly, fostering global thinking when responding to local situations, encourage diversity and flexibility in teaching pedagogic methodologies, and supply appropriate forms of assessment and international benchmarking.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

While definitions vary, '''international education''' is generally taken{{By whom|date=June 2018}} to include:
* Knowledge of other world regions &amp; cultures;
* Familiarity with international and [[global studies|global issues]];
* Skills in working effectively within global or cross-cultural environments, and using information from different sources around the world;
* Ability to communicate in multiple languages; and
* Dispositions towards respect and concern for other cultures and peoples.

==Millennium Development Goals==
One of the eight [[Millennium Development Goals|millennium development goals]] ratified in the [[United Nations]] in the year 2000, focuses on achieving universal primary education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wysokińska|first=Zofia|date=March 2017|title=Millennium Development Goals/UN and Sustainable Development Goals/UN as Instruments for Realizing Sustainable Development Concept in the Global Economy|url=https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dbth%26AN%3d121741476%26site%3deds-live|journal=Comparative Economic Research|volume=20|pages=101-118|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;. {{non sequitur|date=June 2018}}

* improve access to complete, free schooling of good quality for all primary school-age children
* greatly increase learning opportunities for youth and adults
* improve adult literacy rates by 50%
* eliminate gender disparities in schooling
* improve all aspects of education quality. 

== Sustainable Development Goals ==
At the end of 2015, the United Nations led another initiative to continue on the work of development goals. [[Sustainable Development Goals|The Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) contains 17 global goals, which are more extensive than the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millenium Development Goals]] (MDGs). Compared to the 2015 MDGs, the SDGs tries to ensure that no one is left behind. In this regard, not only state actors, but also major private “non-state” actors and multinational companies are involved and active in global education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ei-ie.org/en/detail_page/4918/sustainable-development-goals|title=Sustainable Development Goals : Education International|last=International|first=Education|work=Education International|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is stated under Goal 4 of the SDGs: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, SDGs promote international education through some of the following targets:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* “By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity, and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development” (Target 4.7)

According to a report from the U.N. Secretary-General on “Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals” in 2018, [[official development assistance]] (ODA) for scholarships amounted to $1.2 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Progress Towards the Sustainable Development Goals (English)|first=United Nations|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council|year=2018|isbn=|location=New York|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest contributors were Australia, France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=The World|date=2015-12-01|title=Incheon declaration : education 2030 - towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/167341467987876458/Incheon-declaration-education-2030-towards-inclusive-and-equitable-quality-education-and-lifelong-learning-for-all|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education is a core aspect of the SDGs, and considered essential to their success.

''See also'' [[Comparative education]]; and [[Liberalism]], [[Realism (international relations)|Realism]], [[Power Transition Theory]], [[International Development]], as focus areas that provide insight into international phenomena relevant to "International Education."

There are different lenses international education can be viewed as. For example, thinking of international education in terms of a study abroad program that can help prepare students when looking for international occupations. Another example can be that international development is a focal point that is taught in colleges and universities under the umbrella of international education.

== Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) ==
Although very successful programs such as [[Engineers Without Borders]]{{Example needed |s|date=June 2018}} enable students in one country to obtain an international education while working on [[open source appropriate technology]] projects abroad, the cost of this approach can be prohibitive for large scale replication. Recent, work has shown that using a virtual educational exchange, can have many of the positive benefits associated with international education and cross cultural experiences, without the prohibitive costs of overseas programs.&lt;ref&gt;Augusta Abrahamse, Mathew Johnson, Nanette Levinson, Larry Medsker, Joshua M.

==International Education Week==
International Education Week is held in the United States by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Education.  The choice of week for celebration is determined at each institution, but is generally the week before the week that includes [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. Thanksgiving]]: {{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}.&lt;ref name="DOS-week"&gt;[http://eca.state.gov/programs-initiatives/international-education-week United States Department of State: International Education Week]&lt;/ref&gt;  The aims of this event are to provide an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of international education and global exchange.This joint initiative promotes programs that prepare Americans for a global milieu and attract future leaders from abroad to study, learn and exchange experiences in the U.S. This shows how International education is not just about physically crossing borders, but is also about thinking globally in local situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iew.state.gov International Education Week 2010].

==Challenges Facing International education==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=December 2017}}
International education has a somewhat unusual position in higher education.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} While recognized as an important sphere of activity, it tends to be handled by administrative offices at the top of departments of languages and literature and international affairs. The scholars involved in international education usually have their primary involvement in other teaching and research.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} This leads to four distinctive characteristics particular to the field of international education:&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, William.ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education Washington DC. Current Challenges of International Education. ERIC Digest.Publication Date: 2001-12-00&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is little consensus concerning the guiding theme of the field as well as its scope. Should the field stress internationalization, trans nationalization, or globalization?&lt;ref&gt;(Barrows, 2000; Committee for Transnational Competence, 2000; Hilary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
# International education is not a prominent feature of the contemporary higher education experience. Using enrollment in foreign languages as an indicator, 16 percent of all U.S. college students were enrolled in foreign languages in the peak period of the 1960s; the proportion is currently down to 8 percent (Hayward, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;6).
# There is imbalance in regional coverage. The regions and languages covered at a particular institution are a function of idiosyncratic patterns of faculty recruitment. Nationally, there is reasonable coverage of Western Europe and Latin America and most European languages compared to limited coverage of Africa and the Middle East. For students enrolled in foreign languages, Spanish is the most popular followed by the other major languages of Western Europe; 6 percent enroll in Asian languages. Languages of the Middle East make up only 2 percent (1.3 being Hebrew and .5 percent Arabic). The languages of Africa constitute only 0.15 percent of enrollments.
# Because international education is not a primary concern of most scholars in the field, research is somewhat sporadic, non-cumulative, and tends to be carried out by national organizations as part of advocacy projects (e.g. Lambert, 1989; Brecht and Rivers, 2000). The most recent example is the American Council of Education's (ACE's) Internationalization of Higher Education: A Status Report. (Hayward, 2000). However, programs through various institutions, such as the [[Fulbright Program]] offer research opportunities for those wishing to study abroad.

Additionally, one of the challenges of international students is that increasingly higher education institutions are treating them as cash cows {{buzzword inline|date=June 2018}} for meeting their budget challenges. Institutions must do more to support international students in their academic and career success by providing advising, training and coaching that is culturally attuned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/2016/03/05/higher-education-must-go-beyond-recruitment-and-immigration-compliance-of-international-students/|title=International Students are Paying More for Education; are Universities Doing Enough?|last=Hu|first=Di|date=2016-03-05|website=interEDGE.org}}&lt;/back&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euclid]] [[Euclid's theorem|proved that]] there is no largest [[prime number]], and many mathematicians and hobbyists continue to search for large prime numbers.

Many of the largest known primes are [[Mersenne prime]]s. {{As of|2018|July}}, the seven largest known primes are Mersenne primes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://primes.utm.edu/primes/search.php?Number=100 |title=The largest known primes - Database Search Output |first1=Chris |last1=Caldwell |date= |publisher=Prime Pages |access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last sixteen record primes were Mersenne primes.&lt;ref name="computerhistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html |title=The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History |first1=Chris |last1=Caldwell |date= |publisher=Prime Pages |access-date=January 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The last non-Mersenne to be the largest known prime, was [http://primes.utm.edu/primes/page.php?id=390 391,581 ⋅ 2&lt;sup&gt;216,193&lt;/sup&gt; − 1]; see also [http://primes.utm.edu/notes/by_year.html The Largest Known Prime by Year: A Brief History] by Caldwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fast Fourier transform]] implementation of the [[Lucas–Lehmer primality test]] for [[Mersenne number]]s is fast compared to other known primality tests for other kinds of numbers.

==Current record==
The record is currently held by 2&lt;sup&gt;77,232,917&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 with 23,249,425 digits, found by [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search|GIMPS]] in December 2017.&lt;ref name="M77232"/&gt; Its value is:

==Prizes==
The [[Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search]] (GIMPS) currently offers a US$3000 research discovery award for participants who download and run their free software and whose computer discovers a new Mersenne prime having fewer than 100 million digits.

There are several prizes offered by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] for record primes.&lt;ref name="prizes"/&gt; GIMPS is also coordinating its long-range search efforts for primes of 100 million digits and larger and will split the Electronic Frontier Foundation's US$150,000 prize with a winning participant.

The record passed one million digits in 1999, earning a US$50,000 prize.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation, [https://www.eff.org/press/releases/big-prime-nets-big-prize Big Prime Nets Big Prize].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the record passed ten million digits, earning a US$100,000 prize and a [[Cooperative Computing Award]] from the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]].&lt;ref name="prizes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2009/10/14-0 |title=Record 12-Million-Digit Prime Number Nets $100,000 Prize |date=October 14, 2009 |work=Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=November 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called it the 29th-top invention of 2008.&lt;ref name="invention"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854195_1854157,00.html |title=Best Inventions of 2008 - 29.

Additional prizes are being offered for the first prime number found with at least one hundred million digits and the first with at least one billion digits.&lt;ref name="prizes"/&gt;

==History==
The following table lists the progression of the largest known prime number in ascending order.&lt;ref name="computerhistory"/&gt; Here M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is the [[Mersenne number]] with exponent ''n''. The longest record-holder known was M&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt; = 524,287, which was the largest known prime for 144 years. No records are known before 1456.

The following is a '''list of speed records''' for various categories of [[vehicle]]s. This list only presents the single greatest speed achieved in each broad record category; for more information on records under variations of test conditions, see the specific article for each record category. In any category, as with many [[world record]]s, there may be some dispute over the criteria for a record-setting event, the authority of the organization certifying the record, and the actual speed achieved.&lt;!-- Unless otherwise indicated, trailing zeros to the left of a decimal point are not [[significant figures|significant]].--&gt;&lt;!--Currently no ambiguous values here; uncomment if that changes.--&gt;

In order to unambiguously express the speed of a spacecraft, a [[frame of reference]] must be specified. Typically, this frame will be fixed to the body with the largest [[Sphere of influence (astrodynamics)|gravitational influence]] on the spacecraft, as this is the most relevant frame for most purposes.&lt;ref name="mckinnon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McKinnon|first1=Mika|title=Was Juno the fastest spacecraft ever?

Because of the influence of gravity, maximum velocities are usually attained just after launch, at entry, or at time of [[periapsis|closest approach]] to a massive body.

'''New Age Orientalism''' describes a modern, Western perception of [[Tibet]], and other Asian majority countries. The term was coined by, [[Tibetology|Tibetologist]] [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Donald Swell Lopez Jr.]], who specializes in Western discourse on [[Tibet]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lopez Jr|first=Donald Sewell|date=1994|title=New age orientalism: the case of Tibet|url=|journal=Tricycle: The Buddhist Journal|volume=3|pages=36–43|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lsa.umich.edu/asian/people/faculty/dlopez.html|title=Donald S. Lopez Jr. {{!}} U-M LSA Asian Languages and Cultures|website=lsa.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tibetologist is a person who studies [[tibetology]], the study of things related to [[Tibet]], including its [[History of Tibet|history]], [[Tibetan Buddhism|religion]], [[Standard Tibetan|language]], politics and the collection of Tibetan articles of historical, cultural and religious significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tibetology|date=2018-06-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tibetology&amp;oldid=847768940|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tibet]] is a [[historical region]] covering much of the [[Tibetan Plateau]] in Central Asia. It is the traditional homeland of the [[Tibetan people]] as well as some other [[Ethnic group|ethnic groups]] such as [[Monpa people|Monpa]], [[Qiang people|Qiang]], and [[Lhoba people|Lhoba peoples]] and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of [[Han Chinese]] and [[Hui people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Tibet|date=2018-08-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tibet&amp;oldid=856854724|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=='''Orientalism on Tibet'''==

[[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Dr. Donald S. Lopez Jr.]] studied the depiction of Tibet in Western academic writing throughout history. He found that, before the New Age movement, the depiction of Tibet was often cynical and derogatory. The demeaning features that define Orientalism, characterized the portrayal of Tibet, before the emergence of New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Self-aggrandizing of the Orient ===
In line with the logic of opposites, members of Western academia stressed their superiority (particularly regarding their academic abilities) and used this as a justification to patronize the Orient. With the modern period came Colonialism, when new knowledge of the Eastern world sparked western scholars to write about foreign histories, cultures, and traditions, despite having a sparse and incomplete understanding of them. The Western world, a majority of which was engaging in colonialism, considered The Eastern world to be incapable of representing itself due to its non-western mechanisms of knowledge. The colonial philosophy of manifest destiny led western scholars to believe that they had a more civilized and valuable way of expression, and so western academics took it upon themselves to document societies, such as Tibet, from their perspectives. Often described as 'backward' or 'incapable,' particularly in self-governance, such portrayals helped to fuel racist and white supremacist beliefs of Asian peoples across the west. Such western scholars considered both China and Tibet to be “Oriental Despotisms,” to which the politically organized and colonizing Western world was meant to civilize. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Gaining and justifying authority ===
[[Manifest destiny]], along with larger ideologies of [[racism]] and [[white supremacy]], were used as a method of justifying imperialism and colonialism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Eve|date=2016|title=Orientalist commercializations: Tibetan Buddhism in American popular film|url=https://digitalcommons.unomaha.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1852&amp;amp=&amp;context=jrf&amp;amp=&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.de%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Dde%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C5%2526q%253D%252522new%252Bage%252BOrientalism%252522%252Bmullen%2526oq%253Dmull#search=%22new%20age%20Orientalism%20mullen%22|journal=Journal of Religion &amp; Film|volume=2.2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When control of Tibet was taken by western forces for periods of time, western understandings of self-superiority helped to fuel the sense of entitlement, which explained such [[Colonialism|colonial violence]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

However, western powers never fully succeeded in gaining imperial control of Tibet, despite [[British expedition to Tibet|Britain]] and [[Foreign relations of Tibet#Russia and The Great Game|Russia's]] considerable military efforts. According to a western-centric understanding, Tibet never [[Modernization theory|modernized,]] refusing to adopt European-style education systems or norms. Throughout the course of the 19th and 20th century, Tibet remained inaccessible to Western powers, and was therefore predominantly portrayed as isolated, closed, and uncivilized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=='''New Age Orientalism and Tibet'''==

Embedded in the [[New Age|New Age movement]], New Age Orientalism describes the positive Western perception of old Tibet (before the [[Chinese invasion of Tibet|Chinese invasion 1950]] and [[Tibetan diaspora|Tibetan diaspora 1959)]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This portrayal of Tibet in the modern Western Societies, has been criticized for romanticizing old Tibetan reality and neglecting negative aspects of its society, such as, violence or the clerical, feudal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDuqayOx2Nw|title=Colin Goldner: Hinter dem Lächeln des Dalai Lama (Vortrag Univ. Wien 18.05.2012)|last=Goldner|first=Colin|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, seen as a construct of Western fantasy, rather than a depiction of reality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The myth of Shangri-La: Tibet, travel writing, and the western creatio of sacred landscape.|last=Bishop|first=Peter|publisher=Univ of California Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anand|first=Dibyesh|date=|title=Strategic hypocrisy: The British imperial scripting of Tibet's geopolitical identity|url=|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=68(1)|pages=227–252|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

New Age Orientalism, subsequently, describes the [[Orientalism|orientalist]] perception of Tibet, in which Tibet is no longer depreciated but, rather, romanticized. It is based on the tradition of continued [[Romantic Orientalism]], “in which the ‘West’ perceives some lack within itself and fantasizes that the answer, through a process of projection, is to be found somewhere in the ‘East.'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this manner, the four characteristics of Orientalism persist with slight variation. The logic of opposites, now relates to the old Tibet and China. Tibet is no longer perceived as an antiquated, "oriental despotism," but as a [[Shangri-La]] -- positive, holy, pristine, and pure, which is perceived as incorrupt, since it was never dominated by the West. The Chinese constitute the opposite, as the evil, subhuman force invading the land of peaceful, devoted inhabitants. The old Tibetan culture seems removed from time and history.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This allows the West to aggrandize themselves as rescuers of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism (see [[Free Tibet|'Free Tibet']] movement), whereas, [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] are depicted as helpless and voiceless. Ultimately, the West again finds itself in a patronizing position, representing another culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== New Age Orientalism in popular culture ===

The romanticized picture of Tibet has, partly, been constructed and reflected by [[popular culture]]. Hollywood movies such as [[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven years in Tibet]], [[Kundun]], and [[Little Buddha]], were found to draw a [[Romanticism|romanticized]] image of Tibet, and hold up the Western rescue paradigm, in line with the play of opposites, between China and Tibet.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, publications surrounding the '[[Free Tibet]]' movement have been categorized as New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The constructed fantasies of a Shangri-La Tibet, are found to reflect back on the Western struggles, within their own national identity,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; as well as, pitfalls of [[Globalization|globalization]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
=='''Expansion of New Age Orientialism'''==

In academic literature, the concept of New Age Orientalism, originally relating to Tibet, has been expanded and applied to other cultures and religions, such as [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt; The discourse and perception on [[Ayurveda]], for instance, has been categorized as New Age Orientalism.&lt;ref name="ref6" /&gt;

=='''Criticism of New Age Orientialism'''==

Dr. Donald Lopez's concept of New Age Orientalism, has been criticized for placing too much weight on the impact and power of Orientalism, and viewing Tibet as a closed totality, removed from history. Alternatives to Orientalism are not considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dreyfus|first=Georges|date=2005|title=Are We Prisoners of Shangrila? Orientalism, Nationalism, and the Study of Tibet|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Georges_Dreyfus2/publication/268361871_Are_We_Prisoners_of_Shangrila_Orientalism_Nationalism_and_the_Study_of_Tibet/links/5831ba9f08aef19cb819a8df.pdf|journal=Journal of the international association of Tibetan studies|volume=1.1|pages=1–21|via=Researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the concept has been criticized for neglecting the Tibetan struggle under the Chinese occupation, in addition to not covering negative Oriental pictures of Old Tibet as feudal and antiquated to their fullest extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thurman|first=Robert A.

'''New constitutionalism''' is derived from the classical [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] framework and represents a set of political policies that promote a new global order.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dierckx|first=Sacha|date=2013-12-01|title=After the Crisis and Beyond the New Constitutionalism?

Central ideas of neoliberalism have been advanced to create policies and practices to achieve [[global governance]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  New constitutionalism provides power to the private realm and limits power of state governance and public corporations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The transferring of power creates an informal self-regulatory setting allowing for the dismissal of public scrutiny and transparency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Constitutionalism and World Order|last=Gill|first=Stephen|last2=Cutler|first2=Claire|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-107-05369-4|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New constitutionalism has reshaped the structure of control to allow “locking in” mechanisms to occur to prevent intervention from the democratic realm and to enhance economic objectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This protects markets from regional interference and allows global influence in order to promote [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Constitutionalism: International and Private Rule in The New Global Order|last=McBride|first=Stephen|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4426-0365-3|editor-last=McBride|editor-first=Stephen|location=Toronto|pages=21|editor-last2=Teeple|editor-first2=Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of new constitutionalism is the result of [[globalization]] and the growing need for [[global hegemony]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Institutions have gained power in regards to trade, mobility, and flexibility through the framework of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the [[European Union]] are all actors contributing to the power of global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

New constitutionalism as a political order emerged in the latter half of the 20th century and the term was coined by academic[[Stephen Gill (political scientist)|Stephen Gill]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  The need for economic constitutional change was the result of crisis in political order correspondingly to the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Cold War]] as well as the progress of [[globalization]] through technological means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Since then the disciplinary has grown in acceptance due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] of 2007 and the need for largescale stabilization in its aftermath.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Theorists have subsequently developed the social and economic practices both in support and disagreement of the framework to provide a comparative outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbink|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Assessing the New Constitutionalism|url=https://www.jstor.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/stable/20434076?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=40 [2]|pages=227–245|issn=0010-4159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
New constitutionalism formed in the 1980s as the result of a growing world order and the “worldwide market revolution.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The end of the [[Cold War]] represented an ideological shift and the need for transformation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This shift was reiterated by [[Margaret Thatcher|Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher]] declaring the depletion of [[socialism]] and the rise of [[conservatism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As society progressed it allowed for the evolution of capital mobility, [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporation]] and the expansion of the world market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The [[Great Depression]] and the aftermath of [[World War II]] reflected the need for reform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Reform would redirect economic and political practices, ensuring benefits for all through the creation of global institutions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Falk, R. (2014). New Constitutionalism and geopolitics: notes on legality and legitimacy and prospects for a just new constitutionalism. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 295-312. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-liberal supremacy through the dominance of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] allowed for geopolitical reconfiguration increasing the need for new political order.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Additionally the lack of consistency among nation-state principles and the constant interruption from democratic power influenced the need to provide sustainable long term economic goals by limiting [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches of government using [[Constitution|constitutional framework]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cutler, A. Claire. (2016) "Transformations in Statehood, the Investor-State Regime, and the New Constitutionalism." ''Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies'' 23, no. 1: 95-125.&lt;/ref&gt; New constitutionalism has become prominent in the aftermath of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007 global financial crisis]] as a result of the need to bypass formal trade rules and democratic controls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneiderman, D. (2014).  How to govern differently: neo-liberal, new constitutionalism and international investment law. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 159-175. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework ==
There are four main [[Policy|policies]] to define new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The first represents the development of a constitutional structure for the global market that dictates the public, private and international powers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These international economic agreements or “[[constitution]]s” resemble political constitutions and thus ensure [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The economic power is being shifted from the national to the international as well as from the public to the private to provide growth and sustainability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Second is the separation of economic policies from domestic influence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This allows for capitalist markets to grow as well as extending the commodity form and the market forces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''' ''' This separation insulates economic policies from governing regulatory powers as well as the public demand for transparency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Economic Liberation Movement|Economic liberation]] is usually accompanied by political backlash, by disconnecting these two dynamisms suppresses democratic involvement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[World Bank Group|The World Bank]] advocates for the restriction of democratic participation and limitations imposed in the economic realm by creating a hierarchical system of representation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thirdly is creating “locking in” mechanisms which incorporate; laws, rules, regulations, procedures and institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This mechanism puts limitations on legislative and policy autonomy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Agreements are formulated to “lock in” [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] content through legal guarantees and sanctions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These agreements are difficult, even impossible to change which makes economic policies autonomous.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lastly this process diminished the need for formal accountability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  New constitutionalism has created a flexible system giving privileges to [[Multinational corporation|international corporations]] and private entities creating a “double” legal standard.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This concept diminished the “watchdog” and gives the flexibility for self-regulation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   This instrument is based on the international gold standard of the [[19th century|nineteenth century]] which gave rights to investor to avoid certain jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Permitting deregulation of financial services and trade investment avoids popular pressures and limits the need for transparency.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Minimizing liability and ensuring private authority the economic sector becomes more efficient, functional and practical.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Cutler, C. (2011). The Privatization of Authority in the Global Political Economy''.'' Edited by McBride, S., &amp; Teeple, G. ''In'' ''Relations of global power: Neoliberal order and disorder''. (p.41-59). Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4426-0365-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutions ==
At the global and regional level institutions are implementing the new constitutionalism framework to advance [[global governance]] by upholding the rights of private corporations and promoting a free [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  These institutions policies will ensure [[economic growth]] at the global level.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sinclair, S. (2014). Trade agreements, the new constitutionalism and public services. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 179-195. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global ===
The [[World Trade Organization]] [[World Trade Organization|(WTO)]] is a prominent figure in governing the [[World economy|global economy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Formally it was the responsibility of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade]] built on [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] principles but lacked the greater power adapted through new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]] represents a governing global entity which has adapted to the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] main purpose is to limit national interference in the global market and challenge any nation-state regulations that could be detrimental to the economy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Any economic alternatives that are proposed by nations can be discredited by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] as well as restricting governments ability to implement policy in international jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] represents the freedom of markets and allowing investors to capitalize in a [[world economy]], by doing so provides protection to the private sector.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Stephen McBride describes the [[World Trade Organization]] as having “quasi-judicial and quasi-constitutional aura.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The judicial and constitutional supremacy highlights the difficulty in challenging the organizations because of lock in mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Regional ===
The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] ([[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]) is a considered a regional governing entity that encompasses the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Regan]] referred to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] as a “new economic constitution.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Constitution because the agreement provided restrictions on government intrusion, rights to certain actors and enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The binding agreement afforded rights to both foreign and domestic investor to protect the interests of private capital and corporations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  By limiting government powers the agreement locked in private interests and reduced governments ability to expand or restore [[public service]]s in [[free trade]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Focus at the global level has resulted in hostility between the public and private realms within [[nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This hostility creates a political struggle between the private sector who safeguard the rights of capital and the public who want to control [[capitalism]] politically, democracy and socially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The control is being denationalized and delocalized causing negative repercussions at state level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  New constitutionalism lacks political will and can have detrimental effects to global dignity and future generations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Dividing economic policies from domestic creates disturbances within the civil society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Human rights]], [[Environmental issue|environmental concerns]] and [[public service]]s are being devalued because of the lack of economic concern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

New constitutionalism favours the [[Elitism|elitists]] providing preferential treatment and widening the [[Economic inequality|social gap]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[International financial institutions]], [[investor]]s and bond-raters are holding higher positions of authority than governments or nation-states furthering global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There is an urgent need for surveillance, policy making power, regulations and transparency economic outcomes are not solely focused on monetary gain but [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] concerns as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The absence of accountability and democratic authority has led many countries to depart from the constitutional framework and reclaim their [[sovereignty]] as independent nations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Australia]] has begun to constrain the advancements of new constitutionalism while many [[South America]] states have begun to exit the global regime completely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] have begun to form provisions to improve the democratic power within the global order and no longer allow for their governments to be immobilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Overconsumption''' is a situation where [[resource consumption|resource use]] has outpaced the [[sustainable]] [[carrying capacity|capacity]] of the [[ecosystem]].  A prolonged pattern of overconsumption leads to [[environmental degradation]] and the eventual [[resource depletion|loss of resource]] bases.

Generally, the discussion of overconsumption parallels that of [[human overpopulation]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul R |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|PNAS]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089–E6096|doi=10.1073/pnas.1704949114|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich. These drivers, all of which trace to the fiction that perpetual growth can occur on a finite planet, are themselves increasing rapidly.|pmc=5544311|pmid=28696295}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is the more people, the more [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[raw material]]s takes place to sustain their lives. But, humanity's overall impact on the planet is affected by many factors besides the raw number of people. Their lifestyle (including overall affluence and resource utilization) and the pollution they generate (including [[carbon footprint]]) are equally important. Currently, the inhabitants of the [[developed nation]]s of the world consume resources at a rate almost 32 times greater than those of the developing world, who make up the majority of the human population (7.4 billion people).&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Diamond"&gt;Diamond, Jared: (2008-01-02). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/opinion/02diamond.html "What's Your Consumption Factor?"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the developing world is a growing market of consumption. These nations are quickly gaining more purchasing power and it is expected that the Global South, which includes cities in Asia, Latin America and Africa, will account for 56% of consumption growth by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dobbs, James Manyika, Jonathan Woetzel, Jaana Remes, Jesko Perrey, Greg Kelly, Kanaka Pattabiraman, and Hemant Sharma. (2016, March). Urban world: The global consumers to watch. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/urbanization/urban-world-the-global-consumers-to-watch&lt;/ref&gt; This means that consumption rates will plateau for the developed nations and shift more into these developing countries. 

The theory of overpopulation reflects issues of [[Carrying capacity#Humans|carrying capacity]] without taking into account per capita consumption, by which developing nations are evaluated to consume more than their land can support. It is expected that world population growth will increase by 41% from 2000 to 2050, reaching a height of 8.9 billion people. On top of the rapid growth expectancy, it will be highly concentrated in the developing nations. This poses issues with inequality of consumption as well. The nations that will come into consumer dominance must abstain from abusing certain forms of consumption, especially energy consumption of CO2.&lt;ref&gt;RICHARD FLORIDA. (2016, April 14). Big Cities Are the Future of Global Consumption. Retrieved November 5, 2017, from https://www.citylab.com/life/2016/04/big-cities-are-the-future-of-global-consumption/478128/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Green party|Green parties]] and the [[ecology movement]] often argue that consumption per person, or [[ecological footprint]], is typically lower in poor than in rich nations.

==Causes==
In understanding the effects of over-consumption, it is pertinent to understand what causes the phenomenon. There is a spectrum of goods and services that the world population constantly consume. These range from food and beverage, clothing and footwear, housing, energy, technology,  transportation, education, health and personal care, financial services and other utilities.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank Group - www.worldbank.org. (n.d.). The developing world’s 4.5 billion low-income people already a $5 trillion market. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from http://datatopics.worldbank.org/consumption/market&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these require a different resource and once that resource is exploited to a certain point, that qualifies as over consumption. Since the developing nations are rising quickly into the consumer class, it is important to note the trends happening in these nations. According to the World Bank, the highest shares of consumption lie in food and beverage and clothing and footwear. This applies regardless of sector of income. &lt;ref&gt;The World Bank Group - www.worldbank.org. (n.d.). The developing world’s 4.5 billion low-income people already a $5 trillion market.

Two main factors of why we buy so much and so often is due to planned and perceived obsolescence.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM&lt;/ref&gt; This factor of production was introduced first in the United States and it revolves around the design of products and with these methods, the products are intentionally designed to get rid of after a short amount of time. As of 2012, only 1% of goods purchased were still in use after 6 months. This is due to planned and perceived obsolescence. When it is planned, designers create products that will not be able to work after a certain amount of time but they work for enough time to ensure the customers will come back to buy again. Perceived obsolescence comes in a lot with fashion and trends and fueled by advertising and media consumption. Through this technique, consumers are convinced that certain products do not have value anymore because it is out of style, and in order to have value, consumers must buy more up to date styles. Here is where fast fashion was born. 
As of 2015, the top five consumer markets in the world included the United States, Japan, Germany, China and France. &lt;ref&gt;The 25 Largest Consumer's Markets ... And The Outlook For 2015. (n.d.).

==Effects==
{{See also|I PAT}}
A fundamental effect of overconsumption is a reduction in the planet's [[carrying capacity]]. Excessive unsustainable consumption will exceed the long term carrying capacity of its environment ([[Overshoot (ecology)|ecological overshoot]]) and subsequent resource depletion, [[environmental degradation]] and reduced [[ecosystem health]].

Looking at the two largest sectors of over consumption, the fashion and food industries, we can see most of the harmful effects on the Earth starting here. The fashion industry has created a new venue, fast fashion, which in 2013 produced 15.1 million tons of textile waste and of that, 12.8 million tons were thrown out.  The United States, being the largest consumer market, deals with excess clothing by exporting it to poorer, developing nations but this solution is not sustainable because the demand will go down as cheap clothing becomes more readily available. Another way of disposal is to throw out into landfills or burn up in incinerators which is the least sustainable disposal solution. &lt;ref&gt;Tan, Z. Y. (2016, April 10). What Happens When Fashion Becomes Fast, Disposable And Cheap? Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.npr.org/2016/04/08/473513620/what-happens-when-fashion-becomes-fast-disposable-and-cheap
&lt;/ref&gt;

The food industry is the other largest sector of consumption and studies show that people waste a fifth of food products just through disposal or overconsumption. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization collected data and found that by the time food reaches the consumer, 9% (160 million tons) goes uneaten and 10% is lost to overconsumption - meaning consumers ate more than the calorie intake requirement. Other aspects of losses surrounding dry matter came at each stage in the food system, the highest amount being from livestock production at 43.9%, transportation accounted for 18% and consumer waste accounting for 12.2% loss. When the consumer takes in too much, this not only explains losses in the beginning of the stage at production (and over production) but also lends itself to overconsumption of energy and protein, having harmful effects on the body. &lt;ref&gt;Beer, E. (2017, February 27). Consumer waste and livestock biggest inefficiencies in food production: Study. Retrieved November 05, 2017, from https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2017/02/27/Consumer-waste-and-livestock-biggest-inefficiencies-in-food-production-Study
&lt;/ref&gt;


The scale of modern life's overconsumption has enabled an [[overclass]] to exist, displaying  [[affluenza]] and [[obesity]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nierenberg|first1=Danielle|title=State of the World 2006: a Worldwatch Institute report on progress toward a sustainable society|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/state-of-the-world-2006-a-worldwatch-institute-report-on-progress-toward-a-sustainable-society/oclc/62865904|website=Worldcat|publisher=New York; London: W.W. Norton|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However once again both of these claims are controversial with the latter being correlated to other factors more so than over-consumption. Within the topic of overconsumption there are many other ideas that should be considered in order to find the true cause of it. Some important events that coincide are poverty, population and the development of an area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overpopulation and overconsumption|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/306/6888/1285|website=BMJ|publisher=BMJ|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overconsumption can also lead to a decline in the economy and financial instability. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vidal|first1=John|title=World needs to stabilise population and cut consumption, says Royal Society|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/apr/26/earth-population-consumption-disasters|website=The Guardian|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the long term, these effects can lead to increased conflict over dwindling resources &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalissues.org/EnvIssues/Population/Result.asp Effects of Over-Consumption and Increasing Populations]. 26 September 2001. Retrieved on 19 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and in the worst case a [[Malthusian catastrophe]]. [[Lester Brown]] of the [[Earth Policy Institute]], has said: "It would take 1.5 Earths to sustain our present level of consumption.  Environmentally, the world is in an overshoot mode."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Lester R. |title=World on the Edge: How to Prevent Environmental and Economic Collapse |publisher=Norton |series=Earth Policy Institute |year=2011 |page=7 |isbn =113654075X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, the United States alone was using 30% of the world’s resources and if everyone were to consume at that rate, we would need 3-5 planets to sustain this type of living. Resources are quickly becoming depleted, with about ⅓ already gone. With new consumer markets rising in the developing countries which account for a much higher percent of the world’s population, this number can only rise. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GorqroigqM&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic growth===
The [[Worldwatch Institute]] said China and India, with their booming economies, along with the United States, are the three planetary forces that are shaping the global [[biosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Renner|first=Michael|title=State of the world 2005: A Worldwatch Institute Report on progress toward a sustainable society.|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/3866|accessdate=2009-09-14|date=January 2006|publisher=[[W.W. Norton]]|location=New York|isbn=0-393-32666-7|oclc=57470324|chapter=Chapter 1: China, India, and the New World Order|chapterurl=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/3992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[State of the World (book series)|State of the World]] 2005 report said the two countries' high [[economic growth]] exposed the reality of severe pollution. The report states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;The world's ecological capacity is simply insufficient to satisfy the ambitions of China, India, Japan, Europe and the United States as well as the aspirations of the rest of the world in a sustainable way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Footprint==
{{main article|Ecological footprint}}
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|quote=If everyone consumed resources at the US level, you will need another four or five Earths.|source=—[[Paul R. Ehrlich]], biologist&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/25/half-all-species-extinct-end-century-vatican-conference Biologists say half of all species could be extinct by end of century]. ''[[The Guardian]].'' February 25, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The idea of overconsumption is also strongly tied to the idea of an ecological footprint.  The term “ecological footprint” refers to the “resource accounting framework for measuring human demand on the biosphere.”  Currently, China is roughly 11 times lower in per capita footprint, yet has a population that is more than four times the size of the USA.  It is estimated that if China developed to the level of the United States that world consumption rates would roughly double.&lt;ref name="NYTimes_Diamond" /&gt;  According to Scientific American, one person from China uses 53 times fewer resources than the average American.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/american-consumption-habits/|title=American Consumption|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study published in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' postulates that meat consumption is set to increase as the result of [[human population growth]] and rising affluence, which will increase greenhouse gas emissions and further reduce [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Devlin|first=Hannah |date=July 19, 2018 |title=Rising global meat consumption 'will devastate environment'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/19/rising-global-meat-consumption-will-devastate-environment|work=The Guardian |location= |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counteractions==
The most obvious solution to the issue of overconsumption is to simply slow the rate at which materials are becoming [[Resource depletion|depleted]]. Less consumption naturally has negative effects on economies - so instead, countries must look to curb consumption rates while allowing for new industries, such as [[renewable energy]] and [[recycling]] technologies, to flourish and deflect some of the economic burden. A fundamental shift in the global economy may be necessary in order to account for the current change that is taking place or that will need to take place. Movements and lifestyle choices related to stopping overconsumption include: [[anti-consumerism]], [[freeganism]], [[green economics]], [[ecological economics]], [[degrowth]], [[frugality]], [[Downshifting (lifestyle)|downshifting]], [[simple living]], [[The Minimalists|minimalism]], and thrifting.

Recent grassroots movements have been coming up with creative ways to decrease the amount of goods we consume. [[The Freecycle Network]] is a network of people in one's community that are willing to trade goods for other goods or services. It is a new take on thrifting while still being beneficial to both parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.freecycle.org/|title=The Freecycle Network|website=www.freecycle.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other researchers and movements such as [[the Zeitgeist Movement]] suggest a new socioeconomic model which, through a structural increase of [[efficiency]], collaboration and locality in production as well as effective [[sharing economy|sharing]], increased [[modularity]], sustainability and optimal design of products, are expected to reduce resource-consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq The Zeitgeist Movement - Frequently Asked Questions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815095626/http://thezeitgeistmovement.com/faq |date=2012-08-15 }} Retrieved on 6 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health''' (PMNCH) is a multi-constituency partnership hosted by the [[World Health Organization]] and chaired by [[Graça Machel]]. PMNCH seeks to achieve universal access to comprehensive, high-quality reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health care. PMNCH works with more than 650 members in the reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health (RMNCH) communities across seven constituencies:

# Academic research and teaching institutions 
# Donors and foundations
# Health-care professionals
# Multilateral agencies
# Non-governmental organizations 
# Partner countries 
# The private sector

PMNCH describes itself as "a platform for knowledge, advocacy and accountability to improve women and children’s health". The Partnership is governed by a Board chaired by [[Graça Machel]].

==Main Activities==

The Partnership plays a central role in facilitating joint action on many fronts, mainly progress towards the [[United Nations]] [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) 4 and 5, to
reduce child mortality and improve maternal health, as tracked by  the Countdown to 2015
initiative, and through support for the [[Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health|Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health]] (Global Strategy) and Every Woman Every Child. PMNCH enables members to share
strategies, align objectives and resources, and collectively agree on policy interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reaching Every Woman and Every Child through Partnership|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/knowledge/publications/20130620_pmnchbrochurelowres.pdf?ua=1|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PMNCH’s work and support to partners is focused on three key Strategic Objectives: 
# Promotion of knowledge and innovation for action in order to enhance policy, service delivery and financing mechanisms.  
# Advocacy to mobilize and consolidate resources and greater engagement towards RMNCH.  
# Promotion of accountability for resources and results in order to strengthen monitoring of RMNCH’s efforts.

The Partnership issues annual reports on progress of commitments from more than 250 stakeholders and estimates that the Global Strategy has leveraged over US$18 billion in new and additional money for women’s and children’s health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PMNCH 2013 Report|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/knowledge/publications/2013_pmnch_report/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

PMNCH was launched in September 2005 when the world’s three leading maternal, newborn and child health alliances joined forces under the new name of The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn &amp; Child Health. 80 original members joined together from the three organizations, which included: the Partnership for Safe Motherhood and Newborn Health, hosted by the World Health Organization in Geneva; the Healthy Newborn Partnership, based at [[Save the Children]] USA; and the Child Survival Partnership, hosted by [[Unicef|UNICEF]] in New York. All three partnerships focused on accelerating action by countries—both donor and
developing countries—to achieve Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 4 ([[Child mortality|reduce child
mortality]]) and 5 ([[Maternal health|improve maternal health]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PMNCH History|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/about/history/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Planetary consciousness''' is the idea that human beings are members of a planetary society of [[Earth]] as much as they are members of their nations, provinces, districts, islands, cities or villages.

== History ==
In his 1906 book ''American Character'', author [[Brander Matthews]] mentions the idea of a "league of nations" and a "planetary consciousness", believing it would be created by American politicians in the coming centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=UA2WY1GvV-oC&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22League+of+Nations%22+%22planetary+consciousness%22+-wikipedia#v=onepage&amp;q=%22League%20of%20Nations%22%20%22planetary%20consciousness%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false | author=Matthews, Brander | authorlink=Brander Matthews | title=American Character | page=187 | publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co |date=September 1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Key planetary consciousness events of the 20th century include the creation of the [[League of Nations]], the signing of [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]], the creation of the [[United Nations]], and the creation of the [[Bretton Woods system]].  [[Democratic globalization]] advocate [[Abhay Kumar]] points to the [[ICANN|International Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) board of directors election in 2000, which were conducted globally, as the first example of global democracy.&lt;ref name=abhay&gt;{{cite news | title=Birth of Global Democracy | author=K, Abhay | authorlink=Abhay Kumar | work=[[Times of India]] | date=21 January 2011 | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-01-21/edit-page/28367706_1_printing-press-number-of-mobile-phones-gutenberg | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2001, [[Ervin László]] and the [[Dalai Lama]] wrote an essay titled "Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness", which was adopted at a meeting at the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] in Budapest.&lt;ref name=manifesto&gt;{{cite web | author1=László, Ervin | authorlink1=Ervin László | author2=[[Dalai Lama]] | title=Manifesto on Planetary Consciousness | publisher=WorldShift International | date=15 September 2001 | url=http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | accessdate=13 August 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120828003626/http://www.worldshiftinternational.org/manifesto-planetary-consciousness/ | archivedate=28 August 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its introduction begins:

{{cquote|text=In the closing years of the twentieth century, we have reached a crucial juncture in our history. We are on the threshold of a new stage of social, spiritual, and cultural evolution, a stage that is as different from the stage of the earlier decades of this century as the grasslands were from the caves, and settled villages from life in nomadic tribes. We are evolving out of the nationally based industrial societies that were created at the dawn of the first industrial revolution, and heading toward an interconnected, information-based social, economic, and cultural system that straddles the globe.&lt;ref name=manifesto/&gt;}}

[[Andreas Bummel]], CEO of the Committee for a Democratic UN, says, "The first step into the direction of a world parliament would be the establishment of a Parliamentary Assembly at the United Nations".&lt;ref name=bummel/&gt;

==Concept==
Advocacy for the idea of planetary consciousness is based on the technological advancements made by the mankind in the fields of transport and telecommunications during the 20th century and in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; Kumar claims that these technological advancements have turned the whole planet into an interdependent economic, political and communication community.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He specifically cites the invention of the Internet and the mobile phones as key technological achievements of the 20th century which brought humans into more continuous interconnected communication.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt; He believes that these inventions will lead to a second [[Renaissance]] and global democracy, just as the [[Gutenberg press]] in 1439 led to the first Renaissance, the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and [[Nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=abhay/&gt;  Bummel describes planetary consciousness as integral, insofar as it does not conflict with other levels of [[Identity (social science)|social identity]], but instead is a holistic perspective on humanity and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref name=bummel&gt;{{cite journal | title=Social Evolution, Global Governance and a World Parliament | author=Bummel, Andreas | journal=[[Cadmus (journal)|Cadmus]] | date=11 April 2012 |url=http://www.cadmusjournal.org/article/issue-4/social-evolution-global-governance-and-world-parliament#13 | accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steven Kull writes that while nation states are reluctant to work cooperatively, individuals seem more willing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kull, Steven | title=Listening to the Voice of Humanity | journal= Kosmos Journal | issue=Spring/Summer | year= 2010 | pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Shashi Tharoor]] feels that an [[Earth Anthem]] sung by people across the world can inspire planetary consciousness and [[global citizenship]] among people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newindianexpress.com/nation/Indian-diplomat-pens-anthem-for-earth/2013/06/05/article1620381.ece Indian diplomat pens anthem for earth] The New Indian Express 5 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Recorded history''' or '''written history''' is a [[history|historical narrative]] based on a written record or other documented communication. It  contrasts with other narratives of the past, such as [[myth]]ological, [[oral history|oral]] or [[archeological record|archeological]] traditions. For broader [[world history]], recorded history begins with the accounts of the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] around the [[4th millennium BC]], and coincides with the [[invention of writing]]. For some geographic regions or cultures, written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history because of the limited use of written records. Moreover, human cultures do not always record all of the information relevant to later historians, such as the full impact of natural disasters or the names of individuals; thus, recorded history for particular types of information is limited based on the types of records kept. Because of this, recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the topic.

The interpretation of recorded history often relies on [[historical method]], or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past. The question of the nature, and even the possibility, of an effective method for interpreting recorded history is raised in the [[philosophy of history]] as a question of [[epistemology]]. The study of different historical methods is known as [[historiography]], which focuses on examining how different interpreters of recorded history create different interpretations of historical evidence.

== Prehistory ==
{{Further|History of writing}}

[[Prehistory]] traditionally refers to the span of time before recorded history, ending with the invention of [[writing systems]].&lt;ref name="Shotwell1922"&gt;Shotwell, James Thomson. An Introduction to the History of History. Records of civilization, sources and studies. New York: Columbia University Press, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; Prehistory refers to the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood.

[[Protohistory]] refers to the transition period between prehistory and history, after the advent of [[literacy]] in a society but before the writings of the first [[historians]]. Protohistory may also refer to the period during which a [[culture]] or [[civilization]] has not yet developed writing, but other cultures have noted its existence in their own writings.

More complete writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]]. Early examples are the [[Jiahu symbols]] (c. 6600 BCE), [[Vinča signs]] (c. 5300 BCE), early [[Indus script]] (c. 3500 BCE) and [[Nsibidi]] script (c. before 500 CE). There is disagreement concerning exactly when prehistory becomes history, and when proto-writing became "true writing"&lt;ref&gt;Smail, Daniel Lord. On Deep History and the Brain. An Ahmanson foundation book in the humanities. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]] of the late [[4th millennium BCE]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BCE with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BCE]].

===East Asia===
In China, the earliest history was recorded in [[oracle bone script]] which was deciphered and may date back to around late 2nd millennium B.C..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = "综述", 中国考古学报第5册(Acta Archaeologica Sinica)|publisher=《考古学报》编辑部|year = 1951 |language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', attributed to [[Zuo Qiuming]] in the {{annum|5th century|B.C. }}, is the earliest written of narrative history in the world and covers the period from {{annum|722 to 468|B.C. }}. The ''[[Classic of History]]'' is one of the [[Five Classics]] of [[Chinese classic texts]] and one of the earliest narratives of China. The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from {{annum|722 to 481|B.C. }}, is among the earliest surviving historical texts to be arranged on [[Annals|annalistic]] principles in the world. It is traditionally attributed to [[Confucius]] (551–479 B.C. ). ''[[Zhan Guo Ce]]'' was a renowned ancient Chinese historical compilation of sporadic materials on the [[Warring States period]] compiled between the {{annum|3rd and 1st centuries|B.C. }}.

[[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|B.C. }}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the {{annum|16th century|B.C. }}, and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras. His work influenced every subsequent author of history in China, including the prestigious Ban family of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] era.

===Europe===
[[Herodotus]] of [[Halicarnassus]] (484 B.C. – c. 425 B.C. )&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author=Lamberg-Karlovsky, C. C. |author2=Jeremy A. Sabloff |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Publishing |date=1979 |page=5|isbn=0-88133-834-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has generally been acclaimed as the "father of history" composing his [[Histories (Herodotus)|''The Histories'']] written from 450s to the 420s B.C. . However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 B.C. – c. 400 B.C.) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.&lt;ref name="lamberg-karlovsky-p5" /&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history|sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[secular]] approach in historical study.&lt;ref name="graham-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shape of the Past |author=Graham, Gordon |publisher=[[Oxford University]] |date=1997 |chapter=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumbnail|[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] inscription in monumental archaic style, c. 26th century B.C. ]]According to [[John Tosh]], "From the High Middle Ages (c.1000–1300) onwards, the written word survives in greater abundance than any other source for Western history."&lt;ref name="Tosh59"&gt;Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Western historians developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany, where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past. Many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives. In the 20th century, academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[great men theory|great men]], to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]].

===South Asia===
In Sri Lanka, the oldest historical text is the [[Mahavamsa]]. Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya maintained chronicles of Sri Lankan history starting from the third century BCE. These annals were combined and compiled into a single document in the 5th century by the [[Mahanama of Anuradhapura]] while [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura]] was ruling the [[Anuradhapura Kingdom]]. It was written based on prior ancient compilations known as the ''[[Atthakatha]]'', which were commentaries written in Sinhala.{{sfn|Oldenberg|1879|p=}}{{Page needed|date=February 2016}} An earlier document known as the ''[[Dipavamsa]]''(4th century CE) "Island Chronicles" is much simpler and contains less information than the ''Mahavamsa'' and was probably compiled using the ''Atthakatha'' on the ''Mahavamsa'' as well.

A companion volume, the ''[[Culavamsa]]'' "Lesser Chronicle", compiled by [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]] monks, covers the period from the 4th century to the [[British Empire|British]] takeover of Sri Lanka in 1815. The ''Culavamsa'' was compiled by a number of authors of different time periods.

The combined work, sometimes referred to collectively as the ''Mahavamsa'', provides a continuous historical record of over two millennia, and is considered one of the world's longest unbroken historical accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tripāṭhī|editor1-first=Śrīdhara|title=Encyclopaedia of Pali Literature: The Pali canon |volume=1 |date=2008|publisher=Anmol|isbn=9788126135608|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few documents containing material relating to the [[Naga people (Lanka)|Nāga]] and [[Yaksha|Yakkha people]]s, indigenous inhabitants of [[Lanka]] prior to the legendary arrival of Prince Vijaya from Singha Pura of Kalinga.

===Middle East===
In the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. Ibn Khaldun often criticized "idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data." As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his "new science".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'', p. x, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-01754-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of [[State (polity)|state]], [[communication]], [[propaganda]] and [[systematic bias]] in history,&lt;ref name=Mowlana&gt;H. Mowlana (2001). "Information in the Arab World", ''Cooperation South Journal'' '''1'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and he is thus considered to be the "father of historiography"&lt;ref&gt;Salahuddin Ahmed (1999).

==Methods of recording history==
While recorded history begins with the invention of writing, over time new ways of recording history have come along with the advancement of technology. History can now be recorded through [[photography]], [[audio recording]]s, and [[video recording]]s. More recently, [[Web archive|Internet archives]] have been saving copies of webpages, documenting the history of the [[Internet]]. Other methods of collecting historical information have also accompanied the change in technologies; for example, since at least the 20th century, attempts have been made to preserve [[oral history]] by recording it. Until the 1990s this was done using [[analogue recording]] methods such as [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[reel-to-reel tape]]s. With the onset of new technologies, there are now [[digital recording]]s, which may be recorded to CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preserving Oral History Recordings|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/openpublish/index.php/nlasp/article/viewArticle/1034/1302|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Colin Webb|author2=Kevin Bradley |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/21336/20080620-0137/www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/cwebb4.html|archivedate=20 June 2008|deadurl=no|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, historical record and interpretation often relies heavily on written records, partially because it dominates the extant historical materials, and partially because historians are used to communicating and researching in that medium.&lt;ref name=Tosh-58-59&gt;Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'' 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical method===
The [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]]. Primary sources are first-hand evidence of history (usually written, but sometimes captured in other mediums) made at the time of an event by a present person. Historians think of those sources as the closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.&lt;ref name="primary source guide"&gt;{{cite web|last=User Education Services|title=Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Sources|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources|publisher=University of Maryland Libraries|accessdate=10 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources|archivedate=3 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml "Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml |date=12 February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of sources can provide researchers with, as Dalton and Charnigo put it, "direct, un-mediated information about the object of study."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Historians use other types of sources to understand history as well. [[Secondary source]]s are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyse, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. [[Tertiary source]]s are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources and often tell a more generalized account built on the more specific research found in the first two types of sources.&lt;ref name="primary source guide" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html | title=Glossary, Using Information Resources | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828123138/http://www.lib.odu.edu/libassist/tutorials/nursing/glossary.html | archivedate=28 August 2008 | df=dmy-all }} ("Tertiary Source" is defined as "reference material that synthesizes work already reported in primary or secondary sources")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml | title=Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050212093611/http://www.library.jcu.edu.au/LibraryGuides/primsrcs.shtml | archivedate=12 February 2005 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On society==
In July 2013, media critic [[Jay Rosen]] defined the Snowden effect as "Direct and indirect gains in public knowledge from the cascade of events and further reporting that followed Edward Snowden's leaks of classified information about the surveillance state in the U.S."&lt;ref name=RosenSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Jay |title=The Snowden Effect: definition and examples |url=http://pressthink.org/2013/07/the-snowden-effect-definition-and-examples/ |work=Jay Rosen's PressThink |accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2013, ''[[The Nation]]'' wrote that Snowden had sparked an overdue debate about national security and individual privacy.&lt;ref name=NationSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite web |last=Alterman |first=Eric |title=What the Press Should Learn From the 'Snowden Effect' |url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/177686/what-press-should-learn-snowden-effect# |work=The Nation |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2014 [[World Economic Forum]], Internet experts saw news that [[Microsoft]] would let foreign customers store their personal data on servers outside America as a sign that Snowden's leaks were leading countries and companies to erect borders in cyberspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davos |first=L.S. |title=The Snowden effect |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/babbage/2014/01/internet-governance |work=The Economist |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Forbes]]'', the effect was seen to have nearly united the U.S. Congress in opposition to the massive [[post-9/11]] domestic intelligence gathering system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Watson |first=Tom |title=The Snowden Effect Hits Congress: Will Effective Crowdsourced Lobbying Follow? |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomwatson/2013/07/18/the-snowden-effect-hits-congress-will-effective-crowdsourced-lobbying-follow/ |work=Forbes |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its Spring 2014 Global Attitudes Survey, the [[Pew Research Center]] found that Snowden's disclosures had tarnished the image of the United States, especially in Europe and Latin America.&lt;ref name=PewJuly2014&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/global-opposition-to-u-s-surveillance-and-drones-but-limited-harm-to-americas-image/ |title=Global Opposition to U.S. Surveillance and Drones, but Limited Harm to America's Image |publisher=Pew Research Center |date=July 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the Obama administration appointed [[William Evanina]], a former FBI special agent with a [[counter-terrorism]] specialty, as the new government-wide [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive|National Counterintelligence Executive]]. "Instead of getting carried away with the concept of leakers as heroes," Evanina said in August, "we need to get back to the basics of what it means to be loyal. Undifferentiated, unauthorized leaking is a criminal act." While dealing with insider threats had been an intelligence community priority since WikiLeaks published Chelsea Manning's disclosures in 2010, Evanina said that in the aftermath of Snowden's June 2013 revelations, the process "sped up from a regional railway to the [[Acela Express|Acela]] train." A year later, 100,000 fewer people had security clearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Charles S. |title=Meet the Man Who's Gauging the Damage From Snowden |url=http://www.govexec.com/management/2014/08/meet-man-whos-gauging-damage-snowden/91595/ |work=Government Executive |date=August 15, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James Clapper]] said Snowden's leaks created a [[perfect storm]], degrading the intelligence community's capabilities. Snowden's leaks, said Clapper, damaged relationships with foreign and corporate stakeholders, restrained budget resources, and caused the U.S. to discontinue collecting intelligence on certain targets, putting the United States at greater risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sink |first=Justin |title=Intelligence chief says Snowden leaks created 'perfect storm' |url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/218155-intelligence-chief-says-snowden-leaks-created-perfect-storm |work=The Hill |date=September 18, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014, former Director of the [[National Counterterrorism Center]] [[Matthew G. Olsen]] told [[CNN]] that Snowden's disclosures had made it easier for terrorist groups to evade U.S. surveillance by changing their encryption methods. Olsen said intelligence collection against some individuals of concern had been lost, preventing insight into their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Liptak |first=Kevin |title=Ex-counterterror chief: U.S. lost track of terrorists after Snowden |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/21/politics/olsen-nsa/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2015 [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] had studied Snowden's disclosures and, said U.S. officials, its leaders were using couriers or encrypted communications that Western analysts could not crack.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric P.

In February 2015, [[National Counterterrorism Center]] director [[Nicholas Rasmussen]] told Congress that Snowden's disclosures had damaged U.S. intelligence capabilities. Rasmussen said the government knew of specific terrorists who, after learning from Snowden's leaks how the U.S. collected intelligence, had increased their security measures by using new types of encryption, changing email addresses, or abandoning prior methods of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Aftergood |first=Steven |title=Leaks Damaged U.S. Intelligence, Official Says |url=https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2015/02/leaks-damaged/ |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |date=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the effect of his leaks, Snowden himself wrote in February 2015 that "the biggest change has been in awareness. Before 2013, if you said the NSA was making records of everybody's phonecalls and the [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] was monitoring lawyers and journalists, people raised eyebrows and called you a conspiracy theorist. Those days are over."&lt;ref name=RedditAMA&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2wwdep/we_are_edward_snowden_laura_poitras_and_glenn/ |title=We are Edward Snowden, Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald from the Oscar-winning documentary CITIZENFOUR |website=Reddit |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that the Snowden effect had hit ''[[The Guardian]]''. Journalist [[Michael Wolff (journalist)|Michael Wolff]], who wrote for ''The Guardian'' for many years, asserted that the recent selection of [[Katharine Viner]] as editor-in-chief "can be read as, in part, a deeply equivocal response on the part of the paper's staff, with its unusual power in the process of selecting a new editor, to the Snowden story." According to Wolff, there had developed "a sense of journalistic queasiness around Snowden, difficult to express at the party-line ''Guardian''. Questioning Snowden's retreat to Russia and his protection by Vladimir Putin was internally verboten."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/wolff/2015/03/20/new-editor-for-guardian-newspaper/25094233/ |title=Snowden effect hits 'Guardian' |work=USA Today |date=March 20, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2015 |first=Michael |last=Wolff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology industry==
In the technology industry, the Snowden effect had a profound impact after it was revealed that the NSA was tapping into the information held by some U.S. [[Cloud computing|cloud-based services]]. [[Google]], [[Cisco]], and [[AT&amp;T]] lost business internationally due to the public outcry over their roles in NSA spying. A study by the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]] published in August 2013 estimated that the cloud-based computing industry could have lost up to $35 billion by 2016.&lt;ref name=HuffPoCisco&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Gerry |title='Snowden Effect' Threatens U.S. Tech Industry's Global Ambitions |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/24/edward-snowden-tech-industry_n_4596162.html |work=Huffington Post |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |date=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Wall Street Journal'' named "the Snowden effect" as 2013's top tech story, saying Snowden's leaks "taught businesses that the convenience of the cloud cuts both ways." The ''Journal'' predicted the effect would top 2014 news as well, given the number of documents yet to be revealed.&lt;ref name=WSJ2013TechNews&gt;{{cite news |last=Boulton |first=Clint |title=Snowden Effect Dominates 2013 Tech Industry News |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2013/12/26/snowden-effect-dominates-2013-tech-industry-news/ |work=The Wall Street Journal |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |date=December 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the most profitable country for U.S. tech companies, all are "under suspicion as either witting or unwitting collaborators" in the NSA spying, according to the director of the Research Center for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University.&lt;ref name=ReutersSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Matthew |title=In China, U.S. tech firms weigh 'Snowden Effect' |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/21/us-ibm-china-idUSBREA0K0FB20140121 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=February 1, 2014 |date=January 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect was also seen in changes to investment in the industry, with security "back on the map" according to Hussein Kanji, Venture Capitalist at Hoxton Ventures.&lt;ref name=BloombergSnowdenEffect /&gt;

On August 8, 2013, [[Lavabit#Connection to Edward Snowden|Lavabit]], a secure email provider that Snowden used, discontinued service after being asked for encryption keys that would have exposed to U.S. government prosecutors the emails of all 410,000 Lavabit users.&lt;ref name="nytimes-lavabit-closes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/us/snowdens-e-mail-provider-discusses-pressure-from-fbi-to-disclose-data.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp; |title=As F.B.I.

After revelations that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile was being tapped, the tech industry rushed to create a secure cell phone.&lt;ref name=BloombergSnowdenEffect&gt;{{cite video |last=Kanji |first=Hussein |title=The Snowden Effect: Impact on the Tech Sector |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/video/the-snowden-effect-impact-on-the-tech-sector-mzOWYZYQQkumPGgmUxpE6w.html |publisher=[[Bloomberg TV]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105213946/http://www.bloomberg.com/video/the-snowden-effect-impact-on-the-tech-sector-mzOWYZYQQkumPGgmUxpE6w.html|archive-date=January 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[TechRepublic]]'', revelations from the NSA leaks "rocked the IT world" and had a "chilling effect". The three biggest impacts were seen as increased interest in encryption, business leaving U.S. companies, and a reconsideration of the safety of cloud technology.&lt;ref name=TechRepublicImpact&gt;{{cite web |last=Hiner |first=Jason |title=Understanding Snowden's impact on IT... in 2 minutes |url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/tech-sanity-check/video-understanding-snowdens-impact-on-it-in-2-minutes/#. |work=TechRepublic |accessdate=February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Blackphone]], which ''The New Yorker'' called "a phone for the age of Snowden"—described as "a smartphone explicitly designed for security and privacy", created by the makers of [[GeeksPhone]], Silent Circle, and [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]], provided encryption for phone calls, emails, texts, and Internet browsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Das-Blackphone-soll-die-totale-Ueberwachung-stoppen-2086745.html |title=Das Blackphone soll die totale Überwachung stoppen |date=January 15, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015 |work=heise online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Kopstein/New Yorker"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kopfstein |first=Janus |title=A Phone for the Age of Snowden |url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/01/a-phone-for-the-age-of-snowden.html |work=The New Yorker |accessdate=March 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Snowden's disclosures, Americans used the Internet less for things like email, online shopping and banking, according to an April 2014 poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harris Poll: People Cutting Back Internet Use After Snowden |url=http://www.newsmax.com/US/Snowden-Internet-Harris-poll/2014/04/04/id/563768/ |accessdate=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Post Snowden, Some Internet Usage Is Contracting, Study Finds |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2014/04/03/post-snowden-some-internet-usage-is-contracting-study-finds/ |accessdate=April 6, 2014 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in April 2014, former NSA deputy director Col. Cedric Leighton told the Bloomberg Enterprise Technology Summit in New York City that Snowden's leaks had performed a significant disservice to the worldwide health of the Internet by leading Brazil and other countries to reconsider the Internet's decentralized nature. Leighton suggested that nation states' efforts to create their own versions of the Internet were the beginning of the end for the Internet as we know it. "When you have a situation where all of a sudden, everyone goes into 'tribal' mode—a German cloud, a Swiss cloud, or any other separate Internet—they are significant nationalistic attempts," said Leighton. "What happened with Snowden, it's more of an excuse than a policy, it's more of an excuse to re-nationalize the Internet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Former NSA deputy director: Snowden leaks caused 'significant disservice' to the Internet |url=http://www.zdnet.com/former-nsa-deputy-director-snowden-leaks-caused-significant-disservice-to-the-Internet-7000028746/ |accessdate=April 25, 2014 |work=ZDNet |date=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that economic fallout from Snowden's leaks had been a boon for foreign companies, to the detriment of U.S. firms. Daniel Castro, a senior analyst at the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]], predicted that the United States cloud computing industry could lose $35 billion by 2016. Matthias Kunisch, a German software executive who switched from U.S. cloud computing providers to [[Deutsche Telekom]], said that due to Snowden his customers thought American companies had connections to the NSA. Security analysts estimated that U.S. tech companies had since Snowden collectively spent millions and possibly billions of dollars adding state-of-the-art encryption features to consumer services and to the cables that link data centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/22/business/fallout-from-snowden-hurting-bottom-line-of-tech-companies.html |title=Revelations of N.S.A.

In July 2014, the nonpartisan [[New America Foundation]] summarized the impact of Snowden's revelations on U.S. businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oti.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Surveillance_Costs_Short%20Version.pdf |title=Surveillance Costs: The NSA's Impact on the Economy, Internet Freedom &amp; Cybersecurity |website=newamerica.net |date=Summer 2014 |accessdate=September 30, 2014 |publisher=[[New America Foundation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912153658/http://oti.newamerica.net/sites/newamerica.net/files/policydocs/Surveillance_Costs_Short%20Version.pdf |archivedate=September 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The erosion of trust, said the report, has had serious consequences for U.S. tech firms. [[Information technology|IT]] executives in France, Hong Kong, Germany, the UK, and the U.S. confirmed that Snowden's leaks directly impacted how companies around the world think about information and communication technologies, particularly cloud computing. A quarter of British and Canadian multinational companies surveyed were moving their data outside the U.S. Among U.S. companies attributing drops in revenue to, in part, fallout from Snowden's leaks were [[Cisco Systems]], [[Qualcomm]], [[IBM]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Hewlett-Packard]]. Proposed laws in more than a dozen foreign countries, including Germany, Brazil, and India, would make it harder for U.S. firms to do business there. The European Union is considering stricter domestic privacy legislation that could result in fines and penalties costing U.S. firms billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/07/30/new-report-snowden-revelations-hurt-u-s-companies/ |title=New Report: Snowden Revelations Hurt U.S. Companies |date=July 30, 2014 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |first=Elizabeth |last=Dwoskin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, [[Massachusetts]]-based [[web intelligence]] firm [[Recorded Future]] announced it had found a direct connection between Snowden's leaks and dramatic changes in how Islamist terrorists interacted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.recordedfuture.com/al-qaeda-encryption-technology-part-2/|title=How Al-Qaeda Uses Encryption Post-Snowden (Part 2)|date=August 1, 2014|website=Recorded Future|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPRchanged&gt;{{cite web |last=Temple-Raston |first=Dina |title=Big Data Firm Says It Can Link Snowden Data To Changed Terrorist Behavior |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/08/01/336958020/big-data-firm-says-it-can-link-snowden-data-to-changed-terrorist-behavior |publisher=NPR |date=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2010, the privately held Recorded Future received an investment from [[In-Q-Tel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IQT Portfolio |url=https://www.iqt.org/iqt_portfolio/recorded-future/ |publisher=In-Q-Tel |accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a nonprofit [[venture capital]] firm whose primary partner is the [[CIA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About IQT |url=https://www.iqt.org/about-iqt/#partners |publisher=In-Q-Tel |accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Just months after Snowden's 2013 leaks, said Recorded Future, operatives of [[al-Qaeda]] and associated groups completely overhauled their 7-year-old encryption methods, which included "homebrewed" algorithms, adopting instead more sophisticated [[open-source software]] and newly available downloads that enabled encryption on [[Mobile phone|cellphones]], [[Android (operating system)|Android products]], and [[Macintosh|Macs]], to help disguise their communications.&lt;ref name=NPRchanged /&gt;

In September 2014, [[Seattle]]-based [[Deep Web (search indexing)|Deep Web]] and [[Dark web]] monitoring firm Flashpoint Global Partners published a report that found "very little open source information available via [[Jihadism|jihadi]] online [[social media]]" indicating that Snowden's leaks impelled al-Qaeda to develop more secure digital communications. "The underlying public encryption methods employed by online jihadists," the report concluded, "do not appear to have significantly changed since the emergence of Edward Snowden. Major recent technological advancements have focused primarily on expanding the use of encryption to instant messenger and mobile communications mediums."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Measuring the Impact of the Snowden Leaks on the Use of Encryption by Online Jihadists |url=https://fpjintel.com/public-reports/measuring-the-impact-of-the-snowden-leaks-on-the-use-of-encryption-by-online-jihadists/ |publisher=Flashpoint Partners |date=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, ''[[The Nation]]'' reported, "The fallout from the Edward Snowden fiasco wasn't just political—it was largely economic. Soon after the extent of the NSA's data collection became public, overseas customers (including the Brazilian government) started abandoning U.S.-based tech companies in droves over privacy concerns. The dust hasn't settled yet, but tech-research firm [[Forrester Research|Forrester]] estimated the losses may total 'as high as $180 billion,' or 25 percent of industry revenue."&lt;ref name=Capello01a&gt;{{cite web |last=Cappello |first=Lawrence |title=Privacy and the Profit Motive |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/205953/privacy-and-profit-motive |work=The Nation |date=May 4, 2015 |accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer products==
In September 2014, ''The New York Times'' credited [[Apple Inc.|Apple Inc.'s]] update of [[iOS 8]], which encrypts all data inside it, as demonstrating how Snowden's impact had begun to work its way into consumer products. His revelations, said ''The Times'', "not only killed recent efforts to expand the law, but also made nations around the world suspicious that every piece of American hardware and software—from phones to servers made by [[Cisco Systems]]—have 'back doors' for American intelligence and law enforcement." ''The Times'' situated this development within a "Post Snowden Era" in which Apple would no longer comply with NSA and law enforcement requests for user data, instead maintaining that Apple doesn't possess the key to unlock data on the [[iPhone]]. However, since the new security protects information stored on the device itself, but not data stored on Apple's [[iCloud]] service, Apple will still be able to obtain some customer information stored on iCloud in response to government requests. ''The Times'' added that [[Google|Google's]] [[Android (operating system)|Android]] would have encryption enabled by default in upcoming versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanger |first1=David E. |last2=Chen |first2=Brian X. |title=Signaling Post-Snowden Era, New iPhone Locks Out N.S.A. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/27/technology/iphone-locks-out-the-nsa-signaling-a-post-snowden-era-.html |work=The New York Times |date=September 26, 2014 |accessdate=April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall speed record is the record for the highest average speed regardless of any criteria, categories or classes that all the more specific records belong to, provided that the route was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/526993-first-person-to-twice-hold-three-simultaneous-overall-ocean-rowing-speed-records|title=First person to twice hold three simultaneous overall ocean rowing speed records on different oceans|work=Guinness World Records|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps to compare various performances that differ by the type of the craft, vessel or vehicle, the departure and the arrival points (provided that the distances are comparable), number, age and gender of the crew members, departure date, etc. The distance used for calculating the overall speed record is usually the distance in a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oceanrowing.com/Blue_Riband_Trophy.htm|title=ocean rowing across Atlantic speed record|website=www.oceanrowing.com|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of man-powered races, overall speed record doesn't always reflect the best performance.

|Ancient times||Typical skeletal abnormalities of tuberculosis, including characteristic [[Pott disease|Pott's deformities]], are found in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[mummy|mummies]] and are depicted in early Egyptian art. Tuberculosis is also noted in the [[Bible|Biblical]] books of [[Deuteronomy]] and [[Leviticus]]. Written texts describe tuberculosis in India as early as 3300 years ago and in China 2300 years ago. Tuberculosis is well known in [[classical Greece]], where it is called ''phthisis''.&lt;ref name="summary"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=M.

|1700s–1800s||Description of tuberculosis is developed in medical literature. Toward 1800s [[sanatoria]] start to open for treating patients, with often successful outcomes. Understanding of the [[pathogenesis]] of tuberculosis begins with the works of [[René Laennec|Laennec]], [[Jean Antoine Villemin|Villemin]] and the identification of the tubercle bacillus as the [[etiology|etiologic]] agent by [[Robert Koch]].

|1920s–1930s||The [[International Union Against Tuberculosis]] (IUAT) is founded. [[BCG vaccine]] against tuberculosis is developed.

|1940s onward||During the [[Nazi occupation of Poland]], [[SS-Obergruppenführer]] [[Wilhelm Koppe]] organized the execution of more than 30,000 Polish patients suffering from tuberculosis - little knowing or caring that by that time, a cure was nearly achieved. The isolation of [[streptomycin]] is generally considered the beginning of the modern era of tuberculosis. The revolution continues with the development of [[isoniazid]], the first oral mycobactericidal drug. The advent of [[rifampin]] in the 1970s hastens recovery times, and significantly reduces the number of tuberculosis cases in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Box 1: History of tuberculosis drug development|url=http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v12/n5/box/nrd4001_BX1.html|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raviglione|first1=Mario C.|title=Tuberculosis: The Essentials, Fourth Edition|page=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IlvvBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA113&amp;lpg=PA113&amp;dq=%22isoniazid%22+%22revolution%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mzn--kHu5t&amp;sig=cC-jsmrusNmsyZb43k_mNlBPGD0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCgOe33PnOAhVMIZAKHcNWBQsQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22isoniazid%22%20%22revolution%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universal jurisdiction''' allows [[Sovereign state|state]]s or [[international organization]]s to claim criminal [[jurisdiction]] over an accused person regardless of where the alleged crime was committed, and regardless of the accused's nationality, country of [[Residency (domicile)|residence]], or any other relation with the prosecuting entity. Crimes prosecuted under universal jurisdiction are considered crimes against all, too serious to tolerate [[jurisdictional arbitrage]]. &lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;

The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that some international norms are ''[[erga omnes]]'', or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of ''[[jus cogens]]'' – that certain international law obligations are binding on all states.&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lyal S. Sunga]] Individual Responsibility in International Law for Serious Human Rights Violations, Nijhoff (1992) 252 p. {{ISBN|978-0-7923-1453-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Amnesty International]], a proponent of universal jurisdiction, certain crimes pose so serious a threat to the international community as a whole that states have a logical and moral duty to prosecute an individual responsible; therefore, no place should be a safe haven for those who have committed [[genocide]],&lt;ref&gt;The Program for Humanitarian Policy and Conflict Research, "Brief Primer on Genocide" Accessed at {{cite web|url=http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction%3Dpage.viewpage%26pageid%3D1638 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619091806/http://ihl.ihlresearch.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=page.viewpage&amp;pageid=1638 |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]], [[extrajudicial execution]]s, [[war crime]]s, [[torture]] and [[forced disappearance]]s.&lt;ref name="AI-FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/020/2001/en/|title=UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION: Questions and answers|access-date=6 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1674]], adopted by the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 28 April 2006, "Reaffirm[ed] the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the [[2005 World Summit]] [[World Summit Outcome Document|Outcome Document]] regarding the responsibility to protect populations from [[genocide]], [[war crime]]s, [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]]" and commits the Security Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef!OpenDocument Resolution 1674 (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223154915/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef!OpenDocument |date=23 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxfam_28April"&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.uk/press/releases/unsc_280406.htm Security Council passes landmark resolution – world has responsibility to protect people from genocide] [[Oxfam]] Press Release – 28 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ''[[Institutes of Justinian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Institutes of Justinian'', Book I, Title II, "Concerning Natural Law, the Law of Nations, and the Civil Law".&lt;/ref&gt; echoing the ''Commentaries'' of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]],&lt;ref&gt;Gaius. ''Commentaries on the Roman Law'', Book I, Chapter I, "De Jure Gentium et Civili".&lt;/ref&gt; says that "All nations ... are governed partly by their own particular laws, and partly by those laws which are common to all, [those that] natural Reason appoints for all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Maine| first =Sir Henry Sumner| title =Ancient Law: Its Connection With the Early History of Society and Relation to Modern Ideas| publisher =John Murray| publication-place = London | edition = 1861 first| date =| page = 46| language = | isbn =| url = https://archive.org/stream/ancientlawitsco18maingoog#page/n58/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on the classical understanding of universal law accessible by reason, in the seventeenth century, the Dutch jurist [[Grotius]] laid the foundations for universal jurisdiction in modern international law, promulgating in his ''De Jure Pradae'' (''Of the Law of Captures'') and later ''[[De jure belli ac pacis]]'' (''Of the Law of War and Peace'') the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view that there are universal principles of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grotius|authorlink=Grotius |title=[[De Jure Pradae (book)|De Jure Pradæ: (Of the Law of Captures)]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=London |year=1604 |pages=xviii |isbn=}} (discussing in introductory notes Grotius' account of universal principles of right and wrong derived from reason and divine Will, the underpinning of much modern international law).&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, international law came to recognize the analogous concept of ''[[hostes humani generis]]'' ("enemies of the human race"): pirates, hijackers, and similar outlaws whose crimes were typically committed outside the territory of any state. The notion that heads of state and senior public officials should be treated like pirates or outlaws before the global bar of justice is, according to Henry Kissinger, a new gloss on this old concept.&lt;ref name=HK-2001/&gt; From these premises, representing the Enlightenment belief in trans-territorial, trans-cultural standards of right and wrong, derives universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Anthony Pagden|title=The Enlightenment, and Why It Still Matters |year=2013 |publisher=Random House |quote= [I]f there does exist some concept of universal justice, if even the most powerful states on occasion feel compelled to abide by the demands of international law, that we owe to the Enlightenment. | url= |isbn=978-1-4000-6068-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most notable and influential precedent for universal jurisdiction were the mid-20th century [[Nuremberg Trials]]. U.S. Justice [[Robert H. Jackson]] then chief prosecutor, famously stated that an [[International Military Tribunal]] enforcing universal principles of right and wrong could prosecute acts without a particular geographic location, Nazi "crimes against the peace of the world"—even if the acts were perfectly legal at the time in Fascist Germany. Indeed, one charge was Nazi law itself became a crime, law distorted into a bludgeon of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/nuremberg/jackson.html |title=Justice Jackson's Opening statement for the Prosecution |author=Jackson, Robert, U.S. Supreme Court Justice  |date=21 November 1945 |work= Proceedings, Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal|publisher=International Military Tribunal |accessdate=3 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nuremberg trials supposed universal standards by which one nation's laws, and acts of its officials, can be judged; an international rule of law unbound by national borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jack Goldsmith |title=The Shadow of Nuremberg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/justice-and-the-enemy-nuremberg-9-11-and-the-trial-of-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-by-william-shawcross-book-review.html |quote=The compromises of 1945 came to be seen as imperfect but essential progress toward international rule of law and the foundation for modern international criminal tribunals. |work=[[New York Times]] |date= January 20, 2012|accessdate=2016-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, even at the time the Nuremberg trials appeared to be victor's justice, revenge papered over with legal simulcra. US Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Harlan F. Stone|Harlan Fiske Stone]] remarked that his colleague Justice Jackson acting as Nuremberg Chief prosecutor was "conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg. I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas."&lt;ref&gt;Alpheus T. Mason, Harlan Fiske Stone: Pillar of the Law (New York: Viking, 1956), p. 716.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kenneth Roth]], the executive director of [[Human Rights Watch]], argues that universal jurisdiction allowed Israel to try [[Adolf Eichmann]] in Jerusalem in 1961. Roth also argues that clauses in treaties such as the [[Geneva Convention]]s of 1949 and the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]] of 1984, which requires signatory states to pass [[municipal law]]s that are based on the concept of universal jurisdiction, indicate widespread international acceptance of the concept.&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt;

==Universal distinct from extraterritorial jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction differs from a state's prosecuting crimes under its own laws, whether on its own territory ([[territorial jurisdiction]]) or  abroad ([[extraterritorial jurisdiction]]). As an example, the United States asserts jurisdiction over stateless vessels carrying illicit drugs on international waters—but here the US reaches across national borders to enforce its own law, rather than invoking universal jurisdiction and trans-national standards of right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Neil Boister |title=An Introduction to Transnational Criminal Law |year=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |quote=   | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kElWbHK0JF8C&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=us+transnational+criminal+jurisdiction&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ohc-p-b-Tm&amp;sig=BSde-49gTF84cpZEEwvpzCvEX5U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZzt_XlsjLAhWHVh4KHYfrDyAQ6AEIZzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=us%20transnational%20criminal%20jurisdiction&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-19-960538-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

States attempting to police acts committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory tends to be more controversial than a state prosecuting its own citizens wherever they may be found. Bases on which a state might exercise jurisdiction in this way include the following:

*The least controversial basis is that under which a state can exercise jurisdiction over acts that affect the fundamental interests of the state, such as [[espionage|spying]], even if the act was committed by foreign nationals on foreign territory. For example, the Indian [[Information Technology Act 2000]] largely supports the extraterritoriality of the said Act. The law states that a contravention of the Act that affects any computer or computer network situated in India will be punishable by India irrespective of the culprit's location and nationality.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph--&gt;
*Also relatively non-controversial is the ability of a state to try its own nationals for crimes committed abroad. France and some other nations will refuse to [[extradition|extradite]] their own citizens as a matter of law, but will instead try them on their own territory for crimes committed abroad.
*More controversial is the exercise of jurisdiction where the victim of the crime is a national of the state exercising jurisdiction. In the past some states have claimed this jurisdiction (e.g., Mexico, ''Cutting Case'' (1887)), while others have been strongly opposed to it (e.g., the United States, except in cases in which an American citizen is a victim: ''US v Yunis'' (1988)). In more recent years, however, a broad global consensus has emerged in permitting its use in the case of torture, "forced disappearances" or terrorist offences (due in part to it being permitted by the various United Nations conventions on terrorism); but its application in other areas is still highly controversial. For example, former dictator of Chile [[Augusto Pinochet]] was arrested in London in 1998, on Spanish judge [[Baltazar Garzon]]'s demand, on charges of human rights abuses, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction but rather on the grounds that some of the victims of the abuses committed in Chile were Spanish citizens. Spain then sought his [[extradition]] from Britain, again, not on the grounds of universal jurisdiction, but by invoking the law of the [[European Union]] regarding extradition; and he was finally released on grounds of health. Argentinian [[Alfredo Astiz]]'s sentence is part of this juridical frame.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}&lt;!--sources needed for whole paragraph and specifically for the quote--&gt;

==International tribunals invoking universal jurisdiction==
[[File:ICC member states world map.png|thumb|States parties to the Statute of the [[International Criminal Court]] (light green means ratification or accession deposited but not yet in force, brown means signed but not yet ratified).]]
Established in [[The Hague]] in 2002, the International Criminal Court (ICC) is an international tribunal of general jurisdiction (defined by treaty) to prosecute state-members' citizens for genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression, as specified by several international agreements, most prominently the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]] signed in 1998.  Universal jurisdiction over the crimes enumerated in the Rome Statute was rejected by the signing parties, however universal jurisdiction is what allows the United Nations Security Council to refer specific situations to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&amp;context=bjil&lt;/ref&gt;  This has only happened with Darfur (2005) and Libya (2011).

In addition the United Nations has set up geographically specific courts to investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity under a theory of universal jurisdiction, such as the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (1994), and the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (1993).

The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia investigates war crimes that took place in the Balkans in the 1990s.  It convicted former Bosnian Serb leader [[Radovan Karadžić]] on 10 charges relating to directing murders, purges and other abuses against civilians, including genocide in connection with the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica; he was sentenced to 40 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Murphy  |title=U.N. tribunal finds former Bosnia Serb leader guilty of genocide |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/un-tribunal-finds-former-bosnia-serb-leader-guilty-of-genocide/2016/03/24/1a9f1066-f1c9-11e5-85a6-2132cf446d0a_story.html?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_karadzic_11am%3Ahomepage%2Fstory |quote= |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=March 24, 2016 |accessdate=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular states invoking universal jurisdiction==
Universal jurisdiction may be asserted by a particular nation as well as by an international tribunal. The result is the same: individuals become answerable for crimes defined and prosecuted regardless of where they live, or where the conduct occurred; crimes said to be so grievous as to be universally condemned.

Amnesty International argues that since the end of the Second World War over fifteen states have conducted investigations, commenced prosecutions and completed trials based on universal jurisdiction for the crimes or arrested people with a view to extraditing the persons to a state seeking to prosecute them. These states include: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, [[Israel]], Mexico, Netherlands, [[Senegal]], Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref name="AI-FAQ"/&gt;  Amnesty writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt; All states parties to the [[UN Convention Against Torture|Convention against Torture]] and the [[Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture|Inter-American Convention]] are obliged whenever a person suspected of torture is found in their territory to submit the case to their prosecuting authorities for the purposes of prosecution, or to extradite that person. In addition, it is now widely recognized that states, even those that are not states parties to these treaties, may exercise universal jurisdiction over torture under customary international law.&lt;ref name=AI-UJ&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/012/2001/en/?OpenDocument Universal Jurisdiction: The duty of states to enact and implement legislation – Chapter Nine (Torture: The legal basis for universal jurisdiction)], [[Amnesty International]] 1 September 2001. Section II. Universal Jurisdiction over torture &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Examples of particular states invoking universal jurisdiction are Israel's prosecution of Eichmann in 1961 (see {{section link||Israel}} below) and Spain's prosecution of South American dictators and torturers (see {{section link||Spain}} below).  More recently, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] tried first in Switzerland and then in Canada to prosecute former US President [[George W. Bush]] on behalf of persons tortured in US detention camps, invoking the universal jurisdiction doctrine. Bush cancelled his trip to Switzerland after news of the planned prosecution came to light. Bush has traveled to Canada but the Canadian government shut down the prosecution in advance of his arrest.&lt;ref name = "Center Prosecution"&gt;{{cite news |author=Matt Eisenbrandt |author2=Katherine Gallagher |title=Halting Canadian Bush Prosecution Violated International Obligations|url=http://jurist.org/hotline/2012/01/eisenbrandt-gallagher-bush.php |work=[[Jurist]] | quote=Canada disregarded an opportunity to shatter the global impunity Bush enjoys and in so doing violated international law. |date=January 17, 2012  |accessdate=2016-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center has filed a grievance with the United Nations for Canada's failure to invoke universal jurisdiction to enforce the [[Convention Against Torture]], a petition on which action is pending.&lt;ref name = "Center Prosecution"/&gt;

==Immunity for state officials==
On 14 February 2002, the International Court of Justice in the [[Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|''ICJ Arrest Warrant Case'']] concluded that state officials may have immunity under international law while serving in office. The court stated that immunity was not granted to state officials for their own benefit, but instead to ensure the effective performance of their functions on behalf of their respective states. The court also stated that when abroad, state officials may enjoy immunity from arrest in another state on criminal charges, including charges of war crimes or crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name=ICJ-PR-020214&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2002/afr379.html|title=ICJ rejects Belgian arrest warrant for foreign ministers of Democratic Republic of Congo|publisher=United Nations Information Service|date=14 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the ICJ qualified its conclusions, saying that state officers "may be subject to criminal proceedings before certain international criminal courts, where they have jurisdiction. Examples include the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda&amp;nbsp;..., and the future International Criminal Court."&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003-fn6&gt;Cesare P.R. Romano and André Nollkaemper. ''[http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh110.htm#_ednref6 The Arrest Warrant Against The Liberian President, Charles Taylor]'', on the website of the [[American Society of International Law]], June 2003. Cites in footnote 6: Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium), Judgment, Merits, para. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Charles G. Taylor|Charles Taylor]], the former president of [[Liberia]], was served with an arrest warrant by the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]] (SCSL) that was set up under the auspices of a treaty that binds only the United Nations and the Government of Sierra Leone.&lt;ref name=CRAN-2003&gt;Cesare P.R. Romano and André Nollkaemper. ''[http://www.asil.org/insights/insigh110.htm The Arrest Warrant Against The Liberian President, Charles Taylor]'', on the website of the [[American Society of International Law]], June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor contested the Special Court's jurisdiction, claiming immunity, but the Special Court for Sierra Leone concluded in 2004 that "the sovereign equality of states does not prevent a head of state from being prosecuted before an international criminal tribunal or court".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sc-sl.org/CASES/ProsecutorvsCharlesTaylor/tabid/107/Default.aspx&lt; |title=Prosecutor v. Charles Ghankay Taylor, Summary of Decision on Immunity From Jurisdiction  |author=Appellate Tribunal |date=31 May 2004 |work= Case Number SCSL-2003-01-I|publisher=, Special Court of Sierra Leone |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Special Court convicted Taylor in 2012 and sentenced him to fifty years' imprisonment, making him the first head of state since the [[Nuremberg Trials]] after World War II to be tried and convicted by an international court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/world/africa/charles-taylor-sentenced-to-50-years-for-war-crimes.html|title=Judge Gives Taylor 50 Years for ‘Heinous’ Crimes in War |author1=Simons, Marlise  |author2=Goodman, J. David |lastauthoramp=yes |date=31 May 2004 |work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, the question whether a former head of state might have immunity depends on which international court or tribunal endeavors to try him, how the court is constituted, and how it interprets its own mandate.

===Australia===

The High Court of Australia confirmed the authority of the Australian Parliament, under the Australian Constitution, to exercise universal jurisdiction over war crimes in the ''[[Polyukhovich v Commonwealth]]'' case of 1991.

===Belgium===
In 1993, Belgium's Parliament passed a "law of universal jurisdiction" (sometimes referred to as "Belgium's genocide law"), allowing it to judge people accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. In 2001, four Rwandan citizens were convicted and given sentences from 12 to 20 years' imprisonment for their involvement in 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/french/press/2003/justice02.htm |title=Belgique : Questions et Réponses sur la loi de Compétence Universelle |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a rapid succession of cases:
*Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] was accused of involvement in the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]] in Lebanon, conducted by a Christian militia;
*Israelis filed a case against [[Yasser Arafat]] on grounds of responsibility for terrorist activity;
*In 2003, Iraqi victims of a [[Gulf War|1991 Bagdad bombing]] pressed charges against [[George Herbert Walker Bush|George H.W. Bush]], [[Colin Powell]] and [[Dick Cheney]].

Confronted with this sharp increase in cases, Belgium established the condition that the accused person must be Belgian or present in Belgium. An arrest warrant issued in 2000 under this law, against the then Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was challenged before the [[International Court of Justice]] in the case entitled ''[[Arrest Warrant of 11 April 2000 (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Belgium)|ICJ Arrest Warrant Case]]''. The ICJ's decision issued on 14 February 2002 found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider the question of universal jurisdiction, instead deciding the question on the basis of immunity of high-ranking state officials.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061002112703/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214.PDF ICJ's decision] See paragraph 43&lt;/ref&gt; However, the matter was addressed in separate and dissenting opinions,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313044438/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/iCOBEframe.htm separate and dissenting opinions]&lt;/ref&gt; such as that of President Guillaume who concluded that universal jurisdiction exists only in relation to piracy;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/121/8128.pdf separate opinion of President Guillaume] at paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt; and the dissenting opinion of Judge Oda who recognised piracy, hijacking, terrorism and genocide as crimes subject to universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20020312003750/http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/idocket/iCOBE/icobejudgment/icobe_ijudgment_20020214_oda.PDF dissenting opinion of Judge Oda], paragraph 12&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2003, Belgium repealed the law on universal jurisdiction, and introduced a new law on [[extraterritorial jurisdiction]] similar to or more restrictive than that of most other European countries. However, some cases that had already started continued. These included those concerning the Rwandan genocide, and complaints filed against the Chadian ex-President [[Hissène Habré]] (dubbed the "African [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/08/belgium080103.htm|title=Belgium: Universal Jurisdiction Law Repealed|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|date=1 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005, Habré was indicted for crimes against humanity, torture, war crimes and other human rights violations by a Belgian court. Arrested in [[Senegal]] following requests from Senegalese courts, he was tried and convicted for war crimes by the Special Tribunal in Senegal in 2016 and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html Trial Watch : Hissène Habré] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413081352/http://www.trial-ch.org/fr/trial-watch/profil/db/facts/hissene_habre_87.html |date=13 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

To implement the Rome Statute, Canada passed the [[Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act]]. [[Michael Byers (Canadian author)|Michael Byers]], a [[University of British Columbia]] law professor, has argued that these laws go further than the Rome Statute, providing Canadian courts with jurisdiction over acts pre-dating the ICC and occurring in territories outside of ICC member-states; "as a result, anyone who is present in Canada and alleged to have committed genocide, torture ... anywhere, at any time, can be prosecuted [in Canada]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael Byers|title=Intent for a Nation|year=2007 |publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-1-55365-250-2|page=111 |authorlink=Michael Byers (Canadian author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===

A Finnish high court sentenced a Rwandan preacher to life in jail in 2010 for his participation in Rwanda's genocide in 1994. Francois Bazaramba, 59, moved in 2003 to Finland seeking asylum. Finland allows prosecutions for crimes against humanity wherever they are committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10294529 | work=BBC News | title=Finland sentences Rwanda preacher to life for genocide | date=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the genocide, he was a pastor in the Baptist church in Nyakizu in southern Rwanda. According to Finnish newspaper ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', the court found him guilty of orchestrating deadly attacks, and organising the torching of Tutsi homes. In a statement the court said he had spread anti-Tutsi propaganda and incited "killings through fomenting anger and contempt towards Tutsis". It stated that "The court has found Bazaramba guilty of an offence which without a genocidal intent would be judged as a murder or incitement to murder ... For those crimes, the only possible punishment is life imprisonment." ''Helsingin Sanomat'' reported that he was acquitted of 10 counts of murder and of providing training and acquiring weapons. During the trial, the court heard from 68 witnesses, travelling to Rwanda and Tanzania to hear some testimonies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Germany===

Germany has implemented the principle of universal jurisdiction for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes into its criminal law through the "'''''Völkerstrafgesetzbuch"''''' or '''''VStGB''''' ("international criminal code", literally "book of the criminal law of peoples"), which implemented the treaty creating the [[International Criminal Court]] into domestic law. The law was passed in 2002 and up to 2014 it has been used once, in the trial of [[Rwanda]]n rebel leader [[Ignace Murwanashyaka]]. In 2015 he was found guilty and sentenced to 13 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://armedgroups-internationallaw.org/2015/09/28/conviction-of-fdlr-leaders-by-german-court/ | title=Conviction of FDLR leaders by German Court | work= Armed Groups and International Law | date=28 September 2015 | accessdate=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/05/us-tells-armed-group-drc-surrender-military-option|title = US tells armed group in DRC to surrender or face 'military option'|date = 5 Aug 2014|work = |accessdate = 19 Nov 2014|publisher = The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===

{{Main|Adolf Eichmann}}
The [[moral philosophy|moral philosopher]] [[Peter Singer]], along with Kenneth Roth,&lt;ref name=KR-2001/&gt; has cited [[Israel]]'s prosecution of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1961 as an assertion of universal jurisdiction. He claims that while Israel did invoke a statute specific to [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] crimes against Jews, its [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] claimed universal jurisdiction over crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Singer |title=One World |year=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=114 |isbn=0-300-09686-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eichmann's defense lawyer argued that Israel did not have jurisdiction on account of Israel not having come into existence until 1948. The Genocide Convention also did not come into effect until 1951, and the Genocide Convention does not automatically provide for universal jurisdiction. It is also argued that Israeli agents obtained Eichmann illegally, violating international law when they seized and kidnapped Eichmann, and brought him to Israel to stand trial. The Argentinian government settled the dispute diplomatically with Israel.&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Attorney General of Israel v. Eichmann |vol=Criminal Case 40/61 |reporter= |court=District Court of Jerusalem |date=1961 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ }} {{citation|title=Transcripts |accessdate=6 February 2013 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |  archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061001235018/http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/ |archivedate = 1 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel argued universal jurisdiction based on the "universal character of the crimes in question" and that the crimes committed by Eichmann were not only in violation of Israel law, but were considered "grave offenses against the law of nations itself".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt; It also asserted that the crime of genocide is covered under international customary law. As a supplemental form of jurisdiction, a further argument is made on the basis of protective jurisdiction. Protective jurisdiction is a principle that "provides that states may exercise jurisdiction over aliens who have committed an act abroad which is deemed prejudicial to the security of the particular state concerned".&lt;ref name = EichmannTrial/&gt;

In November 2011, the [[Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission]] purportedly exercised universal jurisdiction to [[trial in absentia|try and convict ''in absentia'']] former US President [[George W.

===Senegal===

In July 2015, the first trial in Africa of a universal jurisdiction case relating to crimes committed abroad by a foreigner with foreign victims was held in a Senegalese courtroom. The former dictator of [[Chad]], [[Hissène Habré]], denied the legitimacy of the special court set up to try him in Senegal for the deaths of thousands during his rule, but the head of the tribunal, [[Gberdao Gustave Kam]], said he would be compelled to participate.  Mr. Habré's lawyers said he was forced to attend the first day of his trial for crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture. The case was lauded by [[Human Rights Watch]]. It was also the first time the courts of one country are prosecuting the former ruler of another for alleged human rights crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/ex-dictator-of-chad-denies-legitimacy-of-torture-crimes-trial-in-senegal/article25599568/ theglobeandmail.com: "Ex-dictator of Chad denies legitimacy of torture crimes trial in Senegal"], 20 Jul 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===

Spanish law recognizes the principle of universal jurisdiction. Article 23.4 of the Judicial Power Organization Act (LOPJ), enacted on 1 July 1985, establishes that Spanish courts have jurisdiction over crimes committed by Spaniards or foreign citizens outside Spain when such crimes can be described according to Spanish criminal law as genocide, terrorism, or some other, as well as any other crime that, according to international treaties or conventions, must be prosecuted in Spain. On 25 July 2009, the Spanish Congress passed a law that limits the competence of the [[Audiencia Nacional of Spain|Audiencia Nacional]] under Article 23.4 to cases in which Spaniards are victims, there is a relevant link to Spain, or the alleged perpetrators are in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain reins in crusading judges |publisher=BBC News | date=25 June 2009 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8119920.stm |first=Steve |last=Kingstone}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law still has to pass the Senate, the high chamber, but passage is expected because it is supported by both major parties.&lt;ref name="The Associated Press"&gt;{{cite news | title=Spanish court ends Israel bombing probe | url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g7nVX6JkK9c3ofnkBpgD_5eFF84AD9950VPO0 | agency=Associated Press | date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009 a court in London issued an arrest warrant for [[Tzipi Livni]]  in connection with accusations of [[war crimes]] in the Gaza Strip during [[Operation Cast Lead]] (2008–2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/14/tzipi-livni-israel-gaza-arrest |work=The Guardian | location=London | title=British court issued Gaza arrest warrant for former Israeli minister Tzipi Livni | first=Ian | last=Black | date=14 December 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrant was issued on 12 December and revoked on 14 December 2009 after it was revealed that Livni had not entered British territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1134978.html |title=Foreign Ministry outraged over U.K. arrest warrant against Livni |newspaper=Haaretz |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warrant was later denounced as "cynical" by the Israeli foreign ministry, while Livni's office said she was "proud of all her decisions in Operation Cast Lead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8413234.stm |publisher=BBC News | title = Israel condemns attempt in a UK court to arrest Livni|date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livni herself called the arrest warrant "an abuse of the British legal system".&lt;ref name="UK warrant"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8415123.stm |date=14 December 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=14 December 2009 |title=Tzipi Livni: UK warrant a legal 'abuse'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly a January visit to Britain by a team of [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) was cancelled over concerns that arrest warrants would be sought by pro-Palestinian advocates in connection with allegations of [[war crimes]] under laws of universal jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/14/tzipi-livni-israel-gaza-arrest| title= Israeli military cancels UK visit over arrest fears |work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Ian | last=Black | date=14 December 2009 | accessdate=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
While the United States has no formal statute authorizing it, in some cases the Federal government has exercised [[self-help (law)|self-help]] in apprehending or killing persons suspected of conspiring to commit crimes within the United States from outside of the country, or committing crimes against U.S officials outside of the United States. This has occurred even when the suspect is not a U.S. person, has never been in the United States, and even when the person has never conspired or assisted in the commission of a crime within the United States, there is a functioning government which could try the person for the crime committed there, and notwithstanding the existence of a proper extradition treaty between that country and the United States, ignoring the provisions of the treaty and capturing or killing the person directly.

In 1985, Dr. Humberto Alvarez-Machain, a [[Mexico|Mexican]] national, allegedly assisted in the torture and murder of a U.S. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent in Mexico. Notwithstanding that the U.S had an extradition treaty with Mexico (and because the Mexican government declined to extradite a Mexican national to the U.S. for a crime allegedly committed in Mexico), the U.S. Government hired a private citizen and some Mexican nationals to essentially act as mercenaries, who then went into Mexico, kidnapped Dr. Alvarez-Machain, and brought him back to the U.S. for trial for the crime committed in Mexico. The trial court ruled that since Alvarez-Machain had been brought to the U.S. in violation of the treaty, his arrest was unlawful. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]], in ''[[United States v. Alvarez-Machain]]'', ruled that notwithstanding the existence of an extradition treaty with Mexico, it was still legal for the U.S. government to exercise self-help and essentially grab him off the street in Mexico ("forcible abduction") to bring him back to the U.S. for trial. In Alvarez-Machain's subsequent criminal trial, he was acquitted, and he lost a civil suit he filed for false arrest against the government.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Environment Day''' ('''WED''') is celebrated on the 5th of June every year, and is the [[United Nations|United Nation's]] principal vehicle for encouraging awareness and action for the [[environmental protection|protection of our environment]]. First held in 1974, it has been a flagship campaign for raising awareness on emerging [[environmental issue]]s from [[marine pollution]], human [[overpopulation]], and [[global warming]], to [[sustainable consumption]] and wildlife crime. WED has grown to become a global platform for public outreach, with participation from over 143 countries annually. Each year, WED has a new theme that major corporations, NGOs, communities, governments and celebrities worldwide adopt to advocate environmental causes.

==History==
World Environment Day [WED] was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] in 1972&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/events/environmentday/background.shtml|title=World Environment Day - 5 June|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the first day of the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]], resulting from discussions on the integration of human interactions and the environment. Two years later, in 1974 the first WED was held with the theme "Only One Earth". Even though WED celebration have been held annually since 1974, in 1987 the idea for rotating the center of these activities through selecting different host countries began.

== Annual themes and major initiatives and accomplishments ==

===World Environment Day Anthem===
An Earth Anthem penned by poet [[Abhay K]] is sung to celebrate World Environment Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nation.lk/online/2015/05/30/world-environment-day.html World Environment Day] The Nation, Sri Lanka,  30 May 2015 &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Our cosmic oasis, cosmic blue pearl
the most beautiful planet in the universe
all the continents and the oceans 
united we stand as flora and fauna
united we stand as species of one earth
different cultures, beliefs and ways
we are humans, the earth is our home
all the people and the nations of the world
all for one and one for all
united we unfurl the blue flag.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2786">The '''World Mental Health Survey Initiative''' is a collaborative project by [[World Health Organization]], [[Harvard University]], [[University of Michigan]], and country-based researchers worldwide to coordinate the analysis and implementation of [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] [[Survey (human research)|surveys]] of [[Mental_disorder|mental]] and [[Behavioral disorder|behavioral]] disorders and substance abuse in all [[World_Health_Organization#Regional_offices|WHO Regions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Mental Health Survey Initiative|url=https://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/wmh/|website=Harvard Medical School|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Mental Health Survey Initiative|url=https://www.src.isr.umich.edu/international/world-mental-health-survey-initiative/|website=University of Michigan|accessdate=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aim ==
It is estimated that the burden of mental and addictive disorders are among the highest in the world with expected increase over the next decades. However, those estimations are not based on [[Cross-sectional_study|cross-sectional]] [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] [[Survey (human research)|surveys]], rather, they are mainly based on [[literature reviews]] and isolated studies.
The WMH Survey Initiative aim is to accurately address the global burden of mental disorders by obtaining accurate cross-sectional information about the prevalences and correlates of mental and behavioral disorders as well as substance abuse, allowing for evaluation of risk factors and study of patterns of service use in order to target appropriate interventions.

== Collaborators ==
Collaborators in this survey come from all WHO regions of the world, with 27 participating countries.

[[File:Castle romeo2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Nuclear warfare]] is often a common theme of World War III scenarios. Such a conflict could result in the [[Human extinction|extinction of mankind itself]].]]
'''World War III''' ('''WWIII''' or '''WW3''') and the '''Third World War''' are names given to a hypothetical third [[World war|worldwide large-scale military conflict]] subsequent to [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The term has been in use since at least as early as 1941. Some have applied it loosely to refer to limited or smaller conflicts such as the [[Cold War]] or the [[War on Terror]], while others have operated under the assumption that such a conflict would surpass both prior world wars in both the level of its widespread scope and of its overall destructive impact.&lt;ref name="einstein"&gt;The New Quotable Einstein. By Alice Calaprice (2005), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the [[Manhattan Project|development]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use]] of [[nuclear weapon]]s near the end of World War II and their subsequent acquisition and deployment by [[List of states with nuclear weapons|many countries]], the potential risk of a nuclear devastation of Earth's civilization and life is a common theme in speculations of a Third World War. Another major concern is that [[biological warfare]] could cause a very large number of casualties, either intentionally or inadvertently by an accidental release of a biological agent, the unexpected mutation of an agent, or its adaptation to other species after use. High-scale [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]] events like these, caused by advanced technology used for destruction, could potentially make [[Earth's surface]] uninhabitable.

Prior to the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914–1918) was believed to have been the "[[The war to end war|war to end all wars]]," as it was popularly believed that never again could there possibly be a global conflict of such magnitude. During the inter-war period between the two world wars, WWI was typically referred to simply as "The Great War." The outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 disproved the hope that mankind might have already "outgrown" the need for such widespread global wars.

With the advent of the Cold War in 1945 and with the spread of nuclear weapons technology to the [[Soviet Union]], the possibility of a third global conflict became more plausible. During the Cold War years the possibility of a Third World War was anticipated and planned for by military and civil authorities in many countries. Scenarios ranged from [[conventional warfare]] to limited or total nuclear warfare. At the height of the Cold War, a scenario referred to as [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutually Assured Destruction]] ("MAD") had been calculated which determined that an all-out nuclear confrontation would most certainly destroy all or nearly all human life on the planet. The potential absolute destruction of the human race may have contributed to the ability of both American and Soviet leaders to avoid such a scenario.

===''Time'' magazine===
''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine was an early adopter if not originator of the "World War III."  Perhaps the first usage appears in its 3 November 1941, issue (preceding the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] on 7 December 1941) under its "National Affairs" section and entitled "World War III?" about [[Nazi]] refugee Dr. [[Hermann Rauschning]], who had just arrived in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;

==Military plans==
Military planners have been war gaming various scenarios, preparing for the worst, since the early days of the Cold War. Some of those plans are now out of date and have been partially or fully declassified.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Operation Unthinkable===
{{main|Operation Unthinkable}}
[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] was concerned that, with the enormous size of Soviet forces deployed in Europe at the end of WWII and the unreliability of the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], there was a serious threat to Western Europe. In April–May 1945, [[British Armed Forces]] developed [[Operation Unthinkable]], thought to be the first scenario of the Third World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book |author1=Jonathan Walker |title=Operation Unthinkable: The Third World War|date=2013 |publisher=[[The History Press]] |isbn=978-0-7524-8718-2 |page=192 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary goal was "to impose upon Russia the will of the United States and the British Empire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = British War Cabinet, Joint Planning Staff, Public Record Office, CAB 120/691/109040 / 002 | date = 11 August 1945 | url = http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/| title = Operation Unthinkable: 'Russia: Threat to Western Civilization'| format = online photocopy| publisher = Department of History, Northeastern University| accessdate = 28 June 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080706093010/http://www.history.neu.edu/PRO2/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;| archivedate = 6 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was rejected by the British [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]] as militarily unfeasible.

===Operation Dropshot===
{{Main|Operation Dropshot}}
"Operation Dropshot" was the 1950s United States contingency plan for a possible [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and conventional war with the [[Soviet Union]] in the Western European and Asian theaters.

At the time the US nuclear arsenal was limited in size, based mostly in the United States, and depended on bombers for delivery. "Dropshot" included mission profiles that would have used 300 nuclear bombs and 29,000 high-explosive bombs on 200 targets in 100 cities and towns to wipe out 85% of the Soviet Union's industrial potential at a single stroke. Between 75 and 100 of the 300 nuclear weapons were targeted to destroy Soviet combat aircraft on the ground.

The scenario was devised prior to the development of [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s. It was also devised before [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] and his [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] changed the US Nuclear War plan from the 'city killing' countervalue strike plan to a "counterforce" plan (targeted more at military forces). Nuclear weapons at this time were not accurate enough to hit a naval base without destroying the city adjacent to it, so the aim in using them was to destroy the enemy industrial capacity in an effort to cripple their war economy.

===Exercises Grand Slam, Longstep, and Mainbrace===
{{main|Exercise Longstep|Exercise Grand Slam|Exercise Mainbrace}}
In January 1950, the [[North Atlantic Council]] approved NATO's military strategy of [[containment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/3.htm |title=Chapter 3 – The Pace Quickens |accessdate=2011-09-19 |work=NATO the first five years 1949–1954 |publisher=[[NATO]] |author=Lord Ismay}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO military planning took on a renewed urgency following the outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in the early 1950s, prompting NATO to establish a "force under a centralised command, adequate to deter aggression and to ensure the defence of Western Europe". [[Allied Command Europe]] was established under [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[US Army]], on 2 April 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nato.int/archives/1st5years/chapters/4.htm |title=Chapter 4 – The Pace Quickens |accessdate=2011-09-19 |work=NATO the first five years 1949–1954 |publisher=[[NATO]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author="X"|authorlink= George F.

Exercise Mainbrace brought together 200 ships and over 50,000 personnel to practice the defence of Denmark and Norway from Russian attack in 1952. It was the first major NATO exercise. The exercise was jointly commanded by [[Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic]] [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Lynde D. McCormick]], [[United States Navy|USN]], and [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe#Supreme Allied Commander Europe .28SACEUR.29|Supreme Allied Commander Europe]] [[General (United States)|General]] [[Matthew B. Ridgeway]], [[US Army]], during the autumn of 1952.

The US, UK, Canada, France, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Netherlands, and Belgium all participated.

Exercises Grand Slam and Longstep were naval exercises held in the Mediterranean Sea during 1952 to practice dislodging an enemy occupying force and amphibious assault. It involved over 170 warships and 700 aircraft under the overall command of Admiral Carney. The overall exercise commander, Admiral Carney summarized the accomplishments of Exercise Grand Slam by stating: "We have demonstrated that the senior commanders of all four powers can successfully take charge of a mixed task force and handle it effectively as a working unit."{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The USSR called the exercises "war-like acts" by NATO, with particular reference to the participation of [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]], and prepared for its own military maneuvers in the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet Zone]].&lt;ref name=Time2&gt;''Time'', 29 September 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sidney&gt;"NATO Ships Enter Baltic Sea" – ''Sydney Morning Herald'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Strikeback===
{{main|Operation Strikeback}}
This was a major NATO naval exercise held in 1957, simulating a response to an all-out Soviet attack on NATO. The exercise involved over 200 warships, 650 aircraft, and 75,000 personnel from the [[United States Navy]], the United Kingdom's [[Royal Navy]], the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], the [[French Navy]], the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]], and the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]]. As the largest peacetime naval operation up to that time, Operation Strikeback was characterized by military analyst [[Hanson W. Baldwin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "constituting the strongest striking fleet assembled since World War II".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |last=Baldwin |first=Hanson W. |authorlink=Hanson W.

===Exercise Reforger===
[[File:Earnest Will Gas King.jpg|thumb|237px|If activated, Operation Reforger would have largely consisted of convoys like this one from [[Operation Earnest Will]] in 1987, although much larger. While troops could easily fly across the Atlantic, the heavy equipment and armor reinforcements would have to come by sea.]]
{{Main|Exercise Reforger}}{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}

Exercise Reforger (from '''re'''turn of '''for'''ces to '''Ger'''many) was an annual exercise conducted, during the Cold War, by [[NATO]]. The exercise was intended to ensure that NATO had the ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the [[Warsaw Pact]].
The Warsaw Pact outnumbered NATO throughout the Cold War in conventional forces, especially armor. Therefore, in the event of a Soviet invasion, in order not to resort to tactical nuclear strikes, NATO forces holding the line against a Warsaw Pact armored spearhead would have to be quickly resupplied and replaced. Most of this support would have come across the Atlantic from the US and Canada.

Reforger was not merely a show of force—in the event of a conflict, it would be the actual plan to strengthen the NATO presence in Europe. In that instance, it would have been referred to as Operation Reforger. Important components in Reforger included the [[Military Airlift Command]], the [[Military Sealift Command]], and the [[Civil Reserve Air Fleet]].

===Seven Days to the River Rhine===
{{Main|Seven Days to the River Rhine}}
[[File:Probable Axes of Attack.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A Warsaw Pact invasion would have come via three main paths through West Germany.]]
Seven Days to the River Rhine was a top secret military simulation exercise developed in 1979 by the Warsaw Pact. It started with the assumption that NATO would launch a nuclear attack on the [[Vistula]] river valley in a [[first strike|first-strike]] scenario, which would result in as many as two million Polish civilian casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|author=Nicholas Watt in Warsaw |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/26/russia.poland#article_continue |title=Poland risks Russia's wrath with Soviet nuclear attack map &amp;#124; World news |journal=The Guardian |date=2005-11-26 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a Soviet counter-strike would be carried out against [[West Germany]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Denmark]], with Warsaw Pact forces invading West Germany and aiming to stop at the River Rhine by the seventh day. Other USSR plans stopped only upon reaching the French border on day nine. Individual Warsaw Pact states were only assigned their own subpart of the strategic picture; in this case, the Polish forces were only expected to go as far as Germany. The Seven Days to the Rhine plan envisioned that Poland and Germany would be largely destroyed by nuclear exchanges, and that large numbers of troops would die of [[radiation sickness]]. It was estimated that NATO would fire nuclear weapons behind the advancing Soviet lines to cut off their supply lines and thus blunt their advance. While this plan assumed that NATO would use nuclear weapons to push back any Warsaw Pact invasion, it did not include nuclear strikes on France or the United Kingdom. Newspapers speculated when this plan was declassified, that France and the UK were not to be hit in an effort to get them to withhold use of their own nuclear weapons.

===Exercise Able Archer===
{{main|Able Archer 83}}
[[File:Reagan and Gordievsky.jpg|thumb|right|upright|President [[Ronald Reagan]] and Soviet double agent [[Oleg Gordievsky]], who later told the west how close the Able Archer 83 exercise had brought the Soviets to ordering a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|First Strike]].]]
Exercise Able Archer was an annual exercise by the United States military in Europe that practiced command and control procedures, with emphasis on transition from solely conventional operations to chemical, nuclear, and conventional operations during a time of war.

"Able Archer 83" was a five-day [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) [[command post]] [[military exercise|exercise]] starting on 7 November 1983, that spanned [[Western Europe]], centered on the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) Headquarters in [[Casteau]], north of the city of [[Mons]]. Able Archer exercises simulated a period of [[conflict escalation]], culminating in a coordinated [[nuclear attack]].&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/a-cold-war-conundrum/source.htm#HEADING1-12|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|title=A Cold War Conundrum: The 1983 Soviet War Scare|author=Benjamin B.

The realistic nature of the 1983 exercise, coupled with [[Cold War (1979–85)|deteriorating relations]] between the United States and the Soviet Union and the anticipated arrival of [[Nuclear strategy|strategic]] [[Pershing II]] nuclear missiles in Europe, led some members of the Soviet Politburo and military to believe that Able Archer 83 was a [[ruse of war]], obscuring preparations for a genuine nuclear [[first strike]].&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov's Instructions'', 85–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fischer Reversal 123,31"&gt;Beth Fischer, ''Reagan Reversal'', 123, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pry Scare 37–9"&gt;Pry, ''War Scare'', 37–9.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Soviets readied their nuclear forces and placed air units in [[East Germany]] and [[History of Poland (1945–89)|Poland]] on alert.&lt;ref&gt;Oberdorfer, ''A New Era'', 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "SNIE 84"&gt;''SNIE 11–10–84'' "Implications of Recent Soviet Military-Political Activities" Central Intelligence Agency, 18 May 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;
This "1983 war scare" is considered by many historians to be the closest the world has come to [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] since the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Lewis Gaddis |author-link=John Lewis Gaddis |author2=John Hashimoto |last-author-amp=yes |title=COLD WAR Chat: Professor John Lewis Gaddis, Historian |url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/guides/debate/chats/gaddis |accessdate=2005-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901185224/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/guides/debate/chats/gaddis/ |archivedate=1 September 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat of nuclear war ended with the conclusion of the exercise on 11 November, however.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew and Gordievsky, ''Comrade Kryuchkov's Instructions'', 87–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pry Scare 43–4"&gt;Pry, ''War Scare'', 43–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic Defense Initiative===
{{main|Strategic Defense Initiative}}
The Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) was proposed by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] on 23 March 1983.&lt;ref name="fas_milestones"&gt;[[Federation of American Scientists]]. [https://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/milestone.htm Missile Defense Milestones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306023546/http://fas.org/spp/starwars/program/milestone.htm |date=6 March 2016 }}. Accessed 10 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In the later part of his [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|presidency]], numerous factors (which included watching the 1983 movie ''[[The Day After]]'' and hearing through a Soviet defector that [[Able Archer 83]] almost triggered a Russian [[first strike]]) had turned Ronald Reagan against the concept of winnable nuclear war, and he began to see nuclear weapons as more of a "[[Wild card (foresight)|wild card]]" than a strategic deterrent. Although he later believed in disarmament treaties slowly blunting the danger of nuclear weaponry by reducing their number and alert status, he also believed a technological solution might allow incoming ICBMs to be shot down, thus making the US invulnerable to a first strike. However the USSR saw the SDI concept as a major threat, since unilateral deployment of the system would allow the US to launch a massive first strike on the Soviet Union without any fear of retaliation.

The SDI concept was to use ground-based and space-based systems to protect the United States from attack by strategic [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[ballistic missile]]s. The initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of [[Mutual Assured Destruction]] (MAD). The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) was set up in 1984 within the [[United States Department of Defense]] to oversee the Strategic Defense Initiative.

===NATO nuclear sharing===
{{main|Nuclear sharing}}
NATO operational plans for a Third World War have involved NATO allies who do not have their own nuclear weapons, using nuclear weapons supplied by the United States as part of a general NATO war plan, under the direction of NATO's Supreme Allied Commander.

Of the three nuclear powers in NATO ([[France]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]), only the United States has provided weapons for nuclear sharing. {{As of|2009|11}}, [[Belgium]], [[Germany and weapons of mass destruction|Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands and weapons of mass destruction|Netherlands]] and [[Turkey]] are still hosting US nuclear weapons as part of NATO's nuclear sharing policy.&lt;ref name=RUSI-2010&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.rusi.org/publications/occasionalpapers/ref:O4B991ABDC4148/|title=NATO's Tactical Nuclear Dilemma|author=Malcolm Chalmers|author2=Simon Lunn|last-author-amp=yes|date=March 2010|publisher=[[Royal United Services Institute]]|accessdate=2010-03-16|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,618550,00.html Der Spiegel: ''Foreign Minister Wants US Nukes out of Germany'' (2009-04-10)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada and weapons of mass destruction|Canada]] hosted weapons until 1984,&lt;ref name=canada-nw&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5-R7EJ0r680C|title=Canadian Nuclear Weapons: The Untold Story of Canada's Cold War Arsenal|author=John Clearwater|date=1998|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.|isbn=978-1-55002-299-5|accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Greece]] until 2001.&lt;ref name=RUSI-2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|page=26|url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/euro/euro.pdf|title=U.S. Nuclear Weapons in Europe|author=Hans M.

==Historical close calls==
{{main|Nuclear warfare}}
{{see also|List of nuclear close calls}}
With the initiation of the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]] in the 1950s, an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] war between the United States and the Soviet Union became a real possibility.  During the Cold War era (1947–1991), a number of military events have been described as having come quite close to potentially triggering World War III.

=== Korean War: 25 June 1950&amp;nbsp;– 27 July 1953 ===
The [[Korean War]] was a war between two coalitions fighting for control over the [[Korean Peninsula]]: a communist coalition including North Korea, China and the USSR, and a capitalist coalition including South Korea, the United States, and the UN. Many then believed that the conflict was likely to soon escalate into a full-scale war between the three countries, the US, the USSR, and China. [[CBS News|CBS]] war correspondent [[Bill Downs]] wrote in 1951 that, "To my mind, the answer is: Yes, Korea is the beginning of World War III. The brilliant [[Battle of Inchon|landings at Inchon]] and the cooperative efforts of the American armed forces with the United Nations Allies have won us a victory in Korea. But this is only the first battle in a major international struggle which now is engulfing the Far East and the entire world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Downs|first=Bill|title=World War III in Asia?|newspaper=See Magazine|date=March 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downs afterwards repeated this belief on ''[[ABC World News Tonight|ABC Evening News]]'' while reporting on the [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|USS ''Pueblo'' incident]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Downs|first=Bill|title=The USS Pueblo incident|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KBxiX_9_Kk|work=ABC Evening News with Bob Young|publisher=ABC Evening News|accessdate=8 November 2013|date=25 January 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cuban Missile Crisis: 15–28 October 1962 ===
;{{Refimprove section|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Soviet b-59 submarine.jpg|thumb|A US Navy [[HSS-1 Seabat]] helicopter hovers over Soviet submarine ''B-59'', forced to the surface by US Naval forces in the Caribbean near Cuba. B-59 had a nuclear torpedo on board, three officer keys were required to use it. Only one dissent prevented the submarine from attacking the US fleet nearby, a spark that could have led to a Third World War (October 28–29, 1962).]]
The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]: a confrontation on the stationing of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, in response to the failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], is considered as having been the closest to a nuclear exchange, which could have precipitated a Third World War. The crisis peaked on 27 October, with three separate major incidents occurring on the same day, all of these incidents having been initiated by the US military.

* The "Arkhipov save" incident occurred when a Soviet submarine nearly launched a nuclear-tipped torpedo in response to having been targeted by American naval [[depth charge]]s in international waters, with the Soviet nuclear launch response only having being prevented by Soviet naval officer [[Vasili Arkhipov]]. 
* The shooting down of a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] while violating Cuban airspace. 
* The near interception of another U-2 that had somehow managed to stray into Soviet airspace over Siberia, which airspace violation nearly caused the Soviets to believe that this might be the vanguard of a US aerial bombardment.

Despite what many believe to be the closest the world has come to a nuclear conflict, throughout the entire standoff, the [[Doomsday Clock]], which is run by the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] to estimate how close the end of the world, or doomsday, is, with midnight being the apocalypse, stayed at a relatively stable seven minutes to midnight. This has been explained as being due to the brevity of the crisis, since the clock monitored more long term factors such as leadership of countries, conflicts, wars, and political upheavals, as well as societies reactions to said factors.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists now credits the political developments resulting from the Cuban Missile Crisis with having actually enhanced global stability.  The Bulletin posits that future crises and occasions that might otherwise escalate, were rendered as more stable due to two major factors: 
# A Washington to Moscow [[Moscow–Washington hotline|direct telephone line]], resulted from the communication trouble between the [[White House]] and the [[Kremlin]] during the crisis, giving the leaders of the two largest nuclear powers the ability to contact each other in real time, rather than sending written messages that needed to be translated and wired, which had dragged out conversations in which seconds could have potentially prevented a nuclear exchange.
# The second factor was caused in part due to the worldwide reaction to how close the US and USSR had come to the brink of World War III during the standoff.  As the public began to more closely monitor topics involving nuclear weapons, and therefore to rally support for the cause of non-proliferation, the [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|1963 test ban treaty]] was signed.  To date this treaty has been signed by 126 total nations, with the most notable exceptions being [[France and weapons of mass destruction|France]] and [[China and weapons of mass destruction|China]].  Both of these countries were still in the relative beginning stages of their nuclear programs at the time of the original treaty signing, and both sought nuclear capabilities independent of their allies.

::-This Test Ban Treaty prevented the testing of nuclear ordnance that detonated in the atmosphere, limiting testing to below ground and under water, decreasing fallout and effects on the environment, and subsequently caused the Doomsday Clock to decrease by five minutes, to arrive at a total of twelve minutes to midnight. Up until this point, over 1000 nuclear bombs had been detonated, and concerns over both long and short term affects to the planet became increasingly more worrisome to scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thebulletin.org/remembering-cuban-missile-crisis |title=Remembering the Cuban Missile Crisis |date=16 October 2012 |website=thebulletin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2017|reason=only the part about doomsday clock is in article}}

=== Yom Kippur War super-power tensions: 6–25 October 1973 ===
The [[Yom Kippur War]], also known as the Ramadan War, or October War, began with Arab victories. Israel successfully counterattacked. Tensions grew between the US (which supported Israel) and the Soviet Union (which sided with the Arab states). American and Soviet naval forces came close to firing upon each other. Admiral Murphy of the US reckoned the chances of the Soviet squadron attempting a first strike against his fleet at 40 percent. The Pentagon moved Defcon status from 4 to 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/commentary/the-little-known-us-soviet-confrontation-during-yom-kippur-wa|title=The little-known US-Soviet confrontation during Yom Kippur War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superpowers had been pushed to the brink of war, but tensions eased with the ceasefire brought in under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 339|UNSC 339]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/erol-araf-incalculable-consequences|title=Erol Araf: 'Incalculable consequences'|publisher=|date=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-01489-X.html|title=Inside the Kremlin During the Yom Kippur War By Victor Israelyan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NORAD computer error of 1979: 9 November 1979 ===
The United States made emergency retaliation preparations after NORAD saw on-screen indications that a full-scale Soviet attack had been launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBC Digital Archives|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/war-conflict/defence/norad-watching-the-skies/norad-false-alarm-causes-uproar.html|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; No attempt was made to use the "[[Moscow–Washington hotline|red telephone]]" hotline to clarify the situation with the USSR and it was not until early-warning radar systems confirmed no such launch had taken place that NORAD realized that a computer system test had caused the display errors. A senator inside the NORAD facility at the time described an atmosphere of absolute panic. A GAO investigation led to the construction of an off-site test facility to prevent similar mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andrews|first1=Evan|title=5 Cold War Close Calls|url=http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/5-cold-war-close-calls|publisher=The History Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Petrov save" incident: 26 September 1983 ===
A [[1983 Soviet nuclear false alarm incident|false alarm]] occurred on the [[Oko|Soviet nuclear early warning system]], showing the launch of American Minuteman ICBMs from bases in the United States. A retaliatory attack was prevented by [[Stanislav Petrov]], an officer of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, who realised the system had simply malfunctioned (which was borne out by later investigations).&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter021099b.htm | title=I Had A Funny Feeling in My Gut | first=David | last=Hoffman | publisher=Washington Post |date=10 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baltimore Sun"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cold War's Riskiest Moment |publisher=Baltimore Sun, 31 August 2003 (article reprinted as ''The Nuclear War That Almost Happened in 1983'') |url=http://hnn.us/articles/1709.html#bombs9-5-03 |first=Scott |last=Shane |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819033034/http://hnn.us/articles/1709.html |archivedate=19 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Able Archer escalations: 2–11 November 1983 ===
During [[Able Archer 83]], a ten-day [[NATO]] exercise simulating a period of [[conflict escalation]] that culminated in a [[DEFCON 1]] nuclear strike, some members of the [[Soviet]] [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] and [[Soviet Armed Forces|armed forces]] treated the events as a [[ruse of war]] concealing a genuine [[first strike]]. In response, the military prepared for a coordinated counter-attack by readying nuclear forces and placing air units stationed in the [[Warsaw Pact]] states of [[East Germany]] and [[Poland]] under high alert. However, the state of Soviet preparation for retaliation ceased upon completion of the Able Archer exercises.&lt;ref name = "Fischer Conundrum"/&gt;

=== Norwegian rocket incident: 25 January 1995 ===
The [[Norwegian rocket incident]] is the only World War III close call to occur outside the Cold War. This incident occurred when [[Russia]]'s [[Olenegorsk Radar Station|Olenegorsk]] [[early warning radar|early warning station]] accidentally mistook the radar signature from a [[Black Brant (rocket)#Black Brant XII|Black Brant XII]] [[sounding rocket|research rocket]] (being jointly launched by Norwegian and US scientists from [[Andøya Rocket Range]]), as appearing to be the radar signature of the launch of a [[Trident missile|Trident]] [[SLBM]] missile. In response, [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] was summoned and the ''[[Cheget]]'' [[nuclear briefcase]] was activated for the first and only time. However, the high command was soon able to determine that the rocket was not entering Russian airspace, and promptly aborted plans for combat readiness and retaliation. It was retrospectively determined that, while the rocket scientists had informed thirty states including Russia about the test launch, the information had not reached Russian radar technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eucom.mil/article/23042/this-week-in-eucom-history-january-23-29-1995|title=January 25, 1995—The Norwegian Rocket Incident|publisher=United States European Command|date=23 January 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921003744/http://www.eucom.mil/article/23042/this-week-in-eucom-history-january-23-29-1995|archivedate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/coldwar/shatter031598a.htm|title=Cold-War Doctrines Refuse to Die|first=David|last=Hoffman|publisher=Washington Post Foreign Service|date=15 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended usage of the term==

===Cold War===
In 2004, neoconservative commentator [[Norman Podhoretz]] proposed that the [[Cold War]] might rightly be called World War III.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/article/world-war-iv-how-it-started-what-it-means-and-why-we-have-to-win/ Norman Podhoretz:''World War IV: How It Started, What It Means, and Why We Have to Win'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 on [[CNBC]]'s ''[[The Kudlow Report|Kudlow and Company]],'' host [[Lawrence Kudlow]], discussing a book by former deputy Under-Secretary of Defense [[Jed Babbin]], agreed with Podhoretz, adding, "World War IV is the terror war, and war with China would be World War V."&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/research/2006/07/14/right-wing-media-divided-is-us-now-in-world-war/136176 Right-wing media divided: Is U.S. now in World War III, IV, or V? | Media Matters for America]. Mediamatters.org (14 July 2006). Retrieved on 26 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Still the majority of historians would seem to hold that World War III would necessarily have to be a worldwide ''"war in which large forces from many countries fought"'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/world-war Definition of "World War": Cambridge Dictionary] Cambridge University Press.

Downloaded 21 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Secret Weapons of the Cold War'', Bill Yenne explains that the military standoff that occurred between the two 'Superpowers', namely the United States and the Soviet Union, from the 1940s through to 1991, was only the [[Cold War]], which ultimately helped to enable mankind to avert the possibility of an all out nuclear confrontation, and that it certainly was not World War III itself.&lt;ref&gt;Yenne, Bill.

===War on Terror===
The so-called "[[War on Terror]]" that began with the [[September 11 attack]]s has been claimed by some to be World War III&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/01/24/are-we-already-fighting-world-war-iii.html|title=Are We Already Fighting World War III?|first=Sean|last=OMelveny|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/723472/WW3-started-9-11-Twin-Towers-terror-attack-ex-chief-blasts|title=We're ALREADY at war: WW3 started on 9/11 with Twin Towers terror attack, ex-chief blasts|first=Lizzie|last=Stromme|date=20 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes as World War IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.commentarymagazine.com/articles/world-war-iv-how-it-started-what-it-means-and-why-we-have-to-win/|title=World War IV: How It Started, What It Means, and Why We Have to Win - Commentary Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have disparaged such claims as "distorting American history." While there is general agreement amongst historians regarding the definitions and extent of the first two world wars, namely due to the unmistakable global scale of aggression and self-destruction of these two wars, a few have claimed that a "World War" might now no longer require such worldwide and large scale aggression and carnage. Still, such claims of a new "lower threshold of aggression," that might now be sufficient to qualify a war as a "World War" have not gained such widespread acceptance and support as the definitions of the first two world wars have received amongst historians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-op-beinart9dec09-story.html Is this really World War IV?] Los Angeles Times.

====War on ISIL====
On 1 February 2015, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iraq)|Iraqi Foreign Minister]] [[Ibrahim al-Jaafari]] declared that the [[Military intervention against ISIL|War on ISIL]] was effectively "World War III", due to ISIL's declaration of a [[Worldwide Caliphate]], its aims to conquer the world, and its success in spreading the conflict to multiple countries outside of the [[Levant]] region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/video/2015/02/01/fight-against-islamic-state-is-world-war?videoId=363066236 "Fight against Islamic State is World War 3 – Iraqi foreign minister"] Reuters, video&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[2016 State of the Union Address|State of the Union Address]] on 12 January 2016, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] warned that news reports granting ISIL the supposed ability to foment WW III might be excessive and irresponsible, stating that, "as we focus on destroying ISIL, over-the-top claims that this is World War III just play into their hands. Masses of fighters on the back of pickup trucks and twisted souls plotting in apartments or garages pose an enormous danger to civilians and must be stopped.

===Multiple small wars as a "third war"===
In multiple recorded interviews under somewhat casual circumstances, comparing the conflagrations of World War I and II to the ongoing lower intensity wars of the 21st century, [[Pope Francis]] has said, "The world is at war, ''because it has lost peace''," and "perhaps one can speak of a third war, one fought piecemeal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/07/28/world/social-issues-world/pope-says-world-war-lost-peace-religion-not-blame/#.WJeFnes76rU Pope says ‘world at war because it has lost peace’ but religion not to blame]  Japan Times. 28 July 2016.

==Views on the likely outcome and definition==
In 1949, after the unleashing of nuclear weaponry at the end of WWII, physicist [[Albert Einstein]] suggested that any outcome of a possible WWIII would be so dire as to revert mankind back to the [[Stone Age]]. When asked by journalist Alfred Werner, what types of weapons Einstein believed World War III might be fought with, Einstein warned, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7406337/#.WmyV55OdU3g |title=The culture of Einstein |last=Johnson |first=M. Alex |date=2005-04-18 |website=msnbc.com |language=en |access-date=2018-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be inferred here that Einstein assumed that World War III would either exterminate, or else nearly exterminate the human race (presumably due to [[nuclear warfare]]).&lt;ref name="einstein"/&gt;{{Verify source|date=January 2018}}

In his book ''Destined for War'', [[Graham Allison]] views the global rivalry between the established power, the US, and the rising power, China, as an example of the [[Thucydides Trap]]. Past examples have often led to war, and in this case World War Three is possible but not inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Allison, ''Destined for War'', Scribe, 2017, p 215&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:100 m final Berlin 2009.JPG|thumb|[[Usain Bolt]] setting a world record in the 100m dash at the [[2009 World Championships in Athletics]] in Berlin.]]

A '''world record''' is usually the best global performance ever recorded and officially verified in a specific [[skill]] or [[sport]]. The book ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' collates and publishes notable records of all types, from first and best to worst human achievements, to extremes in the natural world and beyond.

== Terminology ==
In the [[United States]] the form '''World's Record''' was formerly more common. The term '''World Best''' was also briefly in use.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The latter term is still used in [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] events, including [[track and field]] and [[road running]] to describe good and bad performances not recognized as an official world record: either because it is not an event where the [[IAAF]] tracks the record (e.g. the 150 m run or individual events in a [[decathlon]]), or because it does not fulfil other rigorous criteria of an otherwise qualifying event (e.g. the [[Great North Run]] half-marathon, which has an excessive downhill gradient). The term is also used in video game [[speedrunning]] when someone achieves the fastest possible time for the game and category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speedrunslive - Glossary|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
[[Malaysia]] is one country where world record-breaking has become something of a national fad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.04/capital.html |title = The World Record-Breaking Capital  |accessdate = 2008-09-01 |author = Boulware, Jack |date=April 2006 |publisher = [[Wired Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[India]], the setting and breaking of records is popular: world record [[wikt:registrar|registrar]]s based in India are [[Limca Book of Records]], [[Unique World Records]], World Records India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.worldrecordsindia.com |title = World Records India - Indian Book of World Records  |accessdate = 2015-09-01 |author = Paavan Solanki |date=October 2015 |publisher = worldrecordsindia.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Asia Book of Records]].

'''Zero world government''' refers to a hypothetical future in which [[central government|national governments]] cease to exist or to matter, as a result of [[globalization]] and a worldwide rejection of politics, as known today.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The term contrasts with that of one [[world government]] in the sense that rather than there being a world-[[state (polity)|state]], there are no political states in the world.
