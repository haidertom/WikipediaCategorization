At {{convert|14000000|km2|abbr=off}}, it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]]. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by [[ice]] that averages {{convert|1.9|km|mi ft|abbr=on}} in thickness,&lt;ref name="Bedmap2"&gt;{{cite journal |author=British Antarctic Survey |title=Bedmap2: improved ice bed, surface and thickness datasets for Antarctica |journal=The Cryosphere journal |page=390 |url=http://www.the-cryosphere.net/7/375/2013/tc-7-375-2013.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].

Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at [[Research stations in Antarctica|research stations]] scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[plant]]s, [[protist]]a, and certain [[animal]]s, such as [[mite]]s, [[nematode]]s, [[penguin]]s, [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[tardigrade]]s. Vegetation, where it occurs, is [[tundra]].

Although myths and speculation about a ''[[Terra Australis]]'' ("Southern Land") date back to antiquity, Antarctica is noted as the last region on Earth in recorded history to be discovered, unseen until 1820 when the [[List of Russian explorers|Russian expedition]] of [[Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen]] and [[Mikhail Lazarev]] on ''[[Vostok (sloop-of-war)|Vostok]]'' and ''[[Mirny (sloop-of-war)|Mirny]]'' sighted the [[Fimbul ice shelf]]. The continent, however, remained largely neglected for the rest of the 19th century because of its hostile environment, lack of easily accessible resources, and isolation. In 1895, the first confirmed landing was conducted by a team of Norwegians.

Antarctica is a ''de facto'' [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]], governed by parties to the [[Antarctic Treaty System]] that have consulting status. Twelve countries signed the Antarctic Treaty in 1959, and thirty-eight have signed it since then. The treaty prohibits military activities and mineral mining, prohibits nuclear explosions and nuclear waste disposal, supports scientific research, and protects the continent's [[ecozone]]. Ongoing experiments are conducted by more than 4,000 scientists from many nations.

==Etymology==
[[File:Adelie Penguins on iceberg.jpg|thumb|[[Adelie penguins]] in Antarctica]]
The name ''Antarctica'' is the [[Romanization of Greek|romanised]] version of the [[Greek language|Greek]] compound word ἀνταρκτική (''antarktiké''), feminine of [[wikt:ἀνταρκτικός|ἀνταρκτικός]] (''antarktikós''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Liddell |first1=Henry George |last2=Scott |first2=Robert |editor-last=Crane |editor-first=Gregory R. |contribution=Antarktikos |title=A Greek–English Lexicon |series=Perseus Digital Library |publisher=Tufts University |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%239514 |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "opposite to the [[Arctic]]", "opposite to the north".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hince |first=Bernadette |date=2000 |title=The Antarctic Dictionary |publisher=CSIRO Publishing |isbn=978-0-9577471-1-1 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lJd8_owUxFEC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=antarctica+opposite+of+north+greek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his book ''Meteorology'' about an ''Antarctic region'' in c.&amp;nbsp;350 BC&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.2.ii.html Meteorologica.] Book II, Part 5. 350 BCE. Translated by E. Webster. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1923. 140 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marinus of Tyre]] reportedly used the name in his unpreserved world map from the 2nd century CE.  The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] authors [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]] and [[Apuleius]] (1–2 centuries CE) used for the South Pole the romanised Greek name ''polus antarcticus,''&lt;ref&gt;Hyginus. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlWM1eMefB8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage De astronomia.] Ed. G. Viré. Stuttgart: Teubner, 1992. 176 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Apuleii. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MJ8MAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage Opera omnia.] Volumen tertium. London: Valpy, 1825. 544 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; from which derived the [[Old French]] ''pole antartike'' (modern ''pôle antarctique'') attested in 1270, and from there the [[Middle English]] ''pol antartik'' in a 1391 technical treatise by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] (modern ''Antarctic Pole'').&lt;ref&gt;G. Chaucer. [http://art-bin.com/art/oastro.html A Treatise on the Astrolabe.] Approx. 1391. Ed. W. Skeat. London: N. Trübner, 1872. 188 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before acquiring its present geographical connotations, the term was used for other locations that could be defined as "opposite to the north". For example, the short-lived French colony established in [[Brazil]] in the 16th century was called "[[France Antarctique]]".

The first formal use of the name "Antarctica" as a continental name in the 1890s is attributed to the Scottish [[Cartography|cartographer]] [[John George Bartholomew]].&lt;ref&gt;John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica, CAIRT Issue 13, National Library of Scotland, July 2008, ISSN 1477-4186, and also {{cite web |title=The Bartholomew Archive |url=http://digital.nls.uk/bartholomew/highlights/antarctica.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of name==
The long-imagined (but undiscovered) south polar continent was originally called ''[[Terra Australis]]'', sometimes shortened to 'Australia' as seen in a woodcut illustration titled ''Sphere of the winds'', contained in an astrological textbook published in Frankfurt in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barth |first1=Cyriaco Jacob zum |title=Astronomia: Teutsch Astronomei |date=1545 |location=Frankfurt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the longer Latin phrase was better known, the shortened name ''Australia'' was used in Europe's scholarly circles.

Then in the nineteenth century, the colonial authorities in [[Sydney]] removed the Dutch name from [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]. Instead of inventing a new name to replace it, they took the name ''Australia'' from the south polar continent, leaving it nameless for some eighty years. During that period, geographers had to make do with clumsy phrases such as "the Antarctic Continent". They searched for a more poetic replacement, suggesting various names such as Ultima and Antipodea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually ''Antarctica'' was adopted in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Woodburn |first1=Susan |title=John George Bartholomew and the naming of Antarctica |journal=Cairt |date=July 2008 |issue=13 |pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica has no indigenous population, and there is no evidence that it was seen by humans until the 19th century. However, in February 1775, during his [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]], [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] called the existence of such a polar continent "probable" and in another copy of his journal he wrote:"[I] '''firmly believe''' it and its '''more than''' probable that we have seen a part of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beaglehole |first1=J.C. |title=Cook, Journals, vol.2 |date=1968 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=Cambridge |isbn=9781472453242 |page=643, n.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, belief in the existence of a ''[[Terra Australis]]''—a vast continent in the far south of the globe to "balance" the northern lands of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North Africa]]—had prevailed since the times of [[Ptolemy]] in the 1st century AD. Even in the late 17th century, after explorers had found that [[South America]] and [[Australia]] were not part of the fabled "Antarctica", geographers believed that the continent was much larger than its actual size.
[[File:James Weddell Expedition.jpg|thumb|Painting of [[James Weddell]]'s second expedition in 1823, depicting the brig ''Jane'' and the cutter ''Beaufroy'']]

Integral to the story of the origin of Antarctica's name is that it was not named ''Terra Australis''—this name was [[Australia#Etymology|given to Australia instead]], because of the misconception that no significant landmass could exist further south. Explorer [[Matthew Flinders]], in particular, has been credited with popularising the transfer of the name ''Terra Australis'' to Australia. He justified the titling of his book ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'' (1814) by writing in the introduction:

{{quote|There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.&lt;ref&gt;Flinders, Matthew.

European maps continued to show this hypothesised land until Captain [[James Cook]]'s ships, {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}} and {{HMS|Adventure|1771|2}}, crossed the Antarctic Circle on 17 January 1773, in December 1773 and again in January 1774.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Age of Exploration: John Cook |publisher=The Mariners' Museum |url=http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php |accessdate=12 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207175624/http://www.mariner.org/educationalad/ageofex/cook.php&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=7 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cook came within about {{convert|75|mi|km|order=flip|-1|abbr=on}} of the Antarctic coast before retreating in the face of field ice in January 1773.&lt;ref&gt;James Cook, ''The Journals'', edited by Philip Edwards.

In December 1839, as part of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] of 1838–42 conducted by the [[United States Navy]] (sometimes called the "Ex. Ex.", or "the Wilkes Expedition"), an expedition sailed from [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], into the Antarctic Ocean, as it was then known, and reported the discovery "of an Antarctic continent west of the Balleny Islands" on 25 January 1840. That part of Antarctica was named "[[Wilkes Land]]", a name it retains to this day.

Explorer [[James Clark Ross]] passed through what is now known as the [[Ross Sea]] and discovered [[Ross Island]] (both of which were named after him) in 1841. He sailed along a huge wall of ice that was later named the [[Ross Ice Shelf]].

Positioned asymmetrically around the [[South Pole]] and largely south of the Antarctic Circle, Antarctica is the southernmost continent and is surrounded by the [[Southern Ocean]]; alternatively, it may be considered to be surrounded by the southern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]], and [[Indian Ocean]]s, or by the southern waters of the [[World Ocean]]. There are a number of rivers and lakes in Antarctica, the longest river being the [[Onyx River|Onyx]]. The largest lake, [[Lake Vostok|Vostok]], is one of the largest sub-glacial lakes in the world. Antarctica covers more than {{convert|14|e6km2|sqmi|abbr=unit}},&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt; making it the fifth-largest continent, about 1.3 times as large as Europe. The coastline measures {{convert|17968|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt; and is mostly characterised by ice formations, as the following table shows:

Antarctica is divided in two by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] close to the neck between the Ross Sea and the [[Weddell Sea]]. The portion west of the Weddell Sea and east of the Ross Sea is called West Antarctica and the remainder East Antarctica, because they roughly correspond to the Western and Eastern Hemispheres relative to the [[Greenwich meridian]].

[[File:Antarctica surface.jpg|thumb|left|Elevation coloured by relief height]]

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], a [[ice sheet|sheet of ice]] averaging at least {{convert|1.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} thick. The continent has about 90% of the world's ice (and thereby about 70% of the world's [[fresh water]]). If all of this ice were melted, sea levels would rise about {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|title=How Stuff Works: polar ice caps|publisher=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=12 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204205054/http://science.howstuffworks.com/question473.htm|archivedate=4 February 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the interior of the continent, [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is very low, down to {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year; in a few "[[Blue ice (glacial)|blue ice]]" areas precipitation is lower than mass loss by [[sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], and so the local mass balance is negative. In the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys|dry valleys]], the same effect occurs over a rock base, leading to a desiccated landscape.

[[West Antarctica]] is covered by the [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]]. The sheet has been of recent concern because of the small possibility of its collapse. If the sheet were to break down, [[Sea level change|ocean levels]] would rise by several metres in a relatively [[geologic time scale|geologically short]] period of time, perhaps a matter of centuries. Several Antarctic [[ice stream]]s, which account for about 10% of the ice sheet, flow to one of the many [[Ice shelf#Antarctic ice shelves|Antarctic ice shelves]]: see [[ice-sheet dynamics]].

East Antarctica lies on the Indian Ocean side of the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] and comprises [[Coats Land]], [[Queen Maud Land]], [[Enderby Land]], [[Mac. Robertson Land|&lt;abbr title="Macpherson"&gt;Mac&lt;/abbr&gt;. Robertson Land]], [[Wilkes Land]], and [[Victoria Land]]. All but a small portion of this region lies within the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. East Antarctica is largely covered by the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]].

[[File:Mount Erebus Aerial 2.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Erebus]], an active volcano on [[Ross Island]]]]

[[Vinson Massif]], the highest peak in Antarctica at {{convert|4892|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located in the [[Ellsworth Mountains]]. Antarctica contains [[List of mountains in Antarctica|many other mountains]], on both the main continent and the surrounding islands. Mount Erebus on [[Ross Island]] is the world's southernmost active volcano. Another well-known volcano is found on [[Deception Island]], which is famous for a giant eruption in 1970. Minor eruptions are frequent, and lava flow has been observed in recent years. Other dormant volcanoes may potentially be active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|title=Volcanoes|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=13 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711081129/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/geography/rock/volcanoes.php|archivedate=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a potentially active underwater volcano was found in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] by American and Canadian researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100385|title=Scientists Discover Undersea Volcano Off Antarctica|publisher=United States National Science Foundation|accessdate=13 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica is home to more than 70 lakes that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet. [[Lake Vostok]], discovered beneath Russia's [[Vostok Station]] in 1996, is the largest of these [[subglacial lake]]s. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years, but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.&lt;ref name="Briggs2006"&gt;{{cite news|last=Briggs|first=Helen|date=19 April 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4908292.stm|title=Secret rivers found in Antarctic|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=7 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence, in the form of [[ice core]]s drilled to about {{convert|400|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}} above the water line, that Lake Vostok's waters may contain [[microorganism|microbial life]].

===Geological history and palaeontology===
More than 170&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Antarctica was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]]. Over time, Gondwana gradually broke apart, and Antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. At a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.

====Palaeozoic era (540–250 Ma)====
During the [[Cambrian|Cambrian period]], Gondwana had a mild climate. West Antarctica was partially in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and during this period large amounts of [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s were deposited. East Antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor [[invertebrate]]s and [[trilobite]]s flourished in the tropical seas. By the start of the [[Devonian|Devonian period]] (416&amp;nbsp;[[annum|Ma]]), Gondwana was in more southern latitudes and the climate was cooler, though fossils of land plants are known from this time. [[Sand]] and [[silt]]s were laid down in what is now the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]], [[Horlick Mountains|Horlick]] and [[Pensacola Mountains]]. [[Glaciation]] began at the end of the Devonian period (360&amp;nbsp;Ma), as Gondwana became centred on the South Pole and the climate cooled, though [[Antarctic flora|flora]] remained. During the [[Permian]] period, the land became dominated by seed plants such as ''[[Glossopteris]]'', a pteridosperm which grew in swamps. Over time these swamps became deposits of coal in the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. Towards the end of the Permian period, continued warming led to a dry, hot climate over much of Gondwana.&lt;ref name="Stonehouse"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Stonehouse|editor-first=B.|title=Encyclopedia of Antarctica and the Southern Oceans|date=June 2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-98665-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mesozoic era (250–66 Ma)====
As a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of Gondwana became a desert. In Eastern Antarctica, [[seed fern]]s or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. [[Synapsid]]s, commonly known as "mammal-like reptiles", were common in Antarctica during the [[Early Triassic]] and included forms such as ''[[Lystrosaurus]]''. The Antarctic Peninsula began to form during the [[Jurassic]] period (206–146&amp;nbsp;Ma), and islands gradually rose out of the ocean. [[Ginkgo]] trees, conifers, bennettites, horsetails, ferns and [[cycad]]s were plentiful during this period.

====Gondwana breakup (160–23 Ma)====
The cooling of Antarctica occurred stepwise, as the continental spread changed the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalising currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.

Africa separated from Antarctica in the Jurassic, around 160&amp;nbsp;Ma, followed by the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the early Cretaceous (about 125&amp;nbsp;Ma). By the end of the Cretaceous, about 66&amp;nbsp;Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a subtropical climate and flora, complete with a [[marsupial]] [[fauna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reinhold, Robert|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/21/us/antarctica-yields-first-land-mammal-fossil.html|title=Antarctica yields first land mammal fossil|journal=New York Times|date=21 March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eocene]] epoch, about 40&amp;nbsp;Ma Australia-[[New Guinea]] separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear.  During the [[Eocene–Oligocene extinction event]] about 34&amp;nbsp;million years ago, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels have been found to be about 760 ppm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html|title=New CO2 data helps unlock the secrets of Antarctic formation|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=26 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715082838/http://www.physorg.com/news172072921.html|archivedate=15 July 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm.

Around 23 Ma, the [[Drake Passage]] opened between Antarctica and South America, resulting in the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] that completely isolated the continent. Models of the changes suggest that declining CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels became more important.&lt;ref name="DeContoPollard2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeConto|first1=Robert M.|last2=Pollard|first2=David|title=Rapid Cenozoic glaciation of Antarctica induced by declining atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|journal=Nature|volume=421|pages=245–9|date=16 January 2003|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6920/abs/nature01290.html|doi=10.1038/nature01290|accessdate=19 October 2009|issue=6920|pmid=12529638 |bibcode = 2003Natur.421..245D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ice began to spread, replacing the forests that then covered the continent.

====Neogene Period (23–0.05 Ma)====
Since about 15 Ma, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.&lt;ref name="Trewby2002"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Trewby|editor-first=Mary|date=September 2002|title=Antarctica: An Encyclopedia from Abbott Ice Shelf to Zooplankton|publisher=Firefly Books|isbn=1-55297-590-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Meyer Desert Formation biota====

Fossil ''[[Nothofagus]]'' leaves in the Meyer Desert Formation of the [[Sirius Group]] show that intermittent warm periods allowed ''Nothofagus'' shrubs to cling to the [[Dominion Range]] as late as 3–4 Ma (mid-late [[Pliocene]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=New grounds for reassessing palaeoclimate of the Sirius Group |date=2001 |journal=Journal of the Geological Society, London |volume=158|pages=925–35 | doi=10.1144/0016-764901-030 | last1=Retallack | first1=G.J. | last2=Krull | first2=E.S. | last3=Bockheim | first3=J.G. | issue=6|bibcode=2001JGSoc.158..925R }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, the [[Pleistocene]] ice age covered the whole continent and destroyed all major plant life on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-4164401.html |author= Stefi Weisburd |title=A forest grows in Antarctica.

===Present-day===
[[File:Marie Byrd Land, West Antarctica by NASA.jpg|thumb|Glaciers and rock outcrops in Marie Byrd Land seen from NASA's [[DC-8]] aircraft]]
The geological study of Antarctica has been greatly hindered by nearly all of the continent being permanently covered with a thick layer of ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_1_3.html|title=Antarctica's geology|publisher=Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) in partnership with the British Antarctic Survey and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office|accessdate=31 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122142909/http://www.discoveringantarctica.org.uk/alevel_1_3.html|archivedate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new techniques such as [[remote sensing]], [[ground-penetrating radar]] and [[satellite imagery]] have begun to reveal the structures beneath the ice.

Geologically, West Antarctica closely resembles the [[Andes]] mountain range of South America.&lt;ref name="Stonehouse" /&gt; The [[Antarctic Peninsula]] was formed by uplift and [[metamorphism]] of sea bed sediments during the late [[Paleozoic]] and the early [[Mesozoic]] eras. This sediment uplift was accompanied by [[igneous]] intrusions and [[volcanism]]. The most common rocks in West Antarctica are [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]] volcanics formed during the Jurassic period. There is also evidence of volcanic activity, even after the ice sheet had formed, in [[Marie Byrd Land]] and [[Alexander Island]]. The only anomalous area of West Antarctica is the [[Ellsworth Mountains]] region, where the [[stratigraphy]] is more similar to East Antarctica.

East Antarctica is geologically varied, dating from the [[Precambrian]] era, with some rocks formed more than 3&amp;nbsp;billion years ago. It is composed of a [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] platform which is the basis of the [[Shield (geology)|continental shield]]. On top of this base are coal and various modern rocks, such as [[sandstone]]s, [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s laid down during the Devonian and Jurassic periods to form the [[Transantarctic Mountains]]. In coastal areas such as [[Shackleton Range]] and [[Victoria Land]] some [[fault (geology)|faulting]] has occurred.

The main mineral resource known on the continent is coal.&lt;ref name="Trewby2002" /&gt; It was first recorded near the [[Beardmore Glacier]] by [[Frank Wild]] on the [[Nimrod Expedition]], and now low-grade coal is known across many parts of the Transantarctic Mountains. The [[Prince Charles Mountains]] contain significant deposits of iron ore. The most valuable resources of Antarctica lie offshore, namely the [[oil field|oil]] and [[natural gas field]]s found in the Ross Sea in 1973. Exploitation of all mineral resources is [[Ban (law)|banned]] until 2048 by the [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]].

Antarctica is the coldest of [[Earth]]'s continents.

Temperatures reach a minimum of between {{convert|−80|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|−89.2|C|F|abbr=on}} in the interior in winter and reach a maximum of between {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15|C|F|0|abbr=on}} near the coast in summer. [[Sunburn]] is often a health issue as the snow surface reflects almost all of the ultraviolet light falling on it.  Given the latitude, long periods of constant darkness or constant sunlight create climates unfamiliar to human beings in much of the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="BAS-weather"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/weather/weather.htm|title=Weather in the Antarctic|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=9 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AntarcticaDomeCSnow.jpg|thumb|left|The snow surface at [[Dome C]] [[Concordia Station|Station]] is typical of most of the continent's surface.]]
East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. [[Weather front]]s rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to {{convert|1.22|m|in|0}} in 48 hours have been recorded.

At the edge of the continent, strong [[katabatic wind]]s off the [[polar plateau]] often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate. During clear days in summer, more [[solar radiation]] reaches the surface at the South Pole than at the [[equator]] because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt;

Antarctica is colder than the [[Arctic]] for three reasons. First, much of the continent is more than {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation in the [[troposphere]]. Second, the Arctic Ocean covers the north polar zone: the ocean's relative warmth is transferred through the icepack and prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the Earth is at [[aphelion]] in July (i.e., the Earth is farthest from the Sun in the Antarctic winter), and the Earth is at [[perihelion]] in January (i.e., the Earth is closest to the Sun in the Antarctic summer). The orbital distance contributes to a colder Antarctic winter (and a warmer Antarctic summer) but the first two effects have more impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/orbitsun.htm The Earth's Elliptical Orbit Around the Sun&amp;nbsp;– Aphelion and Perihelion]. Geography.about.com. Retrieved on 21 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aurora australis]], commonly known as the southern lights, is a glow observed in the night sky near the South Pole created by the plasma-full [[solar wind]]s that pass by the Earth. Another unique spectacle is [[diamond dust]], a ground-level cloud composed of tiny ice crystals. It generally forms under otherwise clear or nearly clear skies, so people sometimes also refer to it as clear-sky precipitation. A [[sun dog]], a frequent atmospheric [[optical phenomenon]], is a bright "spot" beside the true [[sun]].&lt;ref name="BAS-weather" /&gt;

Several governments maintain permanent manned [[research station]]s on the continent. The number of people conducting and supporting scientific research and other work on the continent and its nearby islands varies from about 1,000 in winter to about 5,000 in the summer, giving it a [[population density]] between 70 and 350 inhabitants per million square kilometres (180 and 900 per million square miles) at these times. Many of the stations are staffed year-round, the winter-over personnel typically arriving from their home countries for a one-year assignment. An [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox church]]—[[Trinity Church (Antarctica)|Trinity Church]], opened in 2004 at the Russian [[Bellingshausen Station]]—is manned year-round by one or two priests, who are similarly rotated every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.rs/eng/flock_antarcticas_orthodox_temple_celebrates_holy_trinity_day|title=Flock of Antarctica's Orthodox temple celebrates Holy Trinity Day|publisher=Serbian Orthodox Church|date=24 May 2004|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravoslavye.org.ua/index.php?action=fullinfo&amp;r_type=&amp;id=22495|script-title=ru:Владимир Петраков: 'Антарктика – это особая атмосфера, где живут очень интересные люди'|language=ru}} (Vladimir Petrakov: "Antarctic is a special world, full of very interesting people").

The first semi-permanent inhabitants of regions near Antarctica (areas situated south of the [[Antarctic Convergence]]) were British and American [[Seal hunting|sealers]] who used to spend a year or more on [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia]], from 1786 onward. During the [[whaling]] era, which lasted until 1966, the population of that island varied from over 1,000 in the summer (over 2,000 in some years) to some 200 in the winter. Most of the whalers were Norwegian, with an increasing proportion of Britons. The settlements included [[Grytviken]], [[Leith Harbour]], [[King Edward Point]], [[Stromness, South Georgia|Stromness]], [[Husvik]], [[Prince Olav Harbour]], [[Ocean Harbour]] and [[Godthul]]. Managers and other senior officers of the whaling stations often lived together with their families. Among them was the founder of Grytviken, Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]], a prominent Norwegian whaler and explorer who, along with his family, adopted British citizenship in 1910.

The first child born in the [[Antarctic Convergence|southern polar region]] was Norwegian girl [[Solveig Gunbjørg Jacobsen]], born in Grytviken on 8 October 1913, and her birth was registered by the resident British Magistrate of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. She was a daughter of Fridthjof Jacobsen, the assistant manager of the whaling station, and Klara Olette Jacobsen. Jacobsen arrived on the island in 1904 and became the manager of Grytviken, serving from 1914 to 1921; two of his children were born on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Headland, Robert K.|title=The Island of South Georgia|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1984|isbn=978-0-521-25274-4|oclc=473919719|pages=12, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species of marine animals exist and rely, directly or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes [[penguin]]s, [[blue whale]]s, [[orca]]s, [[colossal squid]]s and [[fur seal]]s. The [[emperor penguin]] is the only penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the [[Adélie penguin]] breeds farther south than any other penguin. The [[southern rockhopper penguin]] has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. [[King penguin]]s, [[chinstrap penguin]]s, and [[gentoo penguin]]s also breed in the Antarctic.

The [[Antarctic fur seal]] was very heavily hunted in the 18th and 19th centuries for its pelt by sealers from the United States and the United Kingdom. The [[Weddell seal]], a "[[true seal]]", is named after [[James Weddell|Sir James Weddell]], commander of British sealing expeditions in the [[Weddell Sea]]. [[Antarctic krill]], which congregate in large [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]], is the [[keystone species]] of the [[ecosystem]] of the [[Southern Ocean]], and is an important food organism for whales, seals, [[leopard seal]]s, fur seals, [[squid]], [[Notothenioidei|icefish]], penguins, [[albatross]]es and many other birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|title=Creatures of Antarctica|accessdate=6 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214015049/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/fauna_and_flora.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A census of sea life carried out during the [[International Polar Year]] and which involved some 500 researchers was released in 2010. The research is part of the global [[Census of Marine Life]] and has disclosed some remarkable findings. More than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of {{convert|12000|km|0|abbr=on}}. Large animals such as some cetaceans and birds make the round trip annually. More surprising are small forms of life such as [[sea cucumbers]] and free-swimming snails found in both polar oceans. Various factors may aid in their distribution&amp;nbsp;– fairly uniform temperatures of the deep ocean at the poles and the equator which differ by no more than 5&amp;nbsp;°C, and the major current systems or marine [[Thermohaline circulation|conveyor belt]] which transport eggs and larval stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Kinver|first=Mark|date=15 February 2009|title=Ice oceans 'are not poles apart'|newspaper=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7888558.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
[[File:Lichen squamulose.jpg|thumb|About 400 species of [[lichen]]-forming fungi are known to exist in Antarctica.]]
About 1,150 species of fungi have been recorded from Antarctica, of which about 750 are non-lichen-forming and 400 are lichen-forming.&lt;ref name="basplants"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bridge, Paul D.|author2=Spooner, Brian M.|author3=Roberts, Peter J.|date=2008|title=Non-lichenized fungi from the Antarctic region|journal=Mycotaxon|volume=106|pages=485–490|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0106/0485.htm|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these species are [[endolith|cryptoendoliths]] as a result of evolution under extreme conditions, and have significantly contributed to shaping the impressive rock formations of the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] and surrounding mountain ridges. The apparently simple morphology, scarcely differentiated structures, metabolic systems and enzymes still active at very low temperatures, and reduced life cycles shown by such fungi make them particularly suited to harsh environments such as the McMurdo Dry Valleys. In particular, their thick-walled and strongly melanised cells make them resistant to [[UV light]]. Those features can also be observed in algae and [[cyanobacteria]], suggesting that these are adaptations to the conditions prevailing in Antarctica. This has led to speculation that, if life ever occurred on Mars, it might have looked similar to Antarctic fungi such as ''[[Cryomyces antarcticus]]'', and ''[[Cryomyces minteri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blackyeast2010.bf.uni-lj.si/fileadmin/userfiles/Lectures/Onofri.pdf|title=Survival of Black Fungi in Space, Preliminary Results|author=Onofri, S.|author2=Selbmann, L.|author3=Zucconi, L.|author4=Scalzi, G.|author5=Venkateswaran, K.J.|author6=de la Torre, R.|author7=de Vera, J.-P.|author8=Ott, S.|author9=Rabbow, E.|author10=Horneck, G.|last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these fungi are also apparently endemic to Antarctica. Endemic Antarctic fungi also include certain dung-inhabiting species which have had to evolve in response to the double challenge of extreme cold while growing on dung, and the need to survive passage through the gut of warm-blooded animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=de Hoog, G.S.|date=2005|title=Fungi of the Antarctic: evolution under extreme conditions|journal=Studies in Mycology|volume=51|pages=1–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plants===
About 298 million years ago [[Permian]] forests started to cover the continent, and [[tundra]] vegetation survived as late as 15 million years ago,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://telanganatoday.news/antarctica-green-scientists|title=Antarctica was once green: Scientists|date=15 April 2017|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423062932/https://telanganatoday.news/antarctica-green-scientists|archivedate=23 April 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the climate of present-day Antarctica does not allow extensive vegetation to form. A combination of freezing temperatures, poor [[soil]] quality, lack of moisture, and lack of sunlight inhibit plant growth. As a result, the diversity of plant life is very low and limited in distribution. The [[flora]] of the continent largely consists of [[bryophyte]]s. There are about 100 species of [[moss]]es and 25 species of [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]], but only three species of [[flowering plant]]s, all of which are found in the Antarctic Peninsula: ''[[Deschampsia antarctica]]'' (Antarctic hair grass), ''[[Colobanthus quitensis]]'' (Antarctic pearlwort) and the non-native ''[[Poa annua]]'' (annual bluegrass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0032247414000916|title=''Poa annua'' L. in the maritime Antarctic: an overview|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Katarzyna_Chwedorzewska/publication/270217066_Poa_annua_L._in_the_maritime_Antarctic_an_overview/links/54a30c080cf267bdb9042e47.pdf|journal=Polar Record |volume =51|issue =6 |date=2015|pages=637–643|author=Chwedorzewska, K.J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.&lt;ref name="basplants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/index.php|title=Plants of Antarctica|author=British Antarctic Survey|publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|accessdate=12 July 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607115623/http://www.antarctica.ac.uk//about_antarctica/wildlife/plants/index.php|archivedate=7 June 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aadplants"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/plants|title=Antarctic Wildlife|author=Australian Antarctic Division|publisher=Government of Australia|accessdate=27 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828190048/http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/plants|archivedate=28 August 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other organisms===

===Conservation===
[[File:Antarctica, pollution, environment, Russia, Bellingshausen 1.JPG|thumb|left|Dumping of waste, including old vehicles, such as here at the Russian Bellingshausen Station in 1992, is prohibited since the entry into force of the Protocol on Environmental Protection in 1998.]]
The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty (also known as the Environmental Protocol or Madrid Protocol) came into force in 1998, and is the main instrument concerned with conservation and management of [[biodiversity]] in Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting is advised on environmental and conservation issues in Antarctica by the Committee for Environmental Protection. A major concern within this committee is the risk to Antarctica from unintentional introduction of non-native species from outside the region.&lt;ref name="BridgeHughes73"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridge|first1=Paul D.|first2=Kevin. A.|last2=Hughes|date=2010|title=Conservation issues for Antarctic fungi|journal=Mycologia Balcanica|volume=7|issue=1|pages=73–76|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59687/0007/001/0073.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The passing of the [[Antarctic Conservation Act]] (1978) in the U.S. brought several restrictions to U.S. activity on Antarctica. The introduction of [[introduced species|alien]] plants or animals can bring a criminal penalty, as can the extraction of any indigenous species. The [[overfishing]] of [[krill]], which plays a large role in the Antarctic ecosystem, led officials to enact regulations on fishing. The [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]] (CCAMLR), a treaty that came into force in 1980, requires that regulations managing all Southern Ocean fisheries consider potential effects on the entire Antarctic ecosystem.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt; Despite these new acts, unregulated and illegal fishing, particularly of [[Patagonian toothfish]] (marketed as Chilean Sea Bass in the U.S.), remains a serious problem. The illegal fishing of toothfish has been increasing, with estimates of 32,000&amp;nbsp;[[tonne]]s (35,300&amp;nbsp;short tons) in 2000.&lt;ref name="KirbyBBC-2001"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby|first=Alex|date=15 August 2001|title=Toothfish at risk from illegal catches|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1492380.stm|accessdate=22 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AUgovAntartica-toothfish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Toothfish|publisher=Australian Antarctic Division|url=http://www.antarctica.gov.au/about-antarctica/fact-files/animals/fish/toothfish|accessdate=22 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antarctica is defined as all land and [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] south of 60° S for the purposes of the Treaty System. The treaty was signed by twelve countries including the [[Soviet Union]] (and later Russia), the United Kingdom, [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Australia]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.aq/devAS/ats_parties.aspx?lang=e|title=Antarctic Treaty System – Parties|publisher=Antarctic Treaty and the Secretariat|accessdate=20 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It set aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, established freedom of scientific investigation and environmental protection, and banned military activity on Antarctica.

The Argentine, British and Chilean claims all overlap, and have caused friction. On 18 December 2012, the British [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] named a previously unnamed area [[Queen Elizabeth Land]] in tribute to [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]].&lt;ref name="Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Press Release"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Foreign Secretary has announced that the southern part of British Antarctic Territory has been named Queen Elizabeth Land|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/queen-elizabeth-land|work=Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office|publisher=HM Government|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2012, the UK ambassador to Argentina, [[John Freeman (diplomat)|John Freeman]], was summoned to the Argentine government as protest against the claim.&lt;ref name="BBC News: Argentine Protest Against Queen Elizabeth Land"&gt;{{cite web|title=Argentina angry after Antarctic territory named after Queen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20822582|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argentine–UK relations had previously been damaged throughout 2012 due to disputes over the sovereignty of the nearby [[Falkland Islands]], and the 30th anniversary of the [[Falklands War]].

The areas shown as [[Australian Antarctic Territory|Australia's]] and [[Ross Dependency|New Zealand's]] claims were British territory until they were handed over following the countries' independence. Australia currently claims the largest area. The claims of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, France and Norway are all recognised by each other.

Other countries participating as members of the Antarctic Treaty have a territorial interest in Antarctica, but the provisions of the Treaty do not allow them to make their claims while it is in force.&lt;ref name="peecug1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.jid.org/en/mono38/nieto.htm |title=La Antartica |publisher=Library.jid.org |accessdate=4 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007084832/http://library.jid.org/en/mono38/nieto.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="peecug2"&gt;[http://www.afese.com/img/revistas/revista40/laantartida.pdf Afese.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707092226/http://www.afese.com/img/revistas/revista40/laantartida.pdf |date=7 July 2011 }}.

==Economy==

There is no economic activity in Antarctica at present, except for fishing off the coast and small-scale [[Tourism in Antarctica|tourism]], both based outside Antarctica.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People"/&gt;

Although coal, [[hydrocarbon]]s, iron ore, [[platinum]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[nickel]], gold and other minerals have been found, they have not been in large enough quantities to exploit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Natural Resources|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/print_2111.html|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991 [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty]] also restricts a struggle for resources. In 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. The primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. Antarctic fisheries in 2000–01 reported landing 112,934&amp;nbsp;tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fisheries News|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2003/11/30/fisheries-news|publisher=mecropress|date=30 November 2003|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale "expedition tourism" has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to Antarctic Treaty and Environmental Protocol provisions, but in effect self-regulated by the [[International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators]] (IAATO). Not all vessels associated with Antarctic tourism are members of IAATO, but IAATO members account for 95% of the tourist activity. Travel is largely by small or medium ship, focusing on specific scenic locations with accessible concentrations of iconic wildlife. A total of 37,506 tourists visited during the 2006–07 [[Southern Hemisphere|Austral summer]] with nearly all of them coming from commercial ships; 38,478 were recorded in 2015–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc |title=Final Report, 30th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting |publisher=[[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]] |accessdate=2 August 2007 |format=DOC |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808034540/http://30atcm.ats.aq/30atcm/Documents/Docs/fr/Atcm30_fr001_e.doc |archivedate=8 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm|title=Politics of Antarctica|accessdate=5 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050214014631/http://www.knet.co.za/antarctica/political.htm|archivedate=14 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iaato.org/documents/10157/1444539/2015-2016+Tourists+by+Nationality+(Total)/9a4fe29b-1c44-45cc-96b2-246e93137b2f|title=2015–2016 Tourists by Nationality Total|publisher=IAATO|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors. Some environmentalists and scientists have made a call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/734551/Tourism-%27threatens-Antarctic%27.html|title=''Tourism threatens Antarctic''|publisher=Telegraph UK|accessdate=5 February 2006|location=London|first=Mark|last=Rowe|date=11 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary response by Antarctic Treaty Parties has been to develop, through their Committee for Environmental Protection and in partnership with IAATO, "site use guidelines" setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites. Antarctic sightseeing flights (which did not land) operated out of Australia and New Zealand until the fatal crash of [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]] in 1979 on Mount Erebus, which killed all 257 aboard. [[Qantas]] resumed commercial overflights to Antarctica from Australia in the mid-1990s.

Antarctic fisheries in 1998–99 (1 July&amp;nbsp;– 30 June) reported landing 119,898 tonnes legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Antarctica-Year-In-Review-1999|title=Antarctica in 1999|work=Britannica Book of the Year|author=Guthridge, Guy|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year, scientists from 28 different nations conduct [[experiment]]s not reproducible in any other place in the world. In the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate [[research station]]s; this number decreases to just over 1,000 in the winter.&lt;ref name="CIAfactbook-People" /&gt; [[McMurdo Station]], which is the largest research station in Antarctica, is capable of housing more than 1,000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.

Researchers include [[biologist]]s, [[geologist]]s, [[Oceanography|oceanographers]], [[physicist]]s, [[astronomer]]s, [[Glaciology|glaciologists]], and [[Meteorology|meteorologists]]. Geologists tend to study [[plate tectonics]], meteorites from [[outer space]], and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. Glaciologists in Antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and [[Ice-sheet dynamics|dynamics]] of floating ice, [[snow|seasonal snow]], [[glacier]]s, and [[ice sheet]]s. Biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. Medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the body's response to extreme seasonal temperatures. Astrophysicists at [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] study the celestial dome and [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. Many astronomical observations are better made from the interior of Antarctica than from most surface locations because of the high elevation, which results in a thin atmosphere; low temperature, which minimises the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere; and absence of [[light pollution]], thus allowing for a view of space clearer than anywhere else on Earth. Antarctic ice serves as both the shield and the detection medium for the largest [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory|neutrino telescope]] in the world, built {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} below Amundsen–Scott station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml |title=Science in Antarctica |publisher=Antarctic Connection |accessdate=4 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207003148/http://www.antarcticconnection.com/antarctic/science/index.shtml |archivedate=7 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1970s an important focus of study has been the [[ozone layer]] in the [[atmosphere]] above Antarctica. In 1985, three British scientists working on data they had gathered at [[Halley Station]] on the [[Brunt Ice Shelf]] discovered the existence of a hole in this layer. It was eventually determined that the destruction of the ozone was caused by [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (CFCs) emitted by human products. With the ban of CFCs in the [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989, climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.&lt;ref name=adelie&gt;{{cite web|url=https://birdsnews.com/2014/adelie-penguins-thriving-amid-antarcticas-melting-ice/|title=Adelie Penguins thriving amid Antarctica's melting ice|author=Graham, Rex|date=15 July 2014|accessdate=24 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605053724/https://birdsnews.com/2014/adelie-penguins-thriving-amid-antarcticas-melting-ice/|archivedate=5 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 [[The Polar Geospatial Center]] was founded.  The Polar Geospatial Center uses [[Geospatial technology|geospatial]] and [[remote sensing]] technology to provide mapping services to American federally funded research teams.  Currently, the Polar Geospatial Center can image all of Antarctica at 50&amp;nbsp;cm resolution every 45 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/polar-geospatial-center-releases-new-application-with-high-res-satelli/370342|title=Polar Geospatial Center Releases New Application with High-Res Satellite Imagery|author=Rejcek, Peter|publisher=The Antarctic Sun|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 September 2007 Belgian-based International Polar Foundation unveiled the [[Princess Elisabeth Antarctica|Princess Elisabeth station]], the world's first zero-emissions polar science station in Antarctica to [[research]] [[climate change]]. Costing $16.3&amp;nbsp;million, the [[prefabricated]] station, which is part of the [[International Polar Year]], was shipped to the South Pole from [[Belgium]] by the end of 2008 to monitor the [[health]] of the [[polar region]]s. Belgian polar explorer [[Alain Hubert]] stated: "This base will be the first of its kind to produce zero emissions, making it a unique model of how energy should be used in the Antarctic." Johan Berte is the leader of the station design team and manager of the project which conducts research in [[climatology]], [[glaciology]] and [[microbiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.belspo.be/belspo/bepoles/science/station/index_en.stm Belgian Science Policy Office]&amp;nbsp;– Princess Elisabeth Station&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008 [[British Antarctic Survey]] (BAS) scientists, led by Hugh Corr and [[David Vaughan (glaciologist)|David Vaughan]], reported (in the journal ''[[Nature Geoscience]]'') that 2,200 years ago, a [[volcano]] erupted under Antarctica's ice sheet (based on [[aerial survey|airborne survey]] with radar images).

===Meteorites===
[[File:ALH84001.jpg|thumb|left|Antarctic meteorite, named [[ALH84001]], from [[Mars]]]]
[[Meteorite]]s from Antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the [[solar system]]; most are thought to come from [[asteroid]]s, but some may have originated on larger [[planet]]s. The first meteorite was found in 1912, and named the [[Adelie Land meteorite]]. In 1969, a Japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. Most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. Motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. Compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on Earth, the Antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.&lt;ref name="meteorite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|title=Meteorites from Antarctica|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 February 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306122117/http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/antmet/index.cfm|archivedate=6 March 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly [[ALH84001]] discovered by [[ANSMET]], are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref name="meteorite"/&gt;

In 2006 a team of researchers from [[Ohio State University]] used gravity measurements by NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] satellites to discover the {{convert|300|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}} [[Wilkes Land crater]], which probably formed about 250&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref name="crater"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm |title=Big Bang in Antarctica—Killer Crater Found Under Ice |publisher=Research News |first=Pam Frost |last=Gorder |date=1 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306140004/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm |archivedate=6 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015 reports emerged of a {{convert|2|km|mi|adj=on}} [[King Baudouin Ice Shelf#Supposed meteor crater|circular structure]], supposedly a meteorite crater, on the surface snow of [[King Baudouin Ice Shelf]]. Satellite images from 25 years ago seemingly show it.

[[File:Flow of Ice Across Antarctica.ogv|thumb|upright=1.35|The motion of ice in Antarctica]]

Due to its location at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation except along the southern summer. This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. [[Precipitation]] is low (most of Antarctica is a [[desert]]) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as [[ice stream]]s, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many [[ice shelf|ice shelves]]. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from [[seawater]] through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.

Sea ice extent expands annually in the Antarctic winter and most of this ice melts in the summer. This ice is formed from the ocean water and floats in the same water and thus does not contribute to rise in sea level. The [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|extent]] of [[sea ice]] around Antarctica has remained roughly constant in recent decades, although the thickness changes are unclear.&lt;ref name="United Nations Environment Programme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional changes in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |url=https://www.grida.no/resources/5268}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="National Snow and Ice Data Center"&gt;{{cite web|title=All About Sea Ice: Characteristics: Arctic vs. Antarctic|publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center|url=http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317034609/http://nsidc.org/seaice/characteristics/difference.html|archivedate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melting of floating ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) does not in itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However, it is the outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.&lt;ref name="RignotCasassa2004"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1029/2004GL020697| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Casassa | first2 = G.| last3 = Gogineni | first3 = P.| last4 = Krabill | first4 = W.| last5 = Rivera | first5 = A.| last6 = Thomas | first6 = R.| date = 2004| title = Accelerated ice discharge from the Antarctic Peninsula following the collapse of Larsen B ice shelf| journal = [[Geophysical Research Letters]]| volume = 31| issue = 18| pages = L18401| url = http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| accessdate = 22 October 2011| bibcode = 2004GeoRL..3118401R| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123070917/http://www.glaciologia.cl/textos/RignotetalGRLPeninsulaAccel.pdf| archivedate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the world's fresh water.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks" /&gt; This ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea.

Sheperd et al. 2012, found that different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change were in good agreement and combining methods leads to more certainty with East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula changing in mass by +14 ± 43, –65 ± 26, and –20 ± 14 [[gigatonnes]] (Gt) per year.&lt;ref name="IMBIE2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 338 | issue=6111 | pages = 1183–1189 | date = 2012-11-30 | doi = 10.1126/science.1228102| bibcode = 2012Sci...338.1183S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same group's 2018 [[systematic review]] study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatonnes per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002 but has accelerated to an average of 220 gigatonnes per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017.&lt;ref name="IMBIE2018"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shepherd | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Ivins | first2 = Erik | collaboration = [[Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise|IMBIE]] team | title = Mass balance of the Antarctic Ice Sheet from 1992 to 2017 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 558 | pages = 219–222 | date = 2018-06-13 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0179-y | lay-url = https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/06/latest-estimate-shows-how-much-antarctic-ice-has-fallen-into-the-sea/ | lay-source = [[Ars Technica]] | lay-date = 2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's Climate Change website indicates a compatible overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.&lt;ref name="landice"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/ |title=Land Ice |publisher=NASA Global Climate Change |accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single 2015 study by H. Jay Zwally et al. found instead that the net change in ice mass is slightly positive at approximately 82 gigatonnes per year (with significant regional variation) which would result in Antarctic activity reducing global sea-level rise by 0.23 mm per year.&lt;ref name="ZwallyEtAl2015"&gt;{{cite journal |first=H.

Eric Rignot, who has worked on similar Antarctic studies, has been fielding a lot of questions about this one and shared his comments with Ars. “I am afraid I have some rather harsh words about it,” he wrote. Rignot said the data just aren’t precise enough to support the paper's conclusions.¶ “Zwally's group is the only one pushing its interpretation beyond the realm of the inherent uncertainty of the data. Accumulation of snow in East Antarctica is 10 centimeters water equivalent per year. To detect changes in accumulation of 136 gigatons (with no error bar), or 10 percent, Zwally et al. needs to detect changes of the order of 1 centimeter. Current technology such as ICESat cannot detect any change smaller than 20 centimeters. Radar altimetry (used for the earlier period) is closer to 40-50 centimeter noise, but nobody really knows. There is no way to detect changes in East Antarctic accumulation at the 10 percent level, not even 50 percent level, with those kinds of error bars,” Rignot wrote.¶ He continued, “The Zwally group’s findings are at odds with all other independent methods: re-analysis, gravity measurements, mass budget method, and other groups using the same data.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Antarctica is a cold region with a ground base [[Height above mean sea level|above sea level]] and occupies most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the [[East Antarctic Ice Sheet]] as a whole is thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance.&lt;ref name="ShepherdWingham2007"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.1136776| last1 = Shepherd | first1 = A.| last2 = Wingham | first2 = D.| title = Recent Sea-Level Contributions of the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets| journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]| volume = 315| issue = 5818| pages = 1529–1532| date = 2007| pmid = 17363663|bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1529S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1038/ngeo102| last1 = Rignot | first1 = E.| last2 = Bamber | first2 = J.L.| last3 = Van Den Broeke | first3 = M R.| last4 = Davis | first4 = C.| last5 = Li | first5 = Y.| last6 = Van De Berg | first6 = W.J.| last7 = Van Meijgaard | first7 = E.| date = 2008| title = Recent Antarctic ice mass loss from radar interferometry and regional climate modelling| journal = [[Nature Geoscience]]| volume = 1| issue = 2| pages = 106| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232802727_Recent_Antarctic_ice_mass_loss_from_radar_interferometry_and_regional_climate_modelling|bibcode = 2008NatGe...1..106R | pmc = 4032514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shepherdetal2012"&gt;Sheperd et al. 2012 [http://www.sciencemag.org/content/338/6111/1183 A Reconciled Estimate of Ice-Sheet Mass Balance]&lt;/ref&gt; However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.&lt;ref name="RignotBamber2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenWilson2008"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2007.10.057| last1 = Chen | first1 = J.L.| last2 = Wilson | first2 = C.R.| last3 = Tapley | first3 = B.D.| last4 = Blankenship | first4 = D.| last5 = Young | first5 = D.| date = 2008| title = Antarctic regional ice loss rates from GRACE| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 266| issue = 1–2| pages = 140–148|bibcode = 2008E&amp;PSL.266..140C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at &gt;0.05&amp;nbsp;°C (0.09&amp;nbsp;°F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1&amp;nbsp;°C (0.2&amp;nbsp;°F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring.

==Ozone depletion==
[[File:NASA and NOAA Announce Ozone Hole is a Double Record Breaker.png|thumb|Image of the largest Antarctic [[ozone hole]] ever recorded due to [[chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]] accumulation (September 2006)]]
{{Main|Ozone depletion}}

There is a large area of low ozone concentration or "[[ozone hole]]" over Antarctica. This hole covers almost the whole continent and was at its largest in September 2008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antarctic Ozone|authors=British Antarctic Survey, Meteorology and Ozone Monitoring Unit |publisher=Natural Environment Research Council|url=http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/met/jds/ozone/index.html|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hole was detected by scientists in 1985&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Atmospheric science: Fixing the sky|author=Schiermeier, Quirin|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2009/090812/full/460792a.html|journal=Nature|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|doi=10.1038/460792a|date=12 August 2009|volume=460|pages=792–795|accessdate=7 October 2009|issue=7257|pmid=19675624}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has tended to increase over the years of observation. The ozone hole is attributed to the [[Atmospheric emissions|emission]] of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s or CFCs into the atmosphere, which decompose the [[ozone]] into other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html |title=The Antarctic Ozone hole |authors=National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Advanced Supercomputing Division (NAS) |publisher=Government of the United States |date=26 June 2001 |accessdate=7 February 2009 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090403024238/http://www.nas.nasa.gov/About/Education/Ozone/antarctic.html |archivedate= 3 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in Antarctica (and a wider area of the Southern Hemisphere).&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"/&gt; Ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the [[stratosphere]]. Ozone depletion over Antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6&amp;nbsp;°C in the local stratosphere. This cooling has the effect of intensifying the westerly winds which flow around the continent (the [[polar vortex]]) and thus prevents outflow of the cold air near the South Pole. As a result, the continental mass of the East Antarctic ice sheet is held at lower temperatures, and the peripheral areas of Antarctica, especially the Antarctic Peninsula, are subject to higher temperatures, which promote accelerated melting.&lt;ref name="schiermeier2009"/&gt; Models also suggest that the ozone depletion/enhanced polar vortex effect also accounts for the recent increase in sea ice just offshore of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Turner J.|author2=Comiso J.C.|author3=Marshall G.J.|author4=Lachlan-Cope T.A.|author5=Bracegirdle T.|author6=Maksym T.|author7=Meredith M.P., Wang Z.|author8= Orr A.|title=Non-annular atmospheric circulation change induced by stratospheric ozone depletion and its role in the recent increase of Antarctic sea ice extent|journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]]|volume=36|pages=L08502|date=2009|doi=10.1029/2009GL037524|bibcode=2009GeoRL..36.8502T|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">'''Arne Skoog''' was born in 1913 in the northern Swedish province of [[Jämtland]]. He died on 7 June 1999 aged 86.

==Sweden Calling DXers==

In 1948, Arne, then a young engineer at [[Radio Sweden]], founded [[Sweden Calling DXers]] as a way of keeping listeners in touch with news in the world of international radio. Shortwave came into its own during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and after the war [[shortwave listening]] became a popular hobby. But hobbyists needed access to the latest news, and Arne felt the best place for them to find out was on a shortwave station.

Many hobbyists say they remember Arne presenting Sweden Calling DXers, which is curious since he never did. Arne wrote the scripts, which were read by colleagues, first by the English Service, and then in all of Radio Sweden’s languages, except, ironically, Swedish.

Initially Arne gathered all his own news for the program, but soon listeners were writing in with material for the program. Almost immediately a written version of the program scripts was being mailed out to everyone who contributed. At its height there were between 1500 and 2000 names on the list, and they constituted a ”Who’s Who” of the [[shortwave]] community.

When Arne retired in 1978, on the program’s 30th anniversary, [[George Wood (Radio Sweden)|George Wood]], who wasn’t even born in 1948, took over. But changing times and new Radio Sweden management led to radical changes with the introduction of satellite broadcasting in the 1980s.

The mailing list was discontinued, and the program became a twice a month English-only program called MediaScan, which concentrated more and more on satellite DXing and general Scandinavian media news. The raido program was completely discontinued in 2001, and continues as a sporadically updated page on the Radio Sweden website.

==Arne and the DX Community==

Arne Skoog was also one of the founders of the Swedish DX Federation, and later the European DX Council. He rejected, however, the sometimes expressed claim that he was ”the father of all Swedish DXers”.

In his retirement, Arne turned to his second pastime, violin-making, for which he was quite respected. He taught many courses in the skill. He died on June 7, 1999, in his beloved home province of Jämtland.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Big Brother Award.jpg|thumb|right|Big Brother Award, USA sculpture ("If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face— forever.")]] --&gt;
The '''Big Brother Awards''' ('''BBAs''') recognize "the government and private sector organizations ... which have done the most to threaten [[personal privacy]]". They are named after the [[George Orwell]] character [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] from the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. They are awarded yearly to authorities, companies, organizations, and persons that have been acting particularly and consistently to threaten or violate people's privacy, or disclosed people's [[personal data]] to third parties.

The awards are intended to draw public attention to [[privacy]] issues and related alarming trends in society, especially in [[data privacy]]. The contest is organized by loose coalition of  [[nongovernmental organization]], including Iuridicum Remedium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iure.org/|title=Lidská práva, watchdog, advocacy (Aktuality) - Iuridicum Remedium - IuRe}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Privacy International]],&lt;ref name="BBAI"&gt;http://www.bigbrotherawards.org/&lt;/ref&gt; and others, although some national-level BBAs are organized by specific sponsors.

The German Big Brother Awards are organized and hosted by [[Digitalcourage]] (formerly FoeBuD) in [[Bielefeld]].

The United States most recently hosted its Big Brother Awards – also known as the '''Orwell Awards''' or simply '''the Orwells''' – on 14 April 2005 in Seattle, Washington.  They had previously been hosted in Berkeley, California, on 12 April 2004; New York City on 3 April 2003; San Francisco, California, on 18 April 2002; and Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 7 March 2001. The first annual US Big Brother Awards were made at the [[Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference]] in Washington, D.C., on 7 April 1999, the 50th anniversary of the publication of Orwell's ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.&lt;ref name="Diederich99"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diederich |first1=Tom |title=Intel, US Govt "honored" for breaches of privacy |url=http://linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-04/lw-04-orwell.html |accessdate=25 Jul 2014 |work=Computerworld |date=8 April 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991004233003/http://linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-04/lw-04-orwell.html |archivedate=October 4, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The awards were made by [[Simon Davies (privacy advocate)|Simon Davies]], managing director&lt;ref name=Boodhoo99&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boodhoo |first1=Niala |title=Orwell's Legacy: Big Brother Awards |url=http://www.pcworld.com/pcwtoday/article/0,1510,10441,00.html |accessdate=25 Jul 2014 |work=PC World Today |date=8 April 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508055915/http://www.pcworld.com/pcwtoday/article/0%2C1510%2C10441%2C00.html |archivedate=May 8, 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the London-based Privacy International to recognize "the government and private sector organizations which have done the most to invade personal privacy in the United States."&lt;ref name="Diederich99"/&gt; The awards were given in five categories: Greatest Corporate Invader, Lifetime Menace, Most Invasive Program, People's Choice, and Worst Public Official.&lt;ref name="Boodhoo99"/&gt;

The '''boundaries between the continents''' of [[Earth]] are generally a matter of [[geography|geographical]] convention.  Several slightly different conventions are in use.  The number of [[continent]]s is most commonly considered seven but may range as low as four when the [[Americas]] and [[Afro-Eurasia]] are each considered a single continent.  According to the definition of a continent in the strict sense, an [[island]] cannot be part of any continent, but by convention and in practice most major islands are associated with a continent.

There are three overland boundaries subject to definition:

* between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] (dividing [[Eurasia]]): along the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Urals]] (historically also north of the Caucasus, along the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] or along the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]])
* between Asia and [[Africa]] (dividing Afro-Eurasia into Africa and [[Eurasia]]): at the [[Isthmus of Suez]]
* between [[North America]] and [[South America]] (dividing the [[Americas]]): the [[Isthmus of Panama]]
While the isthmus between Asia and Africa and that between North and South America are today navigable, via the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and [[Panama Canal|Panama]] canals, respectively, diversions and canals of human origin generally are not accepted on their own accord as continent-defining boundaries; the  Suez Canal happens to traverse the [[isthmus]] between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and [[Red Sea]], dividing Asia and Africa. The remaining boundaries concern the association of islands and archipelagos with specific continents, notably:

* the delineation of [[Southeast Asia]] from [[Australasia]] (part of [[Oceania]]) in the [[Ceram Sea]], [[Arafura Sea]], [[Timor Sea]], [[Halmahera Sea]], and [[Malay Archipelago]]
* the delineation between Africa, Europe and Asia in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]
* the delineation between Asia and Europe in the [[Arctic Ocean]]
* the delineation between Europe and North America in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]
* the delineation between North and South America in the [[Caribbean Sea]]
* the delineation of Asia from North America in the [[North Pacific Ocean]]

==Europe and Africa==
[[File:Mediterranean Relief.jpg|left|thumb|300x300px|The Mediterranean sea, between Africa &amp; Europe]]
[[File:Makaronesia.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The Atlantic Ocean around the boundary]]
The [[Europea]]n and [[Africa]]n mainlands are non-contiguous, and the delineation between these continents is thus merely a question of which islands are to be associated with which continent. At its nearest point, [[Morocco]] and the European portion of [[Spain]] are separated by only {{convert|8.1|mi|0|abbr=off|order=flip}}.

The Portuguese Atlantic island possession of the [[Azores]] is {{convert|1368|km|abbr=on}} from Europe and {{convert|1507|km|abbr=on}} from Africa, and is usually grouped with Europe if grouped with any continent. By contrast, the [[Canary Islands|Canary]] and [[Madeira]] islands off the Atlantic coast of [[Morocco]] are much closer to, and usually grouped with, Africa (the Canary Islands are only {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast at their closest point, while Madeira is {{convert|520|km|abbr=on}} from Africa and {{convert|1,000|km|abbr=on}} from Europe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spainforvisitors.com/sections/canaryislands.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225123213/http://spainforvisitors.com/sections/canaryislands.htm |archivedate=25 December 2012 }}; {{cite web|url=http://listofafricancountries.com |title=Countries of Africa |accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mediterranean island nation of [[Malta]] is approximately {{convert|81|km|abbr=on}} from the coast of Sicily in Europe - much closer than the {{convert|288|km|abbr=on}} distance to the closest African coast.  The nearby Italian island of [[Lampedusa]] is {{convert|207|km|abbr=on}} from Sicily while just {{convert|127|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast;  similarly, [[Pantelleria]] is {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from Sicily and just {{convert|71|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast.  All of these Mediterranean islands are actually located on the [[African Plate|African plate]], and may be considered part of the continent of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africa-arabia-plate.weebly.com/|title=African/Arabian Tectonic Plates|website=African/Arabian Tectonic Plates|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/GeolColBk/AfricanPlate.HTM|title=African Plate|website=www.uwgb.edu|access-date=2016-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006145431/https://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/GeolColBk/AfricanPlate.HTM#|archive-date=6 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for political and historical reasons, maps generally display them as part of Europe.

==Europe and Asia==
The boundary between Europe and Asia is unusual among continental boundaries because of its largely mountain-and-river-based characteristics north and east of the Black Sea. The reason is historical, the division of Europe and Asia going back to the early [[Greek geographers]].
In the modern sense of the term "continent", [[Eurasia]] is more readily identifiable as a "continent", and Europe has occasionally been described as a [[subcontinent]] of Eurasia.&lt;ref name="europe"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hans Slomp |title=Europe: A Political Profile |year=2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;pg=PA634&amp;lpg=PA634&amp;dq=%22european+subcontinent%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SYCYoz-m3V&amp;sig=zCy9OfV_frpcoJH0acUWF8JGX3c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GWUNVKlrx9qgBPmZgbAM&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22european%20subcontinent%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[File:Historical Europe-Asia boundaries 1700 to 1900.png|thumb|upright|Conventions used for the boundary between Europe and Asia during the 18th and 19th centuries. The red line shows the most common modern convention, in use since {{circa|1850}} (see [[#Modern definition|below]]).
{{legend|#fcf9ea|Europe}}
{{legend|#d2d0c5|Asia}}
{{legend|#edfb9d|historically placed in either continent}}]]
The threefold division of the [[Old World]] into Europe, Asia and Africa has been in use since the 6th century BC, due to [[Greek geographers]] such as [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]]. 

Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the [[Phasis River]] (the modern Rioni) in the Caucasus (from its mouth by [[Poti]] on the [[Black Sea]] coast, through the [[Surami Pass]] and along the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.38. C.f. James Rennell, ''The Geographical System of Herodotus Examined and Explained'', Volume 1, Rivington 1830, [https://books.google.com/books?id=enQ-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=Herodotus+Phasis&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g8qiTbXZNtCVOuPjjDU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Herodotus%20Phasis&amp;f=false p. 244]&lt;/ref&gt;
As geographic knowledge of the Greeks increased during the [[Hellenistic period]],&lt;ref&gt;according to Strabo (''[[Geographica]]'' 11.7.4) even at the time of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], "it was agreed by all that the Tanais river separated Asia from Europe" ({{lang|grc|ὡμολόγητο ἐκ πάντων ὅτι διείργει τὴν Ἀσίαν ἀπὸ
τῆς Εὐρώπης ὁ Τάναϊς ποταμός}}; c.f. Duane W. Roller, ''Eratosthenes' Geography'', Princeton University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-691-14267-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8peKyWK_SWsC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Eratosthenes+Tanais&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vdGiTeTEEY7rObCruTU&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Eratosthenes%20Tanais&amp;f=false p. 57])
&lt;/ref&gt; this archaic convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] (the modern Don River). This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as [[Posidonius]],&lt;ref&gt;
W. Theiler, ''Posidonios. Die Fragmente'', vol. 1. Berlin: De Gruyter, 1982, fragm. 47a.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;

Kidd (ed.), ''Posidonius: The commentary'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-521-60443-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_iXs1aCr1ckC&amp;pg=PA738&amp;dq=Posidonius+Tanais&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E8-iTdzLH8aZOuXPuTQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Tanais&amp;f=false p. 738].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref&gt;
''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' 7.5.6 (ed. Nobbe 1845, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHMCAAAAQAAJ vol. 2], p. 178)) {{lang|grc|Καὶ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ δὲ συνάπτει διὰ τοῦ μεταξὺ αὐχένος τῆς τε Μαιώτιδος λίμνης καὶ τοῦ Σαρματικοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς διαβάσεως τοῦ Τανάϊδος ποταμοῦ. }}
"And [Asia] is connected to Europe by the land-strait between Lake Maiotis and the Sarmatian Ocean where the river Tanais crosses through."&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [[Eurasia]] into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]],  the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (known in antiquity as the Tanais). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [[Kalach-na-Donu]] (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [[Volga–Don Canal]]), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.

[[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the [[Volga River|Volga]], following the Volga north until the [[Samara Bend]], along [[Obshchy Syrt]] (the [[drainage divide]] between Volga and [[Ural River|Ural]]) and then north along [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=German|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |title=Boundary of Europe and Asia along Urals |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130417143618/http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |archivedate=17 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The [[:commons:Category:Atlas of Russian Empire. 1745 year|1745 atlas]] published by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as [[Serafimovich (town)|Serafimovich]] before cutting north towards [[Arkhangelsk]], while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as [[John Cary]] followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, [[Peter Simon Pallas]], as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simon Pallas, ''Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire'', vol. 3 (1773)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the [[Volga–Don Canal]] and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the [[Greater Caucasus watershed]] to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a controversy in geographical literature of the 1860s, with [[Douglas Freshfield]] advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the best possible, citing support from various modern geographers.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W. Freshfield, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=ips8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=%22watershed+of+the+Caucasus%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4bCdTeaeEpDsOeK6iOgE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22watershed%20of%20the%20Caucasus%22&amp;f=false Journey in the Caucasus]", ''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'', Volumes 13-14, 1869.

In [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.rsl.ru/view.php?path=/rsl01004000000/rsl01004103000/rsl01004103489/rsl01004103489.pdf#?page=163 "Europe"]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from [[Baydaratskaya Bay]], on the [[Kara Sea]], along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the [[Ural River]] until the [[Mugodzhar Hills]], and then the [[Emba River]]; and Kuma–Manych Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velikijporog.narod.ru/st_evraz_gran.htm|title=Do we live in Europe or in Asia?|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |title=Physical Geography |year=1998 |author=Orlenok V. |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016212930/http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest&lt;ref&gt;E. M. Moores, R. W. Fairbridge, ''Encyclopedia of European and Asian regional geology'', Springer, 1997, {{ISBN|978-0-412-74040-4}}, p. 34: "most Soviet geographers took the watershed of the Main Range of the Greater Caucasus as the boundary between Europe and Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; and this became the standard convention in the latter 20th century, although the Kuma–Manych boundary remained in use in some 20th-century maps.

The modern border between Asia and Europe remains a historical and cultural construct, defined only by convention. The modern border follows the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Dardanelles]]-[[Sea of Marmara]]-[[Bosphorus]] (together known as the [[Turkish Straits]]), the [[Black Sea]], along the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of the [[Greater Caucasus]], the northwestern portion of the [[Caspian Sea]] and along the [[Ural River]] and [[Ural Mountains]] to the [[Kara Sea]], as mapped and listed in most atlases including that of the [[National Geographic Society]] and as described in the [[World Factbook]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeoAtlas"&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=9th|year=2011|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-1-4262-0634-4}} "Europe" (plate 59); "Asia" (plate 74): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe ... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Factbook"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html |location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] both have most of their territory in Asia, although each has small parts of their northern borderlands north of the Greater Caucasus watershed and thus in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}} Azerbaijan: Geography and Georgia: Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most geographic sources assign the area south of the Caucasus Mountain crest to [[Southwest Asia|Southwest or West Asia]],&lt;ref name="Asia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/100270/Caucasus |title=Caucasus |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; no definition is entirely satisfactory, with it often becoming a matter of self-identification. Cultural influences in the area originate from both Asia and Europe. While geographers rarely define continents primarily politically, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and to a lesser extent [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] are increasingly in the 21st century politically oriented towards Europe, but Armenia has a great cultural diaspora to the south, and Azerbaijan shares a cultural affinity with [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Iranian Azerbaijan]] as well as with the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] countries of [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref name="De Waal"&gt;Thomas De Waal.

The Turkish city [[Istanbul]] lies in on both sides of the Bosporus (one of the Turkish Straits), making it a transcontinental city. [[Russia]] and [[Turkey]] are transcontinental countries with territory in both Europe and Asia by any definition except that of Eurasia as a single continent. While Russia is historically a European country with a history of [[Russian Empire|imperial conquests]] in Asia, the situation for Turkey is inverse, as that of an Asian country with [[Ottoman Empire|imperial conquests]] in Europe. [[Kazakhstan]] is also a transcontinental country by this definition, its [[West Kazakhstan Province|West Kazakhstan]] and [[Atyrau Province|Atyrau]] provinces extending on either side of the Ural River.&lt;ref name="Factbook-Ural"&gt;{{Cite book | title=World Factbook | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kz.html |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]}} Kazakhstan: Geography&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ural River bridge in [[Orenburg]] is even labeled with permanent monuments carved with the word "Europe" on one side, "Asia" on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.katjasdacha.com/whiterose/thoughts/orenburg/orenburg3.html|title=Orenburg bridge monument photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] (more precisely, the [[Manych River]], the [[Kuma–Manych Canal]] and the [[Kuma River (Russia)|Kuma River]]) remains cited less commonly as one possible natural boundary in contemporary sources.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]'' (2011) s.v. [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/324715/Kuma-Manych-Depression "Kuma-Manych Depression"]: "It is often regarded as the natural boundary between Europe and Asia."&lt;/ref&gt; This definition peaked in prominence in the 19th century, however it has declined in usage since then, as it places traditionally European areas of Russia such as  [[Stavropol]], [[Krasnodar]], and even areas just south of [[Rostov-on-Don]] in Asia.

A lesser known definition for country grouping, is the definition used for statistical purposes by the [[United Nations Statistics Division]] (UNSD):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm| title=Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, and selected economic and other groupings| publisher=United Nations Statistics Division}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* listed as part of [[Eastern Europe]]: [[Russian Federation]]
* listed as part of [[Central Asia]]: [[Kazakhstan]]
* listed as part of [[Western Asia]]: [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Cyprus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Turkey]]
 
According to UNSD, the aforementioned "assignment of countries or areas to specific groupings is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm |title=Standard country or area codes and geographical regions for statistical use |publisher=Unstats.un.org |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the UNSD classification often differs from those of other [[United Nations]] organizations. For instance, while UNSD includes Georgia and Cyprus in Western Asia, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]  and [[UNESCO]] include both countries in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FAKMBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=west+asia+iran+2015&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cWGRVanpKqOy7Qb1tqP4Bw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20asia%20iran%202015&amp;f=false United Nations Industrial Organisation] p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/worldwide/unesco-regions/europe-and-north-america/ Europe and North America], Retrieved: 10 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands===
[[Cyprus]] is an island of the Mediterranean located close to [[Asia Minor]], so that it is usually associated with Asia and/or the [[Middle East]], as in the [[World Factbook]] and the [[United Nations geoscheme]], but the [[Republic of Cyprus]] was nevertheless admitted to the Council of Europe in 1961 and joined the EU in 2004.  The northern part of the island functions as the unrecognized (except by Turkey) [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]].

The Greek [[Aegean Islands|North Aegean Islands]] and the [[Dodecanese]] lie on the coast of the Asian part of Turkey (on the Asian continental shelf).

==Europe and North America==
Europe and North America are separated by the [[North Atlantic]].
In terms of associating islands with either continent, the boundary is usually drawn between [[Greenland]] and [[Iceland]]. The Norwegian islands of [[Jan Mayen]] and [[Svalbard]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]] are usually associated with Europe. Iceland and the [[Azores]] are protrusions of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] and are associated with and peopled from Europe, even though they have areas on the [[North American Plate]].  (Definitions of "continents" are a physical and [[cultural construct]] dating back centuries, long before the advent or even knowledge of [[plate tectonics]]; thus, defining a "continent" falls into the realm of physical and cultural geography, while continental plate definitions fall under plate tectonics in the realm of [[geologists|geology]].)

===Islands===
The geographical notion of a [[continent]] stands in opposition to islands and archipelagos.&lt;ref&gt;
See [[:continent#Noun|continent]] on [[Wiktionary]]. "from Latin ''continent-, continens'' 'continuous mass of land, mainland'" (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/continent?show=1&amp;t=1301917145 merriam-webster.com])&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, there are some islands that are considered part of Europe in a political sense.
This most notably includes the [[British Isles]] (part of the European continental shelf and during the Ice Age of the continent itself), besides the islands of the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean]] which are part of the territory of a country situated on the European mainland, and usually also the [[island state]]s of [[Iceland]] and [[Malta]].

Russia's [[Vaygach Island]] and [[Novaya Zemlya]] extend northward from the northern end of the [[Ural Mountains]] and are a continuation of that chain into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. While Novaya Zemlya was variously grouped with Europe or with Asia in 19th-century maps it is now usually grouped with Europe, the continental boundary considered to join the Arctic Ocean along the southern shore of the [[Kara Sea]]. The Russian Arctic [[archipelago]] of [[Franz Josef Land]] farther north is also associated with Europe.

Europe ends in the west at the [[Atlantic Ocean]], although Iceland and the [[Azores]] archipelago (in the Atlantic, between Europe and North America) are usually considered European, as is the Norwegian [[Svalbard]] archipelago in the [[Arctic Ocean]]. [[Greenland]] is geographically part of North America, but politically associated with Europe as it is part of the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], although it has extensive home rule and EU law no longer applies there.

==Africa and Asia==
[[File:TransAfrica.PNG|thumb|
{{legend|#FF0000|African part of Egypt}}
{{legend|#FFA500|Asian part of Egypt}}
{{legend|#FFFF00|Rest of Asia}}
{{legend|#C0C0C0|Rest of Africa}}]]

Historically in [[Greco-Roman geography]], "Africa" meant [[Ancient Libya]], and its eastern extent was taken to be around [[Marmarica]], at the ''[[Catabathmus Magnus]]'', placing [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] in Asia entirely.
The idea of Egypt being an "African" country seems to develop in around the mid-19th century;{{CN|date=August 2016}} the term  ''Africa'' was classically reserved for what is now known as the [[Maghreb]], to the explicit exclusion of Egypt, but with the [[exploration of Africa]] the shape of the African landmass (and Egypt's "natural" inclusion in that landmass) became apparent.  In 1806, [[William George Browne]] still titled his travelogue ''Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria''. Similarly, [[James Bruce]] in 1835 published ''Travels through part of Africa, Syria, Egypt, and Arabia''. On the other hand,
as early as 1670  [[John Ogilby]] under the title ''Africa'' published ''"an accurate Description of the Regions of Egypt, Barbary, Libya, and Billedulgerid, the Land of Negroes, Guinea, Æthiopia, and the Abyssines, with all the adjacent Islands, either in the Mediterranean, Atlantic, Southern, or Oriental Seas, belonging thereunto"''.

The usual line taken to divide Africa from Asia today is at the [[Isthmus of Suez]], the narrowest gap between the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Gulf of Suez]], the route today followed by the [[Suez Canal]]. This makes the [[Sinai Peninsula]] geographically Asian, and [[Egypt]] a transcontinental country. Less than 2% of Egyptian population live in the Sinai, and hence Egypt, even though technically transcontinental, is usually considered an [[African country]] entirely and not partly Asian.

But when discussing the geopolitical region of the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]], Egypt is usually grouped with the Western Asian countries as part of the [[Middle East]], while Egypt's western neighbor [[Libya]] is grouped with the remaining North African countries as the [[Maghreb]]. However, they are both members of the [[Arab League]] as well as the [[African Union]].

The [[Seychelles]], [[Mauritius]], and [[Comoros]] are island nations in the [[Indian Ocean]] associated with Africa. The island of [[Socotra]] may be considered African as it lies on this continent's shelf, but is part of [[Yemen]], an Asian country.

==North and South America==

{{Further|Americas|Central America}}

===Mainland===
The border between North America and South America is at some point on the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. The most common demarcation in atlases and other sources follows the [[Serranía del Darién|Darién Mountains]] watershed divide along the [[Colombia]]-Panama [[Colombia–Panama border|border]] where the isthmus meets the South American continent.  Virtually all atlases list Panama as a state falling entirely within [[North America]] and/or [[Central America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/mapping/outline-map/?map=Panama |title=National Geographic Education |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=2011-05-12 }}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas (list)|publisher=National Geographic Society|year=2010|page=4}}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite book|title=Webster's New Geographical Dictionary (list and map)|publisher=Merriam-Webster Inc.|year=1984|pages=856, 859}}&lt;br&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#americas "Americas"] ''Standard Country and Area Codes Classifications (M49)'', United Nations Statistics Division&lt;br&gt;[http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view "North America"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303000000/http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/site/english/maps/reference/international/north_america/referencemap_image_view |date=3 March 2008 }} ''Atlas of Canada''&lt;br&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=nameri&amp;Rootmap=&amp;Mode=d&amp;SubMode=w North America Atlas] National Geographic&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islands===
Often most of the [[Caribbean islands]] are considered part of North America, but [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]], [[Curaçao]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] lie on the [[continental shelf]] of South America. On the other hand, the Venezuelan [[Isla Aves]] and the Colombian [[San Andrés and Providencia]] lie on the North American shelf.

==Asia and North America==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
The [[Bering Strait]] and [[Bering Sea]] separate the landmasses of Asia and North America, as well as forming the international boundary between Russia and the United States. This national and continental boundary separates the [[Diomede Islands]] in the Bering Strait, with Big Diomede in Russia and Little Diomede in the US. The [[Aleutian Islands]] are an island chain extending westward from the [[Alaska Peninsula]] toward Russia's [[Komandorski Islands]] and [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. Most of them are always associated with North America, except for the westernmost [[Near Islands]] group, which is on Asia's continental shelf beyond the [[North Aleutians Basin]] and on rare occasions could be associated with Asia, which could then allow the U.S. state of [[Alaska]] to be considered a transcontinental state.

[[St. Lawrence Island]] in the northern Bering Sea belongs to Alaska and may be associated with either continent but is almost always considered part of North America, as with the [[Rat Islands]] in the Aleutian chain. At their nearest points, [[Alaska]] and [[Russia]] are separated by only {{convert|2.5|mi|0|order=flip|abbr=off}}.

==The Americas and Oceania==
The [[Galápagos Islands]] and [[Malpelo Island]] in the eastern Pacific Ocean are possessions of [[Ecuador]] and [[Colombia]], respectively, and associated with South America. The uninhabited French possession of [[Clipperton Island]] {{convert|600|mi|sigfig=1|order=flip|abbr=off}} off the Mexican coast is associated with North America.

[[Easter Island]], a territory of [[Chile]], is considered to be in Oceania, though politically it is associated with South America.

The United States of America controls numerous territories in Oceania, including the state of [[Hawaii]] and the territories of [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] and [[American Samoa]].

==Asia and Oceania==
[[File:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|thumb|right|300px|[[Wallace Line|Wallace]], [[Lydekker line|Lydekker]] and [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber]] Lines, the principals on [[Wallacea]] ]]
The [[Malay Archipelago]] is usually divided between Asia and [[Australasia]], most commonly along the anthropologic Melanesian line or [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber's Line]]. Indonesia controls the western half of [[New Guinea]], geographically part of Australasia. The eastern half of the island is part of [[Papua New Guinea]] which is considered to be part of Oceania. Indonesia is  commonly referred to as one of the [[Asia#SouthEast Asia|Southeast Asian]] countries. [[East Timor]], an independent state that was formerly a territory of Indonesia, which is geographically part of Asia, is classified by the [[United Nations]] as part of the "South-Eastern Asia" block. It is [[ASEAN Summit#East Timor|expected to join]] the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/east-timor-asean-bid/2006/07/22/1153166635002.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=East Timor ASEAN bid | date=23 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been involved as an ASEAN Regional Forum member since independence, and has participated in the [[Southeast Asian Games]] since [[2003 Southeast Asian Games|2003]]. Occasionally, all of the [[Malay Archipelago]] is included in Oceania, although this is extremely rare, especially as most of the archipelago lies on the Asian continental shelf.

The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] includes [[List of islands of Australia#External Territories|island possessions in Oceania]] and islands closer to Indonesia than the Australian mainland.

==Antarctica==
Antarctica along with its outlying islands have no permanent population. All land claims south of 60°S latitude are held in abeyance by the [[Antarctic Treaty System]].

The [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] are closer to Antarctica than to any other continent. However, they are politically associated with the inhabited [[Falkland Islands]] which are closer to South America. Furthermore, Argentina, a South American country, maintains its [[irredentism|irredentist]] claims on the islands. The continental shelf boundary separates the two island groups.

The [[Prince Edward Islands]] are located between Africa and Antarctica, and are the territory of South Africa, an African country.  The Australian [[Macquarie Island]] and the New Zealand [[Antipodes Islands]], [[Auckland Islands]], and [[Campbell Island group|Campbell Islands]], are all located between the [[Oceania]]n countries of Australia and New Zealand and Antarctica.&lt;!-- see [[Talk:Transcontinental country#New Zealand|discussion]] --&gt;

Australia's [[Heard Island and McDonald Islands]] and the French [[Kerguelen Islands]] are located on the [[Kerguelen Plateau]], on the Antarctic continental plate. The French [[Crozet Islands]], [[Île Amsterdam]], [[Île Saint-Paul]], and the Norwegian [[Bouvet Island]] are also located on the Antarctic continental plate, and are not often associated with other continents.

'''''Bryum argenteum''''', the '''silvergreen bryum moss''' or '''silvery thread moss''',&lt;ref name=usda&gt;{{PLANTS|id=BRAR71|taxon=Bryum argenteum|accessdate=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a species of [[moss]] in the family [[Bryaceae]]. It is one of the most common urban mosses of inner cities and can be easily recognized without a microscope.
[[file:A living car.jpg|thumb|''B. argenteum'' growing in the cracks of a car window]]

==Description==
The species is silvery-green or whitish-green colored when dry. This is because the broadly ovate shaped single leaflets in the tip do not form [[chlorophyll]]. The costa extends beyond the middle of the leaf. In damp, undisturbed locations, the branches may also form a more horizontal growth habit. The upper cells of the leaf surface are elongated rhomboid shaped. The capsule of the sporophyte is short cylindrical, appears broader at the base and is dark red to black colored.&lt;ref name=il&gt;http://www.illinoiswildflowers.info/mosses/plants/silver_moss.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It has a high ability to tolerate drought and pollution of urban environments.&lt;ref&gt;http://pza.sanbi.org/bryum-argenteum&lt;/ref&gt; ''B. argenteum'' is considered a desiccation tolerant species that can withstand total drying. While it is a common characteristic in mosses, ''B. argenteum'' was one of the first [[bryophytes]] experimentally determined to be desiccation tolerant.&lt;ref name=gao2017&gt;Gao B, Li X, Zhang D, et al. Desiccation tolerance in bryophytes: The dehydration and rehydration transcriptomes in the desiccation-tolerant bryophyte Bryum argenteum. Sci Rep. 2017;7(1):7571. Published 2017 Aug 8. doi:10.1038/s41598-017-07297-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
An adaptable plant, it has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] and is found in Europe, North America, the deserts of [[Australia]] and in [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=AOLA&gt;{{cite web |title=Bryum argenteum|work=Atlas of Living Australia|url=https://bie.ala.org.au/species/http://id.biodiversity.org.au/node/ausmoss/10062136|accessdate= October 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite web|title=The cosmopolitan moss Bryum argenteum in Antarctica: recent colonisation or in situ survival?|author=S. Pisa, E. M. Biersma, P. Convey, J. Patiño, A. Vanderpoorten, O Werner, R. M. Ros|work=Springer Link - Polar Biology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00300-014-1537-3|accessdate=October 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612122250/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00300-014-1537-3|archive-date=2018-06-12|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It thrives in areas of high anthropogenic activity, growing on rocks, in gaps of paving stones, on asphalt, and on roadsides. It grows especially well in inner cities or in industrial areas. Being a nitrogen loving species, it is also found on nitrophilic soils in urban areas.  It is found growing among lawns as well as in other moss communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/bbs/activities/mosses/Bryum%20argenteum.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The species is often spread by vegetative fragments clinging to the shoes of people and the feet or hooves of animals.&lt;ref name=il/&gt;
Another method of spread is in the production and sale of [[liners]]. Liners infested with ''B. argentem'', often in association with ''[[Marchantia polymorpha]]'', are commonly grown in one region of the country, transported to another region to continue growth, and are shipped to a retail location before being planted. Plants have the potential to pick up or disperse these species at each point of transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/13/1/35.full.pdf|title=Controlling Liverwort and Moss Now and in the Future| accessdate=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biogeography]], a [[taxon]] is said to have a '''cosmopolitan distribution''' if its [[range (biology)|range]] extends across all or most of the world in appropriate [[habitat]]s. Such a taxon is said to exhibit cosmopolitanism or cosmopolitism. The opposite extreme is [[endemism]].

==Related terms and concepts==
The term '''pandemism''' also is in use, but not all authors are consistent in the sense in which they use the term; some speak of pandemism mainly in referring to diseases and [[pandemic]]s, and some as a term intermediate between endemism and cosmopolitanism, in effect regarding pandemism as '''subcosmopolitanism'''. This means near cosmopolitanism, but with major gaps in the [[species distribution|distribution]], say, complete absence from Australia.&lt;ref name="Simpson2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael G. Simpson|title=Plant Systematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj8KRImgyf4C&amp;pg=PA720|date=19 July 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-092208-9|pages=720–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HarperServais2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.

==Aspects and degrees==
The term "cosmopolitan distribution" usually should not be taken literally, because it often is applied loosely in various contexts. Commonly the intention is not to include polar regions, extreme altitudes, oceans, deserts, or small, isolated islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ecology and Environmental Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKTeiqPBpM4C&amp;pg=PA164|date=15 July 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-1324-6|pages=164–}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[housefly]] is nearly as cosmopolitan as any animal species, but it is neither oceanic nor polar in its distribution.&lt;ref name="RussellOtranto2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard C. Russell|author2=Domenico Otranto|author3=Richard L. Wall|title=The Encyclopedia of Medical and Veterinary Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9QfhF_wQSV4C&amp;pg=PA157|year=2013|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-78064-037-2|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the term "cosmopolitan weed" implies no more than that the plant in question occurs on all continents except [[Antarctica]]; it is not meant to suggest that the species is present in all regions of every continent.

==Oceanic and terrestrial==
Another concept in [[biogeography]] is that of [[Oceanography|oceanic]] cosmopolitanism and endemism. Although there is a temptation to regard the [[World Ocean]] as a medium without biological boundaries, this is far from reality; many physical and biological barriers interfere with either the spread or continued residence of many species. For example, temperature gradients prevent free migration of tropical species between the Atlantic and Indian-plus-Pacific oceans, even though there is open passage past continental masses such as the Americas and Africa/Eurasia. Again, as far as many species are concerned, the [[Southern Ocean]] and the Northern marine regions are completely isolated from each other by the intolerable temperatures of the tropical regions. In the light of such considerations, it is no surprise to find that endemism and cosmopolitanism are quite as marked in the oceans as on land.

==Ecological delimitation==
Another aspect of cosmopolitanism is that of ecological limitations. A species that is apparently cosmopolitan because it occurs in all oceans might in fact occupy only [[littoral zone|littoral zones]], or only particular ranges of depths, or only [[Estuary|estuaries]], for example. Analogously, [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial]] species might be present only in forests, or mountainous regions, or sandy [[arid]] regions or the like. Such distributions might be patchy, or extended, but narrow. Factors of such a nature are taken widely for granted, so they seldom are mentioned explicitly in mentioning cosmopolitan distributions.

==Regional and temporal variation in populations==
Cosmopolitanism of a particular species or variety should not be confused with cosmopolitanism of higher taxa.  For example, the family [[Antlion|Myrmeleontidae]] is cosmopolitan in the sense that every continent except Antarctica is home to some indigenous species within the Myrmeleontidae, but nonetheless no one species, nor even genus, of the Myrmeleontidae is cosmopolitan. Conversely, partly as a result of human introduction of unnatural [[Beekeeping|apiculture]] to the New World, ''[[western honey bee|Apis mellifera]]'' probably is the only cosmopolitan member of its family; the rest of the family [[Apidae]] have modest distributions.

Even where a cosmopolitan population is recognised as a single species, such as indeed ''Apis mellifera'', there generally will be variation between regional sub-populations. Such variation commonly is at the level of [[subspecies]], [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] or [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]], whereas some variation is too slight or inconsistent for formal recognition.

For an example of subspecific variation, consider the so-called "[[Africanized bee|African killer bee]]", which is the subspecies ''[[African bee|Apis mellifera scutellata]]'', and the [[African bee|Cape bee]], which is the subspecies ''[[African bee|Apis mellifera capensis]]''; both of them are in the same cosmopolitan species ''Apis mellifera'', but their ranges barely overlap.

Other cosmopolitan species, such as the [[osprey]] and [[house sparrow]], present similar examples, but in yet other species there are less familiar complications: some migratory birds such as the [[Arctic tern]] occur from the Arctic to the [[Southern Ocean]], but at any one season of the year they are likely to be largely in passage or concentrated at only one end of the range. Also, some such species breed only at one end of the range. Seen purely as an aspect of cosmopolitanism, such distributions could be seen as temporal, seasonal variations.

Other complications of cosmopolitanism on a planet too large for local populations to interbreed routinely with each other, lead to genetic effects such as [[ring species]], for example in the ''[[Larus]]'' gulls.&lt;ref name="Kunz2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Werner Kunz|title=Do Species Exist: Principles of Taxonomic Classification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQxwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT211|date=2 August 2013|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-3-527-66426-9|pages=211–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also lead to the formation of [[Cline (biology)|clines]] such as in [[Drosophila]].&lt;ref name="KrimbasPowell1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Costas B.

==Ancient and modern==

Cosmopolitan distributions can be observed both in extinct and extant species. For example, ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' was cosmopolitan in the Early Triassic after a mass extinction.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759.full.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M.

In the modern world, the [[killer whale]] has a cosmopolitan distribution, extending over most of the Earth's [[ocean]]s. The wasp ''[[Copidosoma floridanum]]'' is another example, as it is found around the world. Other examples include [[human]]s, [[cat]]s, [[dog]]s, [[orchid]]s, the foliose [[lichen]] ''[[Parmelia sulcata]]'', and the [[Mollusca|mollusc]] genus ''[[Mytilus (bivalve)|Mytilus]]''.&lt;ref name="Spellerberg"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Ian F.

'''David Vanderpool''' (born February 18, 1960) is an American medical missionary and the CEO and founder of Live Beyond, which has provided medical, spiritual and logistical support to disaster ridden countries.

Vanderpool's work is unusual in that he combines his medical training with an explicit effort to convert his patients to Christianity.

==Early life and education==
Vanderpool was born in [[Dallas, Texas]], graduated from [[St. Mark's School of Texas]], and received his undergraduate degree from [[Abilene Christian University]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[https://smtexas.myschoolapp.com/ftpimages/73/download/The_Pride_2011_Winter.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended the [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] at [[Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center]]. After medical school, Vanderpool completed two surgical residencies at [[Baylor University Medical Center]] where he trained as a vascular surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mmdr.org/Staff.html |title=Staff |publisher=Mmdr.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140126081445/http://www.mmdr.org/staff.html |archivedate=2014-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Vanderpool wife, Laurie, is a speaker for Women's Retreats and [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible Studies]], and speaks frequently for Down Syndrome organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Staff.html |title=Staff |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203173807/http://www.livebeyond.org/Staff.html |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Vanderpool remained in Texas after residency and practiced as a vascular surgeon before moving to Brentwood, Tennessee in 2001 and opening his private practice Lave MD in 2003.

Dr. Vanderpool created Lave MD to act as both a medical facility and a spa. 
After the establishment of his international organization in 2005, Dr. Vanderpool used much of Lave MD's proceeds to fund the organization's efforts abroad.

==Medical missionary work==
In 2005, after [[Hurricane Katrina]] hit the southeastern part of the United States, Dr. Vanderpool delivered healthcare across the Mississippi Coast out of a trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowler |first=Joanne |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20358101,00.html |title=Hope Out of the Rubble |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; His goal was to provide as much free healthcare as possible while the medical infrastructure could recover. Months later, Dr. Vanderpool established his organization, Medical Mobile Disaster Relief, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with goals to provide disaster relief through medical clinics, clean water projects, and micro-finance projects to areas hit by disasters. 
Vanderpool and the Mobile Medical Disaster Relief team began working in Mozambique in 2006. His goal was to provide healthcare to the indigenous people of the country in addition to enhancing the economy by implementing micro-finance projects among widows living in the communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Mozambique.html |title=Mozambique |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085936/http://www.livebeyond.org/Mozambique.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2008, Dr. Vanderpool teamed up with the [[Belmont University|Belmont School of Nursing]] to construct a nursing curriculum that could teach the Mozambique women to be self-sufficient in caring for themselves and their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nashville.medicalnewsinc.com/physician-spotlight-david-vanderpool-md-cms-1943 |title=Physician Spotlight: David Vanderpool, MD on Nashville Medical News |publisher=Nashville.medicalnewsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanderpool and his Mobile Medical Disaster Relief partnered with PACODEP (Partners in Community Development) in Ghana in order to provide medical care, educate the locals on water purification and distribute water purifiers. PACODEP works to free enslaved children who are trafficked through Ghana for purposes of fishing work. Dr. Vanderpool has also partnered with local hospitals in Ghana in order to provide free invasive surgeries to these rescued children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Ghana.html |title=Ghana |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110090632/http://www.livebeyond.org/Ghana.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Vanderpool partnered with Mission Lazarus in 2009 to build a sustainable medical clinic in [[Cedeño, Honduras]]. Given sufficient medical supplies and equipment, Vanderpool allowed Mission Lazarus to take over the clinic and provision of healthcare for the people of Cedeño.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Honduras.html |title=Honduras |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085736/http://www.livebeyond.org/Honduras.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live Beyond in Haiti===
Dr. Vanderpool shifted his focus in the aftermath of the [[Haiti earthquake 2010|earthquake]] that devastated the entire country of Haiti in 2010. In 2010, Vanderpool officially changed the name of his organization from Mobile Medical Disaster Relief to Live Beyond with a stated mission to be "an organization that chooses to Live Beyond...ourselves, our culture, our borders and this life so that others can Live Beyond…disease, hunger, poverty and despair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti.html |title=Haiti |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085813/http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial aid Vanderpool and his team brought to Haiti was primarily mobile medical care to relieve the thousands devastated and injured by the earthquake. Since then however, Vanderpool has grounded his missionary work in Thomazeau, Haiti where his organization began building a base. Vanderpool continued to provide free medical care, establishing a surgical hospital and clinic. In addition, clean water projects, orphanages, and other widow and orphan advocacy projects were begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti-Base.html |title=Haiti Base |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110090459/http://www.livebeyond.org/Haiti-Base.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Dr. Vanderpool is a Christian, who combines religion and the spread of his faith with his medical work. In Haiti, he has made it one of his objectives to bring Haiti away from its traditional voodoo culture and provide "spiritual guidance" to the Haitians in the role of Christianity, with the belief that Christianity will lead to a better Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acuoptimist.com/2010/11/alumni-join-fight-against-cholera-in-haiti/ |title=Alumni join fight against Haiti cholera outbreak &amp;#124; The Optimist |publisher=Acuoptimist.com |date=2010-11-04 |accessdate=2014-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085616/http://www.acuoptimist.com/2010/11/alumni-join-fight-against-cholera-in-haiti/ |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to moving to Haiti, each medical outreach trip made by Vanderpool and other Live Beyond participants included prayer and Christian ministry along with healthcare to the voodoo priests, island chiefs, idol worshipers and the sick and dying in Haiti. On the Live Beyond site, Vanderpool's religious impact since being in Haiti has been characterized as leading to the baptism of dozens, the saving of tribes through "Bibles being read in their own languages" and "the Kingdom is being expanded."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livebeyond.org/Our-Mission.html |title=Our-Mission |publisher=Livebeyond.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110085458/http://www.livebeyond.org/Our-Mission.html |archivedate=2014-01-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Dr. Vanderpool promotes religious missionary work in tandem with his medical relief and sustainable development efforts. A worship center is being built in Thomazeau, Haiti and monthly mission trips are promoted and scheduled for Americans to travel to Thomazeau and volunteer.

'''Deglobalization''' or '''Deglobalisation''' is the process of diminishing interdependence and integration between certain units around the world, typically nation-states. It is widely used to describe the periods of history when economic trade and investment between countries decline. It stands in contrast to [[globalization]], in which units become increasingly integrated over time, and generally spans the time between periods of globalization. While globalization and deglobalisation are antitheses, they are no mirror images

The term of deglobalization has derived from some of the very profound change in many developed nations, where trade as a proportion of total economic activity until the 1970s was below previous peak levels in the early 1910s. This decline reflects that their economies become less integrated with the rest of the world economies in spite of the deepening scope of [[economic globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=New York University Department of Sociology|title=The Sociology Project|year=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=United States of America|isbn=978-0-205-09382-3 |page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the  global level only two longer periods of deglobalization occurred, namely in the 1930s during the Great Depression and 2010s, when following the [[Great Trade Collapse]] the period of the World Trade Slowdown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoekman|first1=Bernhard|title=The Global Trade Slowdown: A New Normal?|date=2015|publisher=CEPR VOXEU|location=Florence ; European University Institute, 2015|url=https://voxeu.org/sites/default/files/file/Global%20Trade%20Slowdown_nocover.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; set in.

The occurrence of deglobalization has strong proponents who have claimed the death of globalisation, but is also contested by leading academics such as Michael Bordo &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bordo |first1=Michael |title=The Second Era of Globalization is Not Yet Over: An Historical Perspective |journal=NBER Working Paper No. 23786 |date=September 2017 |doi=10.3386/w23786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that it is too soon to give a good diagnosis and Mervyn Martin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Mervyn|title=Keeping it Real: Debunking the Deglobalization Myth, Brexit, and Trump:-"Lessons" on Integration' ;|journal=Journal of International Trade Law and Policy|volume=17|pages=62–68|date=2018|doi=10.1108/JITLP-06-2017-0020|url=https://tees.openrepository.com/tees/handle/10149/621562|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argues that US and UK policies are rational answers to essential temporary problems of even strong nations

While as with globalization, deglobalization can refer to economic, trade, social, technological, cultural and political dimensions, much of the work that has been conducted in the study of deglobalization refers to the field of [[international economics]].

== 1930s versus 2010s ==

Periods of deglobalization have mainly been seen as interesting comparators to other periods, such as 1850–1914 and 1950–2007, in which globalization had been the norm, given that globalization is the norm for most people and because the interpretation of the global economy has mainly been framed as inevitably increasing integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livesey|first1=Finbarr.|title=Unpacking the possibilities of deglobalisation|journal=Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society|date=2018|volume=11|issue=1|pages=177–187|doi=10.1093/cjres/rsx030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, even periods of stagnant international interaction are often wrongly seen as periods of deglobalization. Recently scientists, have started to also compare the major periods of deglobalization in order to better understand drivers and consequences of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O’Rourke|first1=Kevin Hjortshøj|title=Two Great Trade Collapses: The Interwar Period and Great Recession Compared.|journal=IMF Economic Review|volume=66|issue=3|pages=418–439|date=2018|doi=10.1057/s41308-017-0046-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Bergeijk|first1=Peter A.G.|title=On the brink of Deglobalisation ... again|journal=Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy and Society|date=2018|volume=11|issue=2|pages=59–72|doi=10.1093/cjres/rsx023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major phases of deglobalisation are not identical twins.The two phases of deglobalisation were equally triggered by a demand shock in the wake of a financial crisis. Both in the 1930s and in the 2000s the composition of trade was a second key determinant: manufacturing trade bore the brunt of the contraction. One important finding is that country experiences both during the Great Depression and Great Recession are very heterogeneous so that one-size-fits-all policies to counter negative impacts of deglobalization are inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bergeijk, Peter AG|author2=Steven Brakman|author3=Charles Marrewijk|title=Heterogeneous economic resilience and the great recession's world trade collapse.|journal=Papers in Regional Science|date=2017|volume=96|issue=1|pages=3–12|doi=10.1111/pirs.12279}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s, democracies supported free trade, and deglobalisation was driven by autocratic decisions to strengthen self-sufficiency. In the 2010s, political institutions are just as significant, but now democratic decisions such as the election of President Trump with an America First agenda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Simon J. Evenett|author2=Johannes Fritz|title=Will Awe Trump Rules?|url=http://www.globaltradealert.org/reports/42|publisher=global trade alert|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brexit drive the deglobalisation process worldwide. Indeed, while the industrialised countries in the 2010s avoided the pitfalls of protectionism and deflation, they have experienced different political dynamics.

== Measures of deglobalization ==

As with globalization, economic deglobalization can be measured in different ways. These centre around the four main economic flows:
* Goods and services, e.g. exports plus imports as a proportion of [[national income]] or per head of population.
* Labour/people, e.g. net [[Human migration|migration rate]]s; inward or outward migration flows, weighted by population (and resultant remittances in per cent of GDP)
* Capital, e.g. inward or outward direct investment as a proportion of national income or per head of population
It is generally not thought possible to measure deglobalization through lack of flows of technology, the fourth main flow. 
Those areas that are measurable do suggest other possible measures, including:
* Average tariffs
* Border restrictions on labour
* [[Capital controls]], including restrictions on foreign direct investment or outward direct investment

The multi-dimensional globalization index of KOF Swiss Economic Institute shows a clear break for economic globalization in 2009 in 2015 KOF observed for its overall index: "The level of globalisation worldwide increased rapidly between 1990 and 2007 and has risen only slightly since the Great Recession. In 2015, globalisation decreased for the first time since 1975. The fall was due to the decline in economic globalisation, with social globalisation stagnating and political globalisation increasing slightly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=KOF|title=press-release/2018/01/kof-globalisation-index-globalisation-down-worldwide-in-2015|url=https://www.kof.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/media/press-releases/2018/01/kof-globalisation-index-globalisation-down-worldwide-in-2015.html|website=www.kof.ethz.ch|publisher=KOF|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other indicators of deglobalization include the development of Foreign Direct Investment, that according to UNCTAD slipped further in 2017 and in stark contrast with production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNCTAD|title=Global Investment Trends Monitor|url=http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/diaeia2018d1_en.pdf|website=unctad.org|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks of deglobalization==
Typically a reduction of the level of international integration of economies (and the world economy at large) are expected to exert second round effects related to four feedback mechanisms:&lt;ref name="brink"&gt;Peter A.G. van Bergeijk, [http://deglobalization.blogspot.nl/ ''On the brink of Deglobalization'',] (Edward Elgar, 2010), {{ISBN|9781849804110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== (International) political economy of deglobalization ==
Deglobalization has also been used as a political agenda item or a term in framing the debate on a new [[World economic order]], for example by [[Walden Bello]] in his 2005 book ''Deglobalization''.&lt;ref name="bello"&gt;Walden Bello, [http://us.macmillan.com/BookCustomPage.aspx?isbn=1842775456&amp;m_type=7 ''Deglobalization: Ideas for a New World Economy'',] (Zed books, 2005). {{ISBN|9781842775455}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the prominent examples of deglobalization movement could be found in the United States of America, where the Bush and Obama administration instituted [[Buy American Act]] clause as party of massive stimulus package, which was designed to favor American-made goods over traded goods. Likewise, the EU has imposed new subsidies to protect their agricultural sectors for their own protection. These movements of deglobalization can be seen as the example of how developed nations react to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08]] through deglobalization movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Office of the Law Revision Counsel |url=http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t41t42+22+1++(41)%20%20AND%2 |publisher=US House of Representatives |accessdate=2013-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806135758/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t41t42+22+1++%2841%29%20%20AND%252 |archivedate=August 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently a change in the pattern of anti-globalism has been observed: anti-globalism now has a strong foothold in the Global North and among right-wing (conservative) politicians,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rory Horner|author2=Daniel Haberly|author3=Seth Schindler|author4=Yuko Aoyama|title=How anti-globalisation switched from a left to a right-wing issue – and where it will go next|url=https://theconversation.com/how-anti-globalisation-switched-from-a-left-to-a-right-wing-issue-and-where-it-will-go-next-90587|website=The conversation|accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with much different attitudes in the Global South, particular among the BRICS countries.

[[File:Beowulf - eorthan.jpg|thumb|left|An early mention of "eorðan" (earth) in ''[[Beowulf]]'']]

==Chronology==
{{Main|History of Earth}}

===Formation===
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of the early Solar System's planetary disk]]
The oldest material found in the [[Solar System]] is dated to {{val|4.5672|0.0006|ul=billion years ago}} (Bya).&lt;ref name=bowring_housch1995/&gt; By {{val|4.54|0.04|u=Bya}}&lt;ref name="age_earth1" /&gt; the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|the Solar System formed and evolved]] with the Sun. In theory, a [[solar nebula]] partitions a volume out of a [[molecular cloud]] by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a [[circumstellar disk]], and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and [[Cosmic dust|dust]] (including [[primordial nuclide]]s). According to [[nebular theory]], [[planetesimal]]s formed by [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], with the primordial Earth taking 10–{{val|20|ul=million years}} (Mys) to form.&lt;ref name=nature418_6901_949/&gt;

A subject of research is the formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya.&lt;ref name=science310_5754_1671/&gt; A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a [[Mars]]-sized object, named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], [[giant impact hypothesis|hit]] Earth.&lt;ref name=reilly20091022/&gt; In this view, the mass of Theia was approximately 10 percent of Earth,&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001a/&gt; it hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001b/&gt; Between approximately 4.1 and {{val|3.8|u=Bya}}, numerous [[Impact event|asteroid impacts]] during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.

===Geological history===
{{Main|Geological history of Earth}}
[[File:USA 10654 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Hoodoo (geology)|Hoodoos]] at the [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], [[Utah]]]]

Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and [[outgassing]]. Water vapor from these sources [[origin of the world's oceans|condensed]] into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, [[protoplanet]]s, and [[comet]]s.&lt;ref name="watersource"/&gt; In [[faint young Sun paradox|this model]], atmospheric "[[greenhouse gas]]es" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its [[solar luminosity|current luminosity]].&lt;ref name=asp2002/&gt; By {{val|3.5|u=Bya}}, [[Earth's magnetic field]] was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=physorg20100304/&gt;

A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled [[Phase transition|to form]] a solid. The two models&lt;ref name=williams_santosh2004/&gt; that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms&lt;ref name=science164_1229/&gt; or, more likely, a rapid growth&lt;ref name=tp322_19/&gt; early in Earth history&lt;ref name=rg6_175/&gt; followed by a long-term steady continental area.&lt;ref name=science310_5756_1947/&gt;&lt;ref name=jaes23_799/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajes38_613/&gt; Continents formed by [[plate tectonics]], a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over [[Geologic time scale|the period]] of hundreds of millions of years, the [[supercontinent]]s have assembled and broken apart. Roughly {{val|750|u=million years ago}} (Mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] {{val|600|–|540|u=Mya}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which also broke apart {{val|180|u=Mya}}.&lt;ref name=as92_324/&gt;

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{val|40|u=Mya}} and then intensified during the [[Pleistocene]] about {{val|3|u=Mya}}. High-[[latitude]] regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every {{val|40000|-|100000|u=years|fmt=commas}}. The last continental glaciation ended {{val|10000|u=years|fmt=commas}} ago.&lt;ref name=psc/&gt;

During the [[Neoproterozoic]], {{val|750|to|580|u=Mya}}, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the [[Cambrian explosion]], when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.&lt;ref name=kirschvink1992/&gt; Following the Cambrian explosion, {{val|535|u=Mya}}, there have been five [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]].&lt;ref name="sci215_4539_1501" /&gt; The [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|most recent such event]] was {{val|66|u=Mya}}, when [[Chicxulub impactor|an asteroid impact]] triggered the extinction of the non-[[bird|avian]] [[dinosaur]]s and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as [[mammal]]s, which at the time resembled [[shrew]]s. Mammalian life has diversified over the past {{val|66|u=Mys}}, and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="gould1994" /&gt; This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the [[Human evolution|evolution of humans]].

===Future===
{{Main|Future of Earth}}
{{See also|Global catastrophic risk}}
Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next {{val|1.1|u=Bys}}, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next {{val|3.5|u=Bys}} by 40%.&lt;ref name="sun_future"/&gt; The Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the [[inorganic]] [[carbon cycle]], reducing [[Carbon dioxide|{{chem2|CO2}}]] concentration to levels lethally low for plants ({{val|10|ul=ppm}} for [[C4 carbon fixation|C4 photosynthesis]]) in approximately {{val|500|–|900|u=Mys}}.&lt;ref name="britt2000" /&gt; The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; After another billion years all surface water will have disappeared&lt;ref name=carrington/&gt; and the mean global temperature will reach {{convert|70|C|F|0}}.&lt;ref name=ward_brownlee2002/&gt; From that point, the Earth is expected to be habitable for another {{val|500|u=Myr}},&lt;ref name="britt2000"/&gt; possibly up to {{val|2.3|u=Ga}} if nitrogen is removed from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=pnas1_24_9576/&gt; Even if the Sun were eternal and stable, 27% of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] in one billion years, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.&lt;ref name=hess5_4_569/&gt;

The Sun will [[stellar evolution|evolve]] to become a [[red giant]] in about {{val|5|u=Bys}}. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly {{convert|1|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=in|abbr=unit}}, about 250 times its present radius.&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder"/&gt; Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit {{convert|1.7|AU|e6km e6mi|lk=off|abbr=unit}} from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius. Most, if not all, remaining life will be destroyed by the Sun's increased luminosity (peaking at about 5,000 times its present level).&lt;ref name="sun_future" /&gt; A 2008 simulation indicates that Earth's orbit will eventually decay due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal effects]] and drag, causing it to enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.&lt;ref name="sun_future_schroder" /&gt;

In [[geodesy]], the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the [[geoid]]. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at [[mean sea level]].

[[Earth mass|Earth's mass]] is approximately {{val|5.97|e=24|ul=kg}} (5,970 [[yottagram|Yg]]). It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;

The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all [[oxide]]s: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.&lt;ref name=brown_mussett1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal structure===
{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their [[chemical]] or physical ([[Rheology|rheological]]) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct [[Silicate minerals|silicate]] solid crust, which is underlain by a highly [[viscous]] solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]]. The thickness of the crust varies from about {{convert|6|km|mi}} under the oceans to {{convert|30|-|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the [[upper mantle]] are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the [[asthenosphere]], a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at {{convert|410|and|660|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the surface, spanning a [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone]] that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid [[outer core]] lies above a solid [[inner core]].&lt;ref name=tanimoto_ahrens1995/&gt; The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher [[angular velocity]] than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year.&lt;ref name=science309_5739_1313/&gt; The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.

===Heat===
{{Main|Earth's internal heat budget}}
Earth's [[internal heat]] comes from a combination of residual heat from [[planetary accretion]] (about 20%) and heat produced through [[radioactive decay]] (80%).&lt;ref name="turcotte"/&gt; The major heat-producing [[isotope]]s within Earth are [[potassium-40]], [[uranium-238]], and [[thorium-232]].&lt;ref name=sanders20031210/&gt; At the center, the temperature may be up to {{convert|6000|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Earth's Centre is 1000 Degrees Hotter than Previously Thought |url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter |website=The European Synchrotron (ESRF) |accessdate=12 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKckNXMF?url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter/Earth-Centre-Hotter |archivedate=12 June 2013 |date=25 April 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pressure could reach {{convert|360|GPa|e6psi|abbr=unit|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=ptrsl360_1795_1227/&gt; Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately {{val|3|ul=Gyr}}, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of [[mantle convection]] and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as [[komatiite]]s that are rarely formed today.&lt;ref name="turcotte" /&gt;&lt;ref name=epsl121_1/&gt;

{{Main|Plate tectonics}}
Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: At [[Convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], two plates come together; at [[Divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], two plates are pulled apart; and at [[Transform boundary|transform boundaries]], two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, [[earthquake]]s, [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]], [[Orogeny|mountain-building]], and [[oceanic trench]] formation can occur.&lt;ref name=kious_tilling1999/&gt; The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.&lt;ref name=seligman2008/&gt;

[[File:Mount-Everest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orogeny|Mountains build up]] when tectonic plates move toward each other, forcing rock up. The highest [[mountain]] on Earth above sea level is [[Mount Everest]].]]

As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is [[Subduction|subducted]] under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the [[oceanic crust]] back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than {{val|100|u=Myr}} old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be {{val|200|u=Myr}} old.&lt;ref name=duennebier1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=noaa20070307/&gt; By comparison, the oldest dated [[continental crust]] is {{val|4030|u=Myr|fmt=commas}}.&lt;ref name=cmp134_3/&gt;

The seven major plates are the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], [[North American Plate|North American]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], [[African Plate|African]], [[Antarctic Plate|Antarctic]], [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian]], and [[South American Plate|South American]]. Other notable plates include the [[Arabian Plate]], the [[Caribbean Plate]], the [[Nazca Plate]] off the west coast of South America and the [[Scotia Plate]] in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between {{val|50|and|55|u=Mya}}. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the [[Cocos Plate]] advancing at a rate of {{convert|75|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=podp2000/&gt; and the Pacific Plate moving {{convert|52|–|69|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}. At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the Eurasian Plate, progressing at a typical rate of {{convert|21|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=gps_time_series/&gt;

The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks [[granite]] and [[andesite]]. Less common is [[basalt]], a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors.&lt;ref name=layers_earth/&gt; [[Sedimentary rock]] is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and [[Diagenesis|compacted together]]. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust.&lt;ref name=jessey/&gt; The third form of rock material found on Earth is [[metamorphic rock]], which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both.

The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the "Blue Planet" from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest underwater location is [[Challenger Deep]] of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of {{convert|10911.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref group="n" name="trench_depth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiko7000/&gt;

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of {{convert|361.8|e6km2|e6mi2|abbr=unit}} with a mean depth of {{convert|3682|m|ft|abbr=on}}, resulting in an estimated volume of {{convert|1.332|e9km3|e6cumi|abbr=unit}}.&lt;ref name=ocean23_2_112/&gt; If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be {{convert|2.7|to|2.8|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559627/sphere-depth-of-the-ocean |title=sphere depth of the ocean&amp;nbsp;– hydrology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_chapter.asp?id=4 |title=Third rock from the Sun&amp;nbsp;– restless Earth |work=NASA's Cosmos |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 97.5% of the water is [[saline water|saline]]; the remaining 2.5% is [[fresh water]].

Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.&lt;ref name="moran2005"/&gt;

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.&lt;ref name="berger2002"/&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2003/&gt;

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.&lt;ref name="moran2005" /&gt; Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.&lt;ref name=hydrologic_cycle/&gt;

The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change|1}} per degree of latitude from the equator.&lt;ref name=sadava_heller2006/&gt; Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[Tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.&lt;ref name=climate_zones/&gt;

This latitudinal rule has several anomalies:
* Proximity to oceans moderates the climate. For example, the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of [[northern Canada]].
* The [[wind]] enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13573-east-coast-colder-europe-west-coast.html |title=Why U.S. East Coast is colder than Europe's West Coast |publisher=Live Science |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.
* The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies. The Earth is closest to the Sun (at [[perihelion]]) in January, which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. It is furthest away (at [[aphelion]]) in July, which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion. Despite this, there are larger land masses in the Northern Hemisphere, which are easier to heat than the seas. Consequently, summers are {{convert|2.3|C-change|F-change|0}} warmer in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere under similar conditions.&lt;ref name="Earth at Aphelion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceweather.com/glossary/aphelion.html |title=Earth at Aphelion |publisher=Space Weather |date=July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density.

The commonly used [[Köppen climate classification]] system has five broad groups ([[tropical climate|humid tropics]], [[arid]], [[humid subtropical climate|humid middle latitudes]], [[Continental climate|continental]] and cold [[polar climate|polar]]), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.&lt;ref name="berger2002" /&gt; The Köppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.

The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was {{convert|56.7|C|F}} in [[Furnace Creek, California]], in [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]], in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-recorded-temperature/ |title=Highest recorded temperature |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest air temperature ever directly measured on Earth was {{convert|-89.2|C|F}} at [[Vostok Station]] in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lyons |first1=Walter A |title=The Handy Weather Answer Book |date=1997 |publisher=Visible Ink Press |location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=978-0-7876-1034-0 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as {{convert|-94.7|C|F}} in [[East Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/coldest-temperature-recorded-earth-antarctica-guinness-book |title=Coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth in Antarctica |journal=The Guardian |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; These temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on Earth.

====Upper atmosphere====
[[File:Full moon partially obscured by atmosphere.jpg|thumb|This view from orbit shows the [[full moon]] partially obscured by Earth's atmosphere.]]
Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], and [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref name="atmosphere" /&gt; Each layer has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the [[exosphere]] thins out into the [[magnetosphere]], where the geomagnetic fields interact with the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=sciweek2004/&gt; Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The [[Kármán line]], defined as 100&amp;nbsp;km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and [[outer space]].&lt;ref name=cordoba2004/&gt;

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|loss of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.&lt;ref name=jas31_4_1118/&gt; The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=sci293_5531_839/&gt; Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.&lt;ref name=abedon1997/&gt; In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name=arwps4_265/&gt;

===Gravitational field===
{{Main|Gravity of Earth}}
[[File:Geoids sm.jpg|thumb|Earth's gravity measured by NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] mission, showing deviations from the [[theoretical gravity]]. Red shows where gravity is stronger than the smooth, standard value, and blue shows where it is weaker.]]
The [[gravity of Earth]] is the [[acceleration]] that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the Earth. Near the Earth's surface, [[gravitational acceleration]] is approximately {{convert|9.8|m/s2|abbr=on}}. Local differences in [[topography]], [[geology]], and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in the Earth's gravitational field, known as [[Gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. B. |last1=Watts |first2=S.

===Magnetic field===
{{Main|Earth's magnetic field}}

The main part of [[Earth's magnetic field]] is generated in the core, the site of a [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a [[dipole]]. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is {{nowrap|3.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tesla (unit)|T]]}}, with global [[magnetic dipole moment]] of {{nowrap|7.91 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; T m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=lang2003/&gt; The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes [[Geomagnetic secular variation|secular variation]] of the main field and [[geomagnetic reversal|field reversals]] at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=campbelwh/&gt;

====Magnetosphere====
{{Main|Magnetosphere}}
[[File:Structure of the magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|Schematic of Earth's magnetosphere. The solar wind flows from left to right|alt=Diagram showing the magnetic field lines of Earth's magnetosphere. The lines are swept back in the anti-solar direction under the influence of the solar wind.]]

The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the [[magnetosphere]]. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=40994 |title=Cluster reveals the reformation of the Earth's bow shock |publisher=European Space Agency |first=Arnaud |last=Masson |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charged particle]]s are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/ |title=The Earth's Plasmasphere |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/formed.html |title=How the Plasmasphere is Formed |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field,&lt;ref name="BaumjohannTreumann1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Space Plasma Physics |publisher=World Scientific |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Baumjohann |first2=Rudolf A. |last2=Treumann |pages=8, 31 |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-86094-079-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/ionosphere-and-magnetosphere/Magnetosphere |title=Ionosphere and magnetosphere |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |first=Michael B. |last=McElroy |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Allen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of Magnetospheric Physics |publisher=University of Iowa Press |last=Van Allen |first=James Alfred |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-87745-921-7 |oclc=646887856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[magnetic storm]]s and [[substorm]]s, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]].&lt;ref name=stern2005/&gt;

==Orbit and rotation==

===Rotation===
{{Main|Earth's rotation}}
[[File:EpicEarth-Globespin(2016May29).gif|thumb|right|Earth's rotation imaged by [[Deep Space Climate Observatory|DSCOVR EPIC]] on 29 May 2016, a few weeks before the [[solstice]].]]
Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is {{nowrap|86,400 seconds}} of mean solar time ({{nowrap|86,400.0025 [[SI]] seconds}}).&lt;ref name=aj136_5_1906/&gt; Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to [[tidal acceleration|tidal deceleration]], each day varies between {{nowrap|0 and 2 SI [[millisecond|ms]]}} longer&lt;!--than the previous day or the 19th-C day?  This construction is ambiguous--&gt;.&lt;ref name=USNO_TSD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rapid Service/Prediction of Earth Orientation |journal=IERS Bulletin-A |date=9 April 2015 |volume=28 |issue=15 |url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/ser7/ser7.dat |accessdate=12 April 2015 |format=.DAT file (displays as plaintext in browser)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's rotation period relative to the [[fixed star]]s, called its ''stellar day'' by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), is {{nowrap|86,164.0989 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1), or {{nowrap |23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0989{{smallsup|s}}.}}&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="Aoki"/&gt; Earth's rotation period relative to the [[precession (astronomy)|precessing]] or moving mean [[vernal equinox]], misnamed its ''[[sidereal day]]'', is {{nowrap|86,164.0905 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0905{{smallsup|s}})}}.&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name=seidelmann1992/&gt; The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623–2005&lt;ref name=iers1623/&gt; and 1962–2005.&lt;ref name=iers1962/&gt;

Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the [[celestial equator]], this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.&lt;ref name=zeilik1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=angular/&gt;

===Orbit===
{{Main|Earth's orbit}}
[[File:Pale Blue Dot.png|thumb|upright|The ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]'' photo taken in 1990 by the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft showing Earth (center right) from nearly {{convert|4|e9mi|e9km|order=flip|abbr=unit}} away]]

Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about {{convert|150|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}} every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one [[sidereal year]]. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12&amp;nbsp;hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24&amp;nbsp;hours—a [[Solar time|solar day]]—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The orbital speed of Earth averages about {{convert|29.78|km/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}, which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about {{convert|12742|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, {{convert|384000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in about 3.5 hours.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The Moon and Earth orbit a common [[barycenter]] every 27.32&amp;nbsp;days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the [[synodic month]], from new moon to new moon, is 29.53&amp;nbsp;days. Viewed from the [[celestial pole|celestial north pole]], the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all [[counterclockwise]]. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] some 23.44&amp;nbsp;degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the [[ecliptic]]), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1&amp;nbsp;degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between [[lunar eclipse]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moon_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The [[Hill sphere]], or the sphere of [[Gravity|gravitational]] influence, of the Earth is about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|abbr=unit}} in radius.&lt;ref name=vazquez_etal2006 /&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="hill_radius" /&gt; This is the maximum distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit the Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the [[Milky Way]] and orbits about 28,000&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s from its center. It is about 20&amp;nbsp;light-years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm]].&lt;ref name=nasa20051201 /&gt;

===Axial tilt and seasons===
{{Main|Axial tilt#Earth}}
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|left|Earth's axial tilt (or [[obliquity]]) and its relation to the [[Rotation|rotation axis]] and [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of orbit]]]]
The axial tilt of the Earth is approximately 23.439281°&lt;ref name="IERS"/&gt; with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [[Celestial Poles]]. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and [[winter]] taking place when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.

Above the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.

By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the [[solstice]]s—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the [[equinox]]es, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, [[spring equinox]] is around 20 March and [[autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.&lt;ref name=bromberg2008/&gt;

The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=lin2006/&gt; The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&amp;nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.&lt;ref name=fisher19960205/&gt;

In modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%&lt;ref group="n" name="solar_energy"/&gt; in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=williams20051230/&gt;

A study from 2016 suggested that [[Planet Nine]] tilted all [[Solar System]] planets, including Earth's, by about six degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/34448-planet-nine-solar-system-tilt.html |title=Did the Mysterious 'Planet Nine' Tilt the Solar System? |work=Space.com |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitability==
[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|The [[Rocky Mountains]] in Canada overlook [[Moraine Lake]].]]
A planet that can sustain life is termed [[Planetary habitability|habitable]], even if life did not originate there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=ab2003/&gt; The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.&lt;ref name=dole1970/&gt;

===Biosphere===
{{Main|Biosphere}}
A planet's life forms inhabit [[ecosystem]]s, whose total is sometimes said to form a "biosphere". Earth's biosphere is thought to have begun [[evolution|evolving]] about {{val|3.5|u=Gya}}.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; The biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, [[elevation|height above sea level]] and [[humidity]]. Terrestrial [[tundra|biomes]] lying within the Arctic or [[Antarctic Circle]]s, at [[Alpine tundra|high altitudes]] or in [[desert|extremely arid areas]] are relatively barren of plant and animal life; [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|species diversity]] reaches a peak in [[tropical rainforest|humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes]].&lt;ref name=amnat163_2_192/&gt;

Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed [[non-renewable resource]]s, such as [[fossil fuel]]s, only renew over geological timescales.

Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]]. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral [[ore]] bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of [[ore genesis]], resulting from actions of [[magmatism]], erosion, and plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="Ramdohr"/&gt; These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful [[chemical element|elements]].

Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, [[wood]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. The land-based [[ecosystem]] depends upon [[topsoil]] and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.&lt;ref name=science299_5607_673/&gt; In 1980, {{convert|5053|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, {{convert|6788|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was grasslands and pasture, and {{convert|1501|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was cultivated as croplands.&lt;ref name="Turner1990"/&gt; The estimated amount of [[irrigated land]] in 1993 was {{convert|2481250|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Humans also live on the land by using [[building material]]s to construct shelters.

===Natural and environmental hazards===
[[File:Pavlof2014iss.jpg|thumb|left|A volcano injecting hot ash into the atmosphere]]
Large areas of Earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical [[cyclone]]s, [[hurricane]]s, or [[typhoon]]s that dominate life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.&lt;ref name=walsh2008/&gt; Many places are subject to earthquakes, [[landslide]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]], [[tornado]]es, [[sinkhole]]s, [[blizzard]]s, floods, droughts, [[wildfire]]s, and other calamities and disasters.

Many localized areas are subject to human-made [[pollution]] of the air and water, [[acid rain]] and toxic substances, loss of vegetation ([[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], [[desertification]]), loss of wildlife, species [[extinction]], [[soil degradation]], [[soil depletion]] and [[erosion]].

There is a [[scientific consensus]] linking human activities to [[global warming]] due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a [[Sea level rise|global rise in average sea levels]].&lt;ref name=un20070202/&gt;

[[Cartography]], the study and practice of map-making, and [[geography]], the study of the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth. [[Surveying]], the determination of locations and distances, and to a lesser extent [[navigation]], the determination of position and direction, have developed alongside cartography and geography, providing and suitably quantifying the requisite information.

{{Main|Moon}}

The Moon is a relatively large, [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], planet-like [[natural satellite]], with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as "moons", after Earth's.

The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].
[[File:Earth-Moon.svg|thumb|left|Details of the Earth–Moon system, showing the radius of each object and the Earth–Moon [[barycenter]]. The Moon's axis is located by [[Cassini's laws|Cassini's third law]].]]

Due to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately {{convert|38|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23&amp;nbsp;[[Microsecond|µs]]/yr—add up to significant changes.&lt;ref name=espenak_meeus20070207/&gt; During the [[Devonian]] period, for example, (approximately {{val|410|u=Mya}}) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambeck |first=Kurt |title=The Earth's Variable Rotation: Geophysical Causes and Consequences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kiG3uYkoUEC&amp;pg=PA62 |isbn=978-0-521-67330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. [[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.&lt;ref name=aaa428_261/&gt; Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.&lt;ref name=nature410_6830_773/&gt;

Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.&lt;ref name=angular /&gt; This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.

The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=nature412_708/&gt;

==Asteroids and artificial satellites==
[[File:Tracy Caldwell Dyson in Cupola ISS.jpg|thumb|[[Tracy Caldwell Dyson]] viewing Earth from the [[ISS]] Cupola, 2010]]
Earth has at least five [[Quasi-satellite|co-orbital asteroids]], including [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}.&lt;ref name=whitehouse20021021/&gt;&lt;ref name=christou_asher2011/&gt; A [[Earth trojan|trojan asteroid]] companion, {{mpl|2010 TK|7}}, is librating around the leading [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange triangular point]], L4, in the [[Earth's orbit]] around the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name=Connors/&gt;&lt;ref name=Choi/&gt;

The tiny [[near-Earth asteroid]] {{mpl|2006 RH|120}} makes close approaches to the Earth–Moon system roughly every twenty years. During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=2006 RH120 ( = 6R10DB9) (A second moon for the Earth?) |url=http://www.birtwhistle.org/Gallery6R10DB9.htm |website=Great Shefford Observatory |publisher=Great Shefford Observatory |accessdate=17 July 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206154817/http://www.birtwhistle.org/Gallery6R10DB9.htm |archivedate=6 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2018|4}}, there are 1,886 operational, human-made [[satellite]]s orbiting Earth.&lt;ref name=ucs/&gt; There are also inoperative satellites, including [[Vanguard 1]], the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked [[space debris]].&lt;ref group="n" name="space_debris"/&gt; Earth's largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station.

Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet.

{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
'''Eastern Bloc media and propaganda''' was controlled directly by each country's [[Communist party]], which controlled the [[state media]], [[censorship]] and [[propaganda]] organs. State and party ownership of print, television and radio media served as an important manner in which to control information and society in light of [[Eastern Bloc]] leaderships viewing even marginal groups of  [[soviet dissident|opposition intellectuals]] as a potential threat to the bases underlying Communist power therein.

Circumvention of dissemination controls occurred to some degree through [[samizdat]] and limited reception of western radio and television broadcasts. In addition, some regimes heavily restricted the flow of information from their countries to outside of the Eastern Bloc by heavily regulating the travel of foreigners and segregating approved travellers from the domestic population.

==Background==

===Creation===
[[File:EasternBlocAfter.svg|right|thumb|300px|Map of the [[Eastern Bloc]] (until 31 December 1992)]]
[[Bolsheviks]] took power following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. During the [[Russian Civil War]] that followed, coinciding with the [[Red Army]]'s entry into [[Minsk]] in 1919, Belarus was declared the [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia]]. After more conflict, the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] was declared in 1920. With the defeat of the [[Ukraine]] in the [[Polish–Ukrainian War]], after the March 1921 [[Peace of Riga]] following the [[Polish–Soviet War]], central and eastern Ukraine were annexed into the Soviet Union as the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1922, the [[Russian SFSR]], [[Ukraine SSR]], Byelorussian SSR and [[Transcaucasian SFSR]] were [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|officially merged]] as republics creating the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ([[Soviet Union]]).

At the end of [[World War II]], all eastern and central European capitals were controlled by the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="wettig69"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final stages of the war, the Soviet Union began the creation of the [[Eastern Bloc]] by occupying several countries as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] that were originally effectively ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. These included eastern [[Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|two different SSRs]]),&lt;ref name="stalinswars43"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latvia]] (became [[Latvia SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="senn"&gt;Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940: Revolution from Above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-420-2225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estonia]] (became [[Estonian SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt; [[Lithuania]] (became [[Lithuania SSR]]),&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt; part of eastern [[Finland]] (became [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]])&lt;ref name="ckpipe"&gt;Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York: Manchester University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7190-4201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and northeastern [[Romania]] (became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).&lt;ref name="stalinswars55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shirer794"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1945, these additional annexed countries totaled approximately 180,000 further square miles (465,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), or slightly more than the area of West Germany, East Germany and Austria combined.&lt;ref name="graubard150"&gt;{{Harvnb|Graubard|1991|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations were converted into [[Satellite state|Soviet Satellite]] states, such as the [[People's Republic of Poland]], the [[People's Republic of Hungary]],&lt;ref name="granville"&gt;Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58544-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp=370–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of Romania]], the [[People's Republic of Albania]],&lt;ref name="cook17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[East Germany]] from the Soviet zone of German occupation.&lt;ref name="wettig96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] was also wrongfully considered part of the Bloc,&lt;ref name="crampton216"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=216–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eastern bloc'', ''The American Heritage New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy'', Third Edition. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; though a [[Tito–Stalin Split]] occurred in 1948&lt;ref name="wettig156"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the formation of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

===Conditions===

{{further|Eastern Bloc|Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Eastern Bloc politics|Eastern Bloc economies}}
Throughout the Eastern Bloc, both in the Soviet Socialist Republic and elsewhere, Russia was given prominence, and referred to as the ''naibolee vıdayuşayasya naciya'' (the most prominent nation) and the ''rukovodyaşy narod'' (the leading people).&lt;ref name="graubard150"/&gt; The Soviets encouraged the admiration of everything Russian and the reproduction of their own Communist structural hierarchies in each of the Bloc states.&lt;ref name="graubard150"/&gt;

The defining characteristic of Communism as implemented in the Eastern Bloc was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable spheres.&lt;ref name="hardt11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, Stalin directed systems that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], multi-party governance (dubbed "[[bourgeois democracy]]" in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.&lt;ref name="hardt12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviets mandated expropriation and ''etatization'' of private property.&lt;ref name="roht83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roht-Arriaza|1995|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet-style "replica regimes" that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced Soviet [[command economy|command economies]], but also adopted the methods employed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and Soviet secret police to suppress real and potential opposition.&lt;ref name="roht83"/&gt; Communist regimes in the Eastern Bloc saw even marginal groups of opposition intellectuals as a potential threat because of the basis underlying Communist power.&lt;ref name="Pollackxiv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pollack|Wielgohs|2004|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The suppression of dissidence and opposition was a central prerequisite for the security of Communist power within the Eastern Bloc, though the degree of opposition and dissident suppression varied by country and period.&lt;ref name="Pollackxiv"/&gt;

While over 15 million Eastern Bloc residents migrated westward from 1945 to 1949,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Böcker|1998|pp=207–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; emigration was effectively halted in the early 1950s, with the Soviet approach to controlling national movement emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc.&lt;ref name="dowty114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dowty|1989|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Eastern Bloc experienced economic mis-development by central planners resulting in those countries following a path of extensive rather than intensive development, and thus lagging far behind their western European counterparts in per capita Gross Domestic Product.&lt;ref name="hardt15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|pp=15–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media and information control===
{{further|Deutscher Fernsehfunk|Rundfunk der DDR|Mass media in Communist Czechoslovakia|Soviet Information Bureau}}
In the [[Eastern Bloc]], the state owned and operated the means of mass communication.&lt;ref name="frucht489"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=489}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ruling authorities viewed media as a propaganda tool, and widely practiced censorship to exercise almost full control over the information dissemination.&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt;  The press in Communist countries was an organ of, and completely reliant on, the state.&lt;ref name="oneil15"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the late 1980s, all Eastern Bloc radio and television organizations were state-owned (and tightly controlled), while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local Communist party.&lt;ref name="oneil25"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth newspapers and magazines were owned by youth organizations affiliated with the communist party.&lt;ref name="oneil25"/&gt;  The governing body in the Soviet Union was "USSR State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting", or USSR Gosteleradio (Государственный комитет по телевидению и радиовещанию СССР, Гостелерадио СССР), which was in charge both of [[Soviet TV]] and [[Radio in the Soviet Union]].

The Communist party exercised control over the media and was responsible for censorship.&lt;ref name="oneil25"/&gt; Media served as an important form of control over information and thus of society.&lt;ref name="oneil1"&gt;{{Harvnb|O'Neil|1997|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eastern Bloc authorities viewed the dissemination and portrayal of knowledge as vital to the survival of Communism and thus stifled alternative concepts and critiques.&lt;ref name="oneil1"/&gt;  Several state Communist Party newspapers were published. Radio was initially the dominant medium, with television being considered low on the priority list when compiling [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-year plans]] during the [[industrialisation]] of the 1950s.

===Censorship and squashing of dissent===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Voroshilov, Molotov, Stalin, with Nikolai Yezhov.jpg|image2=The Commissar Vanishes 2.jpg|width=180|caption2=[[Nikolai Yezhov]], the young man strolling with [[Joseph Stalin]] to his right, was shot in 1940.

{{further|Censorship in East Germany|Censorship in the People's Republic of Poland|Censorship in the Soviet Union|   Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|Anti-Soviet agitation}}
Strict censorship existed in the Eastern Bloc, though it was at times circumvented by those engaging in [[samizdat]].&lt;ref name="major6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Censorship institutions in the countries of the Bloc were organized differently.&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt; For example, censorship in [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] was clearly identified whereas it was loosely structured, but no less efficient, in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]].&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt; Strict censorship was introduced in the [[People's Republic of Albania]] and [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] as early as 1944, though it was somewhat relaxed in Yugoslavia after the [[Tito-Stalin split]] of 1948.&lt;ref name="frucht127"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the rest of the Eastern Bloc, relative freedom existed for three years in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] until Soviet-style censorship was fully applied in 1948,&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; along with the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]].

Throughout the Bloc, the various ministries of culture held a tight rein on writers.&lt;ref name="major15"&gt;{{Harvnb|Major|Mitter|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural products reflected the propaganda needs of the state&lt;ref name="major15"/&gt; and Party-approved censors exercised strict control in the early years.&lt;ref name="crampton247"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Stalinist period, even the weather forecasts were changed if they would have otherwise suggested that the sun might not shine on [[May Day]].&lt;ref name="crampton247"/&gt;  Under [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] in [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], weather reports were doctored so that the temperatures were not seen to rise above or fall below the levels which dictated that work must stop.&lt;ref name="crampton247"/&gt;

In each country, leading bodies of the ruling Communist Part exercised hierarchical control of the censorship system.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; Each Communist Party maintained a department of its [[Central Committee]] apparatus to supervise media.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;  Censors employed auxiliary tools such as: the power to launch or close down any newspaper, radio or television station, licensing of journalists through unions and the power of appointment.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; Party bureaucrats held all leading editorial positions.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;  One or two representatives of censorship agencies modeled on the Soviet GLAVLIT (Main Administration for the Protection of Official and Military Secrets) worked directly in all editorial offices.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;  No story could be printed or broadcast without their explicit approval.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt;

Initially, [[East Germany]] presented unique issues because of rules for the occupying powers in the divided Germany (e.g. regarding media control) that prevented the outright seizure of all media outlets.&lt;ref name="pike219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviet occupation administration (SVAG) directed propaganda and censorship policies to East German censorship organs through its "sector for propaganda and censorship".&lt;ref name="pike217"/&gt; While the initial SVAG policies did not appear to differ greatly from those in the western occupation zones governing [[denazification]],&lt;ref name="pike220"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=220–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; censorship became one of the most overt instruments used to manipulate political, intellectual and cultural developments in East Germany.&lt;ref name="pike217"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=217–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art societies and associations that had existed prior to World War II were dissolved and all new theatres and art societies had to register with SVAG.&lt;ref name="pike221"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Art exhibits were put under a blanket ban unless censorship organs approved them in advance.&lt;ref name="pike221"/&gt;

After East Germany's official establishment, while the original constitution&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.documentarchiv.de/ddr/verfddr1949.html October 7, 1949 Constitution of East Germany], German Document Archive {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided that "censorship of the media is not to occur", both official and unofficial censorship occurred, although to a lesser extent during its later years. Thereafter, official East German censorship was supervised and carried out by two governmental organizations, the ''Head office for publishing companies and bookselling trade'' (Hauptverwaltung Verlage und Buchhandel, HV), and the ''Bureau for Copyright'' (Büro für Urheberrechte). The HV determined the degree of censorship and the method of publishing and marketing works. The Bureau for Copyright appraised the work, then decided if it or another publication was permitted to be published in East Germany or in foreign country. For theatres, a "repertory commission" was created that consisted of the ''Ministerium für Volksbildung'' (MfV), the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] party, the applicable theatre union and the East German office for theatrical affairs.&lt;ref name="pike236"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|p=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a long visa procurement process, western visitors driving over the West German border to East Germany had their car strip-searched for prohibited Western "propaganda material."&lt;ref name="philipsen9"&gt;{{Harvnb|Philipsen|1993|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the East German authorities found it extremely difficult to prevent their citizens listening to Western radio stations and [[ARD (broadcaster)|Western TV]] was available across most of the GDR. Technical and diplomatic considerations meant attempts at [[Radio jamming|jamming]] Western Stations were (unlike in other Eastern bloc countries) soon abandoned.

In the Soviet Union, in accordance with the official ideology and politics of the [[CPSU|Communist Party]], [[Goskomizdat]] censored all printed matter, [[Goskino]] supervised all [[film|cinema]], [[Gosteleradio]] controlled radio and television broadcasting and the [[First Department]] in many agencies and institutions, such as the State Statistical Committee ([[Goskomstat]]), was responsible for assuring that state secrets and other sensitive information only reached authorized hands. The Soviets destroyed pre-revolutionary and foreign material from libraries, leaving only "special collections" (''[[spetskhran]]''), accessible by special permit from the [[KGB]]. The [[Censorship of images in the Soviet Union|Soviet Union also censored images]], included removing repressed persons from texts, posters, paintings and photographs.

==== Prominent individuals ====
Throughout the Eastern Bloc, artists or those attempting to disseminate dissenting views were repressed, with a few of the more prominent victims including:

Other artists, such as [[Geo Bogza]], used subtle imagery or allegories within their works to criticize regimes. This did not prevent state scrutiny, as with the case of Bogza coming under the scrutiny of the [[Securitate]].&lt;ref&gt;Chiorean, Claudia Talaşman, "Promovarea mitului Erei Noi în perioada 1989–2000 prin ''România Literară''", p.138-139&lt;/ref&gt;

The major newspapers were traditionally the daily official publications of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="frucht489"/&gt; Newspapers served as the main party organs of record and provided official political roadmaps for officials and other readers who needed to be informed.&lt;ref name="frucht639"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=639}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, the press provided a significant source of income for the ruling Communist parties.&lt;ref name="frucht639"/&gt; Radio and television was controlled by the state.&lt;ref name="frucht490"/&gt;  The [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union]] (TASS) was the central agency for collection and distribution of internal and international news for all Soviet newspapers, radio and television stations. TASS monopolized the supply of political news.&lt;ref name="frucht127"/&gt; It was frequently infiltrated by Soviet intelligence and security agencies, such as the [[NKVD]] and [[GRU]]. TASS had affiliates in 14 Soviet republics, including the [[Lithuanian SSR]], [[Latvian SSR]], [[Estonian SSR]], [[Moldavian SSR]]. [[Ukrainian SSR]] and [[Byelorussian SSR]].

Despite outward similarities in press policy, large differences existed in the roles and functions of the mass media in Eastern Bloc countries.&lt;ref name="frucht640"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=640}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the press was allowed more freedom, such as in Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia, a national subtext and a significant element of entertainment flourished.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt; In some cases, newspapers and magazines served as the most visible part of liberalizing forces, such as in Poland in 1956 and 1980–81, in Hungary in 1956, and in Czechoslovakia in 1968.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;

In many instances toward the end of the Eastern Bloc's existence, the ruling Communist parties' messages in the press increasingly diverged from reality, which contributed to the declining faith of the public in Communist rule.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;  At the same time, some press in the Eastern Bloc became more open in the 1980s in countries such as Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;  In Yugoslavia, the press after Tito's reign turned increasingly nationalistic.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt; Only in Romania and Albania did the press remain under tight dictatorial control right up until the end of the Eastern Bloc.&lt;ref name="frucht640"/&gt;

In [[East Germany]], where initial control could be less overt because of shared allied occupation rules, the Soviet SVG set up the Deutsche Verwaltung für Volksbildung (DVV) in the fall of 1945.&lt;ref name="pike217"/&gt; The SVAG and DVV controlled and approved all publication licenses needed to publish newspapers, books, journals and other materials.&lt;ref name="pike225"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=225–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those agencies also provided the top publishing priorities and would apportion paper used for printing to the various publications in accordance with those priorities.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt; The SVAG initially licensed some private publishers which required the employment of a greater number of censors.&lt;ref name="pike227"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pike|1997|pp=227–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Control of information flow out of the Eastern Bloc==
Beginning in 1935, [[Joseph Stalin]] effectively sealed off outside access to the [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] (and until his death), effectively permitting no foreign travel inside the Soviet Union such that outsiders did not know of the political processes that had taken place therein.&lt;ref name="laqueur22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, and even for 25 years after Stalin's death, the few diplomats and foreign correspondents that were permitted inside the Soviet Union were usually restricted to within a few miles of Moscow, their phones were tapped, their residences were restricted to foreigner-only locations and they were constantly followed by Soviet authorities.&lt;ref name="laqueur22"/&gt;  Dissenters who approached such foreigners were arrested.&lt;ref name="laqueur23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laqueur|1994|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years after World War II, even the best informed foreigners did not know the number of arrest or executed Soviet citizens, or how poorly the Soviet economy had performed.&lt;ref name="laqueur23"/&gt;

Similarly, the regimes in [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]] carefully controlled foreign visitors in order to restrict the flow of information coming out of (and into) Romania.&lt;ref name="deletantix"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deletant|1995|p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, activities in Romania remained, until the late 1960s, largely unknown to the outside world.&lt;ref name="deletantix"/&gt; As a result, until 1990, very little information regarding labour camps and prisons in Romania appeared in the West.&lt;ref name="deletantix"/&gt; When such information appeared, it was usually in Romanian émigré publications.&lt;ref name="deletantix"/&gt; Romania's [[Securitate]] secret police were able to suppress information leaking to the west about resistance to the regime.&lt;ref name="deletantxiv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Deletant|1995|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stalinist [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], which had become increasingly paranoid and isolated after [[de-Stalinization]] and the death of [[Mao Zedong]],&lt;ref name="olsen19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Olsen|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; restricted visitors to 6,000 per year, and segregated those few that traveled to Albania.&lt;ref name="turnock48"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turnock|1997|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propaganda efforts==
{{further|Communist propaganda|Propaganda in the People's Republic of Poland|Propaganda in the Soviet Union}}
Communist leaders in the Eastern Bloc openly discussed the existence of propaganda efforts. Communist propaganda goals and techniques were tuned according to the target audience. The most broad classification of targets was:&lt;ref name=clews&gt;John C. Clews (1964) ''Communist Propaganda techniques'', printed in the USA by ''[[Frederick A. Praeger|Praeger]]'' and in Great Britain&lt;/ref&gt;
*Domestic propaganda
*External propaganda
*Propaganda of Communist supporters outside the Communist states

Communist Party documents reveal a more detailed classification of specific targets (workers, peasants, youth, women, etc.).&lt;ref name=clews/&gt;

Because the Communist Party was portrayed under [[Marxist-Leninist]] theory as the protagonist of history pushing toward the inevitable end result of historical materialism as a "vanguard of the working class", Party leaders were claimed to be as infallible and inevitable as the purported historical end itself.&lt;ref name="Satter1"&gt;[[David Satter]]. ''Age of Delirium: The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Union'', [[Yale University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-300-08705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Propaganda often worked itself beyond [[agit prop]] plays into traditional productions, such as in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] after the [[Tito-Stalin split]], where the director of the National Theatre produced a version of ''Macbeth'' in which the villainous king was revealed as none other than hated (in the Eastern Bloc) Yugoslavian Leader [[Josip Broz Tito]].&lt;ref name="crampton269"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding economic woes, debilitating wage cuts following economic stagnation were referred to as "blows in the face of imperialism", while forced loans were called "voluntary contributions to the building of socialism".&lt;ref name="crampton273"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist theoretician [[Nikolai Bukharin]] in his ''[[The ABC of Communism]]'' wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[[Nikolai Bukharin]], [[Yevgeny Preobrazhensky]] ''The ABC of Communism'' (1969 translation: {{ISBN|0-14-040005-2}}), [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bukharin/works/1920/abc/10.htm Chapter 10: Communism and Education]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The State propaganda of communism becomes in the long run a means for the eradication of the last traces of bourgeois propaganda dating from the old régime; and it is a powerful instrument for the creation of a new ideology, of new modes of thought, of a new outlook on the world.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:West german tv penetration.svg|thumb|200px|right|Penetration of West German TV reception (grey) in East Germany for [[Das Erste|ARD]] (regional channels  [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]], [[Hessischer Rundfunk|HR]], [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]] and [[Sender Freies Berlin|SFB]]) . Areas with no reception (black) were jokingly referred to as "Valley of the Clueless" ''(Tal der Ahnungslosen)'' while ARD was said to stand for "Außer (except) Rügen und Dresden" .]]
Some propaganda would "retell" the western news, such as the [[East German]] television program [[Der schwarze Kanal]] ("The Black Channel"), which contained [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerized]] programs from [[Federal Republic of Germany|West Germany]] with added [[Communist]] commentary.&lt;ref name="Hancock"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.transdiffusion.org/intertel/countries/gdr.php | archive-url = https://archive.is/20130416082604/http://www.transdiffusion.org/intertel/countries/gdr.php | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2013-04-16 | title = Fade to black | accessdate = 2006-02-20 | last = Hancock | first = Dafydd | date = 2001-01-01 | publisher = Intertel from Transdiffusion }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Black channel" was a play on words deriving from the term German plumbers used for a sewer. The program was meant to counter ideas received by some from West German television because the geography of the divided [[Germany]] meant that West German television signals (particularly [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]) could be received in most of East Germany, except in parts of Eastern [[Saxony]] around Dresden, which consequently earned the latter the nickname "valley of the clueless"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iht.com/articles/1994/11/09/east.php | title = East Germany Struggles, 5 Years After Wall Fell | accessdate = 2007-05-12 | last = Mitchener | first = Brandon | date = 1994-11-09 | publisher = International Herald Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; (despite the fact that some Western radio was still available there).

Eastern Bloc leaders, including even [[Joseph Stalin]], could become personally involved in dissemination. For example, in January 1948, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] published a collection of documents titled ''Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939–1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'', which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name="henig67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="roberts97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement]],&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=32–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[German–Soviet Axis talks|discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchill|1953|pp=512–524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, one month later, the [[Soviet Information Bureau]] published ''[[Falsifiers of History]]''.&lt;ref name="henig67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Henig|2005|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts96"/&gt; Stalin personally edited the book, rewriting entire chapters by hand.&lt;ref name="roberts96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book claimed, for instance, that American bankers and industrialists provided capital for the growth of German war industries, while deliberately encouraging Hitler to expand eastward.&lt;ref name="henig67"/&gt;&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;  The book also included the claim that, during the Pact's operation, Stalin rejected Hitler's offer to share in a division of the world, without mentioning [[German–Soviet Axis talks|the Soviet offers to join the Axis]].&lt;ref name="nekrich202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Nekrich|Ulam|Freeze|1997|pp=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historical studies, official accounts, memoirs and textbooks published in the Soviet Union used that depiction of events [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|until the Soviet Union's dissolution]].&lt;ref name="nekrich202"/&gt;

The book referred to "the American falsifiers and their British and French associates",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed "[a]s far back as in 1937 it became perfectly clear that a big war was being hatched by Hitler with the direct connivance of Great Britain and France",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; blasted "the claptrap of the slanderers"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated "[n]aturally, the falsifiers of history and slanderers are called falsifiers and slanderers precisely because they do not entertain any respect for facts. They prefer to gossip and slander."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Soviet Information Bureau|1948|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[East Germany]], the Soviet SVAG and DVV initially controlled all publication priorities.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt; In the initial months of 1946, the Soviets were unsure how to merge propaganda and censorship efforts in East Germany.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt;  The SVAG engaged in a broad propaganda campaign that moved beyond customary political propaganda to engage in the practice at unions, women's organizations and youth organizations.&lt;ref name="pike225"/&gt;

==Bypassing censorship==

===Clandestine information passing===
{{main|Samizdat|Magnitizdat|Polish underground press}}
[[Samizdat]] was the clandestine copying and distribution of government-suppressed literature or other media in [[Eastern bloc]] countries. Copies were often made in small quantities of handwritten or typed documents, while recipients were expected to make additional copies. Samizdat traders used underground literature for self-analysis and self-expression under the heavy censorship of the Eastern Bloc.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} ''[http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/books/ALEXEEWA/Chapter16a.htm#_VPID_36 History of Dissident Movement in the USSR. The birth of Samizdat]'' by [[Ludmila Alekseyeva]]. Vilnius, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was fraught with danger as harsh punishments were meted out to people caught possessing or copying [[censorship|censored]] materials.   Former Soviet dissident [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] defined it as follows: "I myself create it, edit it, censor it, publish it, distribute it, and [may] get imprisoned for it."&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} "Самиздат: сам сочиняю, сам редактирую, сам цензурирую, сам издаю, сам распространяю, сам и отсиживаю за него." (autobiographical novel ''И возвращается ветер...'', ''And the Wind returns...'' NY, Хроника, 1978, p.126) Also online at [http://www.vehi.net/samizdat/bukovsky.html]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the longest-running and well-known samizdat publications was the information bulletin "Хроника текущих событий" (Khronika Tekushchikh Sobitiy; ''[[Chronicle of Current Events]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.memo.ru/history/diss/chr/index.htm Chronicle of Current Events] Archive at memo.ru&lt;/ref&gt; which contained anonymously published pieces dedicated to the defense of [[human rights]] in the USSR. Several people were arrested in connection with the ''Chronicle'', including [[Natalya Gorbanevskaya]], [[Yuri Shikhanovich]], [[Pyotr Yakir]], [[Victor Krasin]], [[Sergei Kovalev]], [[Alexander Lavut]], [[Tatyana Velikanova]], among others.

[[Magnitizdat]] (in Russian магнитиздат) is the process of re-copying and self distributing live audio tape recordings in the Soviet Union that were not available commercially. The process of magnitizdat was less risky than publishing literature via samizdat, since any person in the USSR was permitted to own a private reel-to-reel tape recorder, while paper duplication equipment was under control of the state.  "Tamizdat" refers to literature published abroad (там, tam, meaning "there"), often from smuggled manuscripts.

===Western role in propaganda war===
{{further|British Broadcasting Corporation|Voice of America|Radio Free Europe}}
Western countries invested heavily in powerful transmitters which enabled broadcasters to be heard in the Eastern Bloc, despite attempts by authorities to [[Radio jamming|jam]] such signals. In 1947, VOA started broadcasting in [[Russian language|Russian]] with the intent to counter Soviet propaganda directed against American leaders and policies, and disseminate pro western propaganda directed against Soviet leaders and policies.&lt;ref name='whitton'&gt;''Cold War Propaganda'' by John B. Whitton, [[The American Journal of International Law]], Vol. 45, No. 1 (Jan., 1951), pp. 151–153&lt;/ref&gt;  These included [[Radio Free Europe]] (RFE)), [[Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor|RIAS (Berlin)]] the [[Voice of America]]  (VOA), [[Deutsche Welle]], [[Radio France International]] and the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC).&lt;ref name="frucht490"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frucht|2003|p=490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviet Union responded by attempting aggressive, electronic [[Radio jamming|jamming]]  of VOA (and some other Western) broadcasts in 1949.&lt;ref name='whitton'/&gt;  The [[BBC World Service]] similarly broadcast language-specific programming to countries behind the [[Iron Curtain]].

RFE was developed out of a belief that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1950, it obtained a transmitter base at [[Lampertheim]], [[West Germany]] and on July 4 of the same year, RFE completed its first broadcast aimed at [[Czechoslovakia]]&lt;ref&gt;Mickelson, Sig, "America's Other Voice: the Story of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty" (New York: Praeger Publishers, 1983): Mickelson 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcasts were often banned in Eastern Europe and Communist authorities used sophisticated [[Radio jamming|jamming]] techniques in an attempt to prevent citizens from listening to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In late 1950, RFE began to assemble a full-fledged foreign broadcast staff, and became more than just a "mouthpiece for exiles" who had fled Eastern Bloc countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; While RFE was cleared of charges that it gave Hungarian listeners false hope during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], its Broadcast Analysis Division was established to ensure that broadcasts were accurate and professional while maintaining the journalists' former [[autonomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1960 study concluded that RFE possessed considerably more listeners than the BBC or VOA.&lt;ref name="puddington131"/&gt; The study concluded that the BBC was regarded as the most objective and the VOA had suffered a notable decline since it stopped critical broadcasts on the communist world after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], focusing instead on world news, American culture and jazz.&lt;ref name="puddington131"&gt;{{Harvnb|Puddington|2003|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Europe''' is a [[continent]] located entirely in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and mostly in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]]. It is bordered by the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south. It comprises the westernmost part of [[Eurasia]].

Since around 1850, Europe is most commonly considered to be [[Borders of the continents#Europe and Asia|separated from Asia]] by the [[drainage divide|watershed divides]] of the [[Ural Mountains|Ural]] and [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Ural River]], the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] Seas and the waterways of the [[Turkish Straits]].&lt;ref name="NatlGeoAtlas"&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=7th|year=1999|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} "Europe" (pp. 68–69); "Asia" (pp. 90–91): "A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe&amp;nbsp;... is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles."&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "continent" implies [[physical geography]], the land border is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]]. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects [[East–West dichotomy|East-West]] cultural, linguistic and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. The border does not follow political boundaries, with [[Turkey]], [[Russia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] being [[list of transcontinental countries|transcontinental countries]].

Europe covers about {{convert|10,180,000|km2|sqmi}}, or 2% of the Earth's surface (6.8% of land area). Politically, Europe is divided into about [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Europe|fifty sovereign states]] of which the [[Russian Federation]] is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a [[Demographics of Europe|total population]] of about 741 million (about 11% of the [[world population]]) {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} The [[European climate]] is largely affected by warm Atlantic currents that temper winters and summers on much of the continent, even at [[latitudes]] along which the climate in Asia and [[North America]] is severe. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.

Europe, in particular [[ancient Greece]], was the birthplace of [[Western civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kim Covert|title=Ancient Greece: Birthplace of Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KVMYJNvUiYkC&amp;pg=PP5|year=2011|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-1-4296-6831-6|page=5|quote=Ancient Greece is often called the cradle of western civilization. ...

[[Renaissance humanism]], [[Renaissance exploration|exploration]], [[Renaissance art|art]] and [[Renaissance science|science]] led to the [[modern era]]. Since the [[Age of Discovery]] started by [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], Europe played a predominant role in global affairs. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European powers [[European colonialism|controlled]] at various times the [[Americas]], almost all of [[Africa]] and [[Oceania]] and the majority of Asia.

The [[Age of Enlightenment]], the subsequent [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] shaped the continent culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. The [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in [[Western Europe]] and eventually the wider world. Both [[world war]]s took place for the most part in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] took prominence.&lt;ref name="natgeo 534"&gt;National Geographic, 534.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Cold War]], Europe was divided along the [[Iron Curtain]] between [[NATO]] in the West and the [[Warsaw Pact]] in the East, until the [[revolutions of 1989]] and [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]].

In 1949 the [[Council of Europe]] was founded, following a speech by Sir [[Winston Churchill]], with the idea of unifying Europe to achieve common goals. It includes all European states except for [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Vatican City]]. Further [[European integration]] by some states led to the formation of the [[European Union]] (EU), a separate political entity that lies between a [[confederation]] and a [[federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ies.ee/iesp/No11/articles/03_Gabriel_Hazak.pdf|title=The European union—a federation or a confederation?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU originated in Western Europe but has been [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding eastward]] since the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. The currency of most countries of the European Union, the [[euro]], is the most commonly used among Europeans; and the EU's [[Schengen Area]] abolishes border and immigration controls among most of its member states.

In classical [[Greek mythology]], [[Europa (mythology)|Europa]] ({{lang-grc|Εὐρώπη}}, ''Eurṓpē'') is the name of either a [[Phoenicia]]n princess or of a queen of Crete. The name contains the elements εὐρύς (''eurús''), "wide, broad"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Deu%29ru%2Fs εὐρύς], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; and ὤψ (''ōps'', gen. ὠπός, ''ōpós'') "eye, face, countenance",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dw%29%2Fy ὤψ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus.&lt;/ref&gt; hence their composite ''Eurṓpē'' would mean "wide-gazing" or "broad of aspect". ''Broad'' has been an [[epithet]] of Earth herself in the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European religion]] and the poetry devoted to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M.L. West |title=Indo-European poetry and myth |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=2007 |pages=178–179 |isbn=978-0-19-928075-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second part compare also the divine attributes of [[Athena#Cult and attributes|"grey-eyed" Athena]] (γλαυκῶπις, ''glaukōpis'') or [[Hera|ox-eyed Hera]] (βοῶπις, ''boōpis'').

There have been attempts to connect ''Eurṓpē'' to a Semitic term for "west", this being either [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''erebu'' meaning "to go down, set" (said of the sun) or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] '' 'ereb'' "evening, west",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Europe "Europe"] in the ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; which is at the origin of Arabic [[Maghreb]] and Hebrew ''ma'arav''. [[Michael A. Barry]], professor in [[Princeton University]]'s Near Eastern Studies Department, finds the mention of the word ''Ereb'' on an Assyrian stele with the meaning of "night, [the country of] sunset", in opposition to ''Asu'' "[the country of] sunrise", i.e. Asia. The same naming motive according to "cartographic convention" appears in Greek Ἀνατολή (''Anatolḗ'' "[sun] rise", "east", hence [[Anatolia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Barry: "L’Europe et son mythe : à la poursuite du couchant". In: ''Revue des deux Mondes'' (November/December 1999) p. 110. {{ISBN|978-2-7103-0937-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Litchfield West]] stated that "phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic word is very poor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=M.L. West |title=The east face of Helicon: west Asiatic elements in Greek poetry and myth |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |year=1997 |page=451 |isbn=978-0-19-815221-7 |oclc= |doi=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Next to these hypotheses there is also a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;regʷos'', meaning "darkness", which also produced Greek ''[[Erebus]]''.

Most major world languages use words derived from ''Eurṓpē'' or ''Europa'' to refer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word ''Ōuzhōu'' (歐洲/欧洲); a similar Chinese-derived term {{nihongo||欧州|Ōshū}} is also sometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union, {{nihongo||欧州連合|Ōshū Rengō}}, despite the [[katakana]] {{nihongo||ヨーロッパ|Yōroppa}} being more commonly used. In some Turkic languages the originally Persian name ''[[Frangistan]]'' ("land of the [[Franks]]") is used casually in referring to much of Europe, besides official names such as ''Avrupa'' or ''Evropa''.&lt;ref name="davison"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Davidson, Roderic H. |title=Where is the Middle East?|jstor=20029452 |journal=Foreign Affairs |volume=38|issue=4 |pages=665–675 |year=1960|doi=10.2307/20029452 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevalent definition of Europe as a geographical term has been in use since the mid-19th century.
Europe is taken to be bounded by large bodies of water to the north, west and south; Europe's limits to the far east are usually taken to be the Urals, the [[Ural River]], and the [[Caspian Sea]]; to the southeast, including the [[Caucasus Mountains]], the [[Black Sea]] and the waterways connecting the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopaedia 2007 |title=Europe |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopaedia_761570768/Europe.html |accessdate=27 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwbxqnne?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570768/Europe.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands are generally grouped with the nearest continental landmass, hence [[Iceland]] is generally considered to be part of Europe, while the nearby island of [[Greenland]] is usually assigned to [[North America]]. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions based on sociopolitical and cultural differences. [[Cyprus]] is closest to [[Anatolia|Anatolia (or Asia Minor)]], but is usually considered part of Europe both culturally and politically and is a member state of the EU. [[Malta]] was considered an island of [[Northwest Africa]] for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Falconer, William; Falconer, Thomas.

===History of the concept===

====Early history====

The first recorded usage of ''Eurṓpē'' as a geographic term is in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Delian Apollo]], in reference to the western shore of the [[Aegean Sea]]. As a name for a part of the known world, it is first used in the 6th century BC by [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus|Hecataeus]]. Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern [[Rioni River]]) in the Caucasus, a convention still followed by [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' 4.38. C.f. James Rennell, ''The geographical system of Herodotus examined and explained'', Volume 1, Rivington 1830, [https://books.google.com/books?id=enQ-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA244 p. 244]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus mentioned that the world had been divided by unknown persons into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya (Africa), with the [[Nile]] and the Phasis forming their boundaries—though he also states that some considered the [[Don River (Russia)|River Don]], rather than the Phasis, as the boundary between Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 4:45&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's eastern frontier was defined in the 1st century by geographer [[Strabo]] at the River Don.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo ''Geography 11.1''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Jubilees|Book of Jubilees]]'' described the continents as the lands given by [[Noah]] to his three sons; Europe was defined as stretching from the [[Pillars of Hercules]] at the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], separating it from [[Northwest Africa]], to the Don, separating it from Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genesis and the Jewish antiquities of Flavius Josephus|first= Thomas W.|last= Franxman|publisher=Pontificium Institutum Biblicum|year= 1979|isbn=978-88-7653-335-8|pages=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention received by the [[Middle Ages]] and surviving into modern usage is that of the [[Roman era]] used by Roman era authors such as [[Posidonius]],&lt;ref&gt;W. Theiler, ''Posidonios. Die Fragmente'', vol. 1. Berlin: De Gruyter, 1982, fragm. 47a.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;I. G. Kidd (ed.), ''Posidonius: The commentary'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0-521-60443-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_iXs1aCr1ckC&amp;pg=PA738 p. 738].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ptolemy]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' 7.5.6 (ed. Nobbe 1845, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vHMCAAAAQAAJ vol. 2], p. 178) {{lang|grc|Καὶ τῇ Εὐρώπῃ δὲ συνάπτει διὰ τοῦ μεταξὺ αὐχένος τῆς τε Μαιώτιδος λίμνης καὶ τοῦ Σαρματικοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ ἐπὶ τῆς διαβάσεως τοῦ Τανάϊδος ποταμοῦ. }}
"And [Asia] is connected to Europe by the land-strait between Lake Maiotis and the Sarmatian Ocean where the river Tanais crosses through."&lt;/ref&gt;
who took the Tanais (the modern Don River) as the boundary.

The term "Europe" is first used for a cultural sphere in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] of the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence of the [[Western Church]], as opposed to both the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches and to the [[Islamic world]].

A cultural definition of Europe as the lands of [[Christendom|Latin Christendom]] coalesced in the 8th century, signifying the new cultural condominium created through the confluence of Germanic traditions and Christian-Latin culture, defined partly in contrast with [[Byzantium]] and [[Islam]], and limited to northern [[Iberia]], the British Isles, France, Christianised western Germany, the Alpine regions and northern and central Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman F. Cantor]], ''The Civilization of the Middle Ages'', 1993, ""Culture and Society in the First Europe", pp185ff.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is one of the lasting legacies of the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]: ''Europa'' often{{dubious|date=October 2016}}&lt;!--inflated from "once or twice"--&gt; figures in the letters of Charlemagne's court scholar, [[Alcuin]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted by Cantor, 1993:181.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern definitions====
{{further|Regions of Europe|Core Europe}}
[[File:Europa Prima Pars Terrae in Forma Virginis.jpg|thumb|Depiction of ''[[Europa regina]]'' ('Queen Europe') in 1582.]]
The question of defining a precise eastern boundary of Europe arises in the Early Modern period, as the eastern extension of [[Muscovy]] began to include Northern Asia.

Throughout the Middle Ages and into the 18th century, the traditional division of the landmass of [[Eurasia]] into two continents, Europe and Asia, followed Ptolemy, with the boundary following the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]], the [[Sea of Azov]] and the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] (ancient [[Tanais]]). But maps produced during the 16th to 18th centuries tended to differ in how to continue the boundary beyond the Don bend at [[Kalach-na-Donu]] (where it is closest to the Volga, now joined with it by the [[Volga–Don Canal]]), into territory not described in any detail by the ancient geographers.

[[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] in 1725 was the first to depart from the classical Don boundary by drawing the line along the [[Volga River|Volga]], following the Volga north until the [[Samara Bend]], along [[Obshchy Syrt]] (the [[drainage divide]] between Volga and [[Ural River|Ural]]) and then north along [[Ural Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Das Nord-und Ostliche Theil von Europa und Asia|author=Philipp Johann von Strahlenberg|year=1730|language=German|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was adopted by the Russian Empire, and introduced the convention that would eventually become adopted as standard, but not without criticism by many modern analytical geographers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrVW9W9eiYMC&amp;pg=PA8 |title=Europe: A History |page=8 |publisher=|accessdate=23 August 2010|isbn=978-0-19-820171-7|date=1996|author1=Davies|first1=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mapmakers continued to differ on the boundary between the lower Don and Samara well into the 19th century. The [[:commons:Category:Atlas of Russian Empire. 1745 year|1745 atlas]] published by the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] has the boundary follow the Don beyond Kalach as far as [[Serafimovich (town)|Serafimovich]] before cutting north towards [[Arkhangelsk]], while other 18th- to 19th-century mapmakers such as [[John Cary]] followed Strahlenberg's prescription. To the south, the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]] was identified circa 1773 by a German naturalist, [[Peter Simon Pallas]], as a valley that, once upon a time, connected the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea,&lt;ref name="oren-icn.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |title=Boundary of Europe and Asia along Urals |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120108153922/http://oren-icn.ru/index.php/discussmenu/retrospectiva/685-eagraniza |archivedate=8 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Simon Pallas, ''Journey through various provinces of the Russian Empire'', vol. 3 (1773)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently was proposed as a natural boundary between continents.

By the mid-19th century, there were three main conventions, one following the Don, the [[Volga–Don Canal]] and the Volga, the other following the Kuma–Manych Depression to the Caspian and then the Ural River, and the third abandoning the Don altogether, following the [[Greater Caucasus watershed]] to the Caspian. The question was still treated as a "controversy" in geographical literature of the 1860s, with [[Douglas Freshfield]] advocating the Caucasus crest boundary as the "best possible", citing support from various "modern geographers".&lt;ref&gt;Douglas W.

In [[Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]], the boundary along the Kuma–Manych Depression was the most commonly used as early as 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlib.rsl.ru/view.php?path=/rsl01004000000/rsl01004103000/rsl01004103489/rsl01004103489.pdf#?page=163 "Europe"]{{dead link|date=August 2016}}, ''[[Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, the Soviet Geographical Society formally recommended that the boundary between the Europe and Asia be drawn in textbooks from [[Baydaratskaya Bay]], on the [[Kara Sea]], along the eastern foot of Ural Mountains, then following the [[Ural River]] until the [[Mugodzhar Hills]], and then the [[Emba River]]; and Kuma–Manych Depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://velikijporog.narod.ru/st_evraz_gran.htm|title=Do we live in Europe or in Asia?|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus placing the Caucasus entirely in Asia and the Urals entirely in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |title=Physical Geography |year=1998 |author=Orlenok V. |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016212930/http://www.i-u.ru/biblio/archive/orlenok_fisicheskaja/06.aspx |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most geographers in the Soviet Union favoured the boundary along the Caucasus crest&lt;ref&gt;E.M.

The [[European Neolithic]] period—marked by the cultivation of crops and the raising of livestock, increased numbers of settlements and the widespread use of pottery—began around 7000 BC in [[Greece]] and the [[Balkans]], probably influenced by earlier farming practices in [[Anatolia]] and the [[Near East]].&lt;ref name="Borza"&gt;{{Citation | last = Borza | first = E.N. | title = In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon | page = 58 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=614pd07OtfQC&amp;pg=PA58 | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 1992| isbn = 978-0691008806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It spread from the Balkans along the valleys of the [[Danube]] and the [[Rhine]] ([[Linear Pottery culture]]) and along the [[Mediterranean coast]] ([[Cardial Ware|Cardial culture]]).

During the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Europe entered a long period of change arising from what historians call the "[[Age of Migrations]]". There were numerous invasions and migrations amongst the [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]], [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Huns]], [[Franks]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Slavs]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and, later on, the [[Vikings]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]] and [[Magyars]].&lt;ref name="mieawl"/&gt; [[Renaissance]] thinkers such as [[Petrarch]] would later refer to this as the "Dark Ages".&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 4, No. 1. (Jan. 1943), pp. 69–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe though they were preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Cantor|Norman F. Cantor]], ''The Medieval World 300 to 1300''.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Roman empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking [[Eastern Roman Empire]], also known as the [[Byzantine Empire]]. During most of its existence, the Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Emperor [[Justinian I]] presided over Constantinople's first golden age: he established a [[Code of Justinian|legal code]] that forms the basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the [[Hagia Sophia]], and brought the Christian church under state control.&lt;ref name="natgeo 135"&gt;National Geographic, 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 7th century onwards, as the Byzantines and neighbouring [[Sasanids|Sasanid Persians]] were severely weakened due the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars]], the Muslim Arabs began to make inroads into historically Roman territory, taking the Levant and North Africa and making inroads into [[Asia Minor]]. In the mid 7th century AD, following the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], Islam penetrated into the [[Caucasus]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote="(..) It is difficult to establish exactly when Islam first appeared in Russia because the lands that Islam penetrated early in its expansion were not part of Russia at the time, but were later incorporated into the expanding Russian Empire.

Cambridge University Press. 052136292X.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 711 and 720, most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was brought under [[Muslim]] rule&amp;nbsp;— save for small areas in the northwest ([[Asturias]]) and largely [[Basque people|Basque]] regions in the [[Pyrenees]]. This territory, under the Arabic name [[Al-Andalus]], became part of the expanding [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The unsuccessful [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|second siege of Constantinople]] (717) weakened the [[Umayyad|Umayyad dynasty]] and reduced their prestige. The Umayyads were then defeated by the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, which ended their northward advance.

During the Dark Ages, the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.&lt;ref name="natgeo 143"&gt;National Geographic, 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the Frankish tribes were united under [[Clovis&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 162"&gt;National Geographic, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charlemagne]], a Frankish king of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty who had conquered most of Western Europe, was anointed "[[Holy Roman Emperor]]" by the Pope in 800. This led in 962 to the founding of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which eventually became centred in the German principalities of central Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 166"&gt;National Geographic, 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[East Central Europe]] saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption of [[Christianity]] (circa 1000 AD). The powerful [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] state of [[Great Moravia]] spread its territory all the way south to the Balkans, reaching its largest territorial extent under [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk I]] and causing a series of armed conflicts with [[East Francia]]. Further south, the first [[South Slavs|South Slavic states]] emerged in the late 7th and 8th century and adopted [[Christianity]]: the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Principality]] (later [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom]] and [[Serbian Empire|Empire]]), and the [[Duchy of Croatia]] (later [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]]). To the East, the [[Kievan Rus]] expanded from its capital in [[Kiev]] to become the largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, [[Vladimir the Great]] adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] as the religion of state.{{sfn|Bulliet|Crossley|Headrick|Hirsch|2011|page=250}}{{sfn|Brown|Anatolios|Palmer|2009|page=66}} Further East, [[Volga Bulgaria]] became an Islamic state in the 10th century, but was eventually absorbed into Russia several centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Mako, "The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered", Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 18, 2011, 199–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===
{{Main|High Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages|Middle Ages}}
{{See also|Medieval demography}}
The period between the year 1000 and 1300 is known as the [[High Middle Ages]], during which the population of Europe experienced significant growth, culminating in the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]]. Economic growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Baltic Sea]]s. The growing wealth and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the [[Maritime Republics]] a leading role in the European scene.

[[File:Philip II and Tancred meeting in Messina - British Library Royal MS 16 G vi f350r (detail).jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|[[Tancred of Sicily]] and [[Philip II of France]], during the [[Third Crusade]] (1189–1192)]]

The Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. [[Feudalism]] developed in [[France]] in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 158"&gt;National Geographic, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A struggle for influence between the [[nobility]] and the [[monarchy]] in England led to the writing of the [[Magna Carta]] and the establishment of a [[parliament]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 186"&gt;National Geographic, 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary source of culture in this period came from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Through monasteries and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of Europe.&lt;ref name="natgeo 158"/&gt;

The [[Papacy]] reached the height of its power during the High Middle Ages. An [[East-West Schism]] in 1054 split the former Roman Empire religiously, with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western Roman Empire. In 1095 [[Pope Urban II]] called for a [[Crusades|crusade]] against [[Muslims]] occupying [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 192"&gt;National Geographic, 192.&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe itself, the Church organised the [[Inquisition]] against heretics. In [[Spain]], the [[Reconquista]] concluded with the fall of [[Granada]] in 1492, ending over seven centuries of Islamic rule in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 199"&gt;National Geographic, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the east a resurgent Byzantine Empire recaptured Crete and Cyprus from the Muslims and reconquered the Balkans. Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city in Europe from the 9th to the 12th centuries, with a population of approximately 400,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laiou|Morisson|2007|pp=130–131}}; {{harvnb|Pounds|1979|p=124}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Empire was weakened following the defeat at [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]] and was weakened considerably by the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sack of Constantinople in 1204]], during the [[Fourth Crusade]].&lt;ref name="DuikerSpielvogel2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William J.

[[File:Château de Montsoreau(Maine-et-Loire).jpg|thumb|The end of [[Hundred Years' War|hundred years' wars]] marked the beginning of the [[French Renaissance]] in [[France]], [[Château de Montsoreau]] (1453).]]

The Renaissance was a period of cultural change originating in [[Florence]] and later spreading to the rest of Europe. The rise of a [[Renaissance humanism|new humanism]] was accompanied by the recovery of forgotten [[Classical Greece|classical Greek]] and Arabic knowledge from [[Monasticism|monastic]] libraries, often translated from Arabic into [[Latin language|Latin]].&lt;ref name="Barrett"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberto Weiss|Weiss, Roberto]] (1969) ''The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity'', {{ISBN|1-59740-150-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Jacob Burckhardt]]|origyear=1878|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2074 |title=The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy|edition=translation by S.G.C Middlemore|year=1990|isbn=978-0-14-044534-3|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Renaissance spread across Europe between the 14th and 16th centuries: it saw the flowering of [[Renaissance art|art]], [[philosophy]], [[music]], and the [[History of science in the Renaissance|sciences]], under the joint patronage of [[Royal family|royalty]], the nobility, the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and an emerging merchant class.&lt;ref name="natgeo 254"&gt;National Geographic, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, De Lamar (1992), ''Renaissance Europe'', {{ISBN|0-395-88947-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levey|first=Michael|title=Early Renaissance|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrons in Italy, including the [[Medici]] family of Florentine bankers and the [[Pope]]s in [[Rome]], funded prolific [[quattrocento]] and [[cinquecento]] artists such as [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Leonardo da Vinci]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 292"&gt;National Geographic, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levey|first=Michael|title=High Renaissance|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political intrigue within the Church in the mid-14th century caused the [[Western Schism]]. During this forty-year period, two popes—one in [[Avignon]] and one in Rome—claimed rulership over the Church. Although the schism was eventually healed in 1417, the papacy's spiritual authority had suffered greatly.&lt;ref name="natgeo 193"&gt;National Geographic, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Cranach d.Ä. - Martin Luther, 1528 (Veste Coburg).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546) initiated the [[Protestant Reformation]].]]

In the 15th century, Europe started to extend itself beyond its geographic frontiers. Spain and Portugal, the greatest naval powers of the time, took the lead in exploring the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=John Morris Roberts|title=Penguin History of Europe|year=1997|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-026561-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 296"&gt;National Geographic, 296.&lt;/ref&gt; A Spanish expedition led by [[Christopher Columbus]] reached the [[New World]] in 1492, the Portuguese sailor [[Vasco da Gama]] opened the ocean route to the [[Orient|East]] in 1498 and the Spanish explorer [[Sebastian Elcano]] made the first [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|circumnavigation of the globe]] in 1519–1522, and soon after the Spanish and Portuguese began establishing huge global empires in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Oceania.&lt;ref name="natgeo 338"&gt;National Geographic, 338.&lt;/ref&gt; France, the Netherlands and England soon followed in building large colonial empires with vast holdings in Africa, [[the Americas]], and Asia.

The Church's power was further weakened by the Protestant Reformation (1517–1648), initially sparked by [[The Ninety-Five Theses|the works]] of German theologian [[Martin Luther]], an attempt to start a reform within the Church. The Reformation also damaged the Holy Roman Emperor's influence, as German princes became divided between [[Protestant]] and Roman Catholic faiths.&lt;ref name="natgeo 256"&gt;National Geographic, 256–257.&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led to the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618–1648), which crippled the Holy Roman Empire and devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25 and 40 percent of its population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics History of Europe – Demographics].

In parallel, the [[Eastern Question]] grew more complex ever since the Ottoman defeat in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]]. As the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent, the [[Great Power]]s struggled to safeguard their strategic and commercial interests in the Ottoman domains. The [[Russian Empire]] stood to benefit from the decline, whereas the [[Habsburg Empire]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] perceived the preservation of the Ottoman Empire to be in their best interests.

Two world wars and an economic depression dominated the first half of the 20th century. World War I was fought between 1914 and 1918.

Russia was plunged into the [[Russian Revolution]], which threw down the [[Russian Empire|Tsarist monarchy]] and replaced it with the [[communist]] [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 480"&gt;National Geographic, 480.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austria-Hungary]] and the Ottoman Empire collapsed and broke up into separate nations, and many other nations had their borders redrawn.

The [[social revolution]]s sweeping through Russia also affected other European nations following [[The Great War]]: in 1919, with the [[Weimar Republic]] in Germany, and the [[First Austrian Republic]]; in 1922, with [[Mussolini]]'s one party [[Fascism|fascist]] government in the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and in [[Ataturk]]'s [[Turkish Republic]], adopting the Western alphabet, and state [[secularism]].
Economic instability, caused in part by debts incurred in the First World War and 'loans' to Germany played havoc in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. This and the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] brought about the worldwide [[Great Depression]]. Helped by the economic crisis, social instability and the threat of communism, [[Fascism|fascist movements]] developed throughout Europe placing [[Adolf Hitler]] in power of what became [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name="hobsbawn"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hobsbawm|first=Eric|publisher=Vintage|year=1995|isbn=978-0-679-73005-7|title=The Age of Extremes: A history of the world, 1914–1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 438"&gt;''National Geographic'', 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Hitler became the leader of Germany and began to work towards his goal of building Greater Germany. Germany re-expanded and took back the [[Saarland]] and [[Rhineland]] in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, [[Austria]] became a part of Germany following the [[Anschluss]]. Later that year, following the [[Munich Agreement]] signed by Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy, Germany annexed the [[Sudetenland]], which was a part of [[Czechoslovakia]] inhabited by ethnic Germans, and in early 1939, the remainder of Czechoslovakia was split into the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], controlled by Germany, and the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Slovak Republic]]. At the time, Britain and France preferred a policy of [[appeasement]].

With tensions mounting between Germany and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] over the future of [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], the Germans turned to the Soviets, and signed the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], which allowed the Soviets to invade the Baltic states and parts of Poland and Romania. Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, prompting France and the United Kingdom to declare war on Germany on 3 September, opening the [[European Theatre of World War II]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 465"&gt;National Geographic, 465.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Taylor|first=A.

P.|title= The Origins of the Second World War|year=1996|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster| isbn=978-0-684-82947-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] started on 17 September and Poland fell soon thereafter. On 24 September, the Soviet Union attacked the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Baltic countries]] and later, Finland. The British hoped to land at [[Battles of Narvik|Narvik]] and send troops to aid Finland, but their primary objective in the landing was to encircle Germany and cut the Germans off from Scandinavian resources. Around the same time, Germany moved troops into Denmark. The [[Phoney War]] continued.

In May 1940, Germany [[Battle of France|attacked France]] through the Low Countries. France capitulated in June 1940. By August Germany began a [[Battle of Britain|bombing offensive on Britain]], but failed to convince the Britons to give up.&lt;ref name="natgeo 510"&gt;''National Geographic'', 510.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, Germany invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 532"&gt;''National Geographic'', 532.&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 December 1941 [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] drew the United States into the conflict as allies of the [[British Empire]] and other [[Allies of World War II|allied]] forces.&lt;ref name="natgeo 511"&gt;''National Geographic'', 511.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natgeo 519"&gt;''National Geographic'', 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the staggering [[Battle of Stalingrad]] in 1943, the German offensive in the Soviet Union turned into a continual fallback. The [[Battle of Kursk]], which involved the largest [[Battle of Prokhorovka|tank battle]] in history, was the last major German offensive on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. In June 1944, British and American forces invaded France in the [[Normandy landings|D-Day landings]], opening a new front against Germany. Berlin finally [[Battle of Berlin|fell in 1945]], ending World War II in Europe.

World War I and especially World War II diminished the eminence of Western Europe in world affairs. After World War II the map of Europe was redrawn at the [[Yalta Conference]] and divided into two blocs, the Western countries and the communist Eastern bloc, separated by what was later called by [[Winston Churchill]] an "[[Iron Curtain]]". The United States and Western Europe
established the [[NATO]] alliance and later the Soviet Union and Central Europe established the [[Warsaw Pact]].&lt;ref name="natgeo 530"&gt;National Geographic, 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schuman Declaration.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Schuman Declaration]] led to the creation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. It began the [[European integration|integration process]] of the [[European Union]] ([[Europe Day|9 May]] 1950, at the [[French Foreign Ministry]]).]]

The two new [[superpower]]s, the United States and the Soviet Union, became locked in a fifty-year-long Cold War, centred on [[nuclear proliferation]]. At the same time [[decolonisation]], which had already started after World War I, gradually resulted in the independence of most of the European colonies in Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name="natgeo 534"/&gt; In the 1980s the [[glasnost|reforms]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement in Poland accelerated the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the end of the Cold War. Germany was reunited, after the symbolic [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and the maps of Central and Eastern Europe were redrawn once more.&lt;ref name="hobsbawn"/&gt;

[[European integration]] also grew after World War II. The [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957 established the [[European Economic Community]] between six Western European states with the goal of a unified economic policy and common market.&lt;ref name="natgeo 536"&gt;National Geographic, 536.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967 the EEC, [[European Coal and Steel Community]] and [[Euratom]] formed the [[European Community]], which in 1993 became the [[European Union]]. The EU established a [[European Parliament|parliament]], [[European Court of Justice|court]] and [[European Central Bank|central bank]] and introduced the [[euro]] as a unified currency.&lt;ref name="natgeo 537"&gt;National Geographic, 537.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2004 and 2013, more Central and Eastern European countries began joining, [[Enlargement of the European Union|expanding the EU]] to its current size of 28 European countries, and once more making Europe a major economical and political centre of power.&lt;ref name="natgeo 535"&gt;National Geographic, 535.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2016 the people of the United Kingdom, in a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|non-binding referendum]] on EU membership voted to [[Brexit|leave the European Union]].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Europe}}
[[File:Europe topography map en.png|thumb|Relief map of Europe and surrounding regions]]

Europe makes up the western fifth of the [[Eurasia]]n landmass.&lt;ref name="Encarta"/&gt; It has a higher ratio of coast to landmass than any other continent or subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last = Cuper |first = Simon |date = 23 May 2014 |title = Why Europe works |url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/51dd9432-db03-11e3-8273-00144feabdc0.html |publisher = [[Financial Times|ft.com]] |accessdate = 28 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its maritime borders consist of the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean, Black, and Caspian Seas to the south.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195686/Europe Europe]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt;
Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]], and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended lowland is known as the [[Great European Plain]], and at its heart lies the [[North German Plain]]. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of Britain and Ireland, and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[Italian Peninsula]] contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like [[Iceland]], Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising sea levels cut them off.

===Climate===

]]

Europe lies mainly in the [[temperate]] climate zones, being subjected to [[prevailing westerlies]]. The climate is milder in comparison to other areas of the same latitude around the globe due to the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]].&lt;ref name="climate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight/climates/european_climate |title=European Climate |website=World Book |accessdate=16 June 2008 |publisher=World Book, Inc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109230709/http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight%2Fclimates%2Feuropean_climate |archivedate=9 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gulf Stream is nicknamed "Europe's central heating", because it makes Europe's climate warmer and wetter than it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe's coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the continent from the Atlantic Ocean.

Therefore, the average temperature throughout the year of Naples is {{convert|16|°C}}, while it is only {{convert|12|°C}} in New York City which is almost on the same latitude. Berlin, Germany; Calgary, Canada; and Irkutsk, in the Asian part of Russia, lie on around the same latitude; January temperatures in Berlin average around {{convert|8|C-change}} higher than those in Calgary, and they are almost {{convert|22|C-change}} higher than average temperatures in Irkutsk.&lt;ref name="climate"/&gt; Similarly, northern parts of Scotland have a temperate marine climate. The yearly average temperature in city of Inverness is {{convert|9.05|C|F}}. However, Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, is on roughly the same latitude and has an average temperature of {{convert|-6.5|C|F}}, giving it a nearly subarctic climate.

===Geology===
{{Main|Geology of Europe|Geological history of Europe}}
[[File:Mount Elbrus May 2008.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount Elbrus]] in [[Russia]] is the highest mountain in Europe.]]

The geological history of Europe traces back to the formation of the [[Baltic Shield]] (Fennoscandia) and the [[Sarmatian craton]], both around 2.25&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, followed by the [[Volgo–Uralia]] shield, the three together leading to the [[East European craton]] (≈ [[Baltica]]) which became a part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]]. Around 1.1&amp;nbsp;billion years ago, Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [[Laurentia]] block) became joined to [[Rodinia]], later resplitting around 550&amp;nbsp;million years ago to reform as Baltica. Around 440&amp;nbsp;million years ago [[Euramerica]] was formed from Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [[Gondwana]] then leading to the formation of [[Pangea]]. Around 190&amp;nbsp;million years ago, Gondwana and [[Laurasia]] split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted for a considerable time, via [[Greenland]], leading to interchange of animal species. From around 50&amp;nbsp;million years ago, rising and falling sea levels have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents such as Asia. Europe's present shape dates to the late [[Tertiary period]] about five million years ago.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |title=Europe |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |year=2007 |accessdate=10 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204015044/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106055 |archivedate=4 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gibraltar-Europa-Point-LH-from-the-sea.jpg|thumb|Europa Point as seen from the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].]]
The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the [[Scottish Highlands]] to the rolling [[plain]]s of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soton.ac.uk/~imw/jpg/eurogy.jpg|title=Geology map of Europe|year=1967|publisher=University of Southampton|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europe's most significant feature is the dichotomy between highland and mountainous [[Southern Europe]] and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]] and [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]] complex and [[Barents Sea]].

The northern plain contains the old geological continent of [[Baltica]], and so may be regarded geologically as the "main continent", while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents. Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient [[microcontinent]] [[Avalonia]].

===Flora===

Having lived side-by-side with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe's animals and plants have been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception of [[Fennoscandia]] and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness are currently found in Europe, except for various [[national park]]s.

[[File:Europe land use map.png|thumb|left|Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow), forest (dark green), pasture (light green), and tundra or bogs in the north (dark yellow)]]

The main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [[forest]]. The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions. Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east-west and allow the wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others are oriented south-north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]], [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]) and because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side, the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time, and the cutting down of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant and animal ecosystems.

[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|Floristic regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer Lösch]]

Probably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&amp;geography.htm|title=History and geography|publisher=Save America's Forest Funds|accessdate=9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Although over half of Europe's original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]], Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forest|broadleaf and mixed]] forests, [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times, deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2–3% or less, in European Russia 5–10%. The country with the smallest percentage of forested area is [[Iceland]] (1%), while the most forested country is Finland (77%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |title=State of Europe's Forests 2007: The MCPFE report on sustainable forest management in Europe |publisher=EFI Euroforest Portal |page=182 |accessdate=9 June 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624190612/http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf |archivedate=24 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In temperate Europe, mixed forest with both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and coniferous trees dominate. The most important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]]. In the north, the taiga is a mixed [[spruce]]–[[pine]]–[[birch]] forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the taiga gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean, many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]]) extends eastwards from [[Ukraine]] and southern Russia and ends in Hungary and traverses into taiga to the north.

===Fauna===
{{main|Fauna of Europe}}
[[File:Europe biogeography countries.svg|right|thumb|[[Biogeography|Biogeographic regions]] of Europe and bordering regions]]

Glaciation during the [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of [[Fauna of Europe|European fauna]]. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction. The [[woolly mammoth]] was extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period. Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bear]]s ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered. Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]] the bears' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with sufficient forest cover. Today, the [[European brown bear|brown bear]] lives primarily in the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]], Scandinavia, and Russia; a small number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.), but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s may be found on [[Svalbard]], a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia. The [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]], the second largest predator in Europe after the brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and in the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [[Western Europe]] (Scandinavia, Spain, etc.).

European wild cat, foxes (especially the red fox), jackal and different species of martens, hedgehogs, different species of reptiles (like snakes such as vipers and grass snakes) and amphibians, different birds (owls, hawks and other birds of prey).

Important European herbivores are snails, larvae, fish, different birds, and mammals, like rodents, deer and roe deer, boars, and living in the mountains, marmots, steinbocks, chamois among others. A number of insects, such as the [[small tortoiseshell]] butterfly, add to the biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, S., Thomas, C. and Bale, J. (1997), Nettle-feeding nymphalid butterflies: temperature, development and distribution. Ecological Entomology, 22: 390–398. {{DOI|10.1046/j.1365-2311.1997.00082.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extinction of the [[Cretan Dwarf Hippopotamus|dwarf hippos]] and [[dwarf elephant]]s has been linked to the earliest arrival of humans on the islands of the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html|title=Paleolithic Man and his Environment in Malta|last1=Savona-Ventura|first1=C.|last2=Mifsud|first2=A.|date=9 April 1997|accessdate=19 July 2014|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/RainForest/3096/palaeol.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+09:39:06|archivedate=25 October 2009|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea creatures are also an important part of European flora and fauna. The sea flora is mainly [[phytoplankton]]. Important animals that live in European seas are [[zooplankton]], [[mollusc]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, different [[crustacean]]s, [[squid]]s and [[octopuses]], fish, [[dolphin]]s, and [[whales]].

Biodiversity is protected in Europe through the Council of Europe's [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Bern Convention]], which has also been signed by the [[European Community]] as well as non-European states.

{{Supranational European Bodies|size=300px|align=right}}

The political map of Europe is substantially derived from the re-organisation of Europe following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815. The prevalent form of government in Europe is [[parliamentary democracy]], in most cases in the form of [[Republic]]; in 1815, the prevalent form of government was still the [[Monarchies in Europe|Monarchy]]. Europe's remaining eleven monarchies&lt;ref&gt;not counting the microstate of [[Vatican City]]&lt;/ref&gt; are [[constitutional monarchy|constitutional]].

[[European integration]] is the process of political, legal, economic (and in some cases social and cultural) integration of European states as it has been pursued by the powers sponsoring the [[Council of Europe]] since the end of [[World War II]]
The [[European Union]] has been the focus of economic integration on the continent since its foundation in 1993. More recently, the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] has been established as a counterpart comprising former Soviet states.

28 European states are members of the politico-economic European Union, 26 of the border-free [[Schengen Area]] and 19 of the monetary union [[Eurozone]]. Among the smaller European organizations are the [[Nordic Council]], the [[Benelux]], the [[Baltic Assembly]] and the [[Visegrád Group]].

Several dependencies and similar territories with broad autonomy are also found within or in close proximity to Europe. This includes Åland (a [[region of Finland]]), two constituent countries of the Kingdom of Denmark (other than Denmark itself), three [[Crown dependencies]], and two [[British Overseas Territories]]. Svalbard is also included due to its unique status within Norway, although it is not autonomous. Not included are the three [[countries of the United Kingdom]] with devolved powers and the two [[Autonomous Regions of Portugal]], which despite having a unique degree of autonomy, are not largely self-governing in matters other than international affairs. Areas with little more than a unique tax status, such as [[Heligoland]] and the [[Canary Islands]], are also not included for this reason.

{{Main|Economy of Europe|List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (nominal)|List of sovereign states in Europe by GDP (PPP)}}

As a continent, the economy of Europe is currently the largest on Earth and it is the richest region as measured by assets under management with over $32.7&amp;nbsp;trillion compared to North America's $27.1&amp;nbsp;trillion in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fineman |first=Josh |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/world |title=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=15 September 2009 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128110049/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/world |archivedate=28 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Europe remained the wealthiest region. Its $37.1 trillion in assets under management represented one-third of the world's wealth. It was one of several regions where wealth surpassed its precrisis year-end peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |title=Global Wealth Stages a Strong Comeback |publisher=Pr-inside.com |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520174617/http://www.pr-inside.com/global-wealth-stages-a-strong-comeback-r1942019.htm |archivedate=20 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other continents, Europe has a large variation of wealth among its countries. The richer states tend to be in the [[Western Europe|West]]; some of the [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an economies are still emerging from the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].

The European Union, a political entity composed of 28 European states, comprises the [[List of countries by GDP|largest single economic area]] in the world. 19 EU [[Eurozone|countries]] share the [[euro]] as a common currency.
Five European countries rank in the top ten of the world's largest [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|national economies in GDP (PPP)]]. This includes (ranks according to the [[The CIA World Factbook|CIA]]): Germany (5), the UK (6), Russia (7), France (8), and Italy (10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html|title=The CIA World Factbook – GDP (PPP)|date=15 July 2008|accessdate=19 July 2008|publisher=[[CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is huge disparity between many European countries in terms of their income. The richest in terms of GDP per capita is Monaco with its US$172,676 per capita (2009) and the poorest is [[Moldova]] with its GDP per capita of US$1,631 (2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://databank.worldbank.org/ddp/home.do?Step=12&amp;id=4&amp;CNO=2|title=The World Bank DataBank |website=worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monaco]] is the richest country in terms of GDP per capita in the world according to the World Bank report.

As a whole, Europe's GDP per capita is US$21,767 according to a 2016 International Monetary Fund assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Some data refers to IMF staff estimates but some are actual figures for the year 2017, made in 12 April 2017.

===Economic history===
;Industrial growth (1760–1945)
Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com-archive-online.eu/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism Capitalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517172857/http://www.britannica.com-archive-online.eu/EBchecked/topic/93927/capitalism |date=17 May 2014 }}. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt; From Britain, it gradually spread throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Industrialism: A Dictionary of Sociology|author=Scott, John|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Revolution]] started in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|publisher=The History Guide|author=Steven Kreis|date=11 October 2006|accessdate=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 19th century saw Western Europe industrialise. Economies were disrupted by World War I but by the beginning of World War II they had recovered and were having to compete with the growing economic strength of the United States. World War II, again, damaged much of Europe's industries.

;Cold War (1945–1991)
[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|Fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989.]]
After World War II the economy of the UK was in a state of ruin,&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to suffer relative economic decline in the following decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rethinking International Organisation: Deregulation and Global Governance|last=Emadi-Coffin|first=Barbara|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-19540-9|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was also in a poor economic condition but regained a high level of growth by the 1950s. West Germany [[Wirtschaftswunder|recovered quickly]] and had doubled production from pre-war levels by the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, Rudiger; Nölling, Wilhelm P.; Layard, Richard G. ''Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today'', p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; France also staged a remarkable comeback enjoying rapid growth and modernisation; later on Spain, under the leadership of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]], also recovered, and the nation recorded huge unprecedented economic growth beginning in the 1960s in what is called the [[Spanish miracle]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrop, Martin. ''Power and Policy in Liberal Democracies'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states came under the control of the [[Soviet Union]] and thus were members of the [[Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] (COMECON).&lt;ref name="loc-cs"&gt;"Germany (East)", Library of Congress Country Study, [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/germany_east/gx_appnb.html Appendix B: The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]&lt;/ref&gt;

The states which retained a [[free-market]] system were given a large amount of aid by the United States under the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/marshall-plan|title=Marshall Plan|publisher=US Department of State Office of the historian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The western states moved to link their economies together, providing the basis for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large part due to the cost of the [[Cold War]]. Until 1990, the [[European Community]] was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe's largest economy.

With the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in 1991, the post-socialist states began free market reforms: Poland, Hungary, and [[Slovenia]] adopted them reasonably quickly, while [[Ukraine]] and Russia are still in the process of doing so.

After [[East Germany|East]] and West Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.

By the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the [[Eurozone]] replacing their former national currencies by the common euro. The three who chose to remain outside the Eurozone were: the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden. The European Union is now the largest economy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thepropheticyears.com/reasons/The%20rise%20of%20the...oman%20empire.htm]{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}{{Better source|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the population of Europe was estimated to be 742 million according to {{UN_Population|source}}, which is slightly more than one-ninth of the world's population. This number includes Asian Russia (Siberia, about 36 million people) but excludes the European part of Turkey, Cyprus and the Transcaucasian countries.
A century ago, Europe had nearly a quarter of the [[world population|world's population]].&lt;ref name="World Population Growth, 1950–2050"&gt;[http://www.prb.org/Educators/TeachersGuides/HumanPopulation/PopulationGrowth.aspx?p=1 World Population Growth, 1950–2050].

Most of Europe is in a mode of [[Sub-replacement fertility]], which means that each new(-born) generation is being less populous than the older.
The most densely populated country in Europe (and in the world) is the [[microstate]] of [[Monaco]].

Today, [[European diaspora|large populations of European descent]] are found on every continent. European ancestry predominates in North America, and to a lesser degree in South America (particularly in [[Uruguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and [[Brazil]], while most of the other [[Latin America]]n countries also have a considerable [[White Latin American|population of European origins]]). [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] have large European derived populations. Africa has no countries with European-derived majorities (or with the exception of [[Cape Verde]] and probably [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], depending on context), but there are significant minorities, such as the [[White South African]]s. In Asia, European-derived populations predominate in [[Northern Asia]] (specifically [[Russians]]) and some parts of Northern [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Greenall, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia], [[BBC News]], 23 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Europe}}

Europe has about 225 indigenous languages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edl.ecml.at/LanguageFun/LanguageFacts/tabid/1859/Default.aspx Language facts – European day of languages], Council of Europe. Retrieved 30 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; mostly falling within three [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language groups: the [[Romance languages]], derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] of the [[Roman Empire]]; the [[Germanic languages]], whose ancestor language came from southern Scandinavia; and the [[Slavic languages]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; Slavic languages are most spoken by the number of native speakers in Europe, they are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western Europe as well as in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], in Eastern Europe. Germanic languages are spoken in Northern Europe, the British Isles and some parts of [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt; Other Indo-European languages outside the three main groups include the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] group (that is, [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] group (that is, [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and [[Breton language|Breton]]&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/&gt;), [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].

A distinct non-Indo-European family of [[Uralic languages]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Erzya language|Erzya]], [[Komi language|Komi]], [[Mari language|Mari]], [[Moksha language|Moksha]], and [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]]) is spoken mainly in [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], and parts of Russia. [[Turkic languages]] include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], in addition to smaller languages in Eastern and Southeast Europe ([[Balkan Gagauz Turkish]], [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]], [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]], [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]], [[Nogai language|Nogai]], and [[Tatar language|Tatar]]). [[Kartvelian languages]] ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]], and [[Svan language|Svan]]) are spoken primarily in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]], most notably including [[Chechen language|Chechen]], [[Avar language|Avar]], and [[Lezgian language|Lezgin]]; and [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]], most notably including [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]]). [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is the only [[Semitic language]] that is official within the EU, while [[Basque language|Basque]] is the only European [[language isolate]].

Multilingualism and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political goals in Europe today. The [[Council of Europe]] [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] and the Council of Europe's [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] set up a legal framework for language rights in Europe.

==Culture==

{{Main|Culture of Europe}}
{{further|European folklore|European art}}
"Europe" as a cultural concept is substantially derived from the shared heritage of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Culture of ancient Rome|its culture]].
The boundaries of Europe were historically understood as those of [[Christendom]] (or more specifically [[Latin Christendom]]), as established or defended throughout the medieval and early modern history of Europe, especially [[Islamic conquests|against Islam]], as in the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilarie Belloc]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8442 Europe and the Faith], Chapter I&lt;/ref&gt;

This shared cultural heritage is combined by overlapping indigenous national cultures and folklores, roughly divided into [[Slavic Europe|Slavic]], [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin (Romance)]] and [[Germanic Europe|Germanic]], but with several components not part of either of these group (notably [[Greek culture|Greek]] and [[Celtic Europe|Celtic]]).
Cultural contact and mixtures characterise much of European regional cultures; Kaplan (2014) describes Europe as "embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances".{{clarify|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Andreas M.

Among Protestants, the most popular are historically state-supported European denominations such as [[Lutheranism]], [[Anglicanism]] and the [[Reformed faith]]. Other Protestant denominations such as historically significant ones like [[Anabaptists]] were never supported by any state and thus are not so widespread, as well as these newly arriving from the [[United States]] such as [[Pentecostalism]], [[Adventism]], [[Methodism]], [[Baptists]] and various [[Evangelical Protestants]]; although Methodism and Baptists both have European origins. The notion of "Europe" and the "[[Western World]]" has been intimately connected with the concept of "[[Christendom|Christianity and Christendom]]"; many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified [[European identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Crisis in Western Education|year=1961|isbn=978-0813216836|edition=reprint|author2=Glenn Olsen|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions''', (also known as ''European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions'') abbreviated '''EU-SILC''', is a survey department of the [[EU]].
It replaced in 2004 the ''European Community Household Panel'' (ECHP), which covered the years 1994-2003. The EU-SILC includes only minor changes relative to its predecessor the ECHP; most importantly, it significantly expands the number of countries included in the sample.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3408">'''GPoT Center''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]: ''Küresel Siyasal Eğilimler Merkezi'') officially the '''Global Political Trends Center''' is a [[research]] unit, which was established by [[Mensur Akgun]] and [[Sylvia Tiryaki]] at the [[Istanbul Kültür University]] in [[Turkey]] in 2008. The mission of the Center is to conduct research, projects, to produce innovative [[publication]]s analyzing the latest issues in the international relations, to formulate viable political recommendations and to boost the dialogue between [[civil society]], [[academia]] and [[Mass media|media]].

== Activities ==

GPoT Center, as one of the leading Turkish [[think tank]]s, runs [[project]]s in various areas and has organized numerous [[Meeting|conferences]], workshops and round-table meetings focused on: the EU - Turkey relations, the [[Cyprus question]], the Turkey - [[Armenia]] relations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/news-207740-us-meetings-reinvigorate-turkish-armenian-reconciliation.html US meetings reinvigorate Turkish-Armenian reconciliation]&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish - [[Arab]] dialogue, [[NATO]], second track [[diplomacy]] between [[Syria]] and [[Israel]], Arab-Israeli conflict and other issues related to the international agenda in general and the agenda of Turkish [[foreign policy]] in particular.

The projects implemented by GPoT Center often involve participation of [[high-level]] politicians and [[opinion]] makers, however the Center is also active in organization of second-track diplomacy meetings aiming at effective conflict solution. For the purposes of second-track diplomacy, GPoT Center brings together representatives of conflicting parties, i.e. [[civil society]] activists, opinion leaders, as well as academics to discuss issues pertaining to solution of the relevant problem. The meetings are usually conducted in friendly atmosphere and under Chatam House rules.

== Publications ==

The Center publishes various types of publications available in the electronic as well as printed form. It has published a number of [[policy]] briefs analyzing issues in [[international relations]] and shorter essays, i.e. GPoT Briefs focusing on one topic from the current global issues. GPoT Center published its first two books on Cyprus issue in the summer 2009 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brtk.cc/index.php/lang/en/cat/2/news/50924 BRT: Rauf Denktash and Michael Moran write a book]&lt;/ref&gt; and has since then published other books on developments in Cyprus, Israeli-Turkish relations, as well as [[democratization]] of the [[Middle East]].

== Partners and Networks ==

The Center cooperates with institutions from [[Sweden]] - SIIA, [[Lebanon]] - CAUS, [[Qatar]] - ADF, [[United Kingdom]] - LSE, [[Czech Republic]] - EUROPEUM, [[Slovak Republic]] - SFPA, [[Armenia]] - EPF, YPC and Internews, [[Egypt]] - Ibn-Khaldun Center, and [[France]] - ENS. GPoT Center is also part of larger research and academic networks such as the United Nations's [[Alliance of Civilizations]], International Research and Security Network, [[United Nations]]' Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures.

[[File:John Slattery Gascony Show.jpg|thumb|left|alt=John Slattery, the Gascony Show host in the radio studio.|''The Gascony Show'' host, John Slattery, in the studio in Saint Blancard]]
John Slattery takes over the airwaves at 5pm and finishes at 7pm with a handover to Patrick Martinez. The ''Gascony Show'' is a music-based programme that includes light-hearted banter and whimsical jokes by the host. Listeners' views and comments are discussed and there are rotating segments such as "Song of The Week" and "Life in the South-West". To keep listeners on their toes, random topics are picked from a big "Bag O Topics."

Podcasts of all previous shows&lt;ref name=gasconyshow5436793&gt;[http://www.gasconyshow.com/podcasts/GasconyShowPodcasts.xml "The Gascony Show Podcasts"] Recordings of all previous shows.&lt;/ref&gt; are available on the show's website so that previous shows can be listened to again. Previous shows can also be found on iTunes.&lt;ref name=gasconyshow5434434&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/fr/podcast/the-gascony-show/id455503319 "The Gascony Show on iTunes"] Recordings of all previous shows.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invited guests==

The show runs interviews with regular and/or rotating guests,&lt;ref name=gasconyshow2334923&gt;[http://www.gasconyshow.com/archives.html "The Gascony Show Archives"] Recorded shows with guests.&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with subjects of both local interest and of general interest to the [[expatriate]] community. The first person to be interviewed on the show was the illustrious English painter, interior designer and writer, Stella Wulf.&lt;ref name=gasconyshow2345213&gt;[http://web.me.com/claire.jefferson/StellaWulf/StopPress.html "Stella Wulf, News &amp; Events"] Interview, Sunday, 10 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Stella is the author of "The Lonesome Froom and other Strange Tales," "Rum Rhymes and Vagabond" and "The Song of the Froom." She recounted humorous stories of her years in France and her efforts to get her books published.

Subsequent interviews included music industry notaries such as Joy Askew and her brother Roger Askew.&lt;ref name=pkmediapromotions6456442&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/user/PKMediaPromotions "The Gascony Show Channel"] Produced by PK Media Promotions.&lt;/ref&gt; These two truly multi-dimensional singers sang some of their favourite songs on air. Joy, who worked closely with the likes of [[Peter Gabriel]] and Joe Jackson, and fronted the all-girl rock band called Bitch, told her story of life as a song-writer and touring musician. The interview proved enormously popular with both English and French speaking listeners in France and it served to create a pattern of story telling and musical treats that would become an underlying trait of later interviews.

A highly commended interview was that with Leaf Fielding,&lt;ref name=leaffielding5437658&gt;[http://www.leaffielding.com/news.html "Leaf Fielding on the Gascony Show"] Interview, Sunday, 11 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the drug-dealers jailed as a result of the famous 1977 drug cartel bust in the UK called [[Operation Julie]]. The interview revolved around Leaf's life, his descent into drug dealing, his imprisonment, and his new life in France. Also discussed was Leaf’s book ''To Live Outside The Law'',&lt;ref name=leaffielding1116349&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/07/leaf-fielding-outside-law-drugs "To Live Outside The Law"] By The Guardian, Thursday, 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; that tells the story from his early days and his first experience with LSD, to his amazing falling from grace.

==Regular contributors==

The show relies heavily on e-mailed material sent in by listeners that is then read out on air, and most of the regular contributors are local [[expatriates]] living in the Gascony region.

'''Glenn Hauser''' (born April 12, 1945 in [[Berkeley, California]]) is an internationally known American [[DXing|DX]]er&lt;ref name="Berg2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Jerome S.|title=Listening on the short waves, 1945 to today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjP978PYo0MC&amp;pg=PA222|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=October 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3996-6|pages=222–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BennettHardy1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bennett|first1=Hank|last2=Hardy|first2=David T.|last3=Yoder|first3=Andrew R.|title=The complete shortwave listener's handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F_tmz9JIRHsC|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=September 1993|publisher=TAB Books|isbn=978-0-8306-4347-9|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[radio]] host from [[Enid, Oklahoma]]. He produces and presents a weekly 30-minute program, ''World Of Radio'',&lt;ref name="League1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=American Radio Relay League|title=ARRL Operating Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ICivfre46-QC|accessdate=17 April 2011|date=August 1997|publisher=American Radio Relay League|isbn=978-0-87259-614-6|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; heard on a number of [[Public broadcasting|non-commercial]] [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations throughout the [[United States|U.S.]] and worldwide on [[Shortwave radio|shortwave]].

Hauser began his broadcasting career on [[Radio Canada International]] during the late 1970s, providing DX tips on Sunday nights, and his tips also appeared on [[Radio Netherlands Worldwide|Radio Nederland's]] ''DX Juke Box'' program. He wrote for ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' and ''[[Modern Electronics]]'', and published ''Review of International Broadcasting''.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;Harvey, Sheldon, "[http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php Glenn Hauser interview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706172348/http://www.cidx.ca/sf/SF5Hauser.php |date=2011-07-06 }}", ''CIDX Special Feature #5'', Summer 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==''World of Radio''==
''World Of Radio'' debuted in 1980 on [[WUOT]]-FM in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], moving to shortwave two years later. The half-hour program consists of Hauser reading news about radio around the world in a characteristic monotone. Although ''World of Radio'' focuses on shortwave news, it covers all aspects of broadcasting. Most items are contributed by listeners to the program or DX publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofradio.com/dxlatest.txt|title=DX Listening Digest|accessdate=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mundo Radial''===
Hauser also produced ''Mundo Radial'', a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] edition of ''World of Radio'', from January 2002 to November 2007.&lt;ref name=Mundo&gt;[http://www.worldofradio.com/espanol.html Mundo Radial]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Review of International Broadcasting''==
Hauser introduced ''Review of International Broadcasting'' in February 1977.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; The magazine published 154 issues, with columns such as "Listener Insights on Programming," "Radio Equipment Forum," "DX Listening Digest," "The Media Mind" and "Satellite Watch."&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; Contributors included David Newkirk, Loren Cox and Juan Carlos Codina,&lt;ref name=Berg&gt;Berg, Jerome S., "Review of International Broadcasting (1977–1997)", 'Listening on the short waves, 1945 to today'', pg 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; and ''RIB'' also featured columns from the BBC, John Norfolk and Alan Roe.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; It was published monthly during the 1970s and 1980s, later decreasing to quarterly and semiannually before ceasing publication in October 1997.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt; ''RIB''{{'}}s successor, ''DX Listening Digest'', went online in 1999.&lt;ref name=Berg /&gt;

=={{anchor|Religious views}}Political and religious views==
Hauser is a political [[Liberalism|liberal]] and an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],&lt;!-- Think he identifies as atheist. --&gt; which occasionally puts him at odds with the [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist-dominated]] [[Shortwave broadcasting in the United States|American shortwave scene]] which carries ''World of Radio''.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

'''Global politics''', also known as '''world politics''',{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=273}} names both the discipline that studies the political and economical patterns of the world and the field that is being studied. At the centre of that field are the different processes of [[political globalization]] in relation to questions of social power.

The discipline studies the relationships between cities, [[nation-states]], shell-states, [[multinational corporations]], [[non-governmental organizations]] and [[international organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Jan-Erik Lane, ''Globalization and Politics: Promises and Dangers'', Aldershot, Ashgate, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Current areas of discussion include national and [[ethnic]] conflict regulation, [[democracy]] and the politics of national [[self-determination]], [[globalization]] and its relationship to democracy, conflict and peace studies, [[comparative politics]], [[political economy]], and the [[international political economy]] of the environment. One important area of global politics is contestation in the global political sphere over legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= van Seeters | first2= Paul | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 2: Global Social Movements and Global Civil Society | url= https://www.academia.edu/7305007/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._2_Global_Social_Movements_and_Global_Civil_Society_2014_ | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global politics is said by some to be distinct from the field of international politics (commonly seen as a branch of [[international relations]]{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=273}}), as it "does not stress the primacy of intergovernmental relations and transactions".{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=578}} This distinction however has not always been held among authors and political scientists, who often use the term "international politics" to mean global politics.{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=273}}

==Defining the field==
Beginning in the late nineteenth century, several groups extended the definition of the political community beyond nation-states to include much, if not all, of humanity. These "internationalists" include [[Marxists]], human rights advocates, environmentalists, peace activists, [[feminists]], and [[dalits]]. This was the general direction of thinking on global politics, though the term was not used as such.&lt;ref name="Vol4"&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 4: Political Philosophies of the Global | url= https://www.academia.edu/7547819/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._4_Political_Philosophies_of_the_Global_2014_ | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | pages= x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern "world politics perspective" is often identified with the works of [[Joseph Nye]] and [[Robert Keohane]], in particular their 1972 work ''Transnational Relations and World Politics''. Here, the authors argued that state-centric views of international relations were inadequate frameworks to utilize in political science or international relations studies due to the increased globalization.{{sfn|Evans|Newnham|1998|p=578}} Today, the practices of global politics are defined by values: norms of [[human rights]], ideas of [[human development (humanity)|human development]], and beliefs such as [[Internationalism (politics)|Internationalism]] or [[cosmopolitanism]] about how we should relate to each. Over the last couple of decades cosmopolitanism has become one of the key contested ideologies of global politics:
{{cquote| Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality.&lt;ref name="Vol4" /&gt;}}

== Debates ==

The intensification of [[globalization]] led some writers to suggest that states were no longer relevant to global politics.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Horsman and Andrew Marshall, After the Nation-State, London, Harper Collins, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been subject to debate:

{{cquote| On the other hand, other commentators have been arguing that states have remained essential to global politics. They have facilitated globalizing processes and projects; not been eclipsed by them. They have been rejuvenated because, among other reasons, they are still the primary providers of (military) security in the global arena; they are still the paramount loci for articulating the voices of (procedurally democratic) national communities, and for ordering their interactions with similar polities; and finally, they are indispensable to relations of (unequal) economic exchange insofar as they legitimize and enforce the global legal frameworks that enable globalization in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Soguk | first2= Nevzat | title= Globalization and Politics, Vol. 1: Global Political and Legal Governance | url= https://www.academia.edu/7285675/Globalization_and_Politics_Vol._1_Global_Political_and_Legal_Governance_2014_| publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xlii}}; AG McGrew and PG Lewis, ''Global Politics'', Cambridge, Polity Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== 1970s ===
In 1972 NSA analyst [[Perry Fellwock]] (under the pseudonym "Winslow Peck") introduced the readers of ''[[Ramparts (magazine)|Ramparts]]'' magazine to the NSA and to the [[UKUSA Agreement]].&lt;ref name="ramparts"&gt;{{cite news

=== 1980s–1990s ===
In 1982 [[James Bamford]]'s book about the NSA, ''[[The Puzzle Palace]]'', was first published. Bamford's second book, ''[[Body of Secrets|Body of Secrets: Anatomy of the Ultra-Secret National Security Agency]]'', was published two decades later.

In 1988 the '''[[ECHELON]]''' network was revealed by [[Margaret Newsham]], a [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] employee. Newsham told a member of the U.S. Congress that the telephone calls of [[Strom Thurmond]], a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] U.S. senator, were being collected by the NSA. Congressional investigators determined that "targeting of U.S. political figures would not occur by accident. but was designed into the system from the start."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], [[William Binney (U.S. intelligence official)|William Binney]], along with colleagues [[J.

In 2001, after the September 11 attacks, [[MI5]] started collecting bulk telephone communications data in the United Kingdom on which telephone numbers called each other and when, authorised the [[Home Secretary]] under a little understood general power under the [[Telecommunications Act 1984]] instead of the [[Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000]] would have brought independent oversight and regulation.

In 2007 former [[Qwest]] CEO [[Joseph Nacchio]] alleged in court and provided supporting documentation that in February 2001 (nearly 7 months prior to the [[September 11 attacks]]) that the NSA proposed in a meeting to conduct blanket phone spying.

The '''Indian subcontinent''' is a southern [[region]] and [[peninsula]] of [[Asia]], mostly situated on the [[Indian Plate]] and projecting southwards into the [[Indian Ocean]] from the [[Himalayas]]. [[Geology|Geologically]], the Indian subcontinent is related to the land mass that rifted from [[Gondwana]] and merged with the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian plate]] nearly 55 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; [[Geography|Geographically]], it is the [[peninsula]]r region in south-central Asia delineated by the [[Himalayas]] in the north, the [[Hindu Kush]] in the west, and the [[Arakan Mountains|Arakanese]] in the east.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Graham P. p. 10"/&gt; Politically, the Indian subcontinent includes [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;"Indian subcontinent".

== Name==

According to ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term "subcontinent" signifies a "subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical, political, or cultural identity" and also a "large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent". It is first attested in 1845 to refer to the [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]s, before they were regarded as separate continents. Its use to refer to the Indian subcontinent is seen from the early twentieth century. It was especially convenient for referring to the region comprising both [[British India]] and the [[princely state]]s under [[British Paramountcy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|term=subcontinent|id=192528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|term=Indian subcontinent|id=94389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Indian subcontinent also has a geological significance. Similar to various continents, it was a part of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. A series of tectonic splits caused formation of various basins, each drifting in various directions. The geological region called "Greater India" once included [[Madagascar]], [[Seychelles]], [[Antarctica]] and Austrolasia along with the Indian subcontinent basin. As a geological term, Indian subcontinent has meant that region formed from the collision of the Indian basin with Eurasia nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Wynn Jones|title=Applications of Palaeontology: Techniques and Case Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrPiq_8pkAwC&amp;pg=PA267 |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49920-0|pages=267–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hinsbergen1&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hinsbergen | first=D.

The Indian subcontinent has been a term particularly common in the British Empire.&lt;ref name=mcleodplus&gt;John McLeod, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8Y3MH3dj6MC&amp;pg=PA1 The history of India]'', page 1, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-313-31459-4}}; note: McLeod does not include Afghanistan in Indian subcontinent or South Asia;&lt;br&gt;Jim Norwine &amp; Alfonso González, ''The Third World: states of mind and being'', pages 209, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1988, {{ISBN|0-04-910121-8}}&lt;br&gt;Raj S. Bhopal, ''Ethnicity, race, and health in multicultural societies'', pages 33, Oxford University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-19-856817-7}}; Quote: "The term South Asian refers to populations originating from the Indian subcontinent, effectively India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka;&lt;br&gt;Lucian W.

The earliest use of the term I could find is from 1915, and it is American, not British--&gt;

The geographical region has historically simply been known as "India" (in antiquity referring to the [[Indus Valley]] region, not the entire subcontinent).  Other related terms are [[Greater India]] and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name=mittal&gt;Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby, ''Religions of South Asia: An Introduction'', page 3, Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|9781134593224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kathleen M page 10"&gt;Kathleen M. Baker and Graham P. Chapman, ''The Changing Geography of Asia'', page 10, Routledge, 2002, {{ISBN|9781134933846}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
And the terms "Indian subcontinent" and "South Asia" are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=mcleodplus/&gt; There is no globally accepted definition on which countries are a part of South Asia or the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=anderson5/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jona Razzaque 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmann&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia’s Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uh0cBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT13|year=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-62445-5|pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
Geologically, the Indian subcontinent was first a part of so-called "Greater India",&lt;ref name=hinsbergen1/&gt; a region of [[Gondwana]] that drifted away from [[East Africa]] about 160 million years ago, around the Middle Jurassic period.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; The region experienced high volcanic activity and plate subdivisions, creating Madagascar, Seychelles, Antarctica, Austrolasia and the Indian subcontinent basin. The Indian subcontinent drifted northeastwards, colliding with the Eurasian plate nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of Paleocene. This geological region largely includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; The zone where the Eurasian and Indian subcontinent plates meet remains one of the geologically active areas, prone to major earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bethany D.

Using the more expansive definition – counting India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives as the constituent countries – the Indian subcontinent covers about 4.4 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1.7 million sq&amp;nbsp;mi), which is 10% of the Asian continent or 3.3% of the world's land surface area.&lt;ref name=JJCO&gt;Desai, Praful B. 2002.

The term "Indian continent" is first introduced in the early 20th century, when most of the territory was  part of [[British Raj|British India]].&lt;ref&gt;"Indian subcontinent" is used by Henry D. Baker, ''British India With Notes On Ceylon Afghanistan And Tibet'' (1915), [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.236168/2015.236168.British-India#page/n403/mode/2up p. 401].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hindu Kush]], centered on eastern  [[Afghanistan]], is the boundary connecting the Indian subcontinent with [[Central Asia]] to the northwest, and the [[Persian Plateau]] to the west.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5989">The '''International Map of the World''' (also called the '''Millionth Map''', after its [[map scale|scale]] of 1:1000000) was a project begun in 1913 to create a complete [[World map|map of the world]] according to internationally agreed standards. Roads were depicted in red, towns and railways were depicted in black, and the labels were written in the Roman alphabet.&lt;s&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutmap"&gt;{{cite web
|title = International Map of the World
|url = http://geography.about.com/od/historyofgeography/a/millionthmap.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/s&gt; The map was the brainchild of [[Albrecht Penck]], a German geographer who first proposed it in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Great maps.|date=2014|publisher=Dk Publishing|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-1-4654-2463-1|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central Bureau of the Map of the World was established at the [[Ordnance Survey]] in London. After the [[Second World War]], the [[United Nations]] took over the project. By 1953 only 400 of about 1000 sheets had been produced; though this covered most of the land surface outside North America, many sheets were decades out of date, and almost none of the open ocean was covered.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson et al 2006, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, [[Arthur H. Robinson]] dismissed the IMW as "cartographic wallpaper" of no practical use.&lt;ref name="main2006p163"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Robinson2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robinson|first=A. H.|date=18 July 2013|origyear=1965|title=The Future of the International Map|journal=The Cartographic Journal|volume=2|issue=1|pages=23–26|doi=10.1179/caj.1965.2.1.23|issn=0008-7041}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were few updates thereafter, and in 1989, [[UNESCO]] declared the project was no longer feasible and stopped monitoring it.&lt;ref name="main2006p163"&gt;Pearson et al 2006, p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to shortening of longitudinal distances with increasing latitude, longitudinal span beyond 60 degrees latitude doubles to twelve degrees.  Beyond 76 degrees it doubles again to 24 degrees.

This indexing system outlived the international project and is still used in national and international mapping programs by Australia,&lt;ref&gt;

Of [[Armenia]]n descent, he was born in [[Batumi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] {{clarify|date=August 2014}}. As a child, he lived with his family in England and attended British schools. Later, in the 1930s, he attended a special school for American expats in Moscow where he acquired familiarity with Americans.&lt;ref name=CSM&gt;{{cite web|last=Thatcher|first=Gary|title=Comrade Joe Adamov tells it all to you|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1986/0709/oadam.html|date=July 9, 1986|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a graduate of [[Moscow State Pedagogical University]].&lt;ref name=VORobit&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Adamov Passed Away|publisher=[[Voice of Russia]] |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221052622/http://www.vor.ru/English/JAdamov.html|date=December 21, 2005|access-date=August 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An expert [[English language|English-speaker]] who spoke with a neutral American accent, Adamov joined Radio Moscow as an announcer at the foreign language service of Radio Moscow in 1942.&lt;ref name=VORobit /&gt; He lived in [[Moscow]] during most of his career.

[[File:Joe Adamov.jpg|thumb|left|Joe Adamov in a Radio Moscow staff meeting]]
Among English-speaking listeners, he is best known as the presenter of the programme ''Moscow Mailbag'' on Radio Moscow's North American shortwave broadcasts. The program answered questions from listeners on all aspects of Soviet life and the [[USSR]]'s policies. At its height, ''Moscow Mailbag'' listeners sent Adamov thousands of letters yearly.&lt;ref name=CSM /&gt; In his capacity as a Radio Moscow journalist and presenter of ''Moscow Mailbag'', Adamov conducted interviews with many western politicians and journalists, including [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]],  [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Larry King]].

During the [[Cold War]], Adamov's broadcasts, like all other Radio Moscow output, were carefully studied by Western governments, a fact of which the Soviet authorities were well aware. Joe Adamov presented ''Moscow Mailbag'' from 1957 until shortly before his death, when ill-health forced him to relinquish the role permanently. The program remains on the air with different presenters.

Joe Adamov was also the official Soviet translator at the trial of [[Gary Powers]], shot down in a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane in 1960.

The signature poem of Moscow Mailbag was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
You can't do better
than send us that letter
and in it tell Joe
what you think of his show
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adamov's death was reported on Voice of Russia's English-language news bulletins on December 21, 2005, although neither these bulletins nor the obituary on their website gave an exact date of death.&lt;ref name=VORobit /&gt;

A '''list of antibiotic resistant bacteria''' is provided below. These bacteria have shown antibiotic resistance (or [[antimicrobial resistance]]).

== Enzyme NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) ==
{{Main|New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1}}
[[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1|NDM-1]] is an [[enzyme]] that makes [[bacteria]] resistant to a broad range of [[beta-lactam antibiotic]]s.

NDM-1 (New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase-1) originated in India. In Indian hospitals [[hospital-acquired infection]]s are common and with the new super-bugs on rise in India, this can make them dangerous.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Timothy R|last2=Weeks|first2=Janis|last3=Livermore|first3=David M|last4=Toleman|first4=Mark A|title=Dissemination of NDM-1 positive bacteria in the New Delhi environment and its implications for human health: an environmental point prevalence study |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309911700597|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=11|issue=5|pages=355–362|doi=10.1016/s1473-3099(11)70059-7|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mapping of sewage and water supply samples that were NDM-1-positive indicates widespread infection in New Delhi already back in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

NDM-1 was first detected in a ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' isolate from a [[Sweden|Swedish]] patient of [[India]]n origin in 2008. It was later detected in bacteria in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/09/13/new_drug_resistant_superbugs_found_in_3_states/ |title=New drug-resistant superbugs found in 3 states|author=Marilynn Marchione|date=13 September 2010|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/about/healthzone.html|title=Superbug detected in GTA|author=Madeleine White|date=21 August 2010|work=Toronto Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2010/09/08/japan_confirms_first_case_of_superbug_gene/|title=Japan confirms first case of superbug gene|last=Yuasa|first=Shino|date=8 September 2010|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|''Clostridium difficile'']] is a [[Hospital-acquired infection|nosocomial]] pathogen that causes diarrheal disease worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gerding DN, Johnson S, Peterson LR, Mulligan ME, Silva J|year=1995|title=Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and colitis|journal=Infect.

Infections are most frequent in people who have had recent medical and/or antibiotic treatment. ''C. difficile'' infections commonly occur during hospitalization.&lt;ref name="CDC2013"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|title=Biggest Threats – Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance – CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 CDC report, ''C. difficile'' caused almost 500,000 infections in the United States over a year period. Associated with these infections were an estimated 15,000 deaths. The CDC estimates that ''C. difficile'' infection costs could amount to $3.8 billion over a 5-year span.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2015/p0225-clostridium-difficile.html|title=CDC Press Releases|website=CDC|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''C. difficile'' colitis is most strongly associated with [[fluoroquinolones]], [[cephalosporin]]s, [[carbapenem]]s, and [[clindamycin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Baxter R, Ray GT, Fireman BH|date=January 2008|title=Case-control study of antibiotic use and subsequent Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea in hospitalized patients|journal=Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology|volume=29|issue=1|pages=44–50|doi=10.1086/524320|pmid=18171186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17072575"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gifford AH, Kirkland KB|date=December 2006|title=Risk factors for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea on an adult hematology-oncology ward|journal=European Journal of Clinical Microbiology &amp; Infectious Diseases|volume=25|issue=12|pages=751–5|doi=10.1007/s10096-006-0220-1|pmid=17072575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16156323"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Palmore TN, Sohn S, Malak SF, Eagan J, Sepkowitz KA|date=August 2005|title=Risk factors for acquisition of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea among outpatients at a cancer hospital|journal=Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology|volume=26|issue=8|pages=680–4|doi=10.1086/502602|pmc=5612438|pmid=16156323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as ''C. difficile''.[16]

Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of ''C. difficile'', which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of "pseudomembrane", a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] [[Clindamycin]]-resistant ''C. difficile'' was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992.&lt;ref name="Johnson1999"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Samore MH, Farrow KA, Killgore GE, Tenover FC, Lyras D, Rood JI, DeGirolami P, Baltch AL, Rafferty ME, Pear SM, Gerding DN|year=1999|title=Epidemics of diarrhea caused by a clindamycin-resistant strain of ''Clostridium difficile'' in four hospitals|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=341|issue=23|pages=1645–1651|doi=10.1056/NEJM199911253412203|pmid=10572152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically dispersed outbreaks of ''C. difficile'' strains resistant to [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005.&lt;ref name="Loo_2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Loo VG, Poirier L, Miller MA, Oughton M, Libman MD, Michaud S, Bourgault AM, Nguyen T, Frenette C, Kelly M, Vibien A, Brassard P, Fenn S, Dewar K, Hudson TJ, Horn R, René P, Monczak Y, Dascal A|year=2005|title=A predominantly clonal multi-institutional outbreak of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality|journal=N Engl J Med|volume=353|issue=23|pages=2442–9|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa051639|pmid=16322602|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Enterococcus'' ===
Multidrug-resistant ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]'' and ''[[Enterococcus faecium]]'' are associated with [[nosocomial infection]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid18947320"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hidron AI, Edwards JR, Patel J, Horan TC, Sievert DM, Pollock DA, Fridkin SK|date=November 2008|others=National Healthcare Safety Network Team; Participating National Healthcare Safety Network Facilities|title=NHSN annual update: antimicrobial-resistant pathogens associated with healthcare-associated infections: annual summary of data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006–2007|journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol|volume=29|issue=11|pages=996–1011|doi=10.1086/591861|pmid=18947320|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strains include: [[penicillin]]-resistant ''[[Enterococcus]]'', [[vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']], and [[linezolid]]-resistant ''[[Enterococcus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK190420/|title=Enterococcal Infection—Treatment and Antibiotic Resistance|last=Kristich|first=Christopher J.|last2=Rice|first2=Louis B.|last3=Arias|first3=Cesar A.|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary|editor-last=Gilmore|editor-first=Michael S.|location=Boston|pmid=24649502|editor-last2=Clewell|editor-first2=Don B.|editor-last3=Ike|editor-first3=Yasuyoshi|editor-last4=Shankar|editor-first4=Nathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''===
{{Main|Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis}}
[[Tuberculosis]] (TB) resistant to antibiotics is called [[Multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis|MDR TB]] (multidrug-resistant TB). Globally, MDR TB causes 150,000 deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/antimicrobial-resistance-still-poses-public-health-threat|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Still Poses a Public Health Threat: A Conversation With Edward J. Septimus, MD, FIDSA, FACP, FSHEA, Clinical Professor of Internal Medicine at Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center|date=2013-04-17|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has contributed to this.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=LoBue P|year=2009|title=Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|journal=Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases|volume=22|issue=2|pages=167–73|doi=10.1097/QCO.0b013e3283229fab|pmid=19283912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an obligate pathogen that has evolved to ensure its persistence in human populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Co-evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Homo sapiens, Brites, D., &amp; Gagneux, S. (2015).|date=2013-04-17|pmc=4339235 | pmid=25703549|doi=10.1111/imr.12264|volume=264|journal=Immunol Rev|pages=6–24 | last1 = Brites | first1 = D | last2 = Gagneux | first2 = S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident in the fact that Mycobacterium tuberculosis must cause a pulmonary disease in order to be successfully transmitted from one person to another. Tuberculosis better known as TB has one of the highest mortality rates among pathogens in the world. Mortality rates have not seen a significant decrease due to its growing resistance to certain antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/perspectives/antimicrobial-resistance-still-poses-public-health-threat|title=Antimicrobial Resistance Still Poses a Public Health Threat: A Conversation With Edward J. Septimus, MD, FIDSA, FACP, FSHEA, Clinical Professor of Internal Medicine at Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center|date=2013-04-17|publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality|accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is years worth of research and many work hours that have been devoted to the creation of a vaccine, one still does not exist. TB has a very high level of virulence which is mainly due in part to the fact it is extremely transmissible. TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of [[streptomycin]] by [[Selman Waksman]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herzog H|year=1998|title=History of Tuberculosis|journal=Respiration|volume=65|issue=1|pages=5–15|doi=10.1159/000029220|pmid=9523361}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bacteria soon developed resistance. Since then, drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] have been used. ''M. tuberculosis'' develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. These types of mutations can lead to genotype and phenotype changes that can contribute to reproductive success therefore they can be passed on and evolve into resistant bacteria. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug. [[Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|Extensively drug-resistant TB]] (XDR TB) is TB that is also resistant to the second line of drugs.&lt;ref name="journals.lww.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gao|first1=Qian|last2=Li|first2=Xia|year=2010|title=Transmission of MDR tuberculosis|journal=Drug Discovery Today: Disease Mechanisms|volume=7|pages=e61|doi=10.1016/j.ddmec.2010.09.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' to [[isoniazid]], [[rifampin]], and other common treatments has become an increasingly relevant clinical challenge. Evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids.&lt;ref name="pmid2115217"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zainuddin ZF, Dale JW|year=1990|title=Does Mycobacterium tuberculosis have plasmids?|journal=Tubercle|volume=71|issue=1|pages=43–9|doi=10.1016/0041-3879(90)90060-l|pmid=2115217}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''M. tuberculosis'' lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in order to share plasmids.&lt;ref name="pmid2115217" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Louw GE, Warren RM, Gey van Pittius NC, McEvoy CR, Van Helden PD, Victor TC|year=2009|title=A Balancing Act: Efflux/Influx in Mycobacterial Drug Resistance|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|volume=53|issue=8|pages=3181–9|doi=10.1128/AAC.01577-08|pmc=2715638|pmid=19451293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mycoplasma genitalium''===
''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' is a small pathogenic bacterium that lives on the ciliated epithelial cells of the urinary and genital tracts in humans. It is still controversial whether or not this bacterium is to be recognized as a sexually transmitted pathogen. Infection with ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' sometimes produces clinical symptoms, or a combination of symptoms, but sometimes can be asymptomatic. It causes inflammation in the [[urethra]] ([[urethritis]]) both in men and women, which is associated with [[mucopurulent discharge]] in the urinary tract, and burning while urinating.

Treatment of ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections is becoming increasingly difficult due to rapidly developing multi-drug resistance, and diagnosis and treatment is further hampered by the fact that ''M. genitalium'' infections are not routinely detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suneta|first1=Soni|last2=Parkhouse|first2=Andy|last3=Gillian|first3=Dean|date=24 April 2017|title=Macrolide and quinolone-resistant ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' in a man with persistent urethritis: the tip of the British iceberg?|url=http://sti.bmj.com/content/early/2017/04/24/sextrans-2016-053077|deadurl=no|journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections|pages=sextrans-2016-053077|doi=10.1136/sextrans-2016-053077|accessdate=6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Azithromycin]] is the most common first-line treatment, but the commonly-used 1 gram single-dose azithromycin treatment can lead to the bacteria commonly developing resistance to azithromycin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yew|first1=H.

The same SNPs are thought to be responsible for resistance against [[josamycin]] which is prescribed in some countries.&lt;ref name="Jorgen S 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Unemo|first1=Magnus|last2=Jensen|first2=Jorgen S.|date=10 January 2017|title=Antimicrobial-resistant sexually transmitted infections: gonorrhoea and ''Mycoplasma genitalium''|journal=Nature Reviews Urology|volume=14|issue=3|pages=139–125|doi=10.1038/nrurol.2016.268|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Moxifloxacin]] can be used as a second-line treatment in case azithromycin is not able to eradicate the infection. However, resistance against moxifloxacin has been observed since 2007, thought to be due to ''parC'' [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]].&lt;ref name="Jorgen S 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theonlineclinic.co.uk/news/2012/12/20/MycoplasmaGenitaliumTreatmentChoices.aspx|title=Mycoplasma Genitalium Treatment Choices|website=www.theonlineclinic.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tetracyclines]], including [[doxycycline]], have a low clinical eradication rate for ''M. genitalium'' infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=J.S.|last2=Cusini|first2=M.|last3=Gomberg|first3=M.|last4=Moi|first4=M.|date=9 August 2016|title=2016 European guideline on ''Mycoplasma genitalium'' infections|journal=Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology|volume=30|issue=10|pages=1650–1656|doi=10.1111/jdv.13849|pmid=27505296|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few cases have been described where doxycycline, azithromycin and moxifloxacin had all failed, but [[pristinamycin]] was still able to eradicate the infection.&lt;ref name="Jorgen S 2016" /&gt;

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
{{Main|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}

''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membrane]]s and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] because of significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now "quite common" in hospitals{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

===''Streptococcus''  ===
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Strains of ''S. pyogenes'' resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Albrich WC, Monnet DL, Harbarth S|year=2004|title=Antibiotic selection pressure and resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes|journal=Emerg. Infect. Dis.|volume=10|issue=3|pages=514–7|doi=10.3201/eid1003.030252|pmc=3322805|pmid=15109426|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. ''S. pneumoniae'' is responsible for [[pneumonia]], [[bacteremia]], [[otitis media]], [[meningitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[peritonitis]] and [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name="pmid15109426" /&gt;

== Gram negative ==

===''Campylobacter''===
''[[Campylobacter]]'' causes diarrhea (often bloody), fever, and abdominal cramps. Serious complications such as temporary paralysis can also occur. Physicians rely on [[ciprofloxacin]] and [[azithromycin]] for treating patients with severe disease although ''Campylobacter'' is showing resistance to these antibiotics.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

===''Neisseria gonorrhoeae''===
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance in gonorrhea}}
[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae|''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'']] is a sexually transmitted pathogen that causes [[gonorrhea]], a sexually transmitted disease that can result in discharge and inflammation at the urethra, cervix, pharynx, or rectum.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt; It can cause pelvic pain, pain on urination, penile and vaginal discharge, as well as systemic symptoms. It can also cause severe reproductive complications.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

=== Gamma proteobacteria ===

==== Enterobacteriaceae ====
As of 2013 hard-to-treat or untreatable infections of [[Carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae|carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae]] (CRE), also known as carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), were increasing among patients in medical facilities. CRE are resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. Almost half of hospital patients who get bloodstream CRE infections die from the infection.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

=====''Klebsiella pneumoniae''=====
Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase ([[Beta-lactamase#KPC (K. pneumoniae carbapenemase) (Class A)|KPC]])-producing bacteria are a group of emerging highly drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli causing infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality whose incidence is rapidly increasing in a variety of clinical settings around the world. ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'' includes numerous mechanisms for antibiotic resistance, many of which are located on highly mobile genetic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hudson|first1=Corey|last2=Bent|first2=Zachary|last3=Meagher|first3=Robert|last4=Williams|first4=Kelly|date=June 7, 2014|title=Resistance Determinants and Mobile Genetic Elements of an NDM-1-Encoding Klebsiella pneumoniae Strain|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0099209|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=6|pages=e99209|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0099209|pmc=4048246|pmid=24905728}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carbapenem]] antibiotics (heretofore often the treatment of last resort for resistant infections) are generally not effective against KPC-producing organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Arnold RS, Thom KA, Sharma S, Phillips M, Kristie Johnson J, Morgan DJ|year=2011|title=Emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase-Producing Bacteria|journal=Southern Medical Journal|volume=104|issue=1|pages=40–5|doi=10.1097/SMJ.0b013e3181fd7d5a|pmc=3075864|pmid=21119555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====''Salmonella'' and ''E. coli''=====
Infection with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' can result from the consumption of contaminated food and [[Water pollution|polluted water]]. Both of these bacteria are well known for causing nosocomial (hospital-linked) infections, and often, these strains found in hospitals are antibiotic resistant because of adaptations to wide spread antibiotic use.&lt;ref name="Davies2010"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Davies J, Davies D|year=2010|title=Origins and Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance|journal=Microbiol Mol Biol Rev|volume=74|issue=3|pages=417–433|doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-10|pmc=2937522|pmid=20805405|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; When both bacteria are spread, serious health conditions arise. Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, with some dying as a result. Since 1993, some strains of ''E. coli'' have become resistant to multiple types of [[quinolone antibiotic|fluoroquinolone antibiotics]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Although mutation alone plays a huge role in the development of antibiotic resistance, a 2008 study found that high survival rates after exposure to antibiotics could not be accounted for by mutation alone.&lt;ref name="Adam2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Adam M, Murali B, Glenn NO, Potter SS|year=2008|title=Epigenetic inheritance based evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria|journal=BMC Evol. Biol.|volume=8|issue=|pages=52|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-8-52|pmc=2262874|pmid=18282299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study focused on the development of resistance in ''E. coli'' to three antibiotic drugs: ampicillin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid. The researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in ''E. coli'' developed because of epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. This was further supported by data showing that reversion to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. This could only be explained by epigenetics.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt; [[Epigenetics]] is a type of inheritance in which gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur, including [[DNA methylation|methylation of DNA]] and [[histone]] modification; however, the important point is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.&lt;ref name="Adam2008" /&gt;

Resistance to [[polymyxins]] first appear in 2011.&lt;ref name="Nature2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reardon|first1=Sara|date=21 December 2015|title=Spread of antibiotic-resistance gene does not spell bacterial apocalypse — yet|url=http://www.nature.com/news/spread-of-antibiotic-resistance-gene-does-not-spell-bacterial-apocalypse-yet-1.19037|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.19037}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easier way for this resistance to spread, a [[plasmid]] known as [[MCR-1]] was discovered in 2015.&lt;ref name="Nature2015" /&gt;

==== Pseudomonadales ====

====''Acinetobacter''====
''[[Acinetobacter]]'' is a gram-negative bacteria that causes pneumonia or bloodstream infections in critically ill patients. [[Acinetobacter#Treatment|Multidrug-resistant ''Acinetobacter'']] have become very resistant to antibiotics.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

On November 5, 2004, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reported an increasing number of ''[[Acinetobacter baumannii]]'' bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the [[Iraq]]/[[Kuwait]] region during [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and in [[Afghanistan]] during [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] were treated. Most of these showed [[multidrug resistance]] (MRAB), with a few isolates resistant to all drugs tested.&lt;ref name="pmid15549020"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Centers for Disease Control Prevention (CDC).|year=2004|title=Acinetobacter baumannii infections among patients at military medical facilities treating injured U.S. service members, 2002–2004|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5345a1.htm|journal=MMWR Morb.

=====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''=====
''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is a highly prevalent [[opportunistic pathogen]]. One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''P. aeruginosa'' is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of [[efflux (microbiology)|multidrug efflux pumps]] with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (e.g., ''mexAB-oprM'', ''mexXY'') and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.&lt;ref name="Poole2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poole K |title=Efflux-mediated multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria |journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=12–26 |year=2004 |pmid=14706082 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.00763.x |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''P. aeruginosa'' has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics. The study experimented with the ''P. aeruginosa'' [[biofilms]] and found that a disruption of relA and spoT genes produced an inactivation of the Stringent response (SR) in cells with nutrient limitation, which provides cells be more susceptible to antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nguyen D, Joshi-Datar A, Lepine F, Bauerle E, Olakanmi O, Beer K, McKay G, Siehnel R, Schafhauser J, Wang Y, Britigan BE, Singh PK |title=Active Starvation Responses Mediate Antibiotic Tolerance in Biofilms and Nutrient-Limited Bacteria |journal=Science |volume=334 |issue=6058 |pages=982–6 |year=2011 |pmid=22096200 |doi=10.1126/science.1211037 |bibcode=2011Sci...334..982N |pmc=4046891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47233">This is a list of '''longest prison sentences served''' by a single person, worldwide, without a period of freedom followed by a second conviction. These cases rarely coincide with the [[list of longest prison sentences|longest prison sentences]] given, because some countries have laws that don't allow sentences without [[parole]] or for convicts to remain in prison beyond a given number of years (regardless of their original conviction).

| Prisoner incarcerated for the longest time who was found to be innocent on retrial, and the longest serving prisoner in [[Maryland]]. Ford, a black man, was convicted for murder by an all-white jury in 1952, when he was 20, and again for an assault in 1975 supposedly committed while he was on parole. The second victim identified a different man as her attacker but the judge argued that both men looked alike enough. Ford, at the time the only person present at his first conviction who was still alive, was granted retrials in 2015 for both charges because he had not been informed of his right to appeal the sentences.

Reports regarding the '''longest recorded sniper kills''' that contain information regarding the shooting distance and the identity of the sniper have been presented to the general public since 1967. Snipers in modern warfare have had a substantial history following the development of long distance weaponry. As weapons, ammunition, and aids to determine [[Ballistics|ballistic]] solutions improved, so too did the distance from which a kill could be targeted. In mid-2017 it was reported that an unnamed Canadian special forces operator, based in Iraq, had set a new record of {{convert|3540|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}, beating the record previously held by British Corporal Craig Harrison at 2,475 m (2,707 yd).&lt;ref name= "Fife p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Fife|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Murphy p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Bunch p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Bunch|2017|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kalvapallé|first1=Rahul|title=Small but mighty: How Canada’s military produces some of the world’s best snipers|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3552281/snipers-canadian-military/|accessdate=June 24, 2017|publisher=Global News|date=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sniper technology==
Although technology such as electronics have improved, optical equipment such as rangefinders and ballistic calculators have eliminated manual mathematical calculations to determine elevation and windage, the fundamentals of accurate and precise long-range shooting remain largely the same since the early history of shooting, and the skill and training of the shooter and the shooter's spotter where applicable are the primary factors. Accuracy and precision of ammunition and firearms are also still reliant primarily on human factors and attention to detail in the complex process of producing maximum performance.

The modern method of long-distance sniping (shots over {{Convert|1,100|meters|mi|1|disp=or|abbr=on}}) requires intense training and practice. A sniper must have the ability to accurately estimate the various factors that influence a [[bullet]]'s [[external ballistics|trajectory and point of impact]], such as the shooter's distance from the target, wind direction, wind speed, [[air density]], elevation, and even the [[Coriolis effect]] due to the rotation of the Earth. Mistakes in estimation compound over distance and can cause a shot to only injure, or to miss completely.&lt;ref name="Plaster p. "&gt;{{harvnb|Plaster|1993|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any given combination of firearm and ammunition will have an associated value, known as the [[circular error probable]] (CEP), defined as the radius of a circle whose boundary is expected to contain the impact points of half of the rounds fired.&lt;ref&gt;"Circular Error Probable (CEP)," Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center Technical Paper 6, Ver 2, July 1987, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

If the shooter wishes to improve accuracy and precision, wishes to increase range or wishes to do all of these things, the accuracy of "estimates" of external factors must improve accordingly. At extreme ranges, extremely accurate "estimates" are required and even with the most accurate estimates, hitting the target becomes subject to uncontrollable factors. For example, a rifle capable of firing a 1/2 MOA (approximately 1/2" center to center of the two holes furthest apart) 5-round group (often referred to as "grouping") at 100 yards will fire a theoretical 12.5" group at 2,500 yards. Unless the group is centered perfectly on the target at 100 yards, the 2,500-yard group will be centered 25 times the off-center error at 100 yards. This example ignores all other factors and assumes "perfect" no-wind shooting conditions and identical muzzle velocities and ballistic performance for each shot.

USMC Gunnery Sergeant [[Carlos Hathcock]]'s confirmed {{Convert|2,500|yd|meters|abbr=on}} kill in the Vietnam War was primarily due to the enemy soldier stopping his bicycle on the spot Hathcock had fired at while sighting in his Browning M2 heavy machine-gun.

Devices such as [[laser rangefinder]]s, handheld meteorological measuring equipment, handheld computers, and ballistic-prediction software can contribute to increased accuracy (i.e. reduced CEP), although they rely on proper use and training to realize any advantages. In addition, as instruments of measure, they are subject to accuracy errors and malfunction. Handheld meteorological instruments only measure conditions at the location they are used. Wind direction and speed can vary dramatically along the path of the bullet.

==History==
The science of long-range sniping came to fruition in the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Carlos Hathcock]] held the record from 1967 to 2002 at {{convert|2286|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Scott p. 181"&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|2003|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He recorded 93 official kills.&lt;ref name="Gaijinass"&gt;{{cite web |ref=harv|date= May 6, 2010|url = http://gaijinass.wordpress.com/2010/05/06/1655/|title = The way of the Gun: USMC S/S|publisher = Gaijinass.com| accessdate = May 6, 2010 | last=Gaijinass| first= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After returning to the U.S., Hathcock helped to establish the Marine Corps [[Scout Sniper]] School at [[Marine Corps Base Quantico|Quantico, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Scott p. 283"&gt;{{harvnb|Henderson|2003|p=283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his success as a USMC scout-sniper during multiple deployments to Vietnam, Gunnery Sergeant Hathcock competed in multiple USMC shooting teams. Hathcock also won the 1966 Wimbledon Cup, which is earned by the winner of the U.S. 1,000-yard high-powered rifle National Championship. Even after being severely burned during an attack on an [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|Amtrac]] on which he was riding and his efforts to rescue other soldiers, and after being diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]], Hathcock continued to serve, shoot and instruct. In Vietnam, Hathcock also completed missions involving a "through the scope" shot which killed an enemy sniper specifically hunting him, and a multiple-day solo stalk and kill of an enemy general.&lt;ref name="Dougherty"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dougherty |first=Martin J |title=Sniper: SAS and Elite Forces Guide: Sniping skills from the world's elite forces |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j1Dm6EnU7mkC&amp;pg=PT40 |publisher=Amber Books Ltd |isbn=978-1-909160-38-5 |page=40 |quote=Upon reaching the target area he discovered that his shot had gone through the scope of the sniper's rifle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COBRA2004"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sasser |first1=Charles W. |last2=Roberts |first2=Craig |title=Crosshairs on the Kill Zone: American Combat Snipers, Vietnam through Operation Iraqi Freedom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQ-s4xBvCg8C&amp;pg=PA76 |date=July 1, 2004 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4165-0362-0 |page=76 |quote=Hathcock's bullet had gone through the cobra sniper's scope and entered his eye}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RiegertKaplan2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Riegert |first1=Keith |last2=Kaplan |first2=Samuel |title=The MANual: Trivia.

Hathcock's record stood until Canadian sniper [[Arron Perry]] of the [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] exceeded it with a shot of {{Convert|2,310|meters|yd|abbr=on}}. Perry held the title for only a few days, as another man in his unit (Corporal [[Rob Furlong]]) beat Perry's distance with a {{convert|2430|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} shot in March 2002. Perry and Furlong were part of a six-man sniper team during 2002's [[Operation Anaconda]], part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|War in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Global"/&gt;

Corporal Furlong's record was bested by a British soldier, [[Craig Harrison (sniper)|Corporal of Horse Craig Harrison]], of the Blues and Royals, [[Household Cavalry]], who recorded two {{convert|2475|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} shots (confirmed by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) in November 2009, also during the War in Afghanistan, in which he hit two Taliban insurgents consecutively.&lt;ref name="Smith p." /&gt; Harrison killed the two Taliban machine gunners with shots that took the 8.59&amp;nbsp;mm rounds almost five seconds to hit their targets, which were {{Convert|900|meters|yd|abbr=on}} beyond the L115A3 sniper rifle’s recommended range. A third shot took out the insurgents' machine gun. The rifle used was made by [[Accuracy International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/defence/10762782/Accuracy-International-the-gun-maker-of-choice-for-Britains-elite-marksmen.html|title=The company behind the rifle used by the world's deadliest sniper|last=Tovey|first=Alan|date=2 February 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, an unnamed sniper from Canada's Tier 1 special forces unit, [[Joint Task Force 2]], surpassed the 2009 record by over {{convert|1,000|meters|yd|abbr=on}}, with a {{convert|3540|meters|yd|0|abbr=on}} shot in the 
[[Iraqi Civil War (2014–present)|Iraqi Civil War]]. As with the previous two Canadian records, a [[McMillan Tac-50]] with [[Hornady|Hornady A-MAX .50 (.50 BMG)]] ammunition was used.&lt;ref name= "Fife p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Murphy p. "/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Bunch p. "/&gt;

==Confirmed kills {{convert|1250|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} or greater==
This list is not exhaustive, as such data is generally not tracked nor managed under any official procedure. For example, the [[Canadian Army]] 2002 sniper team that saw two soldiers ([[Arron Perry]]/2,310 m and [[Rob Furlong]]/2,430 m) set consecutive new records, also made a number of kills at {{Convert|1,500|meter|yd|abbr=on}} that are not counted here.&lt;ref name="Maclean.Furlong"/&gt; The list also shows that, in some cases, an armed force command may choose to withhold the name of the actual sniper for security reasons. The United Nations Security Forces, such as in the Balkans, also had one U.S. sniper (name withheld) attributed with a {{Convert|1,271|meter|yd|abbr=on}} shot.

While not on the list due to the range being less than the minimum distance used to compile it, Hathcock's second-longest confirmed kill was {{convert|1200|yards|m}} using a "standard" USMC sniper rifle chambered in .30-06 Springfield. At the time of Hathcock's service, snipers had essentially been eliminated from the USMC, and its sniper rifles were a hodgepodge mix of commercial [[Remington Model 700|Remington 700]] and [[Winchester Model 70]] rifles chambered for multiple cartridges. The major challenge for Hathcock and other scout-snipers was improving the performance and reliability of their rifles and ammunition.

'''New constitutionalism''' is derived from the classical [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] framework and represents a set of political policies that promote a new global order.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dierckx|first=Sacha|date=2013-12-01|title=After the Crisis and Beyond the New Constitutionalism?

Central ideas of neoliberalism have been advanced to create policies and practices to achieve [[global governance]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  New constitutionalism provides power to the private realm and limits power of state governance and public corporations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The transferring of power creates an informal self-regulatory setting allowing for the dismissal of public scrutiny and transparency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Constitutionalism and World Order|last=Gill|first=Stephen|last2=Cutler|first2=Claire|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-107-05369-4|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New constitutionalism has reshaped the structure of control to allow “locking in” mechanisms to occur to prevent intervention from the democratic realm and to enhance economic objectives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This protects markets from regional interference and allows global influence in order to promote [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Constitutionalism: International and Private Rule in The New Global Order|last=McBride|first=Stephen|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4426-0365-3|editor-last=McBride|editor-first=Stephen|location=Toronto|pages=21|editor-last2=Teeple|editor-first2=Gary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of new constitutionalism is the result of [[globalization]] and the growing need for [[global hegemony]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Institutions have gained power in regards to trade, mobility, and flexibility through the framework of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the [[European Union]] are all actors contributing to the power of global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

New constitutionalism as a political order emerged in the latter half of the 20th century and the term was coined by academic[[Stephen Gill (political scientist)|Stephen Gill]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  The need for economic constitutional change was the result of crisis in political order correspondingly to the [[Russian Revolution]] and the [[Cold War]] as well as the progress of [[globalization]] through technological means.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Since then the disciplinary has grown in acceptance due to the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crisis]] of 2007 and the need for largescale stabilization in its aftermath.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Theorists have subsequently developed the social and economic practices both in support and disagreement of the framework to provide a comparative outlook.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilbink|first=Lisa|year=2008|title=Assessing the New Constitutionalism|url=https://www.jstor.org.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/stable/20434076?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=40 [2]|pages=227–245|issn=0010-4159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
New constitutionalism formed in the 1980s as the result of a growing world order and the “worldwide market revolution.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The end of the [[Cold War]] represented an ideological shift and the need for transformation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This shift was reiterated by [[Margaret Thatcher|Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher]] declaring the depletion of [[socialism]] and the rise of [[conservatism]] and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  As society progressed it allowed for the evolution of capital mobility, [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporation]] and the expansion of the world market.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The [[Great Depression]] and the aftermath of [[World War II]] reflected the need for reform.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Reform would redirect economic and political practices, ensuring benefits for all through the creation of global institutions.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Falk, R. (2014). New Constitutionalism and geopolitics: notes on legality and legitimacy and prospects for a just new constitutionalism. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 295-312. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-liberal supremacy through the dominance of the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] allowed for geopolitical reconfiguration increasing the need for new political order.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Additionally the lack of consistency among nation-state principles and the constant interruption from democratic power influenced the need to provide sustainable long term economic goals by limiting [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches of government using [[Constitution|constitutional framework]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Cutler, A. Claire. (2016) "Transformations in Statehood, the Investor-State Regime, and the New Constitutionalism." ''Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies'' 23, no. 1: 95-125.&lt;/ref&gt; New constitutionalism has become prominent in the aftermath of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2007 global financial crisis]] as a result of the need to bypass formal trade rules and democratic controls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schneiderman, D. (2014).  How to govern differently: neo-liberal, new constitutionalism and international investment law. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 159-175. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Framework ==
There are four main [[Policy|policies]] to define new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The first represents the development of a constitutional structure for the global market that dictates the public, private and international powers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These international economic agreements or “[[constitution]]s” resemble political constitutions and thus ensure [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The economic power is being shifted from the national to the international as well as from the public to the private to provide growth and sustainability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Second is the separation of economic policies from domestic influence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This allows for capitalist markets to grow as well as extending the commodity form and the market forces.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;''' ''' This separation insulates economic policies from governing regulatory powers as well as the public demand for transparency.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Economic Liberation Movement|Economic liberation]] is usually accompanied by political backlash, by disconnecting these two dynamisms suppresses democratic involvement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[World Bank Group|The World Bank]] advocates for the restriction of democratic participation and limitations imposed in the economic realm by creating a hierarchical system of representation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Thirdly is creating “locking in” mechanisms which incorporate; laws, rules, regulations, procedures and institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This mechanism puts limitations on legislative and policy autonomy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Agreements are formulated to “lock in” [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] content through legal guarantees and sanctions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  These agreements are difficult, even impossible to change which makes economic policies autonomous.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lastly this process diminished the need for formal accountability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  New constitutionalism has created a flexible system giving privileges to [[Multinational corporation|international corporations]] and private entities creating a “double” legal standard.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This concept diminished the “watchdog” and gives the flexibility for self-regulation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   This instrument is based on the international gold standard of the [[19th century|nineteenth century]] which gave rights to investor to avoid certain jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Permitting deregulation of financial services and trade investment avoids popular pressures and limits the need for transparency.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Minimizing liability and ensuring private authority the economic sector becomes more efficient, functional and practical.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Cutler, C. (2011). The Privatization of Authority in the Global Political Economy''.'' Edited by McBride, S., &amp; Teeple, G. ''In'' ''Relations of global power: Neoliberal order and disorder''. (p.41-59). Toronto: University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|978-1-4426-0365-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutions ==
At the global and regional level institutions are implementing the new constitutionalism framework to advance [[global governance]] by upholding the rights of private corporations and promoting a free [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  These institutions policies will ensure [[economic growth]] at the global level.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Sinclair, S. (2014). Trade agreements, the new constitutionalism and public services. Edited by ''Cutler, A., &amp; Gill, S.'' ''In New constitutionalism and world order.'' Cambridge, United Kingdom; New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 179-195. {{ISBN|978-1-107-05369-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global ===
The [[World Trade Organization]] [[World Trade Organization|(WTO)]] is a prominent figure in governing the [[World economy|global economy]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Formally it was the responsibility of [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade|General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade]] built on [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] principles but lacked the greater power adapted through new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization]] represents a governing global entity which has adapted to the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] main purpose is to limit national interference in the global market and challenge any nation-state regulations that could be detrimental to the economy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Any economic alternatives that are proposed by nations can be discredited by the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] as well as restricting governments ability to implement policy in international jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] represents the freedom of markets and allowing investors to capitalize in a [[world economy]], by doing so provides protection to the private sector.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Stephen McBride describes the [[World Trade Organization]] as having “quasi-judicial and quasi-constitutional aura.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The judicial and constitutional supremacy highlights the difficulty in challenging the organizations because of lock in mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Regional ===
The [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] ([[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]]) is a considered a regional governing entity that encompasses the principles of new constitutionalism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Regan]] referred to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] as a “new economic constitution.”&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Constitution because the agreement provided restrictions on government intrusion, rights to certain actors and enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The binding agreement afforded rights to both foreign and domestic investor to protect the interests of private capital and corporations.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  By limiting government powers the agreement locked in private interests and reduced governments ability to expand or restore [[public service]]s in [[free trade]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Focus at the global level has resulted in hostility between the public and private realms within [[nation state]]s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This hostility creates a political struggle between the private sector who safeguard the rights of capital and the public who want to control [[capitalism]] politically, democracy and socially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The control is being denationalized and delocalized causing negative repercussions at state level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  New constitutionalism lacks political will and can have detrimental effects to global dignity and future generations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Dividing economic policies from domestic creates disturbances within the civil society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Human rights]], [[Environmental issue|environmental concerns]] and [[public service]]s are being devalued because of the lack of economic concern.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

New constitutionalism favours the [[Elitism|elitists]] providing preferential treatment and widening the [[Economic inequality|social gap]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[International financial institutions]], [[investor]]s and bond-raters are holding higher positions of authority than governments or nation-states furthering global supremacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There is an urgent need for surveillance, policy making power, regulations and transparency economic outcomes are not solely focused on monetary gain but [[Humanitarianism|humanitarian]] concerns as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The absence of accountability and democratic authority has led many countries to depart from the constitutional framework and reclaim their [[sovereignty]] as independent nations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Australia]] has begun to constrain the advancements of new constitutionalism while many [[South America]] states have begun to exit the global regime completely.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] have begun to form provisions to improve the democratic power within the global order and no longer allow for their governments to be immobilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''No Place to Hide: Edward Snowden, the NSA, and the U.S. Surveillance State''''' is a 2014 non-fiction book by American investigative journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Snowden’s Story, Behind the Scenes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/13/books/no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published on May 13, 2014 through [[Metropolitan Books]] and details Greenwald's role in the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures]] as revealed by the former [[National Security Agency]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref name='GuardMay1214'&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/12/glenn-greenwald-uk-arrest-me-edward-snowden-nsa|title=Glenn Greenwald: 'I don't trust the UK not to arrest me. Their behaviour has been extreme'|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 May 2014|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documents from the Snowden archive cited in the book are [http://www.glenngreenwald.net/#BookDocuments freely available online].

==Synopsis==
The book consists of five chapters; Contact, Ten Days in Hong Kong, Collect It All, The Harm of Surveillance, and the Fourth Estate, plus an introduction and an epilogue.
In the introduction Greenwald explains how his background as a blogger on surveillance practices of the American government attracted Edward Snowden's attention, and he summarizes the nature, legality, and evolution of such practices. Greenwald concludes by discussing how a global surveillance network has been created with the assistance of technology companies and the unique role of the internet in human history as a facilitator of such surveillance.

In the body of the book, Greenwald discusses how he became involved with the 2013 global surveillance disclosures. He began by traveling to [[Hong Kong]] to meet Edward Snowden, who had contacted Greenwald as an anonymous source purporting to have evidence of government surveillance. As Greenwald continued to investigate he uncovered more information that he later published, to much controversy. In the book Greenwald also discusses establishment media, which he states will traditionally avoid publishing anything that would put them at odds with the government and as such, are less helpful when it comes to the interests of the general public.

==Reception==
In his review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', law professor [[David D. Cole|David Cole]] called ''No Place to Hide'' an important and illuminating book but wrote, "It would have been more important and illuminating were Greenwald able to acknowledge that the choices we face about regulating surveillance in the modern age are difficult and that there are no simple answers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole|first=David|title=‘No Place to Hide’ by Glenn Greenwald, on the NSA’s sweeping efforts to 'Know it All'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-place-to-hide-by-glenn-greenwald-on-the-nsas-sweeping-efforts-to-know-it-all/2014/05/12/dfa45dee-d628-11e3-8a78-8fe50322a72c_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' gave a mostly positive review, stating that while the book "doesn’t offer an in-depth portrait of the leaker" it does serve as a good "primer" on "what was at stake when he downloaded the government’s most precious secrets onto a thumb drive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|title=Why Are You So Fearful, O Ye of Little Faith?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/books/2014/05/glenn_greenwald_s_book_no_place_to_hide_reviewed.html|work=[[Slate.com]]|accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was positively reviewed by [[Henry Porter (journalist)|Henry Porter]] in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=GuardMay14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/19/no-place-to-hide-review-glenn-greenwald-nsa-gchq-surveillance-edward-snowden-spying|title=No Place to Hide review|author=Henry Porter|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 May 2014|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porter said that he found "reacquainting myself with the details of surveillance and intrusion by America's NSA and Britain's GCHQ was simply shocking. As the stories rolled out last year, there was almost too much to absorb...Greenwald's book is a tough read if you find these things disturbing."&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt; Porter said that reading ''No Place to Hide'' he had wondered "...how we let the spies probe our lives with such inadequate controls, and how on earth we fell for the propaganda that this massive apparatus was there to protect, not control, us."&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt; Critically Porter felt that the book lacked "...a chart or timeline of the major revelations as well as a proper index. And I did feel the argument lost momentum in the middle..." concluding that "...on the whole this is a vigorously executed and important book."&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt; Porter reserved criticism for what he felt was a lack of appreciation by Greenwald of the importance of the efforts of [[Ewen MacAskill]] and his fellow ''Guardian'' writers in bringing the disclosures to publication.&lt;ref name=GuardMay14/&gt;

Glenn Greenwald received the 2014 [[Geschwister-Scholl-Preis]], an annual German literary award, for the German edition of ''No Place to Hide''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geschwister-scholl-preis.de/preistraeger_2010-2019/2014/index.php |title=Preisträger 2014: Glenn Greenwald |trans-title=Award recipient 2014: Glenn Greenwald |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=geschwister-scholl-preis.de |publisher=Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels – Landesverband Bayern e.V.

'''North America''' is a [[continent]] entirely within the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and almost all within the [[Western Hemisphere]]; it is also considered by some to be a northern [[subcontinent]] of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name=britannica-northamerica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/418612/North-America|title = North America|publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate = 3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/contnent.htm | title = Map And Details Of All 7 Continents |publisher = worldatlas.com|quote=In some parts of the world students are taught that there are only six continents, as they combine North America and South America into one continent called the Americas.|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bordered to the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the east by the [[Atlantic Ocean]], to the west and south by the [[Pacific Ocean]], and to the southeast by [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]].

North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers&lt;!--spelled out per WP:MOSNUM --&gt; (9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5% of the [[earth|earth's]] land area and about 4.8% of its total surface.
North America is the third largest continent by area, following [[Asia]] and [[Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/nalandst.htm|title=North America Land Forms and Statistics|publisher=World Atlas.com|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of continents by population|fourth]] by population after Asia, Africa, and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/nafacts.htm|title=North America Fast Facts|publisher=World Atlas.com|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 579 million people in [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in North America|23 independent states]], or about 7.5% of the world's population, if nearby islands (most notably the [[Caribbean]]) are included.

North America was reached by its [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|first human populations]] during the [[last glacial period]], via crossing the [[Bering land bridge]] approximately 40,000 to 17,000 years ago. The so-called [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian]] period is taken to have lasted until about 10,000 years ago (the beginning of the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic or Meso-Indian]] period). The [[Classic stage]] spans roughly the 6th to 13th centuries. The [[Pre-Columbian era]] ended in 1492, and the [[transatlantic migrations]]—the arrival of European settlers during the [[Age of Discovery]] and the [[Early Modern period]]. Present-day cultural and ethnic patterns reflect different kinds of interactions between [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]], [[Atlantic slave trade|African slaves]] and their descendants.

European influences are strongest in the northern parts of the continent while indigenous and African influences are relatively stronger in the south.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} Because of the history of colonialism, most North Americans speak English, Spanish or French and societies and states commonly reflect [[Western civilization|Western traditions]].

== Name ==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
[[File:Historisch Nordamerika.jpg|thumb|Map of North America, from 1621]]
[[The Americas]] are usually accepted as having been named after the Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] by the German cartographers [[Martin Waldseemüller]] and [[Matthias Ringmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/626894/Amerigo-Vespucci |title= Amerigo Vespucci |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vespucci, who explored South America between 1497 and 1502, was the first [[Europe]]an to suggest that the Americas were not the [[East Indies]], but a different landmass previously unknown by Europeans. In 1507, Waldseemüller produced a world map, in which he placed the word "America" on the continent of South America, in the middle of what is today Brazil. He explained the rationale for the name in the accompanying book ''Cosmographiae Introductio'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3bOg4Nroos4C |title=The Cosmographiæ Introductio of Martin Waldseemüller in Facsimile |others=Translated by Edward Burke and Mario E. Cosenza, introduction by Joseph Fischer and Franz von Wieser |editor-last=Herbermann |editor-first=Charles George |place=New York |publisher=The United States Catholic Historical Society |year=1907 |page=9 |quote={{lang-la|"Quarta pars per Americum Vesputium (ut in sequentibus audietur) inventa est, quam non video, cur quis jure vetet, ab Americo inventore sagacis ingenii viro Amerigen quasi Americi terram sive Americam dicendam, cum et Europa et Asia a mulieribus sua sortita sint nomina."}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|la|... ab Americo inventore ... quasi Americi terram sive Americam}} (from Americus the discoverer ... as if it were the land of Americus, thus America).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Waldseemüller, no one should object to the naming of the land after its discoverer. He used the Latinized version of Vespucci's name (Americus Vespucius), but in its feminine form "America", following the examples of "Europa", "Asia" and "Africa".

Later, other mapmakers extended the name ''America'' to the northern continent, In 1538, [[Gerard Mercator]] used ''America'' on his map of the world for all the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhmc.sunysb.edu/surgery/america.html |title=The Naming of America: Fragments We've Shored Against Ourselves |author=Jonathan Cohen |accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that the convention is to use the surname for naming discoveries except in the case of royalty and so a derivation from "Amerigo Vespucci" could be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=John |authorlink=John Lloyd (producer) |last2=Mitchinson |first2=John |title=The Book of General Ignorance |year=2006 |publisher=Harmony Books |isbn=978-0-307-39491-0 |page=95 |quote=New countries or continents were never named after a person's first name, but always after the second ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ricardo Palma (1949) proposed a derivation from the "Amerrique" mountains of Central America—Vespucci was the first to discover South America and the ''Amerrique'' mountains of [[Central America]], which connected his discoveries to those of [[Christopher Columbus]].

[[Alfred Hudd|Alfred E. Hudd]] proposed a theory in 1908 that the continents are named after a Welsh merchant named [[Richard Amerike]] from [[Bristol]], who is believed to have financed [[John Cabot]]'s voyage of discovery from England to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1497. A minutely explored belief that has been advanced is that America was named for a Spanish sailor bearing the ancient [[Visigothic]] name of 'Amairick'. Another is that the name is rooted in a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] language.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

== &lt;span id="Usage of the term"&gt;Extent&lt;/span&gt; ==

The United Nations formally recognizes "North America" as comprising three areas: Northern America, Central America, and The Caribbean. This has been formally defined by the UN Statistics Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/|title=UNSD — Methodology|last=Division|first=United Nations Statistics|website=unstats.un.org|language=en|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/#panel-11|title=UNSD — Methodology|last=Division|first=United Nations Statistics|website=unstats.un.org|language=en|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/#panel-12|title=UNSD — Methodology|last=Division|first=United Nations Statistics|website=unstats.un.org|language=en|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''North America'' maintains various definitions in accordance with location and context. In [[Canadian English]], ''North America'' generally refers to the land mass as a whole consisting of Mexico, the United States, and Canada, although it is generally ambiguous which other countries are included, and is mostly defined by context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/international_relations-relations_internationales/north_america-amerique_nord/index.aspx?lang=eng|title=The North American relationship|last=Government of Canada|first=Global Affairs Canada|website=GAC|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/usmca-aeumc/index.aspx?lang=eng|title=United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)|last=Government of Canada|first=Foreign Affairs Trade and Development Canada|website=GAC|access-date=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thebusinesscouncil.ca/issues/north-america/|title=North America – Business Council of Canada|work=Business Council of Canada|access-date=1 November 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States of America, usage of the term may refer only to Canada and the USA, and sometimes includes [[Greenland]]&lt;ref name="CIAGreenland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CountryReports"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eNotes"/&gt; and Mexico (as in the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]),&lt;ref name="CountryReports"&gt;{{cite web|title=Countries in North America – Country Reports |url=http://www.countryreports.org/maps/northamerica.aspx |publisher=Country Reports |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427050055/http://www.countryreports.org/maps/northamerica.aspx |archivedate=27 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trilateral&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Region |url=http://www.trilateral.org/go.cfm?do=Page.View&amp;pid=12 |publisher=The Trilateral Commission |accessdate=30 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021204534/http://www.trilateral.org/go.cfm?do=Page.View&amp;pid=12 |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="epa" /&gt;&lt;ref name=About.com /&gt; as well as offshore islands.

In [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Romania]], [[Greece]], and the countries of Latin America, the [[cognate]]s of ''North America'' usually designate a subcontinent of the Americas comprising Canada, the United States, and Mexico, and often Greenland, Saint Pierre et Miquelon, and Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mx.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562468/Norteam%C3%A9rica.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130015145/http://mx.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761562468/Norteam%C3%A9rica.html |archivedate=30 January 2009 |title=Norteamérica |trans-title=North America |language=Spanish|quote=In Ibero-America, ''North America'' is considered a subcontinent containing Canada, the United States, Mexico, Greenland, Bermuda and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six or Seven Continents on Earth|url=http://geography.about.com/od/learnabouttheearth/qt/qzcontinents.htm|accessdate=18 December 2016|language=English}} "In Europe and other parts of the world, many students are taught of six continents, where North and South America are combined to form a single continent of America.

North America has been historically referred to by other names. Spanish North America ([[New Spain]]) was often referred to as ''[[Northern America]]'', and this was the [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|first official name]] given to Mexico.&lt;ref name=AGN&gt;{{cite web|title=Acta Solemne de la Declaración de Independencia de la América Septentrional|trans-title=Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|url=http://www.agn.gob.mx/independencia/documentos.html|work=Archivos de la Independencia|publisher=Archivo General de la Nación|accessdate=8 July 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographically the North American continent has many regions and subregions. These include cultural, economic, and geographic regions. Economic regions included those formed by trade blocs, such as the North American Trade Agreement bloc and Central American Trade Agreement. Linguistically and culturally, the continent could be divided into [[Anglo-America]] and Latin America. Anglo-America includes most of Northern America, [[Belize]], and Caribbean islands with English-speaking populations (though sub-national entities, such as [[Louisiana]] and [[Quebec]], have large [[Francophone]] populations; in Quebec, French is the sole official language&lt;ref name=language&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html|title=Status of the French language|author=Office Québécois de la langue francaise|publisher=Government of Quebec|accessdate=10 November 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514153402/http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/english/charter/index.html|archivedate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Original French: http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/charte/charte/clflgoff.html --&gt;).

The largest countries of the continent, Canada and the United States, also contain well-defined and recognized regions. In the case of Canada these are (from east to west) [[Atlantic Canada]], Central Canada, [[Canadian Prairies]], the [[British Columbia Coast]], and Northern Canada. These regions also contain many subregions. In the case of the United States – and in accordance with the US Census Bureau definitions – these regions are: [[New England]], [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]], [[South Atlantic States]], [[East North Central States]], [[West North Central States]], [[East South Central States]], [[West South Central States]], [[Mountain States]], and [[Pacific States]]. Regions shared between both nations included the [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes Region]]. [[Megalopolis (city type)|Megalopolises]] have formed between both nations in the case of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and the [[Great Lakes Megaregion]].

=== Geologic history ===
[[File:NorthAmerica-WaterDivides.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Principal hydrological divides of Canada, the United States and Mexico]]

[[Laurentia]] is an ancient [[craton]] which forms the geologic core of North America; it formed between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago during the [[Proterozoic]] eon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dalziel |first=I.W.D. |year=1992 |title=On the organization of American Plates in the Neoproterozoic and the breakout of Laurentia |journal=GSA Today |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=237–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Shield]] is the largest exposure of this craton. From the Late [[Paleozoic]] to Early [[Mesozoic]] eras, North America was joined with the other modern-day continents as part of the supercontinent [[Pangaea]], with [[Eurasia]] to its east. One of the results of the formation of Pangaea was the [[Appalachian Mountains]], which [[Taconic orogeny|formed]] some 480 million years ago, making it among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. When Pangaea began to rift around 200 million years ago, North America became part of [[Laurasia]], before it separated from Eurasia as its own continent during the mid-[[Cretaceous]] period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merali |first1=Zeeya |last2=Skinner |first2=Brian J. |title=Visualizing Earth Science |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-41847-5|date=9 January 2009 }}{{page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rockies and other western mountain ranges began forming around this time from a period of mountain building called the [[Laramide orogeny]], between 80 and 55 million years ago. The formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] that connected the continent to South America arguably occurred approximately 12 to 15 million years ago,&lt;ref name="Origins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/50450-when-panama-land-bridge-appeared.html|title=Land Bridge Linking Americas Rose Earlier Than Thought|work=LiveScience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Great Lakes]] (as well as many other northern freshwater lakes and rivers) were carved by receding glaciers about 10,000 years ago.

North America is the source of much of what humanity knows about [[geologic time]] periods.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-american" /&gt; The geographic area that would later become the United States has been the source of more varieties of [[dinosaur]]s than any other modern country.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-american" /&gt; According to [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] Peter Dodson, this is primarily due to stratigraphy, climate and geography, human resources, and history.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-american"/&gt; Much of the Mesozoic Era is represented by exposed outcrops in the many arid regions of the continent.&lt;ref name="dinopedia-american"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodson |first=Peter |year=1997 |chapter=American Dinosaurs |title=Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs |editor1-last=Currie |editor1-first=Phillip J. |editor2-last=Padian |editor2-first=Kevin |publisher=Academic Press |pages=10–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant [[Late Jurassic]] dinosaur-bearing fossil deposit in North America is the [[Morrison Formation]] of the western United States.&lt;ref name="jurassicdistribution"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weishampel |first=David B. |year=2004 |title=Dinosaur distribution (Late Jurassic, North America)|editor-last1=Weishampel |editor-first1=David B. |editor2-last=Dodson |editor2-first=Peter |editor3-last=Halszka |editor3-first=Osmólska |series=The Dinosauria |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |pages=543–545 |isbn=978-0-520-24209-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pre-Columbian|Before contact with Europeans]], the natives of North America were divided into many different polities, from small [[Band society|bands]] of a few families to large empires. They lived in several "[[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas|culture areas]]", which roughly correspond to [[Geography of North America|geographic and biological zones]] and give a good indication of the main [[lifeway]] or occupation of the people who lived there (e.g., the [[Plains Bison|bison]] [[hunter-gatherer|hunters]] of the [[Plains Indian|Great Plains]], or the farmers of [[Mesoamerica]]). Native groups can also be classified by their [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|language family]] (e.g., [[Athabaskan languages|Athapascan]] or [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]]). Peoples with similar languages did not always share the same [[material culture]], nor were they always [[allies]]. Anthropologists think that the Inuit people of the high [[Arctic]] came to North America much later than other native groups, as evidenced by the disappearance of [[Dorset culture]] artifacts from the [[archaeological record]], and their replacement by the [[Thule people]].

During the thousands of years of native habitation on the continent, cultures changed and shifted. One of the oldest cultures yet found is the [[Clovis culture]] of modern [[New Mexico]]. Later cultures include the [[Mississippian culture]] and related [[Mound builder (people)|Mound building]] cultures, found in the [[Mississippi river]] valley and the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples|Pueblo culture]] of what is now the [[Four Corners]]. The more southern cultural groups of North America were responsible for the [[domestication]] of many common [[crops]] now used around the world, such as tomatoes and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. Perhaps most importantly they domesticated one of the world's major staples, maize (corn).

The earliest verifiable instance of [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]] by any European culture with the landmasses that geologically constitute the "mainland" of modern North America has been dated to the end of the 10th century CE – this site, situated at the northernmost extent of the island named [[Newfoundland]], is known as [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], where unmistakable evidence of [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement was uncovered in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Ingstad and A. Stine Ingstad, ''The Viking Discovery of America'' (2000), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the development of agriculture in the south, many important cultural advances were made there. For example, the [[Maya civilization]] developed a [[Maya script|writing system]], built [[Mesoamerican pyramids|huge pyramids and temples]], had a [[Maya calendar|complex calendar]], and developed the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] around 400 CE, a few hundred years after the [[Mesopotamians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-origin-of-zer | title = What is the origin of zero? How did we indicate nothingness before zero? | author = Robert Kaplan | publisher = Scientific American | date = 16 January 2007 | accessdate =19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mayan culture was still present in [[Yucatan Peninsula|southern Mexico]] and Guatemala when the [[Conquistadors|Spanish]] explorers arrived, but political dominance in the area had shifted to the [[Aztec Empire]] whose capital city [[Tenochtitlan]] was located further north in the [[Valley of Mexico]]. The Aztecs were conquered in 1521 by [[Hernán Cortés]].&lt;ref name=Grunberg&gt;Bernard Grunberg, ''"La folle aventure d'Hernan Cortés''", in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007 {{incomplete short citation|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Timeline of the European colonization of North America|British America|French America|Viceroyalty of New Spain|Russian colonization of the Americas}}

During the [[Age of Discovery]], Europeans explored and staked claims to various parts of North America. Upon their arrival in the "[[New World]]", the Native American population [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|declined substantially]], because of violent conflicts with the invaders and the introduction of European diseases to which the Native Americans lacked immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise History of World Population: An Introduction to Population Processes |last=Massimo Livi Bacci |first=Malden |place=Massachusetts |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2001 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-631-22335-1 |pages=42–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native culture changed drastically and their affiliation with political and cultural groups also changed. Several linguistic groups [[Language death|died out]], and others changed quite quickly. The names and cultures that Europeans recorded were not necessarily the same as the names they had used a few generations before, or the ones in use today.

Britain, [[Spain]], and France took over extensive territories in North America – and fought over them. In the late 18th century and beginning of the 19th, independence movements that sprung up across the continent, led to the creation of the modern countries in the area. The 13 British colonies on the North Atlantic coast declared independence in 1776, becoming the [[United States of America]]. Canada was formed from the unification of northern territories controlled by Britain and France. New Spain, a territory that stretched from modern-day southern US to Central America, declared independence in 1810, becoming the [[First Mexican Empire]]. In 1823 the former [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], then part of the Mexican Empire, became the first [[sovereign state|independent state]] in Central America, officially changing its name to the [[Federal Republic of Central America|United Provinces of Central America]].

The [[Gulf of Mexico]] is the largest body of water indenting the continent, followed by [[Hudson Bay]]. Others include the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and the [[Gulf of California]].

Before the Central American isthmus formed, the region had been underwater. The islands of the [[West Indies]] delineate a submerged former [[land bridge]], which had connected North and South America via what are now [[Florida]] and [[Venezuela]].

There are numerous islands off the continent's coasts; principally, the Arctic Archipelago, the [[Bahamas]], [[Turks &amp; Caicos]], the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], the [[Aleutian Islands]] (some of which are in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] proper), the [[Alexander Archipelago]], the many thousand islands of the British Columbia Coast, and Newfoundland. Greenland, a self-governing Danish island, and the [[list of islands by area|world's largest]], is on the same [[tectonic plate]] (the [[North American Plate]]) and is part of North America geographically. In a geologic sense, Bermuda is not part of the Americas, but an oceanic island which was formed on the fissure of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] over 100 million years ago. The nearest landmass to it is [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]]. However, Bermuda is often thought of as part of North America, especially given its historical, political and cultural ties to [[Virginia]] and other parts of the continent.
[[File:Moraine Lake.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moraine Lake]] in [[Banff National Park]]]]
The vast majority of North America is on the North American Plate. Parts of western Mexico, including Baja California, and of [[California]], including the cities of [[San Diego]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], lie on the eastern edge of the [[Pacific Plate]], with the two plates meeting along the [[San Andreas fault]]. The southernmost portion of the continent and much of the West Indies lie on the [[Caribbean Plate]], whereas the [[Juan de Fuca Plate|Juan de Fuca]] and [[Cocos Plate|Cocos plates]] border the North American Plate on its western frontier.

The continent can be divided into four great regions (each of which contains many subregions): the [[Great Plains]] stretching from the Gulf of Mexico to the [[Northern Canada|Canadian Arctic]]; the geologically young, mountainous west, including the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Great Basin]], [[Geography of California|California]] and [[Alaska]]; the raised but relatively flat plateau of the Canadian Shield in the northeast; and the varied eastern region, which includes the Appalachian Mountains, the coastal plain along the Atlantic seaboard, and the Florida peninsula. Mexico, with its long [[plateau]]s and [[American cordillera|cordilleras]], falls largely in the western region, although the eastern coastal plain does extend south along the Gulf.

The western mountains are split in the middle into the main range of the Rockies and the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|coast ranges]] in California, [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[British Columbia]], with the Great Basin—a lower area containing smaller ranges and low-lying deserts—in between. The highest peak is [[Denali]] in Alaska.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20120722022527/http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html United States Geographical Survey (USGS)] states that the geographic center of North America is "6 miles [10 km] west of [[Balta, North Dakota|Balta, Pierce County, North Dakota]]" at about {{Coord|48|10|N|100|10|W}}, about {{convert|15|mi|km|order=flip}} from [[Rugby, North Dakota]].

=== Canadian geology ===
Geologically, Canada is one of the oldest regions in the world, with more than half of the region consisting of [[precambrian]] rocks that have been above sea level since the beginning of the [[Palaeozoic]] era.&lt;ref name="Marianopolis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace |first=Stewart W. |url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/GeologyofCanada.htm |title=Geology Of Canada |series=The Encyclopedia of Canada |volume=III |place=Toronto |publisher=University Associates of Canada |year=1948 |pages=23–26 |via=[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/ Marianopolis College] |accessdate=1 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704145706/http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/GeologyofCanada.htm |archivedate=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's mineral resources are diverse and extensive.&lt;ref name="Marianopolis"/&gt; Across the Canadian Shield and in the north there are large iron, nickel, [[zinc]], copper, gold, lead, [[molybdenum]], and [[uranium]] reserves. Large diamond concentrations have been recently developed in the Arctic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/magazine/16-12/ff_diamonds_sb |title=Digging for Diamonds 24/7 Under Frozen Snap Lake |publisher=Wired |website=Wired.com |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Canada one of the world's largest producers. Throughout the Shield there are many mining towns extracting these minerals. The largest, and best known, is [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], Ontario. Sudbury is an exception to the normal process of forming minerals in the Shield since there is significant evidence that the [[Sudbury Basin]] is an ancient [[meteorite]] [[impact crater]]. The nearby, but less known [[Temagami Magnetic Anomaly]] has striking similarities to the Sudbury Basin. Its magnetic anomalies are very similar to the Sudbury Basin, and so it could be a second metal-rich impact crater.&lt;ref name="GH"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html |title=3-D Magnetic Imaging using Conjugate Gradients: Temagami anomaly |accessdate=13 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711184237/http://gdcinfo.agg.nrcan.gc.ca/app/3Dimaging/temagami_e.html |archivedate=11 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shield is also covered by vast boreal forests that support an important logging industry.

=== United States geology ===
The [[Continental United States|lower 48 US states]] can be divided into roughly five [[physiography|physiographic]] provinces:
# The American cordillera
# The Canadian Shield&lt;ref name="Marianopolis"/&gt; Northern portion of the upper midwestern United States.
# The stable platform
# The coastal plain
# The Appalachian [[orogeny|orogenic]] belt

The geology of Alaska is typical of that of the cordillera, while the major islands of Hawaii consist of [[Neogene]] [[volcano|volcanics]] erupted over a [[hotspot (geology)|hot spot]].

=== Central American geology ===
[[File:Tectonic plates Caribbean.png|thumb|right|{{legend|#FAD4AF|Central America rests in the [[Caribbean Plate]].}}]]

Central America is geologically active with [[volcanic eruption]]s and earthquakes occurring from time to time. In 1976 Guatemala was hit by a [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|major earthquake]], killing 23,000 people; Managua, the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in 1931 and 1972, the last one killing about 5,000 people; three earthquakes devastated El Salvador, one in 1986 and two in 2001; one [[2009 Costa Rica earthquake|earthquake]] devastated northern and central Costa Rica in 2009, killing at least 34 people; in [[2009 Honduras earthquake|Honduras]] a powerful earthquake killed seven people in 2009.

Volcanic eruptions are common in the region. In 1968 the [[Arenal Volcano]], in Costa Rica, erupted and killed 87 people. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lavas have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.

Central America has many [[mountain range]]s; the longest are the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]], the [[Cordillera Isabelia]], and the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]]. Between the mountain ranges lie fertile valleys that are suitable for the people; in fact, most of the population of Honduras, Costa Rica, and Guatemala live in valleys. Valleys are also suitable for the production of coffee, beans, and other crops.

North America is a very large continent which surpasses the [[Arctic Circle]], and the [[Tropic of Cancer]]. Greenland, along with the [[Canadian Shield]], is tundra with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|10|to|20|°C}}, but central Greenland is composed of a very large ice sheet. This tundra radiates throughout Canada, but its border ends near the Rocky Mountains (but still contains Alaska) and at the end of the Canadian Shield, near the Great Lakes.

=== Languages ===
{{main article|Languages of North America}}
[[File:Languages of the Americas.PNG|thumb|Languages spoken in the Americas]]
The dominant [[languages in North America]] are English, Spanish, and French. Danish is prevalent in Greenland alongside [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], and Dutch is spoken side by side local languages in the [[Netherlands Antilles|Dutch Caribbean]]. The term Anglo-America is used to refer to the [[English language|anglophone]] countries of the Americas: namely Canada (where English and French are co-official) and the United States, but also sometimes Belize and parts of the tropics, especially the [[Commonwealth Caribbean]]. Latin America refers to the other areas of the Americas (generally south of the United States) where the [[Romance language]]s, derived from [[Latin language|Latin]], of Spanish and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (but French speaking countries are not usually included) predominate: the other republics of Central America (but not always Belize), part of the Caribbean (not the Dutch-, English-, or French-speaking areas), Mexico, and most of South America (except [[Guyana]], [[Suriname]], [[French Guiana]] (France), and the [[Falkland Islands]] (UK)).

The French language has historically played a significant role in North America and now retains a distinctive presence in some regions. Canada is officially bilingual. French is the official language of the Province of Quebec, where 95% of the people speak it as either their first or second language, and it is co-official with English in the Province of [[New Brunswick]]. Other French-speaking locales include the Province of [[Ontario]] (the official language is English, but there are an estimated 600,000 Franco-Ontarians), the Province of [[Manitoba]] (co-official as ''[[de jure]]'' with English), the [[French West Indies]] and [[Saint-Pierre et Miquelon]], as well as the US state of Louisiana, where French is also an official language. Haiti is included with this group based on historical association but Haitians speak both [[Haitian Creole language|Creole]] and French. Similarly, French and French Antillean Creole is spoken in Saint Lucia and the [[Commonwealth of Dominica]] alongside English.

While the United States, Canada, and Mexico maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. There are also large cities in the Caribbean. The largest cities in North America, by far, are Mexico City and New York. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and two of three in the Americas. Next in size are Los Angeles, [[Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2013/03/05/torontos_population_overtakes_chicago.html |title=Toronto's population overtakes Chicago |work=Toronto Star |date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago, Havana, Santo Domingo, and [[Montreal]]. Cities in the [[sunbelt]] regions of the United States, such as those in Southern California and [[Houston]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], Miami, [[Atlanta]], and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], are experiencing rapid growth. These causes included warm temperatures, retirement of [[Baby Boomers]], large industry, and the influx of immigrants. Cities near the United States border, particularly in Mexico, are also experiencing large amounts of growth. Most notable is [[Tijuana]], a city bordering San Diego that receives immigrants from all over Latin America and parts of Europe and Asia. Yet as cities grow in these warmer regions of North America, they are increasingly forced to deal with the major issue of [[water shortages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cetron |first1=Marvin J. |last2=O'Toole |first2=Thomas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_VGAAAAMAAJ |title=Encounters with the future: a forecast of life into the 21st century |publisher=Mcgraw-Hill |date=April 1982 |page=34|isbn=9780070103474 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[urban agglomerations]] are observed at their largest and most productive in [[Detroit–Windsor]] and [[San Diego–Tijuana]] and experience large commercial, economic, and cultural activity. The metropolitan areas are responsible for millions of dollars of trade dependent on international freight. In Detroit-Windsor the Border Transportation Partnership study in 2004 concluded US$13 billion was dependent on the Detroit–Windsor international border crossing while in San Diego-Tijuana freight at the Otay Mesa Port of Entry was valued at US$20 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Detroit Regional Chamber |year=2006 |url=http://www.detroitchamber.com/detroiter/articles.asp?cid=7&amp;detcid=531 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321130504/http://www.detroitchamber.com/detroiter/articles.asp?cid=7&amp;detcid=531 |archivedate=21 March 2006 |title=Detroit/Windsor Border Update: Part I – Detroit River International Crossing Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Planning SD-TJ"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter IV Planning for the Future: Urban &amp; Regional Planning in the San Diego-Tijuana Region |publisher=International Community Foundation |url=http://www.icfdn.org/publications/blurredborders/documents/urbanch4.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=20 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723181848/http://www.icfdn.org/publications/blurredborders/documents/urbanch4.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

North America has also been witness to the growth of [[megapolitan area]]s. In the United States exists eleven megaregions that transcend international borders and comprise Canadian and Mexican metropolitan regions. These are the [[Arizona Sun Corridor]], Cascadia, Florida, [[Front Range Urban Corridor|Front Range]], Great Lakes Megaregion, [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast Megaregion]], [[Northeast megalopolis|Northeast]], [[Northern California]], [[Piedmont Atlantic]], Southern California, and the [[Texas Triangle]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagler, Yoav (2009). "Defining U.S. Megaregions." New York: [[Regional Plan Association]].{{full citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and Mexico are also the home of megaregions. These include the [[Quebec City – Windsor Corridor]], [[Golden Horseshoe]] – both of which are considered part of the Great Lakes Megaregion – and megalopolis of [[Central Mexico]]. Traditionally the largest megaregion has been considered the Boston-Washington, DC Corridor, or the Northeast, as the region is one massive contiguous area. Yet [[United States megapolitan areas#Megaregions and planning: A brief history|megaregion criterion]] have allowed the Great Lakes Megalopolis to maintain status as the most populated region, being home to 53,768,125 people in 2000.&lt;ref name=RPA08&gt;Regional Plan Association (2008).

In addition to the larger trade blocs there is the [[Canada-Costa Rica Free Trade Agreement]] among numerous other free trade relations, often between the larger, more developed countries and Central American and Caribbean countries.

The North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) forms one of the four largest trade blocs in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Regional Trade Blocs |url=http://ucatlas.ucsc.edu/trade/subtheme_trade_blocs.php |publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz |accessdate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its implementation in 1994 was designed for economic homogenization with hopes of eliminating barriers of trade and foreign investment between Canada, the United States and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |title=North American Free Trade Agreement |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/418784/North-American-Free-Trade-Agreement-NAFTA |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Canada and the United States already conducted the largest bilateral trade relationship – and to present day still do – in the world and [[Canada–United States trade relations]] already allowed trade without national taxes and tariffs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRS Report for Congress: United States-Canada Trade and Economic Relationship – Prospects and Challenges |url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RL33087.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Congress Research Service |last=Fergusson |first=Ian |accessdate=9 June 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query.php?url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/assets/crs/RL33087.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NAFTA allowed Mexico to experience a similar [[duty-free]] trade. The free trade agreement allowed for the elimination of tariffs that had previously been in place on United States-Mexico trade.

The Caribbean trade bloc – CARICOM – came into agreement in 1973 when it was signed by 15 Caribbean nations. As of 2000, CARICOM trade volume was US$96 billion. CARICOM also allowed for the creation of a [[CARICOM passport|common passport]] for associated nations. In the past decade the trade bloc focused largely on [[Free Trade Agreement]]s and under the CARICOM Office of Trade Negotiations (OTN) free trade agreements have been signed into effect.

Integration of Central American economies occurred under the signing of the Central American Common Market agreement in 1961; this was the first attempt to engage the nations of this area into stronger financial cooperation. Recent implementation of the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) has left the future of the CACM unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Central American Community and Market |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0811094.html |publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate= 3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Central American Free Trade Agreement was signed by five Central American countries, the Dominican Republic, and the United States. The focal point of CAFTA is to create a free trade area similar to that of NAFTA. In addition to the United States, Canada also has relations in Central American trade blocs. Currently under proposal, the [[Canada – Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CA4) would operate much the same as CAFTA with the United States does.

These nations also take part in inter-continental trade blocs. Mexico takes a part in the [[G3 Free Trade Agreement]] with Colombia and Venezuela and has a trade agreement with the EU. The United States has proposed and maintained trade agreements under the [[Transatlantic Free Trade Area]] between itself and the [[European Union]]; the [[US-Middle East Free Trade Area]] between numerous Middle Eastern nations and itself; and the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]] between Southeast Asian nations, Australia, and New Zealand.

=== &lt;span id="Infrastructure"&gt;Transport&lt;/span&gt; ===
{{main article|Transportation in North America}}
[[File:PanAmericanHwy.png|thumb|The full [[Pan American Highway]] (including South America), from [[Prudhoe Bay, Alaska]] to [[Ushuaia]], Argentina]]

The [[Pan-American Highway]] route in the Americas is the portion of a network of roads nearly {{Convert|48000|km|mi|abbr = on}} in length which travels through the mainland nations. No definitive length of the Pan-American Highway exists because the US and Canadian governments have never officially defined any specific routes as being part of the Pan-American Highway, and Mexico officially has many branches connecting to the US border. However, the total length of the portion from Mexico to the northern extremity of the highway is roughly {{convert|16000|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}}.

[[File:Class1rr.png|thumb|left|2006 map of the North American [[Class I railroad]] network]]

The First Transcontinental Railroad in the United States was built in the 1860s, linking the railroad network of the eastern US with California on the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast. Finished on 10 May 1869 at the famous [[golden spike]] event at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], it created a nationwide mechanized transportation network that revolutionized the population and economy of the [[U.S. West|American West]], catalyzing the transition from the [[wagon train]]s of previous decades to a modern transportation system.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/ |title = Ceremony at "Wedding of the Rails", May 10, 1869 at Promontory Point, Utah |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 10 May 1869 |accessdate = 20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although an accomplishment, it achieved the status of first transcontinental railroad by connecting myriad eastern US railroads to the Pacific and was not the largest single railroad system in the world. The Canadian [[Grand Trunk Railway]] (GTR) had, by 1867, already accumulated more than {{convert|2055|km|mi|abbr=on}} of track by connecting Ontario with the Canadian Atlantic provinces west as far as [[Port Huron, Michigan]], through [[Sarnia, Ontario]].

=== Communications ===
A shared telephone system known as the [[North American Numbering Plan]] (NANP) is an integrated [[telephone numbering plan]] of 24 countries and territories: the United States and its [[Insular area|territories]], Canada, Bermuda, and 17 [[Caribbean]] nations.

== Culture ==
Canada and the United States were both [[British America|former British colonies]]. There is frequent cultural interplay between the United States and English-speaking Canada. Greenland shares some cultural ties with the indigenous people of Canada but is considered [[Nordic Countries|Nordic]] and has strong Danish ties due to [[Danish colonization of the Americas|centuries of colonization by Denmark]]. Spanish-speaking North America shares a common past as former [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonies]]. In Mexico and the Central American countries where civilizations like the Maya developed, indigenous people preserve traditions across modern boundaries. Central American and Spanish-speaking Caribbean nations have historically had more in common due to geographical proximity.

Northern Mexico, particularly in the cities of [[Monterrey]], Tijuana, [[Ciudad Juárez]], and [[Mexicali]], is strongly influenced by the [[Culture of the United States|culture]] and [[American way|way of life of the United States]]. Of the aforementioned cities, Monterrey has been regarded as the most [[Americanization|Americanized]] city in Mexico.&lt;ref name="MonterreyFall"&gt;{{cite news |title=Special report: If Monterrey falls Mexico falls – Reuters |publisher=Reuters |date=1 June 2011 |last=Emmot |first=Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immigration to the United States]] and [[Immigration to Canada|Canada]] remains a significant attribute of many nations close to the southern border of the US. The [[Anglophone Caribbean|Anglophone Caribbean states]] have witnessed the decline of the [[British Empire]] and its influence on the region, and its replacement by the economic influence of Northern America. In the Anglophone Caribbean. This is partly due to the relatively small populations of the English-speaking Caribbean countries, and also because many of them now have more people [[expatriate|living abroad]] than those remaining at home. Northern Mexico, the Western United States and [[Alberta]], Canada share a [[cowboy]] culture.

==History==
The initiative for the creation of the Official World Golf Ranking came from the Championship Committee of the [[Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews]], which found in the 1980s that its system of issuing invitations to [[The Open Championship]] on a tour by tour basis was omitting an increasing number of top players because more of them were dividing their time between tours, and from preeminent sports agent [[Mark McCormack]], who was the first chairman of the International Advisory Committee which oversees the rankings. The system used to calculate the rankings was developed from [[McCormack's World Golf Rankings]], which were published in his ''World of Professional Golf Annual'' from 1968 to 1985, although these were purely unofficial and not used for any wider purpose (such as inviting players to major tournaments).

The first ranking list was published prior to the 1986 [[Masters Tournament]]. The top six ranked golfers were: [[Bernhard Langer]], [[Seve Ballesteros]], [[Sandy Lyle]], [[Tom Watson (golfer)|Tom Watson]], [[Mark O'Meara]] and [[Greg Norman]]. Thus the top three were all European, but there were 31 Americans in the top 50 (compared with 17 at the end of 2010).

The method of calculation of the rankings has changed considerably over the years. Initially, the rankings were calculated over a three-year period, with the current year's points multiplied by four (three in 1986), the previous year's points by two and the third year's points by one. Rankings were based on the total points and points awarded were restricted to integer values. All tournaments recognised by the world's professional tours, and some leading invitational events, were graded into categories ranging from major championship (whose winners would receive 50 points) to "other tournaments" (whose winners would receive a minimum of 8). In all events, other finishers received points on a diminishing scale that began with runners-up receiving 60% of the winners' points, and the number of players in the field receiving points would be the same as the points awarded to the winner. In a major, for example, all players finishing 30th to 40th would receive 2 points, and all players finishing 50th or higher, 1 point.

Beginning in April 1989, the rankings were changed to be based on the average points per event played instead of simply total points earned, subject to a minimum divisor of 60 (20 events per year). This was in order to more accurately reflect the status of some (particularly older) players, who played in far fewer events than their younger contemporaries but demonstrated in major championships that their ranking was artificially low. Tom Watson, for example, finished in the top 15 of eight major championships between 1987 and 1989, yet had a "total points" ranking of just 40th; his ranking became a more realistic 20th when based on "average points". A new system for determining the "weight" of each tournament was also introduced, based on the strength of the tournament's field in terms of their pre-tournament world rankings. Major championships were guaranteed to remain at 50 points for the winners, and all other events could attain a maximum of 40 points for the winner if all of the world's top 100 were present. In practice most PGA Tour events awarded around 25 points to the winner, European Tour events around 18 and JPGA Tour events around 12.

In 1996, the three-year period was reduced to two years, with the current year now counting double. Points were extended to more of the field, beginning in 2000, and were no longer restricted to integer values. Beginning in September 2001, the tapering system was changed so that instead of the points for each result being doubled if they occurred in the most recent 12 months, one eighth of the initial "multiplied up" value was deducted every 13 weeks. This change effectively meant that players could now be more simply described as being awarded 100 points (not 50) for winning a major. Beginning in 2007, the system holds the points from each event at full value for 13 weeks and then reduces them in equal weekly increments over the remainder of the two-year period.

At first only the Championship Committee of the Royal and Ancient used the rankings for official purposes, but the [[PGA Tour]] recognized them in 1990, and in 1997 all five of the then principal men's golf [[professional golf tours|tours]] did so. The rankings, which had previously been called the '''Sony Rankings''', were renamed the Official World Golf Rankings at that time. They are run from offices in [[Virginia Water]] in [[Surrey]], [[England]].

==Calculation of the rankings==
Source:&lt;ref&gt;[http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/OWGRPT12.pdf Structure of Ranking Points and Rating Values from January 1 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Simply put, a golfer's World Ranking is obtained by dividing their ''points total'' by the ''number of events'' they have played, which gives their ''average''. Players are then ranked; a higher average yields a higher rank.

===Event ranking===

The first stage in the calculation is the ranking of each event. For most events the ranking depends on the current world rankings of the participating golfers and the participation of the leading golfers from the "home tour".

A "world rating value" is calculated. Any golfer currently ranked in the world top 200 is given a rating value. The world No. 1 is allocated 45, the No. 2 is allocated 37, the No. 3 is allocated 32, down to those ranked between 101 and 200 who are allocated a rating value of 1 each. The maximum possible world rating value is 925 but this would only happen if all the top 200 golfers were playing.

A "home tour rating value" is calculated. The leading 30 golfers from the previous year's "home tour" are given rating values. Most tours use earnings lists for their top 30, but the PGA Tour currently uses the FedEx points list calculated after the playoffs. [[Men's major golf championships|Major championships]] and [[World Golf Championships|WGC]] events use the current world top 30 list. The home tour No. 1 is allocated 8 down to those from 16 to 30 who are allocated a rating value of 1 each. The maximum home tour rating value is 75 if all the top 30 players from the home tour are competing. The total home tour rating value is limited to 75% of the world rating value.

The world rating value and home tour rating value are added together to give a total rating value. This is then converted into an event ranking using a table. As examples, a total rating value of 10 converts to an event ranking of 8, a total rating value of 100 converts to an event ranking of 24, while a total rating value of 500 converts to an event ranking of 62.

[[Men's major golf championships|Major championships]] have a fixed event ranking of 100 points. For each tour, there is a minimum ranking for each event. In addition, most tours have a "flagship event" that is guaranteed a higher ranking.

Starting in 2012, several events that previously had not received any points, now do so: Sunshine Tour "Winter Series" – 6 points (72-hole events), 4 points (54-hole events), PGA Tour of Australasia "State Based and Regional Tournaments" – 6 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owgr.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=6653907&amp;itype=&amp;iCategoryID=0 |title=Official World Golf Ranking Board Announces Adjustments To Ranking System |date=July 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925161739/http://www.owgr.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=6653907&amp;itype=&amp;iCategoryID=0 |archivedate=September 25, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in July 2015, the four third-tier European tours receive points: 6 points for 72-hole events and 4 points for 54-hole events.&lt;ref name=july2015/&gt; In April 2016, the Korean Tour's minimum was increased from 6 to 9 points and the MENA Golf Tour was added.&lt;ref name=mena&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owgr.com/news/2016/april/press-release |title=OWGR Board Announcement |publisher=OWGR |date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2018, the Sunshine Tour Big Easy Tour will factor into the World Rankings, making it the 20th professional tour included in the OWGR.&lt;ref name=bet/&gt; For 2018, the European Tour-linked China Tour was added, expanding that total to 21. 

72-hole tournaments which are reduced to 54 holes retain full points, but if a tournament is reduced to 36 holes, its points allocation is reduced by 25%. 54-hole tournaments reduced to 36 holes retain full points.

[[OneAsia Tour]], whose events previously earned a minimum of 6 points, lost its eligibility for world ranking points in 2018.&lt;ref name=oneasia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owgr.com/news/2018/april/board-announcement |title=Board Announcement |publisher=OWGR |date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;'''Rank''' refers to the player's world ranking before the event.&lt;/small&gt;

===Player rankings===
Having calculated the ranking of the event, the ranking points of the players for that event can be calculated. The winner's ranking points are the same as the ranking of the event, so that major winners get 100 ranking points. The second place golfer gets 60% of this amount, 40% for 3rd, 30% for 4th, 24% for 5th, down to 14% for 10th, 7% for 20th, 3.5% for 40th to 1.5% for 60th. Players tied for a position share the points for those positions so that if, for example, two players tie for second place they would each receive 50%, the average of 60% and 40%.

A player's ranking points for an event must be at least 1.2. Players who would get less than this using the above formula get no ranking points. For example, if an event has a ranking of 10 only the leading 12 players (and ties) receive any ranking points since the player in 12th place gets 12% of the event ranking (i.e. 1.2). The player in 13th position gets no points. Where there is a tie for the final scoring place, those players are guaranteed to receive at least 1.2 points. Using the above example, if there were two or more players tied for 12th place, each would receive 1.2 points. The only exceptions to this system are in the major championships where all players who make the cut get a minimum of 1.5 ranking points.

===Adjusted rankings===
For the first 13 weeks after an event the player receives the full ranking points earned in that event. However, from then onwards they are reduced in equal weekly increments over the remainder of a two-year period. This gives priority to recent form. Each week the ranking points are reduced by a factor of 1/92 (approximately 1.09%) so that in week 14 only 98.91% of the ranking points are credited, continuing until week 104 when only 1.09% is credited. From week 105 the ranking points are completely lost.

===Ranking average===
The player's adjusted points for all events in the two-year period are then added together, and this total is divided by the number of events to give the average ranking. However, players are subject to both a minimum and maximum number of events over the two-year period.

If a player competes in fewer than 40 tournaments over the two-year period his adjusted points total is divided by 40 and not the actual number of events he has played in.

In 2010, a maximum number of tournaments was also introduced. The maximum number was initially set to 60 from January 2010 and was reduced by 2 every six months until it reached 52 in January 2012. This means that since 2012 only the player's 52 most recent tournaments (within the two-year period) are used to calculate his ranking average.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120913134247/http://www.owgr.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=6636299&amp;itype=&amp;iCategoryID=0 Official World Ranking Board Approves Introduction of Maximum Divisor] July 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting averages for all players are put into descending order to produce the ranking table. This means that the player who has obtained most cumulative success does not necessarily come top of the rankings: it is ''average'' performance levels that are important, and some golfers play substantially more tournaments than others. New rankings are released every Monday.

==Importance of the rankings==
A professional golfer's ranking is of considerable significance to his career. Currently a ranking in the World Top 50 grants automatic entry to all the [[men's major golf championships|majors]] and [[World Golf Championships]]; see table below. In addition, rankings are the sole criterion for selection for the International Team in the [[Presidents Cup]], while ranking points are one of the qualification criteria for the European [[Ryder Cup]] team. The rankings are also used to help select the field for various other tournaments.

&lt;small&gt;'''Top 10 since''' – indicates the date at which the player entered or last re-entered the top 10.&lt;br /&gt;'''Weeks''' – current number of consecutive weeks in the top 10.&lt;/small&gt;

Since the major revision of the rating method in September 2001, the highest points average as well as the largest lead in points average were set by [[Tiger Woods]] on September 16, 2007. After winning the [[BMW Championship (PGA Tour)|BMW Championship]] and [[The Tour Championship]] in consecutive weeks, he had an average of 24.36 and a lead of 14.73 points over [[Phil Mickelson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/archive/2007/owgr37f2007.pdf OWGR, Week 37, September 16, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tiger Woods]] holds the record for most weeks in the World Top 10, with 860. He is followed by [[Ernie Els]] (788 weeks) and Phil Mickelson (774 weeks). Woods had a record run of 736 consecutive weeks in the top-10 from April 13, 1997 to May 15, 2011 and then had a further run of 124 consecutive weeks in the top-10 from March 25, 2012 to August 3, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golftoday.co.uk/tours/rankings/OWGR_top_10_stats_1.html |title=Official World Golf Ranking - Top Tens |publisher=Golf Today |date=February 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dps.endavadigital.net/owgr/doc/content/2007%20Stats/86TO0810.pdf |title=69 Players Who Have Reached the Top-10 in World Ranking |publisher=Official World Golf Ranking |date=December 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=European Tour Official Guide 09 |edition=38th |year=2009 |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |chapter=Players who have reached the Top Ten in the Official World Golf Ranking since 1986 |page=558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of the "number one" ranking==

{{main|List of World Number One male golfers}}
The first official ranking list was published prior to the Masters in April 1986, with [[Bernhard Langer]] the first world No. 1 ranked player, ahead of [[Seve Ballesteros]], who had topped the unofficial [[McCormack's World Golf Rankings]] at the end of the previous year. Ballesteros briefly held the No. 1 spot after Langer, before [[Greg Norman]]'s worldwide success over the rest of that season made him the first year-end No. 1. Ballesteros took the No. 1 position back from Norman in 1987, and the pair exchanged the No. 1 position several times over the next two years. During 1990, [[Nick Faldo]] remained ranked just behind Norman despite winning three majors in two years (and more world ranking points in total than his rival, albeit having entered more events). As detailed in Mark McCormack's "World of Professional Golf 1991" annual, it was also the case (but less immediately apparent) that Norman had won a total of 14 events during the ranking period to Faldo's 10, and when the two had competed in the same tournament, had finished ahead of his rival 19 times to 11, so Norman's No. 1 position (on the new "average points" system) had some justification. Faldo did inherit the No. 1 ranking for the first time early in 1991.

In April 1991, a quirk in the way the rankings treated results from previous years meant that [[Ian Woosnam]], who had never won a major, took the No. 1 spot from Faldo on the eve of the latter's attempt to win the Masters for a third year in succession; as if justifying the ranking system, Woosnam—and not Faldo—won the tournament. Twelve months later, [[Fred Couples]] similarly took over the No. 1 ranking shortly before the 1992 Masters, then also went on to make that tournament his first major victory. Faldo's Open victory in 1992 lifted him back to the No. 1 position, and he held that spot until replaced by [[Nick Price]], who in 1994 became the first African ranked No. 1 after his back-to-back major victories that summer.

By 1996, Greg Norman had regained the top spot and ended 1996 and 1997 narrowly ahead of first [[Tom Lehman]], and then [[Tiger Woods]] and [[Ernie Els]] in the rankings, despite his rivals enjoying major victories in those years while he won none. Lehman, Els and Woods would all briefly become No. 1 during 1997, Lehman for a week – to date, the only player to hold the No. 1 ranking for just one week. In 1996, [[Colin Montgomerie]] also led the rankings in total points earned over the two-year period (but never on average points per event); in 1997 Els was top of a similar "total points" list. Those were the last occasions on which a player led on "total" points but not average points until 2016, when [[Dustin Johnson]] similarly had more points in total than the world number one [[Jason Day]]. Woods then finished 1998 narrowly ahead of [[Mark O'Meara]] even though the latter won two major titles that year while Woods won just once on the PGA Tour. In March 1999, [[David Duval]] became world No. 1 after winning [[The Players Championship]], his sixth victory in a twelve-month period that came before his first major victory (which would follow two years later at the Open Championship).

In 2000, Tiger Woods had an unprecedented season of success that saw him earn 948 world ranking points in a single calendar year, so many points that even had his 1999 points (which represented the previous single-season record) been totally discounted from the calculation, Woods would still have had a points average easily high enough to lead the rankings – and Woods would still have led at the end of 2001 even had he earned no further points that year. Tiger Woods dominated the No. 1 spot for the following five years, but when [[Vijay Singh]] won the [[PGA Championship]] in 2004 and with it took the No. 1 ranking, that change highlighted the fact that Woods had not won a major for over two years, and also the extraordinary success Singh had recently on tour had that had allowed him to overtake the American. Woods responded by winning the very next major, the 2005 Masters, and with it regained the No. 1 spot, which he would then retain for a further five years. Following knee surgery in the summer of 2008, Woods missed the entire second half of the year, while [[Pádraig Harrington]] won two major championships, to add to the Open Championship he won in 2007. Despite earning no further ranking points during his absence, Woods remained No. 1 on the ranking system in December 2008.

During 2010, there was much debate as to whether Woods' continued retention of the No. 1 ranking (which he held up until the end of October) was justified given his relatively poor form—Woods finished fourth in two major championships in 2010, but failed to finish in the top ten of any other events he entered. During the 2010 season, several of his rivals for the No. 1 spot - including Masters champion [[Phil Mickelson]] (who had won four majors since 2004 but had yet to reach No. 1 in the rankings), [[Lee Westwood]] (who had yet to win a major but had finished second in both the Masters and Open Championships in 2010), and then [[Martin Kaymer]] (who had won the PGA Championship among four worldwide wins)— each missed opportunities to win particular events that would have taken them above Woods, before Westwood finally became world No. 1 on October 31.

During 2011, the possession of the No. 1 ranking would be the subject of much discussion among European golf commentators as it passed from Westwood to Kaymer, back to Westwood and then in May to [[Luke Donald]], who took No. 1 spot by defeating Westwood in a playoff for the BMW PGA Championship. Donald, in becoming the fifteenth world No. 1, also became the first ever to reach No. 1 before having won or finished runner-up in a major championship in his career. Donald's position at the top of the rankings was justified by his consistency through the rest of the 2011 season – becoming the first golfer ever to win the money title on both the European and PGA Tours in the same season.

In March 2012, Donald lost the No. 1 position to [[Rory McIlroy]]; the pair then exchanged the No. 1 position a further four times in the following two months, so the volatility of the No. 1 ranking again became a source of comment. At the end of 2012, McIlroy had opened up a clear lead at the top of the rankings, following his second major victory at the PGA Championship and emulating Donald in leading the money lists on both sides of the Atlantic. However, by the end of March 2013, a resurgent Tiger Woods had returned to the top of the rankings, after adding three PGA Tour wins in 2013 to his three victories from 2012 while McIlroy struggled with his form following equipment changes. Woods then suffered a back injury that sidelined him for the early part of 2014, and in his absence, [[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]], winner of the 2013 Masters, became the 17th world No. 1 on May 18, despite not winning an event in 2014 to that date; he would win the following week to secure his No. 1 position and avoid following [[Tom Lehman]] as a one-week No. 1. He held the No. 1 position until August 3, when McIlroy regained the top spot by following his Open Championship victory with another at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. Following his second-place finish at the [[2015 PGA Championship]] (that followed earlier wins at the Masters and the U.S. Open), [[Jordan Spieth]] became the 18th world No. 1 on August 16, 2015, describing it as "as good a consolation prize as I've ever had". Over the following three weeks, the No. 1 spot passed back and forth between McIlroy and Spieth, due to the way each player's average points (which were almost identical) fluctuated (as their point weightings and events played divisors changed), until, on September 20, both were overtaken by [[Jason Day (golfer)|Jason Day]], the [[2015 PGA Championship]] winner, who became the 19th world No. 1 with victory in the [[BMW Championship (PGA Tour)|BMW Championship]], his fifth of the season. A week later, Spieth regained the No. 1 spot from Day after winning the Tour Championship (and with it, the FedEx Cup), and concluded 2015 as world No. 1, but Day's continued good form took him back to number one after winning the WGC Matchplay in March 2016. 

On February 19, 2017, [[Dustin Johnson]] became the 20th player to reach number one in the rankings following his victory at the [[Genesis Open]]. He would remain number one for over a year before being overtaken in May 2018 by [[Justin Thomas (golfer)|Justin Thomas]], who had won the PGA championship and four other events in 2017. Johnson regained top spot but was overtaken again in September 2018 by [[Justin Rose]], who had finished second at the Open and again in two FedEx Cup playoff events. Rose became the 22nd player to reach number one, and the fourth Englishman. Johnson regained the number one position from Rose but was replaced by a new number one for a third time in 2018 on October 21, when [[Brooks Koepka]] added victory in the [[CJ Cup]] to his two 2018 major titles.

==Overview==
The goal of the Pacific Health Summit is to connect science, industry, and policy for a healthier world. Traditionally, the main work of the Summit has been an annual meeting, where top decision makers convene to discuss how to realize the dream of a healthier future through the effective utilization of scientific advances, combined with industrial innovation and appropriate policies. In autumn of 2012 on the heels of its eight major conference, the Summit shifted its focus from an annual meeting to more targeted work that builds on the past themes and concrete outcomes. As it has since 2005, the Summit will continue to provide a year-round forum for world leaders to grapple with problems and solutions, share best practices, and forge effective collaborations.

==History==
The first Pacific Health Summit was held in Seattle, Washington in 2005 with foundational support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the [http://www.trff.org/ Russell Family Foundation].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/Summit-hopes-to-spark-talks-on-Earth-s-health-1162197.php "Summit hopes to spark talks on Earth’s health", The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, 12/19/2004]&lt;/ref&gt; It was the co-creation of 2001 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine winner [[Leland H. Hartwell]], businessman and philanthropist George F. Russell Jr., Co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation [[William H. Gates Sr.]], and Founding Director of the National Bureau of Asian Research’s Center for Health and Aging Michael Birt.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;[http://pacifichealthsummit.org/about/About_the_Pacific_Health_Summit.pdf About the Summit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302222048/http://www.pacifichealthsummit.org/about/About_the_Pacific_Health_Summit.pdf |date=2012-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NBR has been the Secretariat of the Summit since the inaugural 2005 conference. 

Birt, founding Executive Director of the Summit, stepped down from his role as NBR’s Center for Health and Aging Director in 2009, and from his role as Executive Director in 2012, handing the mantle to Claire Topal, the Summit's Managing Director, who ran the Summit and managed the team from 2009-2012. She now serves as Senior Advisor for International Health to NBR. Nualchan Sakchalathorn, the Summit’s Project Director, served on the Summit team from 2007-2012.

Building on Bill Gates Sr.'s strong personal support, in 2007 [[Tachi Yamada]], then President of Global Health at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, took on a decisive leadership role and formally established the Foundation as the Summit's third co-presenting organization. 

In 2008, the Wellcome Trust joined the Summit as the fourth official co-presenting organization, and Trust Director, [[Sir Mark Walport]], joined our Executive Committee. Both [[Sir William Castell]], Chairman of the Wellcome Trust, who has participated in the Summit since its first year, and Sir Mark provided crucial leadership as the Summit began its rotation in London for the annual meeting.

Peter Neupert, then Corporate Vice President for Health Solutions Strategy for Microsoft, and [[Craig Mundie]], Chief Research and Strategy Officer of Microsoft, consistently provided a private sector perspective to the Summit's strategic discussions. Additionally, GE Healthcare, through Bill Castell in 2005, has always provided critical advice and perspective, as well as the critical founding sponsorship for the annual meeting. 

Out of this initial foundation of leadership, the Summit grew into one of the world's premier global health gatherings every year. In 2012, eight years after the inaugural meeting, which was never designed to take place in perpetuity, global health is in an exciting new place. The Summit’s interactive format has proliferated, and decision-makers across all sectors and geographies are collaborating on all the critical global health issues the Summit sought to address: health technology, pandemic flu, MDR-TB, vaccines, malnutrition, maternal and newborn health, and many more. While the Summit is proud of eight years of transformational conversations, countless new friendships, and exciting partnerships, there is still much work to do – and so much momentum on which to build. NBR is looking forward and excited to build on the Summit’s legacy in the years to come.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11623">The '''pizza effect''' is a term used especially in [[religious studies]] and [[sociology]] for the phenomenon of elements of a nation or people's culture being transformed or at least more fully embraced elsewhere, then re-imported back to their culture of origin,&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | year=2003 | title = Action dharma: new studies in engaged Buddhism | editor1=Christopher S. Queen | editor2=Charles S. Prebish | editor3=Damien Keown | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-7007-1594-7 | page=33 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WP4RcKcEm2QC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%22pizza+effect%22}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or the way in which a community's self-understanding is influenced by (or imposed by, or imported from) foreign sources.&lt;ref name=white/&gt; It is named after the idea that modern [[pizza]] toppings were developed among [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]] [[History of immigration to the United States|in the United States]] (rather than in native Italy, where in its simpler form it was originally looked down upon), and was later exported back to Italy to be interpreted as a delicacy in [[Italian cuisine]].&lt;ref name="dandavats"/&gt;

Related phrases include "hermeneutical feedback loop", "re-enculturation", and "self-orientalization". The term "pizza effect" was coined by the Austrian-born [[Hindu]] [[Dashanami Sampradaya|monk]] and professor of Anthropology at [[Syracuse University]], [[Agehananda Bharati]]&lt;ref name=white/&gt;&lt;ref name=knott/&gt;&lt;ref name="dandavats"&gt;[[Steven J. Rosen]] (Satyaraja Dasa), [http://www.dandavats.com/?p=260 "The Pizza Effect"] (in the context of [[Krishna Consciousness]])

== Examples ==
The original examples given by Agehananda Bharati mostly had to do with popularity and status:
*The [[Apu trilogy]] films of [[Satyajit Ray]], which were flops in India before they were given prizes in [[Western countries]] and re-evaluated as classics of the [[Indian cinema]]&lt;ref name="expat"&gt;
{{citation | author=Agehananda Bharati | contribution=Indian Expatriates in North America and neo-Hindu Movements | year=1980 | title = The Communication of Ideas | editor1=Vinayshil Gautam | editor2= J. S. Yadava | publisher=Concept Publishing Company | page=245 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waWQ8mAUrC8C&amp;pg=PA245}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*The popularity in India of movements like those of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] and [[ISKCON]] based on their popularity in the west&lt;ref name="expat" /&gt;
*The popularity of [[yoga]], several [[List of Hindu gurus and saints|gurus]], and some other Indian systems and teachings following their popularity in the west&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation | year=1996 | title = An introduction to Hinduism | author1=Gavin D. Flood | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-0-521-43878-0 | page=267 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=%22pizza+effect%22}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
*The exalted status of the [[Bhagavad Gita]] in Hinduism, where, although it was always highly regarded, it gained its current prominence only following Western attempts to identify a single canonical "Hindu Bible"&lt;ref name="ab70" /&gt;

Analyst [[Mark Sedgwick]] wrote that [[Islamist terrorism]], and specifically [[suicide bombing]], can be seen as examples, beginning as isolated interpretations of the concept of [[shahid]], or martyrdom, then being re-exported to the greater Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Day of the Dead]] parade in Mexico City was inspired by an event in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', which was fictional at the time of the film's production. &lt;ref&gt;David Agren, October 30, 2016, The Gaurdian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/29/day-of-the-dead-parade-james-bond-mexico-city Mexico City's James Bond-inspired Day of the Dead parade gets mixed reviews], retrieved October 28, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founders of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott]], were influenced by Eastern religions, then placed their headquarters in [[Adyar, Chennai]], from where they spread their views within India.&lt;ref name="knott"&gt;{{citation | year=2000 | title = Hinduism: a very short introduction | author1=Kim Knott | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-285387-5 | page=78 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wv8XK_GU9icC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=wonders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Buddhist modernism]] or "Protestant Buddhism" was developed by Westerners, who according to scholar Stephen Jenkins, "mistook it for an indigenous Sri Lankan product", and they in turn influenced [[Sri Lankan Buddhist]] [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], who, along with the Theosophical Society, was instrumental in spreading Buddhism in both India and the West.&lt;ref name="blackships"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xvi}}

According to scholar Kim Knott, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] "was not very interested in religion until he went to London to study law, where he studied the [[Bhagavad Gita]] in English in [[Sir Edwin Arnold]]'s translation, and this deeply influenced his spiritual outlook."&lt;ref name="knott" /&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious thought of [[Averroes|Ibn Rushd]] (Averroes), which was taken up by 19th-century Europeans such as [[Ernest Renan]], and thereby regained popularity during the [[Nahda]], the Islamic renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Chicken tikka masala]], a [[British cuisine|dish created in Britain]], based on [[Indian cooking]], which then became popular in India.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/19/race.britishidentity Robin Cook's chicken tikka masala speech: Extracts from a speech by the foreign secretary to the Social Market Foundation in London] (April 19, 2001).

[[Teppanyaki]], a Western-influenced style created in Japan, popular in the U.S.

[[Salsa music]]: the first salsa bands were mainly [[Puerto Ricans]] who moved to New York in the 1930s.

[[Haoqiu zhuan]], a Chinese novel. James St. André, author of "Modern Translation Theory and Past Translation Practice: European Translations of the ''Haoqiu zhuan''", wrote that in China the novel was originally "considered second-rate fiction and stood in danger of being completely forgotten with changes in literary taste in the early twentieth century."&lt;ref name="StAndrep39"&gt;St. André, James. "Modern Translation Theory and Past Translation Practice: European Translations of the ''Haoqiu zhuan''" (Chapter 2). In: Chan, Leo Tak-hung (editor). ''One Into Many: Translation and the Dissemination of Classical Chinese Literature'' (Issue 18 of Approaches to translation studies). [[Rodopi (publisher)|Rodopi]], 2003. Start page 39. {{ISBN|9042008156}}, 9789042008151. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=o5oPBC2AfgAC&amp;pg=PA39 39].&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the fact there had been interest in translating the novel into English "gave life and fame" to ''Haoqiu zhuan'' and therefore affected its standing in China.&lt;ref name="StAndrep39" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholar David Miller wrote that Westerners were responsible for "…the renewed interest in the four [[Vedas]] and the [[Upanishads]], as texts in themselves apart from the endless number of commentaries that have been written by Indians to interpret and to systematize the texts," and that due to this interest, "Indian scholars have also served up that menu, often in a less appetizing way than their Western counterparts. In so doing they have missed the very life force or essence of Indian ethical traditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| year = 1981| author1 = Miller | first1 = D.| jstor = 40014933| publisher = Blackwell Publishing| issue = 2| pages = 186–198| title = Sources of Hindu Ethical Studies_ a Critical Review| journal = The Journal of Religious Ethics| volume = 9| doi = 10.2307/40014933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
Scholar Jørn Borup wrote about an "inverted pizza-effect", when a society's modification of another culture gets further re-modified by that same society, such as European philosophers including [[Martin Heidegger]] "appear to have been significantly inspired by [[Eastern thought]] - an Eastern thought itself presented through "[[Protestant]]" or [[Western culture|"Western" eyes]]. This transformation is naturally not a unique phenomenon in [[religious studies]], where interpretations, re-interpretations and inventions are seen as common characteristics of religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=2004 | title = Zen and the Art of Inverting Orientalism | author1=Jørn Borup | publisher=Walter de Gruyter | isbn=3-11-017698-X | page=477 | url=http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/9783110211702.3.451}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Jenkins noted that the feedback phenomenon could continue; in the case of pizza, he wrote that the return of pizza to Italy again influenced [[American cuisine]]: "...pizza-loving American tourists, [[Tourism in Italy|going to Italy]] in the millions, sought out authentic Italian pizza. Italians, responding to this demand, developed [[pizzeria]]s to meet American expectations. Delighted with their discovery of "authentic" Italian pizza, Americans subsequently developed chains of "authentic" Italian brick-oven pizzerias. Hence, Americans met their own reflection in the other and were delighted."&lt;ref name="blackships" /&gt;{{rp|81}}

Jim Douglas, familiar with Bharati's thesis, applied it to black blues originating in the United States before 1960. The music of Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, etc. went over to England, where it was embraced by other musicians (especially white men playing electric guitar). Then, this re-packaged blues came back to the US presented by the Rolling Stones, Cream, Led Zeppelin,  etc. in the late 1960s where it was embraced by baby boomers (who had never heard of Robert Johnson, etc.). Later, some of these American baby boomers discovered the roots of the British blues-rock in the recordings of the original American blues artists.

'''Population health''' has been defined as "the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group".&lt;ref name="pmid12604476"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kindig D, Stoddart G | date = March 2003 | title = What is population health? | url = http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/93/3/380.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 93 | issue = 3| pages = 380–3 | doi=10.2105/ajph.93.3.380 |pmid=12604476 | pmc=1447747}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an approach to [[health]] that aims to improve the [[health]] of an entire human population. This concept does not refer to animal or plant populations. It has been described as consisting of three components. These are "health outcomes, patterns of health determinants, and [[Population health policies and interventions|policies and interventions]]".&lt;ref name="pmid12604476" /&gt;  A priority considered important in achieving the aim of Population Health is to reduce health inequities or disparities among different population groups due to, among other factors, the [[social determinants of health]], SDOH. The SDOH include all the factors (social, environmental, cultural and physical) that the different populations are born into, grow up and function with throughout their lifetimes which potentially have a measurable impact on the health of human populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=39 Social Determinants of Health overview tab.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Population Health concept represents a change in the focus from the individual-level, characteristic of most mainstream [[medicine]]. It also seeks to complement the classic efforts of [[public health]] agencies by addressing a broader range of factors shown to impact the health of different populations.

==Healthy People 2020==

Healthy People 2020 is a web site sponsored by the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]], representing the cumulative effort of 34 years of interest by the Surgeon General's office and others. It identifies 42 topics considered [[social determinants of health]] and approximately 1200 specific goals considered to improve population health. It provides links to the current research available for selected topics and identifies and supports the need for community involvement considered essential to address these problems realistically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx Health People 2020]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The human role of economic inequality==

Recently, human role has been encouraged by the influence of population growth there has been increasing interest from [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] on the subject of [[economic inequality]] and its relation to the health of populations. There is a very robust correlation between [[Social status|socioeconomic status]] and health. This correlation suggests that it is not only the poor who tend to be sick when everyone else is healthy,  [[heart disease]], [[Peptic ulcer|ulcers]], [[type 2 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], certain types of [[cancer]], and [[premature aging]]. Despite the reality of the [[Socioeconomic status#health|SES Gradient]], there is debate as to its cause. A number of researchers (A. Leigh, C. Jencks, A. Clarkwest—see also Russell Sage working papers) see a definite link between economic status and mortality due to the greater economic resources of the better-off, but they find little correlation due to [[social status]] differences.

Other researchers such as [[Richard G. Wilkinson]], J. Lynch, and G.A. Kaplan have found that socioeconomic status strongly affects health even when controlling for economic resources and access to health care. Most famous for linking social status with health are the [[Whitehall Study|Whitehall studies]]—a series of studies conducted on [[civil servants]] in [[London]]. The studies found that, despite the fact that all civil servants in England have the same access to health care, there was a strong correlation between social status and health. The studies found that this relationship stayed strong even when controlling for health-affecting habits such as [[exercise]], [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]]. Furthermore, it has been noted that no amount of medical attention will help decrease the likelihood of someone getting [[type 1 diabetes]] or [[rheumatoid arthritis]]—yet both are more common among populations with lower socioeconomic status. Lastly, it has been found that amongst the wealthiest quarter of countries on earth (a set stretching from [[Luxembourg]] to [[Slovakia]]) there is no relation between a country's wealth and general population health{{ref|sci_amer_dec_2005}}—suggesting that past a certain level, absolute levels of wealth have little impact on population health, but relative levels within a country do.
The concept of [[psychosocial stress]] attempts to explain how psychosocial phenomenon such as [[Social status|status]] and [[social stratification]] can lead to the many diseases associated with the [[SES gradient]]. Higher levels of economic inequality tend to intensify social hierarchies and generally degrades the quality of social relations—leading to greater levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] and stress related diseases. Richard Wilkinson found this to be true not only for the poorest members of society, but also for the wealthiest. Economic inequality is bad for everyone's health.''' 
Inequality does not only affect the health of human populations. David H. Abbott at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center found that among many primate species, less egalitarian social structures correlated with higher levels of stress hormones among socially subordinate individuals. Research by [[Robert Sapolsky]] of [[Stanford University]] provides similar findings.

==Research==
There is well-documented variation in health outcomes and health care utilization &amp; costs by geographic variation in the U.S., down to the level of Hospital Referral Regions (defined as a regional health care market, which may cross state boundaries, of which there are 306 in the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chandra, A |author2=Skinner, JS | title= Geography and Racial Health Disparities, Chapter 16 of Critical Perspectives on Racial and Ethnic Differences in Health in Late Life. |year=2004|publisher=National Research Council|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6555551.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dartmouthatlas.org/data/region/| title=Data by Region, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is ongoing debate as to the relative contributions of race, gender, poverty, education level and place to these variations. The Office of Epidemiology of the [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]] recommends using an analytic approach (Fixed Effects or hybrid Fixed Effects) to research on health disparities to reduce the confounding effects of neighborhood (geographic) variables on the outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Schempf, AH, Kaufman, JS | title= Accounting for context in studies of health inequalities: a review and comparison of analytic approaches. | journal=Annals of Epidemiology |volume=10| issue= 10 | year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2012.06.105 | pmid= 22858050 | pages=683–690| url= https://zenodo.org/record/1258734 | type= Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The importance of family planning programs==
[[Family planning]] programs (including [[Birth control|contraceptives]], [[sex education|sexuality education]], and promotion of [[safe sex]]) play a major role in population health. Family planning is one of the most highly cost-effective interventions in medicine.&lt;ref name=Tsui&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsui AO, McDonald-Mosley R, Burke AE |title=Family planning and the burden of unintended pregnancies |journal=Epidemiol Rev |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=152–74 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20570955 |pmc=3115338 |doi=10.1093/epirev/mxq012 |url= | quote=International studies confirm that family planning is among the most cost-effective of all health interventions (80, 81).

==Population health management (PHM)==
One method to improve population health is population health management (PHM), which has been defined as "the technical field of endeavor which utilizes a variety of individual, organizational and cultural interventions to help improve the [[morbidity]] patterns (i.e., the illness and injury burden) and the health care use behavior of defined populations".&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, Michael.

== Healthcare reform and population health ==
Healthcare reform is driving change to traditional hospital reimbursement models. Prior to the introduction of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)]], hospitals were reimbursed based on the volume of procedures through [[fee-for-service]] models. Under the PPACA, reimbursement models are shifting from volume to value. New reimbursement models are built around [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|pay for performance]], a value-based reimbursement approach, which places financial incentives around patient outcomes and has drastically changed the way US hospitals must conduct business to remain financially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Revised Medicare ACO Program: More Options … And More Work Ahead|url = http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2015/06/16/the-revised-medicare-aco-program-more-options-and-more-work-ahead/|website = Health Affairs|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to focusing on improving patient experience of care and reducing costs, hospitals must also focus on improving the health of populations (IHI Triple Aim&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The IHI Triple Aim|url = http://www.ihi.org/engage/initiatives/TripleAim/Pages/default.aspx|website = www.ihi.org|accessdate = 21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

These factors all have the potential to increase earnings. Some states, like New York, have implemented statewide initiatives to address population health. In New York state there are 11 such programs. One example is the Mohawk Valley Population Health Improvement Program (http://www.mvphip.org/). These programs work to address the needs of the people in their region, as well as assist their local community based organizations and social services to gather data, address health disparities, and explore evidence-based interventions that will ultimately lead to better health for everyone. Following a similar approach, Cullati et al. developed a theoretical framework for the development and onset of vulnerability in later life based on the concept of "reserves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullati|first=Stéphane|last2=Kliegel|first2=Matthias|last3=Widmer|first3=Eric|date=2018|title=Development of reserves over the life course and onset of vulnerability in later life|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=2|issue=8|pages=551–558|doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0395-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantages to use the concept of reserves in interdisciplinary studies, as compared with related concepts such as resources and capital, is to strengthen the importance of constitution and sustainability of reserves (the “use it or lose it” paradigm) and the presence of thresholds, below which functioning becomes challenging.

The '''cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact''' is the corpus of changes to terrestrial science, technology, religion, politics, and ecosystems resulting from contact with an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[civilization]]. It is closely related to the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI), which attempts to locate intelligent life as opposed to analyzing the implications of contact with that life.

The potential changes from extraterrestrial contact could vary greatly in magnitude and type, based on the extraterrestrial civilization's level of technological advancement, degree of benevolence or malevolence, and level of mutual comprehension between itself and humanity.&lt;ref name=ptrsa-2010 /&gt; The medium through which humanity is contacted, be it electromagnetic radiation, direct physical interaction, extraterrestrial artefact, or otherwise, may also influence the results of contact. Incorporating these factors, various systems have been created to assess the implications of extraterrestrial contact.

The implications of extraterrestrial contact, particularly with a technologically superior civilization, have often been likened to the meeting of two vastly different human cultures on Earth, a historical precedent being the [[Columbian Exchange]]. Such meetings have generally led to the destruction of the civilization receiving contact (as opposed to the "contactor", which initiates contact), and therefore destruction of human civilization is a possible outcome.&lt;ref name=daily-galaxy-1/&gt; Extraterrestrial contact is also analogous to the numerous encounters between non-human native and invasive species occupying the same ecological niche.&lt;ref name=The-Space-Review&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3240/1|title=Stranger Danger|publisher=The Space Review|archivedate=16 May 2017|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the absence of verified public contact to date means tragic consequences are still largely speculative.&lt;!--All lead material is supported by sources within the body of the article.--&gt;&lt;!--This page does not deal with UFOlogy, conspiracy theories, exopolitics (whose page here was deleted), or anything similar.--&gt;

Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. [[Project Cyclops]] was commissioned by [[NASA]] in the 1970s to investigate the most effective way to search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources,&lt;ref name=phys-imp-1&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Physics of the Impossible|Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time Travel]]|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|author=Kaku, Michio|date=2009|isbn=0-307-27882-4|chapter=Extraterrestrials and UFOs|pages=126–153}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of [[Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]] (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept.

===Impact assessment===
{{Anchor|Systems for the assessment of the potential impact of extraterrestrial contact}}

The implications of extraterrestrial contact depend on the method of discovery, the nature of the extraterrestrial beings, and their location relative to the Earth.&lt;ref name=almar-2011&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2011AcAau..68..358A|title=The discovery of ETI as a high-consequence, low-probability event|author1=Almár|first1=Iván|last2=Tarter|first2=Jill|volume=68|date=2011|pages=358–361|journal=Acta Astronautica|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2009.07.007|issue=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering these factors, the [[Rio Scale]] has been devised in order to provide a more quantitative picture of the results of extraterrestrial contact.&lt;ref name=almar-2011 /&gt; More specifically, the scale gauges whether communication was conducted through radio, the information content of any messages, and whether discovery arose from a deliberately beamed message (and if so, whether the detection was the result of a specialized SETI effort or through general astronomical observations) or by the detection of occurrences such as radiation leakage from astroengineering installations.&lt;ref name=almar-1995&gt;{{cite conference|bibcode=1995ASPC...74..499A|title=The Consequences of a Discovery: Different Scenarios|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995ASPC...74..499A|author=Almár, Iván|orig-year=1993|date=1995|conference=''Progress in the Search for Extraterrestrial Life''|series=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series|editor=Seth Shostak|publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|isbn=0-937707-93-7|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA5bFScR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of whether or not a purported extraterrestrial signal has been confirmed as authentic, and with what degree of confidence, will also influence the impact of the contact.&lt;ref name=almar-1995 /&gt; The Rio Scale was modified in 2011 to include a consideration of whether contact was achieved through an interstellar message or through a physical extraterrestrial artifact, with a suggestion that the definition of ''artifact'' be expanded to include "[[technosignature]]s", including all indications of intelligent extraterrestrial life other than the interstellar radio messages sought by traditional SETI programs.&lt;ref name=almar-2011-2&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2011.05.036|author=Almár, Iván|volume=69|date=2011|pages=899–904|title=SETI and astrobiology: The Rio Scale and the London Scale|journal=Acta Astronautica|issue=9–10|bibcode = 2011AcAau..69..899A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by astronomer [[Steven J. Dick]] at the [[United States Naval Observatory]] considered the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact by analyzing events of similar significance in the [[history of science]].&lt;ref name=dick-1993&gt;{{cite conference|bibcode=1995ASPC...74..521D|title=Consequences of Success in SETI: Lessons from the History of Science|author1=Dick|first1=S.|volume=74|date=1995|pages=521–532|series=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series|conference=A New Era in Bioastronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study argues that the impact would be most strongly influenced by the information content of the message received, if any.&lt;ref name=dick-1993 /&gt; It distinguishes short-term and long-term impact.&lt;ref name=dick-1993 /&gt; Seeing radio-based contact as a more plausible scenario than a visit from extraterrestrial spacecraft, the study rejects the commonly stated analogy of [[European colonization of the Americas]] as an accurate model for information-only contact, preferring events of profound scientific significance, such as the [[Copernican Revolution|Copernican]] and [[History of evolutionary thought|Darwinian]] revolutions, as more predictive of how humanity might be impacted by extraterrestrial contact.&lt;ref name=dick-1993 /&gt;

The physical distance between the two civilizations has also been used to assess the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact. Historical examples show that the greater the distance, the less the contacted civilization perceives a threat to itself and its culture.&lt;ref name=schetsche-2005 /&gt; Therefore, contact occurring within the Solar System, and especially in the immediate vicinity of Earth, is likely to be the most disruptive and negative for humanity.&lt;ref name=schetsche-2005 /&gt; On a smaller scale, people close to the epicenter of contact would experience a greater effect than would those living farther away, and a contact having multiple epicenters would cause a greater shock than one with a single epicenter.&lt;ref name=schetsche-2005 /&gt; Space scientists [[Martin Dominik]] and [[John Zarnecki]] state that in the absence of any data on the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence, one must predict the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact on the basis of generalizations encompassing all life and of analogies with history.&lt;ref name=dominik-zarnecki-2011&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dominik, Martin|author2=John C. Zarnecki|last-author-amp=yes|url=http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/369/1936/499|title=The detection of extra-terrestrial life and the consequences for science and society|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A|doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0236|date=2011|volume=369|issue=1936|pages=499–507|bibcode = 2011RSPTA.369..499D }} ([http://royalsociety.org/events/2010/extra-terrestrial-life/ audio supplement])&lt;/ref&gt;

The beliefs of the general public about the effect of extraterrestrial contact have also been studied. A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides [[factor analysis]] of responses to questions about, ''[[wikt:inter alia|inter alia]]'', the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it.&lt;ref name=vakoch-2000&gt;{{cite journal|title=Reactions to Receipt of a Message from Extraterrestrial Intelligence: A Cross-Cultural Empirical Study|author=Vakoch, D.A.|author2=Y.

The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants{{which|date=September 2015}} took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.&lt;ref name=vakoch-2000 /&gt;

===Post-detection protocols===
{{main|Post-detection protocol}}

Various protocols have been drawn up detailing a course of action for scientists and governments after extraterrestrial contact. Post-detection protocols must address three issues: what to do in the first weeks after receiving a message from an extraterrestrial source; whether or not to send a reply; and analyzing the long-term consequences of the message received.&lt;ref name=billingham-1991-1&gt;{{cite conference| bibcode=1993ASPC...47..417B| title=SETI Post-Detection Protocols: What Do You Do After Detecting a Signal?| publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific| author=Billingham, John| editor=Shostak, Seth| booktitle=ASP Conference Series|date=August 1991| conference=Third Decennial US-USSR Conference on SETI| location=University of California, Santa Cruz| pages=417–426}}&lt;/ref&gt; No post-detection protocol, however, is binding under national or international law,&lt;ref name=dominik-zarnecki-2011 /&gt; and Dominik and Zarnecki consider the protocols likely to be ignored if contact occurs.&lt;ref name=dominik-zarnecki-2011 /&gt;

One of the first post-detection protocols, the "Declaration of Principles for Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence", was created by the SETI Permanent Committee of the [[International Academy of Astronautics]] (IAA).&lt;ref name=billingham-1991-1 /&gt; It was later approved by the Board of Trustees of the IAA and by the International Institute of Space Law,&lt;ref name=billingham-1991-1 /&gt; and still later by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU), the [[Committee on Space Research]], the [[International Union of Radio Science]], and others.&lt;ref name=billingham-1991-1 /&gt; It was subsequently endorsed by most researchers involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,&lt;ref name=norris-2004&gt;{{cite conference|title=Bioastronomy 2002: Life Among the Stars|publisher=International Astronomical Union|author=Norris, Ray|editor=Norris, R|editor2=F.

The Declaration of Principles contains the following broad provisions:&lt;ref name=setileague-1997&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setileague.org/general/protocol.htm|title=Declaration of Principles for Activities Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence|publisher=The SETI League, Inc.|work=setileague.org|date=17 August 1997|author=Permanent SETI Committee, International Academy of Astronautics|accessdate=2 July 2012|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA5kpSkW}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Any person or organization detecting a signal should try to verify that it is likely to be of intelligent origin before announcing it.
# The discoverer of a signal should, for the purposes of independent verification, communicate with other signatories of the Declaration before making a public announcement, and should also inform their national authorities.
# Once a given astronomical observation has been determined to be a credible extraterrestrial signal, the astronomical community should be informed through the [[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams]] of the IAU. The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] and various other global scientific unions should also be informed.
# Following confirmation of an observation's extraterrestrial origin, news of the discovery should be made public. The discoverer has the right to make the first public announcement.
# All data confirming the discovery should be published to the international scientific community and stored in an accessible form as permanently as possible.
# Should evidence for extraterrestrial intelligence take the form of electromagnetic signals, the Secretary-General of the [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) should be contacted, and may request in the next ITU Weekly Circular to minimize terrestrial use of the [[electromagnetic spectrum|electromagnetic frequency bands]] in which the signal was detected.
# Neither the discoverer nor anyone else should respond to an observed extraterrestrial intelligence; doing so requires international agreement under separate procedures.
# The SETI Permanent Committee of the IAA and Commission 51 of the IAU should continually review procedures regarding detection of extraterrestrial intelligence and management of data related to such discoveries. A committee comprising members from various international scientific unions, and other bodies designated by the committee, should regulate continued SETI research.

A separate "Proposed Agreement on the Sending of Communications to Extraterrestrial Intelligence" was subsequently created.&lt;ref name=michaud-1991&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/009457659290114X|title=An international agreement concerning the detection of extraterrestrial intelligence|author=Michaud, Michael A.

[[Paul Davies]], a member of the SETI Post-Detection Taskgroup, has stated that post-detection protocols, calling for international consultation before taking any major steps regarding the detection, are unlikely to be followed by astronomers, who would put the advancement of their careers over the word of a protocol that is not part of national or international law.&lt;ref name=davies-2012&gt;{{cite news |url=http://failuremag.com/index.php/feature/article/if_et_calls_who_answers/|title=If ET Calls, Who Answers?|work=[[Failure Magazine]] |agency=Failure Magazine LLC|accessdate=2 July 2012|author=Zasky, Jason|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA60bA5i}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contact scenarios and considerations==
Scientific literature and [[science fiction]] have put forward various models of the ways in which extraterrestrial and human civilizations might interact.

[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|250px|An advanced, friendly extraterrestrial civilization might help humanity to eliminate risks that could destroy its fledgling civilization.|alt=An image of the explosion of the nuclear bomb Ivy Mike.]]Futurist [[Allen Tough]] suggests that an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization, recalling its own past of war and plunder and knowing that it possesses superweapons that could destroy it, would be likely to try to help humans rather than to destroy them.&lt;ref name=tough-1986&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ieti.org/articles/future.pdf|title=What Role will Extraterrestrials Play in Humanity's Future?|author=Tough, Allen|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|date=1986|volume=39|pages=491–498|bibcode=1986JBIS...39..491T|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6J12kR}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identifies three approaches that a friendly civilization might take to help humanity:&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt;
* Intervention only to avert catastrophe: this would involve occasional limited intervention to stop events that could destroy human civilization completely, such as nuclear war or asteroid impact.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt;
* Advice and action with consent: under this approach, the extraterrestrials would be more closely involved in terrestrial affairs, advising world leaders and acting with their consent to protect against danger.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt;
* Forcible corrective action: the extraterrestrials could require humanity to reduce major risks against its will, intending to help humans advance to the next stage of civilization.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt;

Tough considers advising and acting only with consent to be a more likely choice than the forceful option. While coercive aid may be possible, and advanced extraterrestrials would recognize their own practices as superior to those of humanity, it may be unlikely that this method would be used in cultural cooperation.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt; Lemarchand suggests that instruction of a civilization in its "technological adolescence", such as humanity, would probably focus on [[morality]] and ethics rather than on science and technology, to ensure that the civilization did not destroy itself with technology it was not yet ready to use.&lt;ref name=lemarchand-2006&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=0807.4518|first1=Guillermo A.|last1=Lemarchand|title=Counting on Beauty: The role of aesthetic, ethical, and physical universal principles for interstellar communication|bibcode = 2008arXiv0807.4518L|volume=0807|date=2008|pages=4518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tough, it is unlikely that the avoidance of immediate dangers and prevention of future catastrophes would be conducted through radio, as these tasks would demand constant surveillance and quick action.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt; However, cultural cooperation might take place through radio or a [[space probe]] in the Solar System, as radio waves could be used to communicate information about advanced technologies and cultures to humanity.&lt;ref name=tough-1986 /&gt;

===Hostile civilizations===
Science fiction films often depict humans successfully repelling [[alien invasion]]s, but scientists more often take the view that an extraterrestrial civilization with sufficient power to reach the Earth would be able to destroy human civilization with minimal effort.&lt;ref name="alien"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8642558.stm |work=BBC News |title=Stephen Hawking warns over making contact with aliens |date=25 April 2010 |access-date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=phys-imp-1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=b-g&gt;{{cite news|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2012/03/13/alien-encounters-a-few-sage-and-sagan-thoughts-on-invasion/|title='Alien Encounters': A few sage (and Sagan) thoughts on invasion|work=Los Angeles Times Hero Complex|date=13 March 2012|agency=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=28 March 2012|author=Boucher, Geoff|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6Ppw3I}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operations that are enormous on a human scale, such as destroying all major population centers on a planet, bombarding a planet with deadly [[neutron radiation]], or even traveling to another planetary system in order to lay waste to it, may be important tools for a hostile and totalitarian civilization.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-21-4-3&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute|author=Freitas, Robert|chapter=Interstellar War|date=1978|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/21.4.3.htm|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6Ua4QK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deardorff speculates that a small proportion of the intelligent life forms in the galaxy may be aggressive, but the actual aggressiveness or benevolence of the civilizations would cover a wide spectrum, with some civilizations "policing" others.&lt;ref name=ras-paper&gt;{{cite journal|title=Possible Extraterrestrial Strategy for Earth|author=Deardorff, James W.|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=1986|bibcode=1986QJRAS..27...94D|volume=27|page=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The paper states in its abstract that any communication by extraterrestrials via radio telescope would be censored by governments initially, though at the time it was written, the [[Cold War]] between the United States and the former Soviet Union was still ongoing.--&gt; According to Harrison and Dick, hostile extraterrestrial life may indeed be rare in the Universe, just as belligerent and autocratic nations on Earth have been the ones that lasted for the shortest periods of time, and humanity is seeing a shift away from these characteristics in its own sociopolitical systems.&lt;ref name=harrison-dick-ff-2000 /&gt; In addition, the causes of war may be diminished greatly for a civilization with access to the galaxy, as there are prodigious quantities of natural resources in space accessible without resort to violence.&lt;ref name=phys-imp-1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=harrison-ff-2000 /&gt;

SETI researcher [[Carl Sagan]] believed that a civilization with the technological prowess needed to reach the stars and come to Earth must have transcended war to be able to avoid self-destruction.

Disputing these analyses, [[David Brin]] states that while an extraterrestrial civilization may have an imperative to act for no benefit to itself, it would be naïve to suggest that such a trait would be prevalent throughout the galaxy.&lt;ref name=brin-2009&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.davidbrin.com/SKEPTICcontactperils.pdf |title=The Dangers of First Contact: The Moral Nature of Extraterrestrial Intelligence and a Contrarian Perspective on Altruism | author=Brin, David| journal=Skeptic Magazine | date=2009 | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brin points to the fact that in many moral systems on Earth, such as the Aztec or Carthaginian one, non-military killing has been accepted and even "exalted" by society, and further mentions that such acts are not confined to humans but can be found throughout the animal kingdom.&lt;ref name=brin-2009 /&gt;

Baum ''et al.'' speculate that highly advanced civilizations are unlikely to come to Earth to enslave humans, as the achievement of their level of advancement would have required them to solve the problems of labor and resources by other means, such as creating a sustainable environment and using mechanized labor.&lt;ref name=baum-2011/&gt; Moreover, humans may be an unsuitable food source for extraterrestrials because of marked differences in biochemistry.&lt;ref name=phys-imp-1/&gt; For example, the [[chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] of molecules used by terrestrial biota may differ from those used by extraterrestrial beings.&lt;ref name=baum-2011/&gt; Douglas Vakoch argues that transmitting intentional signals does not increase the risk of an alien invasion, contrary to concerns raised by British cosmologist [[Stephen Hawking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vakoch|first=Douglas A.|date=2016-10-01|title=In defence of METI|url=http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v12/n10/full/nphys3897.html|journal=Nature Physics|language=en|volume=12|issue=10|pages=890|doi=10.1038/nphys3897|issn=1745-2473|bibcode = 2016NatPh..12..890V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/stephen-hawking-wants-to-find-aliens-before-they-find-us/|title=Stephen Hawking wants to find aliens before they find us|last=Mack|first=Eric|date=2016-09-22|work=CBS News|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; because "any civilization that has the ability to travel between the stars can already pick up our accidental radio and TV leakage.”&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/02/12/should-we-beam-greetings-to-alien-civilizations-even-though-they-might-be-klingons-or-just-bad-company/|title=Should we beam greetings to alien civilizations even though they might be Klingons, or just bad company?|last=Achenbach|first=Joel|date=2015-02-12|website=Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/28632-active-seti-search-alien-life.html|title=Should Humanity Try to Contact Alien Civilizations?|last=Wall|first=Mike|date=2015-02-24|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians have also commented on the likely human reaction to contact with hostile species.

===Equally advanced and more advanced civilizations===
[[File:Dyson Sphere Diagram-en.svg|thumb|250px|It is suggested that technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization would probably be ethically advanced as well and would not attempt projects with severe ecological implications for other species, like the construction of a [[Dyson sphere]].|alt=A Dyson sphere]] [[Robert Freitas]] speculated in 1978 that the technological advancement and energy usage of a civilization, measured either relative to another civilization or in absolute terms by its rating on the [[Kardashev scale]], may play an important role in the result of extraterrestrial contact.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-25-3-1&gt;{{cite book |title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization |publisher=Xenology Research Institute |author=Freitas Jr., Robert A. |orig-year=1975–1979 |date=2008 |location=Sacramento, California, United States |url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm |chapter=Encounters Between Equals: The 0/0 Contact |chapterurl= http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/25.3.1.htm |archivedate=24 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6h2df2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the infeasibility of interstellar space flight for civilizations at a technological level similar to that of humanity, interactions between such civilizations would have to take place by radio. Because of the long transit times of radio waves between stars, such interactions would not lead to the establishment of diplomatic relations, nor any significant future interaction at all, between the two civilizations.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-25-3-1 /&gt;

According to Freitas, direct contact with civilizations significantly more advanced than humanity would have to take place within the Solar System, as only the more advanced society would have the resources and technology to cross interstellar space.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-25-3-2/&gt; Consequently, such contact could only be with civilizations rated as Type II or higher on the Kardashev scale, as Type I civilizations would be incapable of regular interstellar travel.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-25-3-2&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute| author=Freitas Jr., Robert A.|orig-year=1975–1979|date=2008|location=Sacramento, California, United States|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapter=Gods and Primitives: The 11/0 Contact|chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/25.3.2.htm|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6ifo7b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freitas expected that such interactions would be carefully planned by the more advanced civilization to avoid mass societal shock for humanity.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-25-3-2 /&gt;

However much planning an extraterrestrial civilization may do before contacting humanity, the humans may experience great shock and terror on their arrival, especially as they would lack any understanding of the contacting civilization. Ben Finney compares the situation to that of the tribespeople of [[New Guinea]], an island that was settled fifty thousand years ago during the [[last glacial period]] but saw little contact with the outside world until the arrival of European colonial powers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The huge difference between the indigenous stone-age society and the Europeans' technical civilization caused unexpected behaviors among the native populations known as [[cargo cult]]s: to coax the gods into bringing them the technology that the Europeans possessed, the natives created wooden "radio stations" and "airstrips" as a form of [[sympathetic magic]]. Finney argues that humanity may misunderstand the true meaning of an extraterrestrial transmission to Earth, much as the people of New Guinea could not understand the source of modern goods and technologies. He concludes that the results of extraterrestrial contact will become known over the long term with rigorous study, rather than as fast, sharp events briefly making newspaper headlines.&lt;ref name=doa-2003/&gt;

Billingham has suggested that a civilization which is far more technologically advanced than humanity is also likely to be culturally and ethically advanced, and would therefore be unlikely to conduct astroengineering projects that would harm human civilization. Such projects could include [[Dyson sphere]]s, which completely enclose stars and capture all energy coming from them. Even if well within the capability of an advanced civilization and providing an enormous amount of energy, such a project would not be undertaken.&lt;ref name=billingham-2000&gt;{{cite conference|title=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series |publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific|author=Billingham, John|editor=Lemarchand, G.|editor2=Meech, K|booktitle=Summary of Results of the Seminar on the Cultural Impact of Extraterrestrial Contact|date=2000|conference=A New Era in Bioastronomy |pages=667–678|bibcode=2000ASPC..213..667B}}&lt;/ref&gt; For similar reasons, such civilizations would not readily give humanity the knowledge required to build such devices.&lt;ref name=billingham-2000/&gt; Nevertheless, the existence of such capabilities would at least show that civilizations have survived "technological adolescence".&lt;ref name=billingham-2000/&gt; Despite the caution that such an advanced civilization would exercise in dealing with the less mature human civilization, Sagan imagined that an advanced civilization might send those on Earth an ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica|Encyclopædia Galactica]]'' describing the sciences and cultures of many extraterrestrial societies.&lt;ref name=folger-2011&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.astro.umass.edu/~wqd/a191/Scientific_American/scientificamerican0111-40_SETI.pdf|title=Contact: The Day After |work=Scientific American|date=3 January 2011|agency=Nature Publishing Group|accessdate=6 May 2012|author=Folger, Tim|pages=40–45|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA6mwUr4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether an advanced extraterrestrial civilization would send humanity a decipherable message is a matter of debate in itself.

Given the age of the galaxy, Harrison surmises that there exist several "galactic clubs", groupings of multiple civilizations from across the galaxy.&lt;ref name=harrison-ff-2000&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.futurefoundation.org/documents/hum_pro_wrk1.pdf|booktitle=When SETI Succeeds: The Impact of High-Information Contact|date=July 2000|editor=Tough, Allen|author=Harrison, Albert|title=Networking with Our Galactic Neighbors|pages=107–114|archivedate=24 December 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DA64QjzG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such clubs could begin as loose confederations or alliances, eventually developing into powerful unions of many civilizations.&lt;ref name=harrison-ff-2000 /&gt; If humanity could enter into a dialogue with one extraterrestrial civilization, it might be able to join such a galactic club. As more extraterrestrial civilizations, or unions thereof, are found, these could also become assimilated into such a club.&lt;ref name=harrison-ff-2000/&gt; Sebastian von Hoerner has suggested that entry into a galactic club may be a way for humanity to handle the culture shock arising from contact with an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-3&gt;{{cite book|title=Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials |publisher=Copernicus Books|author=Michaud, Michael A.

Whether a broad spectrum of civilizations from many places in the galaxy would even be able to cooperate is disputed by Michaud, who states that civilizations with huge differences in the technologies and resources at their command "may not consider themselves even remotely equal".&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-4&gt;{{cite book|title=Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials|publisher=Copernicus Books|author=Michaud, Michael A.

When two Canadian astronomers argued that they potentially discovered 234 extraterrestrial civilizations through analysis of the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] database, [[Douglas Vakoch]] doubted their explanation for their findings, noting that it would be unusual for all of these stars to pulse at exactly the same frequency unless they were part a coordinated network: "If you take a step back," he said, "that would mean you have 234 independent stars that all decided to transmit the exact same way."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/22876-234-pulsing-stars-aren-t-aliens-still-mysterious|title=Those 234 Pulsing Stars Probably Aren’t Aliens, But They're Still a Complex Mystery|last=Patel|first=Neel V.|date=2016-10-28|work=Inverse|access-date=2017-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michaud suggests that an interstellar grouping of civilizations might take the form of an empire, which need not necessarily be a force for evil, but may provide for peace and security throughout its jurisdiction.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-5&gt;{{cite book|title=Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials|publisher=Copernicus Books|author=Michaud, Michael A.

In contrast to the belief that an extraterrestrial civilization would want to establish an empire, Ćirković proposes that an extraterrestrial civilization would maintain equilibrium rather than expand outward.&lt;ref name=cirkovik-2008 /&gt; In such an equilibrium, a civilization would only colonize a small number of stars, aiming to maximize efficiency rather than to expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures.&lt;ref name=cirkovik-2008&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=0805.1821|author=Ćirković, Milan M.|title=Against the Empire|url=http://www.jbis.org.uk/paper.php?p=2008.61.246|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|volume=61|pages=246–254|date=2008|bibcode = 2008JBIS...61..246C }}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the classic Kardashev Type III civilization, which has access to the energy output of an entire galaxy and is not subject to any limits on its future expansion.&lt;ref name=cirkovik-2008/&gt; According to this view, advanced civilizations may not resemble the classic examples in science fiction, but might more closely reflect the small, independent Greek city-states, with an emphasis on cultural rather than territorial growth.&lt;ref name=cirkovik-2008/&gt;

===Extraterrestrial artifacts===
{{see also|Bracewell probe}}
[[File:Interstellar robotic probe.gif|thumb|Robotic probes may be preferable to radio waves or microwaves as a means of interstellar communication.|left|alt=An extraterrestrial robotic spacecraft]]An extraterrestrial civilization may choose to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may take a long time to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away.&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2 /&gt; Radio would be completely unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2 /&gt;

Although faster-than-light travel has been seriously considered by physicists such as [[Miguel Alcubierre]],&lt;ref name="Christopher Pike"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alcubierre, Miguel|title=The warp drive: hyper-fast travel within general relativity|journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]|date=1994|volume=11|pages=L73–L77|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/11/5/001|arxiv=gr-qc/0009013 |bibcode=1994CQGra..11L..73A|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tough speculates that the enormous amount of energy required to achieve such speeds under currently proposed mechanisms means that robotic probes traveling at conventional speeds will still have an advantage for various applications.&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2/&gt; 2013 research at NASA's [[Johnson Space Center]], however, shows that faster-than-light travel with the [[Alcubierre drive]] requires dramatically less energy than previously thought,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.space.com/17628-warp-drive-possible-interstellar-spaceflight.html | title=Warp Drive May Be More Feasible Than Thought, Scientists Say | work=Space.com | date=17 September 2012 | agency=Space.com | accessdate=27 October 2012 | author=Moskowitz, Clara}}&lt;/ref&gt; needing only about 1 metric ton of exotic mass-energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/1105voyager_facts.html | title=NASA - Voyager Facts | publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration | date=23 February 2008 | accessdate=27 October 2012 | author=Jenner, Lynn}}&lt;/ref&gt; to move a spacecraft at 10 times the speed of light, in contrast to previous estimates that stated that only a Jupiter-mass object would contain sufficient energy to power a faster-than-light spacecraft.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The original article stated that the mass-energy required would be roughly equal to that of the Voyager 1 spacecraft, and the mass of that spacecraft itself is, according to NASA, currently about 733 kg. Therefore, "about one metric ton" was used in the text.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tough, an extraterrestrial civilization might want to send various types of information to humanity by means of artifacts, such as an ''Encyclopædia Galactica'', containing the wisdom of countless extraterrestrial cultures, or perhaps an invitation to engage in diplomacy with them.&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=Small Smart Interstellar Probes|author=Tough, Allen|volume=51|pages=167–174|date=1998
|url=http://www.ieti.org/tough/articles/jbis51.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A civilization that sees itself on the brink of decline might use the abilities it still possesses to send probes throughout the galaxy, with its cultures, values, religions, sciences, technologies, and laws, so that these may not die along with the civilization itself.&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2 /&gt;

Freitas finds numerous reasons why interstellar probes may be a preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing to make contact with Earth. A civilization aiming to learn more about the distribution of life within the galaxy might, he speculates, send probes to a large number of star systems, rather than using radio, as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can (he says) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983 /&gt; Furthermore, probes would enable the surveying of non-intelligent populations, or those not yet capable of space navigation (like humans before the 20th century), as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983 /&gt; In addition, the greater energy required to send living beings rather than a robotic probe would, according to Michaud, be only used for purposes such as a one-way migration.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-6&gt;{{cite book|title=Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials |publisher=Copernicus Books|author=Michaud, Michael A.

Freitas points out that probes, unlike the interstellar radio waves commonly targeted by SETI searches, could store information for long, perhaps geological, timescales,&lt;ref name=freitas-1983 /&gt; and could emit strong radio signals unambiguously recognizable as being of intelligent origin, rather than being dismissed as a [[UFO]] or a natural phenomenon.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983 /&gt; Probes could also modify any signal they send to suit the system they were in, which would be impossible for a radio transmission originating from outside the target star system.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=The Case for Interstellar Probes|volume=36|date=November 1983|pages=490–495|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/TheCaseForInterstellarProbes1983.htm|author=Freitas, Robert|bibcode = 1983JBIS...36..490F }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the use of small robotic probes with widely distributed beacons in individual systems, rather than a small number of powerful, centralized beacons, would provide a security advantage to the civilization using them.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983/&gt; Rather than revealing the location of a radio beacon powerful enough to signal the whole galaxy and risk such a powerful device being compromised, decentralized beacons installed on robotic probes need not reveal any information that an extraterrestrial civilization prefers others not to have.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983 /&gt;

Given the age of the Milky Way galaxy, an ancient extraterrestrial civilization may have existed and sent probes to the Solar System millions or even billions of years before the evolution of ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-6 /&gt; Thus, a probe sent may have been nonfunctional for millions of years before humans learn of its existence.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-6 /&gt; Such a "dead" probe would not pose an imminent threat to humanity, but would prove that interstellar flight is possible.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-6 /&gt; However, if an active probe were to be discovered, humans would react much more strongly than they would to the discovery of a probe that has long since ceased to function.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-6 /&gt;

==Further implications of contact==

===Theological===
{{see also|Exotheology}}
The confirmation of extraterrestrial intelligence could have a profound impact on [[religion|religious]] doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries.&lt;ref name=space-2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/10670-extraterrestrial-life-religious-beliefs.html|title=Could Extraterrestrial Intelligence Sway Religious Beliefs?|work=Space.com|date=24 January 2011|agency=Space.com|accessdate=30 March 2012|author=Choi, Charles Q. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a survey of people with many different [[religious belief]]s indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence,&lt;ref name=space-2 /&gt; and another study, conducted by [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it.&lt;ref name=peters-2011&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rsta.2010.0234|title=The implications of the discovery of extra-terrestrial life for religion|date=2011|last1=Peters|first1=T.|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=369|issue=1936|pages=644–655|bibcode = 2011RSPTA.369..644P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion.&lt;ref name=elsevier&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.phpro.2011.08.031|title=Astrosociology and the Capacity of Major World Religions to Contextualize the Possibility of Life Beyond Earth|date=2011|last1=McAdamis|first1=E.M.|journal=Physics Procedia|volume=20|pages=338–352|bibcode = 2011PhPro..20..338M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the [[Vatican Observatory]] and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the [[Catholic Church]] would be likely to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.&lt;ref name=keim-2008&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/science/space/news/2008/06/alien_religion|title=Christian Theologians Prepare for Extraterrestrial Life|work=Wired|date=13 June 2008|agency=Condé Nast|accessdate=20 May 2012|author=Keim, Brandon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would not be completely inconsequential for religion. The Peters study showed that most non-religious people, and a significant minority of religious people, believe that the world could face a religious crisis, even if their own beliefs were unaffected.&lt;ref name=peters-2011 /&gt; Contact with extraterrestrial intelligence would be most likely to cause a problem for western religions, in particular traditionalist Christianity, because of the geocentric nature of western faiths.&lt;ref name=kaufman-2012&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a_l4cNtcxpcC | title=First Contact: Scientific Breakthroughs in the Hunt for Life Beyond Earth]|publisher=Simon and Schuster|author=Kaufman, Marc|date=2012|isbn=978-1-4391-0901-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of extraterrestrial life would not contradict basic conceptions of God, however, and seeing that science has challenged established dogma in the past, for example with the [[theory of evolution]], it is likely that existing religions will adapt similarly to the new circumstances.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-3&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute|author=Freitas Jr., Robert A.|orig-year=1975–1979|date=2008|location=Sacramento, California, United States|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapter=The Religiou Response Contact|chapterurl= http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.4.3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Vakoch argues that it is not likely that the discovery of extraterrestrial life will impact religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/16285-alien-life-discovery-religion-impact.html|title=Religion Would Likely Survive Alien Life Discovery|last=Wall|first=Mike|date=2012-06-25|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of Musso, a global religious crisis would be unlikely even for Abrahamic faiths, as the studies of himself and others on Christianity, the most "anthropocentric" religion, see no conflict between that religion and the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref name=musso-2012 /&gt; In addition, the cultural and religious values of extraterrestrial species would likely be shared over centuries if contact is to occur by radio, meaning that rather than causing a huge shock to humanity, such information would be viewed much as archaeologists and historians view ancient artifacts and texts.&lt;ref name=musso-2012 /&gt;

Funes speculates that a decipherable message from extraterrestrial intelligence could initiate an interstellar exchange of knowledge in various disciplines, including whatever religions an extraterrestrial civilization may host.&lt;ref name=lemarchand-ff-2000&gt;{{cite conference|date=2000|url=http://www.futurefoundation.org/documents/hum_pro_wrk1.pdf|editor1-first=Allen|editor1-last=Tough|author=Lemarchand, Guillermo A.|title=Speculations on the First Contact: Encyclopedia Galactica or the Music of the Spheres?|pages=153–163|booktitle=When SETI Succeeds: The Impact of High-Information Contact}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billingham further suggests that an extremely advanced and friendly extraterrestrial civilization might put an end to present-day religious conflicts and lead to greater religious toleration worldwide.&lt;ref name=billingham-ff-2000&gt;{{cite conference|booktitle=When SETI Succeeds: The Impact of High-InformationContact|date=2000|url=http://www.futurefoundation.org/documents/hum_pro_wrk1.pdf|editor1-first=Allen|editor1-last=Tough|author=Billingham, John|title=Who Said What: A Summary and Eleven Conclusions|pages=33–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Jill Tarter puts forward the view that contact with extraterrestrial intelligence might eliminate religion as we know it and introduce humanity to an all-encompassing faith.&lt;ref name=daily-galaxy-1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/08/pandemics-from.html|title=The Impact of ET Contact: Europe's Scientists Discuss The Future of Humans in Space|publisher=Daily Galaxy|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=21 April 2012|author=Kazan, Casey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vakoch doubts that humans would be inclined to adopt extraterrestrial religions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scienceandreligiontoday.com/2010/03/18/would-intelligent-aliens-undermine-god/|title=Would Intelligent Aliens Undermine God?|last=Kuhn|first=Robert Lawrence|date=2010-03-18|website=Science and Religion Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; telling ''[[ABC News]]'' "I think religion meets very human needs, and unless extraterrestrials can provide a replacement for it, I don't think religion is going to go away," and adding, "if there are incredibly advanced civilizations with a belief in God, I don't think [[Richard Dawkins]] will start believing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=5065245&amp;page=1|title=Christian Theologians Prepare for Extraterrestrial Life|last=Keim|first=Brandon|date=2008-06-15|website=ABC News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Luca Codignola of the University of Genoa, contact with a powerful extraterrestrial civilization is comparable to occasions where one powerful civilization destroyed another, such as the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Hernán Cortés]] into the Americas and the subsequent destruction of the indigenous civilizations and their ways of life.&lt;ref name=daily-galaxy-1/&gt; However, the applicability of such a model to contact with extraterrestrial civilizations, and that specific interpretation of the arrival of the European colonists to the Americas, have been disputed.&lt;ref name=wired-anthropologist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/04/space-anthropology/|title=Q&amp;A: The Anthropology of Searching for Aliens|publisher=Wired|work=Wired Science|date=4 April 2012|accessdate=21 April 2012|author=Mann, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, any large difference between the power of an extraterrestrial civilization and our own could be demoralizing and potentially cause or accelerate the collapse of human society.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; Being discovered by a "superior" extraterrestrial civilization, and continued contact with it, might have psychological effects that could destroy a civilization, as is claimed to have happened in the past on Earth.&lt;ref name=schetsche-2005&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrosociology.com/Library/PDF/Contributions/SETIandConsequences_ENG.pdf|title=SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) and the Consequences: Futurological Reflections on the Confrontation of Mankind with an Extraterrestrial Civilization|publisher=Astrosociology.com|orig-year=7 January 2005|date=1 July 2005|accessdate=20 May 2012|author=Schetsche, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the absence of close contact between humanity and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-3 /&gt; Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-3 /&gt; The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-3 /&gt;

===Legal===
{{see also|Metalaw}}
Contact with extraterrestrial civilizations would raise legal questions, such as the rights of the extraterrestrial beings. An extraterrestrial arriving on Earth might only have the protection of animal cruelty statutes.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-3&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute|author=Freitas, Robert|chapter=Legal Issues of First Contact|date=1978 |url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much as various classes of human being, such as women, children, and indigenous people, were initially denied [[human rights]], so might extraterrestrial beings, who could therefore be legally owned and killed.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-3-1&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute |author=Freitas, Robert|chapter=Alien Animals|date=1978 |url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.3.1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; If such a species were not to be treated as a legal animal, there would arise the challenge of defining the boundary between a legal person and a legal animal, considering the numerous factors that constitute intelligence.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-3-2&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute|author=Freitas, Robert|chapter=Legal Standards of Personhood|date=1978|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freitas considers that even if an extraterrestrial being were to be afforded legal personhood, problems of nationality and immigration would arise. An extraterrestrial being would not have a legally recognized earthly citizenship, and drastic legal measures might be required in order to account for the technically illegal immigration of extraterrestrial individuals.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-3-3&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute|author=Freitas, Robert|chapter=Extraterrestrial Persons|date=1978 |url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm|chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.3.3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If contact were to take place through electromagnetic signals, these issues would not arise. Rather, issues relating to patent and copyright law regarding who, if anyone, has rights to the information from the extraterrestrial civilization would be the primary legal problem.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-3 /&gt;

===Scientific and technological===
The scientific and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-4&gt;{{cite book|title=Xenology: An Introduction to the Scientific Study of Extraterrestrial Life, Intelligence, and Civilization|publisher=Xenology Research Institute|author=Freitas, Robert|chapter=Impact on Science and Technology|date=1978|url=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno.htm |chapterurl=http://www.xenology.info/Xeno/26.4.4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the message contains a large amount of information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the formation of the Solar System, which may greatly advance our technology and science.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-4 /&gt; A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-4 /&gt;

On the other hand, extraterrestrial civilizations with malicious intent could send information that could enable human civilization to destroy itself,&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-4 /&gt; such as powerful computer viruses or information on how to make extremely potent weapons that humans would not yet be able to use responsibly.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; While the motives for such an action are unknown, it would require minimal energy use on the part of the extraterrestrials.&lt;ref name=freitas-1978-26-4-4 /&gt; According to Musso, however, computer viruses in particular will be nearly impossible unless extraterrestrials possess detailed knowledge of human computer architectures, which would only happen if a human message sent to the stars were protected with little thought to security.&lt;ref name=musso-2012 /&gt; Even a [[virtual machine]] on which extraterrestrials could run computer programs could be designed specifically for the purpose, bearing little relation to computer systems commonly used on Earth.&lt;ref name=musso-2012 /&gt; In addition, humans could send messages to extraterrestrials detailing that they do not want access to the ''Encyclopædia Galactica'' until they have reached a suitable level of technological advancement, thus mitigating harmful impacts of extraterrestrial technology.&lt;ref name=musso-2012 /&gt;

Extraterrestrial technology could have profound impacts on the nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet for a wide variety of political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent.&lt;ref name=harrison-2002&gt;{{cite book|title=After Contact: The Human Response To Extraterrestrial Life|publisher=Basic Books|author=Harrison, Albert A.|date=2002|isbn=978-0-7382-0846-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u7BnvJMbPrsC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology.&lt;ref name=harrison-2002 /&gt; He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the [[Industrial Revolution]], which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to the new social order.&lt;ref name=harrison-2002 /&gt; Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.&lt;ref name=harrison-2002 /&gt;

Michaud suggests that humanity could be impacted by an influx of extraterrestrial science and technology in the same way that medieval European scholars were impacted by the knowledge of Arab scientists.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-10&gt;{{cite book|title=Contact with Alien Civilizations: Our Hopes and Fears about Encountering Extraterrestrials |publisher=Copernicus Books|author=Michaud, Michael A. G.|date=2007|location=New York, New York, United States|url=http://www.radio-astronomy.org/library/Contact-With-Alien-Civilizations.pdf|isbn=978-0-387-28598-6|pages=232–233|chapter=Fears: The End of Hubris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humanity might at first revere the knowledge as having the potential to advance the human species, and might even feel inferior to the extraterrestrial species, but would gradually grow in arrogance as it gained more and more intimate knowledge of the science, technology, and other cultural developments of an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.&lt;ref name=michaud-2006-10 /&gt;

The discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence would have various impacts on biology and [[astrobiology]]. The discovery of extraterrestrial life in any form, intelligent or non-intelligent, would give humanity greater insight into the nature of life on Earth and would improve the conception of how the [[Tree of life (biology)|tree of life]] is organized.&lt;ref name=mckay-2011&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McKay | first1 = C. P. | title = The search for life in our Solar System and the implications for science and society | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2010.0247 | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume = 369 | issue = 1936 | pages = 594–606 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2011RSPTA.369..594M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human biologists could learn about extraterrestrial [[hypothetical types of biochemistry|biochemistry]] and observe how it differs from that found on Earth.&lt;ref name=mckay-2011/&gt; This knowledge could help human civilization to learn which aspects of life are common throughout the universe and which are specific to Earth.&lt;ref name=mckay-2011/&gt;

===Ecological and biological-warfare impacts===
{{see also|Planetary protection}}
An extraterrestrial civilization might bring to Earth pathogens or invasive life forms that do not harm its own biosphere.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; Alien pathogens could decimate the human population, which would have no immunity to them, or they might use terrestrial livestock or plants as hosts, causing indirect harm to humans.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; Invasive organisms brought by extraterrestrial civilizations could cause great ecological harm because of the terrestrial biosphere's lack of defenses against them.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt;

On the other hand, pathogens and invasive species of extraterrestrial origin might differ enough from terrestrial organisms in their biology to have no adverse effects.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; Furthermore, pathogens and parasites on Earth are generally suited to only a small and exclusive set of environments,&lt;ref name=loker-2005&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0010038|pmc=1291355|title=Can Specialized Pathogens Colonize Distantly Related Hosts?

If an extraterrestrial civilization bearing malice towards humanity gained sufficient knowledge of terrestrial biology and weaknesses in the immune systems of terrestrial biota, it might be able to create extremely potent biological weapons.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt; Even a civilization without malicious intent could inadvertently cause harm to humanity by not taking account of all the risks of their actions.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt;

According to Baum, even if an extraterrestrial civilization were to communicate using electromagnetic signals alone, it could send humanity information with which humans themselves could create lethal biological weapons.&lt;ref name=baum-2011 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21967">In [[global health]], '''priority-setting''' is a term used for the process and strategy of deciding which health interventions to carry out. Priority-setting can be conducted at the disease level (i.e. deciding which disease to alleviate), the overall strategy level (i.e. [[selective primary healthcare]] versus [[primary healthcare]] versus more general [[health systems strengthening]]), research level (i.e. which health research to carry out),&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt; or other levels.&lt;ref name=durand /&gt;{{rp|5}}

==Definitions==

Priority-setting is the act of deciding which health interventions to carry out, and can occur at several levels of granularity. Priority-setting can occur at the following levels:&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=durand /&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name="pmac2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/CallForAbstract.pdf |title=Call for Abstracts: Priority Setting for Universal Health Coverage |accessdate=June 23, 2016 |publisher=Prince Mahidol Award Conference 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* health budget level (i.e. deciding how much to spend on health overall)
* overall strategy level (i.e. [[selective primary healthcare]] versus [[primary healthcare]] versus more general [[health systems strengthening]])
* disease level (i.e. deciding which disease to alleviate)
* intervention level within each disease (i.e. restricting to a specific disease and prioritizing among interventions for that disease)
* drug level
* research level (i.e. which health research to carry out)

Synonymous terms include "prioritization in health care and health research", "priority determination", "health priorities",&lt;ref name=rudan2010/&gt; and "agenda-setting".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 370| issue = 9595| pages = 1370–1379| last1 = Shiffman| first1 = Jeremy| last2 = Smith| first2 = Stephanie| title = Generation of political priority for global health initiatives: a framework and case study of maternal mortality| journal = The Lancet| accessdate = 2016-07-26| date = 2007| url = http://www.who.int/pmnch/topics/advocacy/JShiffman-globalsmarticle-Lancet.pdf| doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61579-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metrics==

Various metrics have been used to compare interventions. These include:

* [[Disability-adjusted life year]] per unit cost (used by e.g. [[Disease Control Priorities Project]]),&lt;ref name=rudan2010/&gt;&lt;ref name="glassman2012"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.gheart.2012.01.007| issn = 2211-8160| volume = 7| issue = 1| pages = 13–34| last1 = Glassman| first1 = Amanda| last2 = Chalkidou| first2 = Kalipso| last3 = Giedion| first3 = Ursula| last4 = Teerawattananon| first4 = Yot| last5 = Tunis| first5 = Sean| last6 = Bump| first6 = Jesse B.| last7 = Pichon-Riviere| first7 = Andres| title = Priority-Setting Institutions in Health| journal = Global Heart| accessdate = 2016-06-23| date = March 2012| url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211816012000105}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[quality-adjusted life year]], and other forms of [[cost-effectiveness analysis]]

* Adequacy of funding&lt;ref name=dcp2_ch4 /&gt;

==Who sets the priorities?==

Priority-setting can be done by various actors. These include:

* Governments: "In most countries, health spending by governments vastly outpaces international health aid, so governments set most health priorities."&lt;ref name="glassman2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Glassman%2011-13-13%20(public).pdf |title=A conversation with Amanda Glassman on November 13, 2013 |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=June 21, 2016 |publisher=[[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Non-profits and companies that assist governments
* If a country is using a [[Health in All Policy]] (HiAP) approach, then priority-setting is done by stakeholders who do not directly deal with health.&lt;ref name=pmac2016/&gt;
* International organizations
* Foundations
* Private donors (including [[high-net-worth individual]]s and ultra-high-net-worth individuals): "A common outcome is a negotiated set of priorities that reflect some domestic needs and some technical, political, and economic considerations defined largely by the interests of donors."&lt;ref name=glassman2012/&gt; In some highly aid-dependent countries, donors "have huge influence on health priorities".&lt;ref name=glassman2013/&gt;

According to Devi Sridhar, professor of global health at the [[University of Edinburgh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cphs.mvm.ed.ac.uk/people/staffProfile.php?profile=dsridhar |date=September 30, 2015 |title=Centre for Population Health Sciences - People |accessdate=July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the priorities of funding bodies largely dictate what health issues and diseases are studied".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001312| issn = 1549-1676| volume = 9| issue = 9| pages = –1001312| last = Sridhar| first = Devi| title = Who Sets the Global Health Research Agenda?

==History of organizations and programs working on priority-setting==

According to [[Amanda Glassman]] et al., global-level priority-setting has occurred since at least the 1980s, though these efforts have only focused on a few aspects.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;

The following table is a timeline of organizations and programs working on priority-setting.

Priority setting, or resource allocation, is an important health policy issue that occurs at all levels of health care. The Joint Centre for Bioethics shares its research platform on priority setting with the Canadian Priority Setting Research Network, which aims to improve the politics and processes of health care priority setting and enhance the research capacity for priority setting. The centre takes an innovative approach to priority setting research in that the focus is placed on enhancing the priority setting processes, capturing and sharing actual priority setting experiences, and taking a bottom-up approach to improve priority setting.

{{cquote|text=The result of a myriad of actors championing a kaleidoscope of "priorities" is confusion. Advocates, researchers, and policy makers have labeled almost every disease, condition, medication, or intervention a "health priority."|author=Glassman et al.&lt;ref name=glassman2012/&gt;}}

Rudan et al. says that priority-setting efforts have relied on "consensus reached by panels of experts" and as a result have not been systematic enough, and that this has "often made it difficult to present the identified priorities to wider audiences as legitimate and fair".&lt;ref name=rudan2007/&gt;

[[Amanda Glassman|Glassman]] et al. notes that criticisms of priority-setting include "the weak data on which estimates of burden, cost, and effectiveness relied; the value judgments implicit in disability-adjusted life year age weighting and discounting decisions; and treatment of equity issues, as well as the political difficulties associated with translating a ground zero package into a public budget based on historical inputs"; and the consideration of only health maximization at the expense of other objectives such as fairness.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;{{rp|16}}

Glassman et al. also notes how there are more cost-effectiveness studies for LMICs (in the thousands), but that these are unlikely to be actually applied to priority-setting processes.&lt;ref name=glassman2012 /&gt;{{rp|16}}

[[Jeremy Shiffman]] has said that some bodies such as the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] and ''[[The Lancet]]'' are prominent in priority-setting due to their dominion rather than data and analysis, and also notes that the process of creating the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] was not sufficiently transparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.15171/ijhpm.2015.51| issn = 2322-5939| volume = 4| issue = 5| pages = 315–317| last = Levine| first = Ruth E.| title = Power in global health agenda-setting: the role of private funding| journal = International Journal of Health Policy and Management| date = 2015-03-04| pmid = 25905483| pmc = 4417636}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Refeudalization''' is the process of recovering mechanisms and relationships that used to define [[feudalism]]. Because the term "feudalism" is slightly ambiguous, "refeudalization" is ambiguous, too.

In the modern era, the term "refeudalization" is used for policies that give special privileges to organized groups such as [[NGO]]s.

== Refeudalization in seventeenth-century European historiography ==
The process of '''refeudalization''' is also used in seventeenth-century European historiography. The term was made famous by Italian Marxist historians [[Ruggiero Romano]] and [[Rosario Villari]], to illuminate the social conditions behind the Neapolitan Revolt of 1647. The concept was influenced by Gramsci's ideas, the historigraphical debates during the 1950s and 1960s that centered on Eric Hobsbawm's seventeenth century "[[General Crisis]]" as well as 1960s Italian politics. Villari used it quite specifically in reference to the increasing pressure in the six decades preceding the revolt of 1647, in which the peasantry and the lower-middle classes revolted against the feudal aristocracy and international financiers. The process was triggered by the royal state's need for money. The Spanish crown ennobled the bourgeoisie of rich merchants and financiers, who infiltrated and reinforced the noble order. [[Fernand Braudel]] found the “clearest case of refeudalization” in Spanish Naples. The monarchy had raised capital by selling feudal titles, which in the  long term increased the fiscal burden that the seigneurial regime imposed on the rural poor, since the nobles were exempted from paying taxes to the viceroyal regime. Refeudalization in a more general sense has been used to explain Italy's failed transition to modern capitalism. Though Italy had pioneered the commercial revolution, feudal barons neglected business opportunities to innovate and further rationalize the processes of production.

== Refeudalization in Habermas's theory of the public sphere ==
[[Jürgen Habermas]]’s theory of the [[public sphere]] is based on his research into the bourgeois class of the eighteenth century in Great Britain, France and Germany; his key work on the theme is ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'' (1962). Habermas saw space that had been gained for the public around the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries returning to private hands, a process which he called 'the refeudalization [''Refeudalisierung''] of the public spehere': 'Habermas discussed the pincer-like movement in which late modern [[consumer capitalism]] attempts to turn us into unthinking mass consumers on one hand, while political actors, interest groups, and the state try to turn us into unthinking mass citizens on the other'.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jamie Warner, 'The New Refeudalization of the Public Sphere', in ''The Routledge Companion to Advertising and Promotional Culture'', edited by Matthew P. McAllister and Emily West (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 285-97 (p. 285).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Habermas's idea of the 'public sphere' ===
For Habermas, the 'public sphere' is 'a space in which all citizens can critically, substantively, and rationally debate public policy' (though this does not necessarily exist in any single physical space: it can also be constituted, for example, by newspapers).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In its ideal form, the public sphere is "made up of private people gathered together as a public and articulating the needs of society with the state".
The public sphere is the source of public opinion needed to "legitimate authority in functioning democracy". Habermas made a distinction between ''[[lifeworld]]'' and ''system''. The public sphere is part of the lifeworld and it is the immediate setting of the individual social actor, and Habermas opposed any analysis which uncoupled the interdependence of the lifeworld.&lt;ref name="Habermas, 1990 p 292"&gt;Habermas, ''Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit'', Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1962 (1990), p 292. ("The Structural Change of The Public Sphere"), translation Walter Kastorp (expressly for Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt;

Habermas's analysis is based on an oral bias; he believed that the public sphere can be most effectively constituted and maintained through dialogue, acts of speech, debate and discussion. In his further reflections, Habermas claims that public debate can be animated by “opinion-forming associations” which are voluntary associations, social organizations such as from churches, sports clubs, groups of concerned citizens, grassroots movements, trade unions – to counter or refashion the messages of authority.
This public sphere began to form first in Britain at the end of the seventeenth century. It resulted in the Licensing Act (1695), which allowed newspapers to print what they want without the Queen’s censorship. However, there were still strict laws. But the sphere is seen as a crucial enabler for this to happen.&lt;ref name="Habermas, 1990 p 292"/&gt;

=== The refeudalization of the public sphere ===
For Habermas, a key feature of the feudal is that small numbers of individuals embodied the public state: a king or similar officer ''was'' the realm (what Habermas called 'representative publicity'). Habermas saw the eighteenth-century bourgeois public sphere as a positive contrast to this situation. But in the twentieth century, he perceived the rise of advertising, marketing and 'public relations' trying to manipulate the public and discourage critical thought, and he perceived the state, political parties, and interest groups increasingly using the same approaches to win votes. This is 'refeudalization' because 'the public sphere becomes the court &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;before&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; whose public prestige can be displayed─rather than &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;in&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; which public critical debate is carried on'.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, ''The Transformation of the Public Sphere'', p. 201, quoted by Jamie Warner, 'The New Refeudalization of the Public Sphere', in ''The Routledge Companion to Advertising and Promotional Culture'', edited by Matthew P. McAllister and Emily West (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 285-97 (p. 287).&lt;/ref&gt;

"Publicity once meant the exposure of political domination before public reasoning; ''publicity'' [here Habermas uses the English word] sums up the reactions of a non-binding goodwill. The bourgeois public sphere readopts feudal qualities in proportion to its formation by ''public relations'' [in English]: the "offering agents" display representative expenditure in front of compliant customers. Publicity imitates that aura of personal prestige and preternatural authority which the representative public sphere had once imparted.

A "refeudalization" of the public sphere must be discussed in another, more exact sense. The integration of mass entertainment and advertising, which in the form of public relations already assumes a "political" character, subjugates namely even the state under its code. Because private companies suggest to their customers in consumer decisions the consciousness of citizens, the state has to "appeal to" its citizens like consumers. Thus the public use of violence also solicits publicity.

Some recent commentators have argued that the politics of twenty-first century America,&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Warner, 'The New Refeudalization of the Public Sphere', in ''The Routledge Companion to Advertising and Promotional Culture'', edited by Matthew P. McAllister and Emily West (New York: Routledge, 2013), pp. 285-97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Warner, 'The Smugglers: The Rationality of Political Satire in the 2014 Elections', ''PS: Political Science &amp; Politics'', 49.1 (January 2016), 48-52. DOI: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1017/S104909651500126&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and the West more generally,&lt;ref&gt;Alain Supiot; The public–private relation in the context of today’s refeudalization, ''International Journal of Constitutional Law'', Volume 11, Issue 1, 1 January 2013, Pages 129–145, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1093/icon/mos050&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; take further the trends observed by Habermas.

== Refeudalization in sociology of neoliberal globalization ==
There is a third context which sociologists, drawing on Habermas, refer to contemporary socio-economic processes in the global economy as refeudalization. The concepts overlap with discussions of [[neomedievalism]]. The Swiss sociologist [[Jean Ziegler]] uses the German expression "Refeudalisierung der Gesellschaft" to illuminate the forces behind [[neoliberal]] [[globalization]]. In his pamphlet "[[The Empire of Shame]]", he criticizes the new system of "Refeudalisierung" based on [[scarcity]] and debt. However, the concept in English is typically translated as the "new feudalization", which here means the subversion of Enlightenment values (freedom, equality and brotherhood) and the radical [[privatization]] of [[public goods]] and services.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Ziegler, ''L'empire de la honte'' (Fayard, 2005), {{ISBN|978-2213623993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Schutte, '[https://archiv.attacberlin.de/ags/argumente/text-refeudalisierung/ Was ist: »Refeudalisierung der Gesellschaft"?]', ''attacBerlin'' (26.2.2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Comparable ideas have been developed by Sighard Neckel.&lt;ref&gt;Sighard Neckel, '[http://www.mpifg.de/pu/workpap/wp10-6.pdf Refeudalisierung der Ökonomie: Zum Strukturwandel kapitalistischer Wirtschaft]', MPIfG Working Paper 10/6 (Cologne: Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, July 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Revolutions of 1917–1923''' were a period of political unrest and revolts around the world inspired by the success of the [[Russian Revolution]] and the disorder created by the [[aftermath of World War I]]. The uprisings were mainly [[socialist]] or [[anti-colonial]] in nature and were mostly short-lived, failing to have a long-term impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historytoday.com/david-motadel/waves-revolution |title=Waves of Revolution |last1=Motadel |first1=David |last2= |first2= |date=April 4, 2011 |website=History Today |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the revolutionary activity of the era, the [[revolutionary wave]] of 1917–1923 mainly refers to the unrest caused by [[World War I]] in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnLI8ooHHPgC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=1917%E2%80%9323+wave&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tb3I4H5ZA&amp;sig=j8d0sgDCa3o0D0fK8fPGymAhdlM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjW0Mr-q8TMAhULKh4KHfsFDlAQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=1917%E2%80%9323%20wave&amp;f=false |title=Neutral Europe Between War and Revolution, 1917-23 |last1=Schmitt |first1=Hans |publisher= |access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communist revolutions in Europe==
===Russia===
{{Main|Russian Revolution|Russian Civil War}}
[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] but before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]], and [[Peace of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]]]

In war-torn [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], the liberal [[February Revolution]] toppled the monarchy. It was unstable and the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power in the [[October Revolution]]. The ascendant [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|communist party]] soon withdrew from the war with some territorial concessions by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]].  It then battled its political rivals in the [[Russian Civil War]], including [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invading forces from the Allied Powers]]. In response to [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], the Bolshevik Party and the emerging [[Soviet Union]], [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]] from a broad assortment of ideological factions fought against them, particularly through the [[counter-revolutionary]] [[White movement]] and the peasant [[Green armies|Green Army]], the various nationalist movements in [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution]] and other would-be new states like those in Soviet [[Transcaucasia]] and [[Soviet Central Asia]], through the [[Anarchism|anarchist]]-inspired [[Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks|Third Russian Revolution]] and [[Tambov Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Ascher, //The Russian Revolution: A Beginner's Guide'' (Oneworld Publications, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1921, due to exhaustion, the collapse of transportation and markets, and threats of starvation, even dissident elements of the [[Red Army]] itself were in revolt against the [[communist state]], as shown by the [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. However, the multiple anti-Bolshevik forces were uncoordinated and disorganized, and in every case operated on the periphery. The Red Army, operating at the center, defeated them one by one and regained control. The complete failure of Comintern-inspired revolutions was a sobering experience in Moscow, and the Bolsheviks moved from world revolution to the theme of socialism in one country, Russia. Lenin moved to open trade relations with Britain, Germany, and other major countries. Most dramatically, in 1921, Lenin introduced a sort of small-scale capitalism with his [[New Economic Policy]] (or NEP). In this process of revolution and counter-revolution the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) was officially born in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Rex A. Wade, "The Revolution at One Hundred: Issues and Trends in the English Language Historiography of the Russian Revolution of 1917." ''Journal of Modern Russian History and Historiography'' 9.1 (2016): 9-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western Europe===
{{Main|German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Biennio Rosso}}
[[File:Berlin.revolution1918.statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of a revolutionary soldier; memorial to the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] in [[Berlin]]]]

The [[Leninist]] victories also inspired a surge by the [[History of communism|world Communist movement]]: the larger [[German Revolution of 1918–19|German Revolution]] and its offspring, like the [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], as well as the neighboring [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–20)|Hungarian Revolution]], and the [[Biennio Rosso]] in Italy in addition to various smaller uprisings, protests and strikes, all proved abortive.

The Bolsheviks sought to coordinate this new wave of revolution in the Soviet-led [[Communist International]], while new [[Communist party|communist parties]] separated from their former socialist organizations and the older, more moderate [[Second International]]. Despite ambitions for [[world revolution]], the far-flung Comintern movement had more setbacks than successes through the next generation, and it was abolished in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McDermott and Jeremy Agnew, ''The Comintern: A History of International Communism from Lenin to Stalin'' (Macmillan, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; After the Second World War when the [[Red Army]] occupied most of Eastern Europe, Communists would come to power in the Baltic states, [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[East Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Service, ''Comrades!: A History of World Communism'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Communist revolutions==
===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], then part of the United Kingdom, the [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 anticipated the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) within the same historical period as this first wave of [[communist revolution]]. The [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] movement of the time was predominantly nationalist and [[Populism|populist]], and although it had left-wing positions and included socialists and communists, it was not Communist. The Irish and Soviet Russian Republics nevertheless found common ground in their opposition to [[British Empire|British interests]], and established a trading relationship.

===Mexico===
The same was true of the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1920), which had broken out in 1910 but had devolved into factional fighting among the rebels by 1915, as the more radical forces of [[Emiliano Zapata]] and [[Pancho Villa]] lost ground to the more conservative "Sonoran oligarchy" and its [[Constitutional Army]]. The [[Felicistas]], the last major group of counterrevolutionaries, abandoned their armed campaign in 1920, and the internecine power struggles abated for a time after revolutionary General [[Álvaro Obregón]] had bribed or slain his former allies and rivals alike, but the following decade witnessed the assassination of Obregon and several others, abortive [[Coup d'état|military coup]] attempts and a massive right-wing uprising, the [[Cristero War]], due to religious persecution of Roman Catholics.

===Malta===
The [[Sette Giugno|Sette Giugno of 1919]] was a revolt characterised by a series of riots and protests by the Maltese population, initially as a reaction to the rise in the cost of living in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and the sacking of hundreds of workers from the dockyard. This coincided with popular demands for [[Self-governance|self-government]], which resulted in a National Assembly being formed in Valletta at the same time of the riots. This dramatically boosted the uprising, as many people headed to Valletta to show their support for the Assembly. This led to the British forces firing into the crowd, killing four local men. The cost of living increased dramatically after the war. Imports were limited, and as food became scarce prices rose; this made the fortune of farmers and merchants with surpluses to trade.

===Egypt===
The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] was a countrywide [[revolution]] against the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation of [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]. It was carried out by [[Egyptians]] and Sudanese from different walks of life in the wake of the British-ordered exile of revolutionary leader [[Saad Zaghloul]], and other members of the [[Wafd Party]] in 1919. The revolution led to Britain's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|recognition of Egyptian independence]] in 1922, and the implementation of a new [[Egyptian Constitution of 1923|constitution in 1923]]. Britain, however, continued in control of what was renamed the [[Kingdom of Egypt]]. British guided the king and retained control of the Canal Zone, [[Sudan]] and Egypt's external and military affairs. King Fuad died in 1936 and [[Farouk of Egypt|Farouk]] inherited the throne at the age of sixteen. Alarmed by the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] when Italy invaded Ethiopia, he signed the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]], requiring Britain to withdraw all troops from Egypt by 1949, except at the Suez Canal. During World War II, British troops [[Military history of Egypt during World War II|used Egypt]] as a major base for its operations throughout the region. British troops were withdrawn to the Suez Canal area in 1947, but nationalist, anti-British feelings continued to grow after the war.&lt;ref&gt;P.J.

'''SINPO''', an [[acronym]] for S'''ignal, Interference, Noise, Propagation, and Overall''', is a Signal Reporting Code used to describe the quality of [[radiotelegraph]] transmissions. SINPFEMO, an acronym for S'''ignal, Interference, Noise, Propagation, frequency of Fading, Modulation, dEpth, and Overall''' is used to describe the quality of [[Radiotelephone|radiotelephony]] transmissions.  SINPFEMO code consists of the SINPO code plus the addition of three letters to describe additional features of radiotelephony transmissions. These codes are defined by ''Recommendation ITU-R Sm.1135, SINPO and SINPFEMO codes''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/sm/R-REC-SM.1135-0-199510-I!!PDF-E.pdf|title=ITU-R Sm.1135, SINPO and SINPFEMO codes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SINPO code is most frequently used in [[reception report]]s written by [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]]. Each letter of the code stands for a specific factor of the signal, and each item is graded on a 1 to 5 scale (where 1 stands for nearly undetectable/severe/unusable and 5 for excellent/nil/extremely strong).

The code originated with the [[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]] (a predecessor to the ITU-R) in 1951, and was widely used by BBC shortwave listeners to submit signal reports, with many going so far as to mail audio recordings to the BBC's offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Engineering Division Monnograph, Number 43: September 1962|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/archive/pdffiles/monographs/bbc_monograph_43.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SINPO and SINPFEMO are the official signal reporting codes for international civil aviation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Procedures for Air Navigation Services: ICAO Abbreviations and Codes|url=http://www.icao.int/NACC/Documents/Meetings/2014/ECARAIM/REF03-ICAOCodes.pdf|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ITU-R.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The use of the SINPO code can be subjective and may vary from person to person. Not all [[shortwave]] listeners are conversant with the SINPO code and prefer using plain language instead.

==SINPO code explained==

; S ([[Signalling (telecommunication)|Signal]] strength) : The relative strength of the transmission.
; I ([[Interference (communication)|Interference]]) : Interference from other stations on the same or adjacent frequencies (man-made noise).
; N ([[Signal noise|Noise]]) : The amount of atmospheric noise.
; P ([[Radio propagation|Propagation]]) : Whether the signal is steady or fades from time to time.
; O (Overall merit) : An overall score for the listening experience under these conditions.

Each category is rated from 1 to 5 with 1 being 'unusable' or 'severe' and 5 being 'perfect' or 'nil'. MANY raters misunderstand the code and will rate everything either 55555 or 11111 when in reality both extremes are unusual in the extreme.  '55555' essentially means 'perfect reception akin to a local station' while that is occasionally possible, when talking about long-distance short-wave reception, it is almost never the case.

Another common mistake in rating is presenting an 'O' higher than any previously rated element. By definition, a station cannot present 'perfect' reception if there is any Noise or Interference or Fading present. In other words, it is NOT 'perfect local quality' reception if any of those things are present.

==Examples of SINPO code applied==

In responding to a shortwave reception, the SINPO indicates to the transmitting station the overall quality of the reception.

The SINPO code in normal use consists of the 5 rating numbers listed without the letters, as in the examples below:

* '''54554''' – This indicates a relatively clear reception, with only slight interference; however, nothing that would significantly degrade the listening experience.
* '''33433''' – This indicates a signal which is moderately strong, but has more interference, and therefore deterioration of the received signal.

Generally, a SINPO with a code number starting with a 2 or lower would not be worth reporting, unless there is no noise, interference or loss of propagation, since it would be likely the signal would be unintelligible.

Although the original SINPO code established technical specifications for each number (i.e., a number 3 in the P column meant a fixed number of fades per minute), these are rarely adhered to by reporters.  The 'S' meter displays the relative strength of the received RF signal in decibels; however, this should not be used as the sole indication of signal strength, as no two S meters are calibrated exactly alike, and many lower-priced receivers omit the S meter altogether. References to a "SINFO" code may also be found in some literature. In this case, the 'F' stands for Fading, instead of 'P' for Propagation, but the two codes are interchangeable. It was presumed that the average listener would be more familiar with the meaning of "fading" than "propagation". A simple way to ensure the rating applied is useful is to rate the "O" column first based on the intelligibility of the station. If you can understand everything easily, the station will rate a 4 or higher. If you have to work hard, but can understand everything '3' is the appropriate rating. If you cannot understand everything although you put great effort into it, a '2' is appropriate, and if you cannot understand the programming at all '1' is the appropriate rating.

Some listeners may not know how to distinguish between the 'I' which indicates interference from adjacent stations, and the 'N' which describes natural atmospheric or man-made noise; also for some listeners, the rating for 'Propagation' may not be completely understood. As a result of this confusion, many stations suggest the SIO code&amp;nbsp;– a simpler code which makes the limitations noted above not relevant. Despite this, some books and periodicals maintain the SINPO code is the best for DX reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reception Reports: Reporting Code - Writing Useful Reception Reports |url=http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports-codes.html |accessdate=27 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107033211/http://www.dxinginfo.com/dx-reception-reports-codes.html |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radio Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Sveriges Radio International}}) is [[Sweden]]'s official [[international broadcasting]] station. It is a non-commercial and politically independent public service broadcasting company.

==History==
SR International is part of [[Sveriges Radio]] (SR), Sweden's non-commercial public-radio broadcasting organization. The service was founded in 1938, at the approach of [[World War II]], as a way of keeping Swedes living abroad informed of happenings in Sweden and of Swedish opinion. Programming was at first in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] only, but in 1939 [[English language|English-]] and [[German-language]] broadcasts were added.

After the war, further language services were added: in [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. At the close of the [[Cold War]], the services in French, Portuguese, and Spanish were gradually phased out and replaced by new services in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. The latter services were withdrawn once [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] had developed their own independent media and joined the [[European Union]].

Radio Sweden also operated a service in [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] between 2004 and 2009.

In the 1990s Radio Sweden was merged with SR's Immigrant Languages Department to form the SR International channel. For a while, immigrant language services, such as those in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], were additionally carried on [[shortwave]].

==Programming in other languages==
The Radio Sweden English Service seeks to provide a window on the diverse perspectives and issues in [[Sweden]] today.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Its programs and website offer a ”[[Smörgåsbord#Other use of the term in English|smörgåsbord]]” of news and current affairs, science and technology, lifestyle, and culture.

In the beginning of 2016, the international service underwent a major reorganization. English language news about Sweden for overseas listeners were moved to a 30 minutes-a-week show on P2 and to social media. Minority languages service was further focused on those minorities living in Sweden and integrated with Swedish language services. 

Service in languages of the oppressed nations, such as Somali, were moved to an independent organization. News for overseas listeners in foreign languages other than English, such as Russian and German, has been canceled.&lt;ref&gt;http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2054&amp;artikel=6249380&lt;/ref&gt;
There have been several foreign-leagugaes services in the history of Radio Sweden. The German Programm got disfunct after 76 years of service.&lt;ref&gt;https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2108&amp;artikel=6379933 German Service of SR&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former programs==

===''Sweden Calling DXers''===
One of the most popular programs on Radio Sweden was ''[[Sweden Calling DXers]]'', founded in 1948 by [[Arne skoog|Arne Skoog]]. He reasoned that [[shortwave listening]] or [[DXing]] was a very young hobby, and that by providing information in a weekly program for shortwave listeners about their hobby, Radio Sweden was teaching its own audience about how to listen better. While the first program was based solely on Arne's own listening, listeners were encouraged to write in with their own news, and soon virtually all of the program was based on listener's letters (an early example of interactvity).

The program was carried on Tuesdays in all of Radio Sweden's services except Swedish.

When Arne Skoog retired in connection with the program's 30th anniversary in 1978, the program was taken over by [[George Wood (Radio Sweden)|George Wood]], a member of the Radio Sweden English Service. After a number of years, as media changed, it began to cover less about shortwave, and more about satellite radio and television. Later coverage was extended to the Internet, the focus was shifted to concentrating on Swedish media, and the name of the English version of the program was changed to "MediaScan". "MediaScan" was the first English-language radio program in Europe (and the second overall in Europe) to post audio on the Internet (on the ftp sites [[funet|ftp.funet.fi]] and [[SUNET|ftp.sunet.se]], as well as via Internet Multicasting).

In 2001 the program was discontinued, but remains in a somewhat sporadic form on the Radio Sweden website.

===''The Saturday Show''===
Another popular Radio Sweden program was ''[[The Saturday Show (Radio Sweden)|The Saturday Show]]'', with [[Roger Wallis]] and Kim Loughran, which ran from 1967 to 1981. The program was launched to showcase Swedish rock and pop music in a world dominated by American and British rock. Using Radio Sweden's relatively high-powered medium wave transmitter on 1179&amp;nbsp;kHz, the entire program was 90 minutes in length, and featured many satirical sketches, often political and sometimes controversial. A 30-minute segment of the entire broadcast was the Radio Sweden shortwave program on Saturdays.

==End of radio broadcasting==
On October 20, 2010, Radio Sweden ceased broadcasts on shortwave and medium wave, as Swedish Radio's management decided that the Internet had matured enough to support international broadcasts. At the same time the English Service was extended to national broadcasts on FM, but programming on weekends was discontinued. Services in English also continue on satellite, both using Swedish Television's satellite and the [[World Radio Network]].

{{International relations theory sidebar}}
In [[world-systems theory]], the '''semi-periphery countries''' (sometimes referred to as just '''the semi-periphery''') are the [[industrialization|industrializing]], mostly [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[country|countries]] which are positioned between [[periphery countries|the periphery]] and [[core countries]]. Semi-periphery countries have organizational characteristics of both core countries and periphery countries and are often geographically located between core and peripheral regions as well as between two or more competing core regions.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt; Semi-periphery regions play a major role in mediating economic, political, and social activities that link core and peripheral areas.&lt;ref name=chase&gt;Chase-Dunn and Thomas D.

These regions allow for the possibility of innovative technology, reforms in social and organizational structure, and dominance over peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=chase/&gt; These changes can lead to a semi-periphery country being promoted to a core nation.&lt;ref name="chase"/&gt; Semi-periphery is, however, more than a description, as it also serves as a position within the world hierarchy in which social and economic change can be interpreted.&lt;ref name=terlouw&gt;Terlouw 1992 pg 136-145&lt;/ref&gt;

World-systems theory describes the semi-periphery as a key structural element in the world economy.&lt;ref name=waller&gt;Wallerstein 1976, pp. 229-233&lt;/ref&gt; The semi-periphery plays a vital role comparative to that of the role that Spain and Portugal played in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as intermediate trading groups within the European colonial empire.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt;

Today, the semi-periphery is generally industrialized.&lt;ref name=waller2&gt;Wallerstein 1974 Vol.3, No.4., pp 461-483&lt;/ref&gt; Semi-peripheral countries contribute to the manufacturing and exportation of a variety of goods.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; They are marked by above average land mass, as exemplified by Argentina, China, India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, and [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; More land mass typically means an increased market size and share.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-peripheral nations are not all large though, as smaller countries such as [[Israel]], Poland, and Greece exist within the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

==Sociological theory==
Semi-peripheral countries offer their citizens relatively diverse economic opportunities but also have extreme gaps between the rich and poor. World-system theorists originally used only two categories: [[periphery countries]] and [[core countries]]. A need for an in between category became quickly apparent,&lt;ref name="Chirot"&gt;Chirot. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the establishment of the semi-periphery category for societies that have moved away from the periphery but have not become core. In other words, the category describes societies that remain dependent, and to some extent underdeveloped, despite having achieved significant levels of industrialization.&lt;ref name="Chirot"/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are tied into dynamic world systems that focus on the reliance of poor nations upon the wealthy, a concept known as the [[dependency theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Tausch A.&lt;/ref&gt; The term semi-periphery has been applied to countries that existed as early as in the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu&gt;Janet Abu-Lughod 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the creation of a semi-periphery category has added sociological and historical layers to previous developmental theories—yet it still has similar, inherently capitalist foundations.&lt;ref name="waller" /&gt;

===Function===
[[File:China fuels 1983.jpg|thumb|250px|Energy and mineral resources]]
The semi periphery is needed to stabilize the world system,&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; as it facilitates interaction and provides a connection between the low-income [[periphery countries|peripheral states]] and the high-income [[core countries|core states]] by adding another step in the world system hierarchy.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; As the middle ground, semi-peripheral countries display characteristics of both the [[Core countries|core]] and the [[Periphery countries|periphery]].&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; They also serve as a political buffer zone in that while they are exploited, they are also the exploiters.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; These areas have either been core regions in the past or formerly-peripheral areas that have since advanced in the world economy.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

Semi-peripheral nations are a necessary structural element in a world-trade system,&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; since such nations can serve to alleviate the political pressures that the core can exert upon the periphery and the political unrest that the periphery can direct back at the core.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; On the other hand, the semi-periphery can find itself excluded from the region's politics, as it lies just outside the bounds of political arena of the core states.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt;

The semi-periphery exists because it needs to divide the economic power between the core and the periphery. Semi-periphery, referred to as the middle class by Wallerstein, is what makes the capitalist world function because it is much like the sociological [[structural functionalism]] theory, where norms, customs, traditions, and institutions act as "organs" that work toward the proper functioning of the "body" as a whole. Without these industrializing countries, change will never reach the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Chirot, Daniel, and Thomas D. Hall. 1982. 8:81-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of their contribution to industry and economy, the contemporary semi-peripheral states are semi-industrialized.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are major exporters of minerals and agricultural goods. They are often focused in the manufacturing and exportation of industrial goods and commodities. While these advances separate the semi-periphery from the periphery, they lack the power and the economic dominance of core nations and still have a lot of un-managed poverty, placing them beneath the core.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; Semi-peripheral countries are important contributors to the world economy because of the above reasons and because they tend to have above average land mass, meaning that they are host to an above average market.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt; A primary example is China, a country with not only a large area but with a booming population.&lt;ref name=terlouw/&gt;

==History and development==

===13th century===
[[File:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[silk road]] [[trade routes]] across [[Eurasia]]]]This era of human history found the semi-periphery concentrated in the area stretching from the Middle East to China, including India and the [[Mongol Empire]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; This was the first time in history that the peripheries and semi-peripheries of the world became connected and involved in the trade of the world, both with cores and with each other.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Through a lucrative trade system, including heavy taxing of goods traveling through their borders, they were able to maintain a steady stream of wealth, becoming the driving forces of economic change throughout this time period.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;  In addition, a heavy emphasis on defense and border security, particularly among the [[Mongols]], allowed them to be fairly impenetrable [[trade]] obstacles.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; [[Geography]] also played a role, as seen in India's development of an impressive [[maritime industry]].  Because of its position along a convenient route through the Indian Ocean, India established its role as a "hinge" between the [[East]] and [[West]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Through their positions within the world trade system, semi-peripheries in the Middle East became crucially important in connecting the cities of Chinese and Indian cores with the fledgling cities of Europe, as well as serving as key points between other, more major core cities in the region, such as [[Baghdad]], [[Cairo]], and [[Aden]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

===1300–1450===
[[File:Bubonic plague-en.svg|thumb|250px|The Black Death rapidly spread along the major European sea and land trade routes.]]

Following increases in population and commerce in Western Europe in the thirteenth century, the [[feudal system]] met severe economic difficulties in the fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries.&lt;ref name=halsall&gt;Halsall 1997, pp.14-19&lt;/ref&gt; This decline in development was caused by a combination of the decline in agricultural production, the shrinking economy that had already hit its peak within the current feudal structure, and the devastating effects of the [[Black Plague]] epidemic.&lt;ref name=waller/&gt; The regression of Western Europe into the semi-periphery and periphery allowed for the rise of the trading powers of Italy, most notably [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; These Italian city-states took advantage of their established trade connections with the [[Mongol Empire]], the [[Far East]], the Middle East, and the other Mediterranean powers to maintain their growth despite the economic failures of their European trade partners.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa and Venice had influence beyond their trade channels. Both were instrumental in the [[Crusades]] through their provisions of troops, transport vessels, and naval ships.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa also assisted the [[Byzantine Empire]] when it helped recapture the capital, [[Constantinople]], in the late thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; The Byzantine Empire took advantage of its strategic position along various trade routes and the decline of Western Europe to rise to [[Core countries|core]] status until its fall in 1453.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

During this time period, Genoa and Venice developed forms of [[laissez-faire]] government and institutions that are viewed as precursors to modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Despite these advances in influence and entrepreneurship, Genoa and Venice suffered from the crippling effects of the Black Plague, as much of the rest of Europe had before them.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Venice was able to survive due to its connection with the Southern trade route, though her strength was much reduced by the middle of the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; Genoa never fully recovered from the [[Black Death]] and its defeat at the hands of Venice in the late fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; The decline of Genoa and the shift in Venice's focus to the [[Red Sea]] trade route left the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic open to Portugal and Spain, who were already better positioned geographically to control Atlantic trade routes.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt;

===1450–1700===
[[File:Spanish Empire Anachronous 0.PNG|thumb|460px|The areas of the world that at one time were territories of the Spanish Empire.]]
  
In a push to ensure stable economic growth, Europe turned to a capitalistic economy in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries to replace the failed feudal system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Modern capitalism allowed for economies to extend beyond geographical and political boundaries, leading to the formation of the first worldwide economic system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; At the base of this world system was an [[international division of labor]] that determined countries' relationships and placement within the categories of the world system: core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The core regions, most notably the countries of Northwestern Europe like England, France, and the [[Netherlands]], gained the most from the world economy.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Their ascension from previous peripheral and semi-peripheral status to the core was driven by the development of strong central government and military power, the combination of which made possible control of international commerce and exploitation of colonial possessions.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

At the other end of the spectrum was the periphery, marked by lack of central government, exportation of raw materials to the core, and exploitive labor practices.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; In this time period, especially toward the end of the 17th century, South America and parts of North America stood out as peripheral zones under the control and capitalistic exploitation of core countries in Europe.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; [[Slaves]] and indigenous workers in these regions developed [[raw materials]] for export to Europe, a distinctive characteristic of the new capitalism, as goods were no longer produced solely for internal consumption.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The [[aristocracy]] of these regions controlled commerce and became wealthy through the new world economy, leading to their rise in power above the government.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Even in periods of upheaval, local aristocrats were able to rely on core European powers to assist in keeping control over the economic system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

In between the core and periphery was the semi-periphery, which constituted both previous core regions that had declined, like Italy, Spain and Portugal, and peripheries that had improved their position, like southern Germany and southern France.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Spain and Portugal had taken advantage of the opening to Atlantic control left by the decline of Italian powers like Genoa and Venice.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Much like the core European powers, Spain and Portugal had strong navies and expansive colonial domains, which they exploited for their natural resources and cheap labor.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Rather than using the increased wealth to develop strong domestic [[manufacturing]] sectors, as other Western European powers did, Spain and Portugal used imported gold and silver to obtain manufactured goods from the core countries, relegating them to semi-periphery instead of core status.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; So, while they had control over several peripheral regions and exploited them, a characteristic of a core region, these countries failed to develop the quality manufacturing industries and the access to international banking that further defined core countries, leaving them a step below in the world system at semi-periphery status.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

===1700–1875===
[[File:graph rel share world manuf 1750 1900 02.png|300px|thumb|As the Industrial Revolution developed British manufactured output surged ahead of other economies]]
The development of trade between Europe, the Americas, and the East generated massive profits for a relatively small [[merchant]] elite in the European colonial powers.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; These merchants were able to utilize their profits to take control of [[agriculture]] and other industries.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The merchant class further consolidated its power by extending control over internal markets and the prices of finished goods.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The end result was the development of the necessary capital to [[industrialize]] the European core states.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

This era was defined by the transition from agriculture to [[industrialization]].&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The rapid development of industry triggered several reactions. Many European states explored new territories in addition to their original colonial holdings for new markets to exploit.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The European world system continued to expand and include more regions, as it absorbed the Indian Ocean economic system through the acquisition of colonies by Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal, among others.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; Previously isolated regions, like much of the American interior zone, joined newly independent South American countries in becoming part of the periphery.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; By the nineteenth century, Asia and Africa had also entered the world system as peripheral regions.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; This development of Africa and Asia as peripheral continents allowed for new cores like the United States and Germany to improve their core status, rising higher within the world system.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

Throughout this time period was a constant shift within core regions from a combination of agriculture and industry to solely industrial enterprise.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; In this period, England was the leader in industrial and agricultural production, though by 1900, only ten percent of England's populace worked in agriculture, demonstrating the shift to industry not only in England but across the core stratum.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt; The dramatic shift to industry extended beyond the core by the end of this time period, as core regions encouraged the development of [[manufacturing]] in peripheral and semi-peripheral zones to further develop those markets and create demand for newly developed machines and other goods.&lt;ref name=halsall/&gt;

===1875–1914===
[[File:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|A ration party of the Royal Irish Rifles in a communication trench.]] The [[West]] represented both the core and the semi-periphery, as Europe dominated 80% of the world's market share.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"&gt;Hobsbawn, Eric. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the rest of the world was a diverse periphery, though Japan was a notable exception.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; As expansionism continued, new core nations emerged, such as the Britain, Germany, and the United States, while old cores such as Spain and Portugal faded to the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; The growth of the power of the common man led to an expansion of thought concerning democracy, communism, and revolution, which pervaded the weaker semi-peripheral nations overcome with civil distress.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; In some cases, this led to the weakening of the nations, such as the violent revolution in France.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; This contributed to the adoption of totalitarian leaders, as seen in Germany and France.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; The major factors contributing to world war were the conflicts and power struggles taking place between the three classes of nations in the global system.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt; Nations considered part of the semi-periphery felt oppressed by the stronger, larger core nations.&lt;ref name="Hobsbawn"/&gt;

===1914–today===

This trend known to continued throughout the century, with Germany, Russia, and Japan also taking seats at the core. At the end of World War II however, Germany quickly fell to the [[semi-periphery]] along with war-ravaged France. As the rest of Europe struggled to rebuild itself, it also fell to the [[semi-periphery]], with the exception of many [[Eastern European]] nations, who fell under the Soviet Union as bloc countries. Japan also fell back into semi-periphery, along with the industrializing China and India, until their recent upswing in influence. Change also came to North America, where [[American imperialism]] led to the rise of countries like [[Guatemala]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. On the other side of the Pacific, Australia was also developing, helping to secure an Allied Victory in World War II.

In today's global hierarchy, some states are transitioning upward while others are moving downward in terms of status and influence. Former colonial powers no longer exercise control over an international domain and are instead mostly relegated to their core; for example, former European world powers do not exert influence over colonial outposts in the [[Americas]], Africa, or Asia, but rather have consolidated their power in the form of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;Shaw, Timothy M. ''The Review of Black Political Economy'': pp. 341-358.
[http://www.springerlink.com/content/2118h2x63n84u170/]&lt;/ref&gt; The new leading powers are mostly non-European (United States, Canada, Japan). Outside of these developed countries are countries (see list below) that are considered semi-periphery and are both dominant and dominated within economic, political, and social realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morales Ruvalcaba|first1=Daniel Efrén|title=INSIDE THE BRIC: ANALYSIS OF THE SEMIPERIPHERAL NATURE OF BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA|journal=Austral: Brazilian Journal of Strategy &amp; International Relations|date=11 September 2013|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/austral/article/view/40942/26976|language=es|issn=2238-6912}}&lt;/ref&gt; These middle powers are a combination of nations that have emerged as a result of the fragmentation of the Soviet Union and nations that have risen because of their possession of resources in high demand, like oil in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; While these nations are by no means on the level of the stated world powers, they are able to exert influence over the weaker nations of the impoverished [[Fourth World]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

Other terms used to describe semi-periphery countries include sub-imperial and semi-industrial.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] identifies three ways by which countries can emerge from the periphery into the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Countries with a large market and room for industrial growth, like [[Brazil]], South Africa, and Mexico, and countries with valuable energy resources, like [[Iran]] and Saudi Arabia, can utilize the strategy of seizing the chance.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; The strategy of promotion by invitation can be utilized by countries willing to be open to foreign governmental and regional administrative centers.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Examples of past countries to utilize this strategy are the capitalist regimes in Africa like [[Egypt]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Zaire]], [[Senegal]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; These countries use [[dependency theory|dependent development]] to integrate into the world economy and establish local dominance.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Outside of these strategies is that of self-reliance, a basic theory that as some countries grow, others will decline.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt; Many countries in Africa and South America have exhibited the qualities of a sub-imperial or semi-industrial power.&lt;ref name="shaw"/&gt;

Wallerstein examines the role of semi-periphery countries during a period of economic downturn.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; To redefine core and periphery countries in an economic sense, core countries are characterized by advanced technology, high [[Profit (economics)|profits]], high wages, and diversified production while periphery countries have less technology, low profits, low wages, and less diversified production.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; Semi-periphery countries fall in the middle of these spectra, and their unique political and social structure place them in a position where they can best take advantage of economic downturns.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

These economic downturns occur because of increased [[supply (economics)|supply]] and decreased [[demand]], which combine to create a shift in surplus and power to the semi-periphery. Semi-periphery regions take advantage of the situation by expanding control of their home markets and the surrounding periphery countries at the expense of core countries.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; The underlying reason for this shift in power lies in the basic economic principle of [[scarcity]]. As long as core countries maintain scarcities of their goods, they can select customers from semi-periphery and periphery countries that are competing over them. When excess supply occurs, the core countries are the ones competing over a smaller market. This competition allows semi-peripheral nations to select from among core countries rather than vice versa when making decisions about commodity purchases, manufacturing investments, and sales of goods, shifting the balance of power to the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; While in general there is a power shift from core to semi-periphery in times of economic struggles, there are few examples of semi-peripheral countries transitioning to core status.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; To accomplish this, semi-peripheral nations must not only take advantage of weaker core countries but must also exploit any existing advantages over other semi-peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt; How well they exploit these advantages determines their arrangement within the semi-periphery class.&lt;ref name=waller2/&gt;

==Effects==
[[File:Election MG 3455.JPG|thumb|A ballot box]]
The semi-peripheral nations of the world have played an important role to world trade and interaction since early periods of globalized trade. This "middle ground" between the very powerful [[Core countries|cores]] and the backwaters of the far [[Periphery countries|periphery]] allowed those two zones to interact with greater ease. For example, during the [[Pax Mongolica|13th-century world system]], the semi-periphery areas around Europe's Mediterranean Coast facilitated trade between the peripheries of the more manufacturing based [[Flanders|Northern Europe]] and the cores of India and China.&lt;ref name=abu/&gt; John Markoff, a [[sociology|sociologist]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]], also notes that political developments, particularly in the advancement of [[democracy]], originate in the semi-periphery.&lt;ref name="Markoff"/&gt; He notes that innovations in democracy came from the semi-periphery rather than the more established, stable [[First World|core nations]], where profit discourages great reform, or the extremely poor [[Third World|periphery]] where instability makes reform too dangerous to attempt.&lt;ref name="Markoff"/&gt; It has been within semi-peripheral nations where democratic reforms like the expansion of suffrage and the institution of the secret ballot have been implemented.&lt;ref name="Markoff"&gt;Markoff, John. 1999-1041:4&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Post Cold War */"First World" and "Third World" do not still describe the same basic concepts. As explained in the article, they previously described the Western and Eastern blocs, two alliances that no longer exist. This isn't similar to how the words are used now.</comment>

{{Three worlds}}
The terms ''[[First World]]'', ''[[Second World]]'', and ''[[Third World]]'' were originally used to divide the world's nations into three categories. The model did not emerge to its end state all at once. The complete overthrow of the post–[[World War II]] status quo, known as the [[Cold War]], left two superpowers (the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]) vying for ultimate global supremacy. They created two camps, known as blocs. These blocs formed the basis of the concepts of the First and Second Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gaddis |first1= John |title= We Now Know: Rethinking Cold War History |year= 1998 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 0-19-878071-0 |pages= 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Cold War ===
Early in the Cold War era, [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] were created by the United States and The Soviet Union, respectively. They were also referred to as the [[NATO|Western Bloc]] and the [[Warsaw Pact|Eastern Bloc]]. The circumstances of these two blocks were so different that they were essentially two worlds, however, they were not numbered first and second.&lt;ref name="p. 21"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Melkote |first1=Srinivas R. |last2=Steeves |first2=H.

 | title = Winston Churchill "Iron Curtain"
 | publisher = The History Place
 | url = http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/ironcurtain.htm
 | accessdate = 2018-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this speech, Churchill describes the division of the West and East to be so solid that it could be called an iron curtain.&lt;ref name=iron/&gt;

In 1952, the French [[demography|demographer]] [[Alfred Sauvy]] coined the term Third World in reference to the three estates in pre-revolutionary France.&lt;ref name=model&gt;{{Cite web
 | title = Three Worlds Model
 | publisher = University of Wisconsin Eau Claire

Just as the third estate comprised everybody else, Sauvy called the Third World all the countries that were not in this Cold War division, i.e., the unaligned and uninvolved states in the "East–West Conflict."&lt;ref name=model/&gt;&lt;ref name=leonard1542-3 /&gt; With the coining of the term Third World directly, the first two groups came to be known as the "First World" and "Second World," respectively. Here the three-world system emerged.&lt;ref name=leonard1542-3 /&gt;

However, [[Secwepemc|Shuswap]] Chief [[George Manuel]] believed the '''Three Worlds Model''' to be outdated. In his 1974 book ''The Fourth World: An Indian Reality'', he describes the emergence of the [[Fourth World]] while coining the term. The fourth world refers to "nations," e.g., cultural entities and ethnic groups, of indigenous people who do not compose states in the traditional sense.&lt;ref name=fourth&gt;{{Cite web

===Post Cold War===
With [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991]], the Eastern Bloc ceased to exist; with it, so did all applicability of the term Second World.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26610">The '''Ultimate Fighting Championship rankings''', which were introduced in February 2013, are generated by a voting panel made up of media members. The media members are asked to vote for who they feel are the top fighters in the UFC by [[Mixed martial arts weight classes|weight class]] and [[Pound for pound|pound-for-pound]]. A fighter is only eligible to be voted on if they are in active status in the UFC. A fighter can appear in more than one weight division at a time. The champion and interim champion are considered to be in the top positions of their respective divisions and therefore are not eligible for voting by weight class. However, the champions can be voted on for the pound-for-pound rankings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufc.com/rankings UFC.com: Rankings]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Union of International Associations''' ('''UIA''') is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] research institute and documentation center based in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], and operating under [[United Nations]] mandate. It was founded in 1907 under the name [[Central Office of International Associations]] by [[Henri La Fontaine]],  the 1913 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, and [[Paul Otlet]], a founding father of what is now called [[information science]].

The UIA is an independent research institute and a repository for current and historical information on the work of global [[civil society]]. It serves two main purposes: to document and promote public awareness of the work of [[Yearbook of International Organizations|international organizations]] (both [[International nongovernmental organization|INGOs]] and [[Intergovernmental organizations|IGOs]]), [[International Congress Calendar|international meetings]], and [[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential|world problems]]. The UIA also supports and facilitates the work of international associations through training and networking opportunities.

It has consultative status with [[ECOSOC]] and [[UNESCO]].

==Aims==

* Facilitate the development and efficiency of nongovernmental networks in every field of human activity – especially non-profit and voluntary associations – considered to be essential components of contemporary society
* Collect, research and disseminate information on international bodies, both governmental and nongovernmental, their interrelationships, their meetings, and the problems and strategies with which they are concerned
* Experiment with meaningful and action-oriented ways of presenting such information to enable these initiatives to develop and counterbalance each other creatively, and act as a catalyst for the emergence of new forms of associative activity and international co-operation
* Promote research on the legal, administrative and other problems common to these international associations, especially in their contacts with governmental bodies
* Contribute to a universal order based on principles of human dignity, solidarity of peoples and freedom of association and communication

==History==
The two founders started work setting up the Central Office of International Organisations and then conducting a survey of international organisations with headquarters in Belgium. Then with the help of the sociologist [[Cyril van Overbergh]] they extend this research to organisations based elsewhere.&lt;ref name="WELIS"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rayward |first1=W.

[[File:World Heritage Logo global.svg|thumb|[[Logo]] of the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage Committee]]]]

A '''World Heritage site''' is a landmark or area which is selected by the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] ([[UNESCO]]) as having cultural,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. Marshall Rev. Intell. Prop. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt; historical, scientific or other form of significance, and is legally protected by international treaties. The sites are judged important to the collective interests of humanity.

To be selected, a World Heritage site must be an already classified landmark, unique in some respect as a geographically and historically identifiable place having special cultural or physical significance (such as an ancient ruin or  historical structure, building, city, complex, desert, forest, island, lake, monument, mountain, or [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12976/full wilderness area]). It may signify a remarkable accomplishment of humanity, and serve as evidence of our intellectual history on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Centre|first1=UNESCO World Heritage|title=The Criteria for Selection|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=1 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sites are intended for practical conservation for posterity, which otherwise would be subject to risk from human or animal trespassing, unmonitored/uncontrolled/unrestricted access, or threat from local administrative negligence. Sites are demarcated by UNESCO as protected zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Heritage|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630023048/http://whc.unesco.org/en/about/|archivedate=30 June 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lists of World Heritage Sites|The list]] is maintained by the international World Heritage Program administered by the UNESCO [[World Heritage Committee]], composed of 21 states parties which are elected by their General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|title=The World Heritage Committee|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Site|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109181158/http://whc.unesco.org/en/comittee/|archivedate=9 November 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The programme catalogues, names, and conserves sites of outstanding [[cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage|natural]] importance to the common culture and heritage of [[World population|humanity]]. Under certain conditions, listed sites can obtain funds from the World Heritage Fund. The program began with the ''Convention Concerning the Protection of the World's Cultural and Natural Heritage'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf Convention Concerning the Protection of World's Cultural and Natural Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704214349/http://whc.unesco.org/archive/convention-en.pdf |date=4 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] on 16 November 1972. Since then, 193 state parties have ratified the convention, making it one of the most widely recognized international agreements and the world's most popular cultural program.

As of July 2018, a total of 1,092 World Heritage sites (845 cultural, 209 natural, and 38 mixed properties) exist across [[Table of World Heritage Sites by country|167 countries]]. [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|Italy]], with 54 sites, has the most of any country, followed by [[List of World Heritage Sites in China|China]] (53), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain|Spain]] (47), [[List of World Heritage Sites in France|France]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in Germany|Germany]] (44), [[List of World Heritage Sites in India|India]] (37), and [[List of World Heritage Sites in Mexico|Mexico]] (35).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https:/whc.unesco.org/en/list|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the government of [[Egypt]] decided to build the new [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]], whose resulting future reservoir would eventually [[Flood|inundate]] a large stretch of the [[Nile]] valley containing cultural treasures of [[ancient Egypt]] and ancient [[Nubia]]. In 1959, the governments of Egypt and [[Sudan]] requested UNESCO to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, the Director-General of UNESCO launched an appeal to the member states for an International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429024818/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172 |date=29 April 2009 }} World Heritage Convention, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; This appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites, the recovery of thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number of important temples, the most famous of which are the temple complexes of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]] and [[Philae]]. The campaign, which ended in 1980, was considered a success. As tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples: the [[Temple of Dendur]] was moved to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, the [[Temple of Debod]] was moved to the [[Parque del Oeste]] in Madrid, the [[Temple of Taffeh]] was moved to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in the Netherlands, and the [[Temple of Ellesyia]] to [[Museo Egizio]] in Turin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227222650/http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ |date=27 February 2015 }}, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;

The project cost $80&amp;nbsp;million, about $40&amp;nbsp;million of which was collected from 50 countries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} The project's success led to other safeguarding campaigns: saving [[Venice]] and its [[Venetian Lagoon|lagoon]] in Italy, the ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]] in Pakistan, and the [[Borobodur]] Temple Compounds in Indonesia. UNESCO then initiated, with the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], a draft convention to protect the common cultural heritage of humanity. {{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Convention and background===
The United States initiated the idea of cultural conservation with nature conservation. The [[White House]] conference in 1965 called for a "World Heritage Trust" to preserve "the world's superb natural and scenic areas and historic sites for the present and the future of the entire world citizenry". The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] developed similar proposals in 1968, and they were presented in 1972 to the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in [[Stockholm]]. Under the World Heritage Committee, signatory countries are required to produce and submit periodic [[data reporting]] providing the World Heritage Committee with an overview of each participating nation's implementation of the World Heritage Convention and a "snapshot" of current conditions at World Heritage properties.

A single text was agreed on by all parties, and the "Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage" was adopted by the General Conference of UNESCO on 16 November 1972.

The Convention came into force on 17 December 1975. As of May 2017, it has been ratified by 193 states parties,&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|title=States Parties – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|website=whc.unesco.org|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 189 [[UN member states]] plus the [[Cook Islands]], the [[Holy See]], [[Niue]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. Only four UN member states have not ratified the Convention: Liechtenstein, Nauru, Somalia and Tuvalu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage: Treaty status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130719235637/http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13055&amp;language=E |date=19 July 2013 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nominating process&lt;!--This section is linkedd from Citadel of Arbil--&gt;==

A country must first list its significant cultural and natural sites; the result is called the Tentative List. A country may not nominate sites that have not been first included on the Tentative List. Next, it can place sites selected from that list into a Nomination File.

The Nomination File is evaluated by the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]] and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|World Conservation Union]]. These bodies then make their recommendations to the World Heritage Committee. The Committee meets once per year to determine whether or not to inscribe each nominated property on the World Heritage List and sometimes defers or refers the decision to request more information from the country which nominated the site. There are ten selection criteria – a site must meet at least one of them to be included on the list.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | title=The Operational Guidelines for the Implementation of the World Heritage Convention | publisher=UNESCO | accessdate=10 July 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714073431/http://whc.unesco.org/en/guidelines/ | archivedate=14 July 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selection criteria==
Up to 2004, there were six criteria for cultural heritage and four criteria for natural heritage. In 2005, this was modified so that there is now only one set of ten criteria. Nominated sites must be of "outstanding universal value" and meet at least one of the ten criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|title=Criteria for Selection|publisher=World Heritage|accessdate=14 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612152223/http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/|archivedate=12 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These criteria have been modified or/amended several times since their creation.

&lt;/ol&gt;

===Legal status of designated sites===
UNESCO designation as a World Heritage site provides ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence that such culturally sensitive sites are legally protected pursuant to the Law of War, under the [[Geneva Convention]], its articles, protocols and customs, together with other treaties including the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] and international law.

Thus, the Geneva Convention treaty promulgates:

"Article 53. PROTECTION OF CULTURAL OBJECTS AND OF PLACES OF WORSHIP. Without prejudice to the provisions of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict of 14 May 1954,' and of other relevant international instruments, it is prohibited:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=UN General Assembly |authorlink=United Nations General Assembly |date=1979 |origyear=8 June 1977 |title=UN Treaty No. 17512 |series=Treaty Series |url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |format=PDF |work='Volume 1125-1' UN |page=27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309204240/http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201125/volume-1125-I-17512-English.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:(a) To commit any acts of hostility directed against the historic monuments, works of art or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples;
:(b) To use such objects in support of the military effort;
:(c) To make such objects the object of reprisals."

==Extensions and other modifications==
A country may request to extend or reduce the boundaries, modify the official name, or change the selection criteria of one of its already listed sites. Any proposal for a significant boundary change or modify the site's selection criteria must be submitted as if it were a new nomination, including first placing it on the Tentative List and then onto the Nomination File.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

A request for a minor boundary change, one that does not have a significantly impact on the extent of the property or affect its "outstanding universal value", is also evaluated by the advisory bodies before being sent to the Committee. Such proposals can be rejected by either the advisory bodies or the Committee if they judge it to be a significant change instead of a minor one.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Proposals to change the site's official name is sent directly to the Committee.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

==Endangered sites==
{{main|List of World Heritage in Danger|Former UNESCO World Heritage sites}}

A site may be added to the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] if there are conditions that threaten the characteristics for which the landmark or area was inscribed on the World Heritage List. Such problems may involve armed conflict and war, natural disasters, pollution, poaching, or uncontrolled urbanization or human development. This danger list is intended to increase international awareness of the threats and to encourage counteractive measures. Threats to a site can be either proven imminent threats or potential dangers that could have adverse effects on a site.&lt;ref name="UNESCO-WHinDanger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|title=List of World Heritage in Danger|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321040701/http://whc.unesco.org/en/158/|archivedate=21 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of conservation for each site on the danger list is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List.&lt;ref name="WHS Guidelines"/&gt;

Only two sites have ever been [[Former UNESCO World Heritage sites|delisted]]: the [[Arabian Oryx Sanctuary]] in Oman and the [[Dresden Elbe Valley]] in Germany. The Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted in 2007, instead of first being put on the danger list, after the Omani government decided to reduce the protected area's size by 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|title=Oman's Arabian Oryx Sanctuary: first site ever to be deleted from UNESCO's World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118001455/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/362|archivedate=18 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dresden Elbe Valley was first placed on the danger list in 2006 when the World Heritage Committee decided that plans to construct the [[Waldschlösschen Bridge]] would significantly alter the valley's landscape. In response, the Dresden City Council attempted to stop the bridge's construction, but after several court decisions allowed the building of the bridge to proceed, the valley was removed from the World Heritage List in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522|title=Dresden is deleted from UNESCO’s World Heritage List|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707003437/http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/522/|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first global assessment to quantitatively measure [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320716310138 threats to Natural World Heritage sites] found that 63 percent of sites have been damaged by increasing [https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12558 human pressures] including encroaching roads, agriculture infrastructure and settlements over the last two decades. These activities endanger Natural World Heritage sites and could compromise their unique values. Of the Natural World Heritage sites that contain forest, 91 percent of those experienced some loss since the year 2000. Many Natural World Heritage sites are more threatened than previously thought and require immediate conservation action.

There are 1092 World Heritage sites located in 167 states. Of these, 845 are cultural, 209 are natural and 38 are mixed properties. The World Heritage Committee has divided the world into five geographic zones which it calls regions: Africa, Arab states, Asia and the Pacific, Europe and North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean.

Russia and the [[Caucasus]] states are classified as European, while Mexico and the Caribbean are classified as belonging to the Latin America &amp; Caribbean zone, despite their location in North America. The UNESCO geographic zones also give greater emphasis on administrative, rather than geographic associations. Hence, [[Gough Island]], located in the South Atlantic, is part of the Europe &amp; North America region because the government of the United Kingdom nominated the site.

The table below includes a breakdown of the sites according to these zones and their classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|title=World Heritage List Statistics|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514002820/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/stat|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|title=UNESCO World Heritage Centre - World Heritage List|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027174218/http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;l=en&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;mode=table&amp;order=region|archivedate=27 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Despite the successes of World Heritage listing in promoting conservation, the UNESCO administered project has attracted criticism from some for perceived under-representation of heritage sites outside Europe, disputed decisions on site selection and adverse impact of mass tourism on sites unable to manage rapid growth in visitor numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barron|first1=Laignee|title='Unesco-cide': does world heritage status do cities more harm than good?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/30/unescocide-world-heritage-status-hurt-help-tourism|accessdate=3 September 2017|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vallely|first1=Paul|title=The Big Question: What is a World Heritage Site, and does the accolade make a difference?|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|work=The Independent|date=7 November 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192333/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/the-big-question-what-is-a-world-heritage-site-and-does-the-accolade-make-a-difference-997955.html|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sizable [[Lobbying|lobbying industry]] has grown around the awards because World Heritage listing has the potential to significantly increase tourism revenue from sites selected. Site listing bids are often lengthy and costly, putting poorer countries at a disadvantage. Eritrea's efforts to promote [[Asmara]] are one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Modernist masterpieces in unlikely Asmara|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|work=The Economist|date=20 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170715102559/https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2016/07/architecture-eritrea?zid=317|archivedate=15 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Australian government was reported to have successfully lobbied for [[Great Barrier Reef]] conservation efforts to be removed from a UNESCO report titled 'World Heritage and Tourism in a Changing Climate'. The Australian government's actions were in response to their concern about the negative impact that an 'at risk' label could have on tourism revenue at a previously designated UNESCO World Heritage site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slezak|first1=Michael|title=Australia scrubbed from UN climate change report after government intervention|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|work=The Guardian|date=26 May 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027130133/https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention|archivedate=27 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hasham|first1=Nicole|title=Government spent at least $400,000 lobbying against Great Barrier Reef 'danger' listing|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=17 September 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228235450/http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/government-spent-at-least-400000-lobbying-against-great-barrier-reef-danger-listing-20150914-gjlwr2.html|archivedate=28 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of listed World Heritage locations such as [[George Town, Penang]], and [[Casco Viejo, Panama]], have struggled to strike the balance between the economic benefits of catering to greatly increased visitor numbers and preserving the original culture and local communities that drew the recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maurel|first1=Cholé|title=The unintended consequences of UNESCO world heritage listing|url=https://theconversation.com/the-unintended-consequences-of-unesco-world-heritage-listing-71047|accessdate=4 September 2017|publisher=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Map at Lake Klejtrup''' ({{lang-da|Verdenskortet ved Klejtrup Sø}}) is a miniature [[world map]] built of stones and grass in [[Klejtrup Sø]] near the village of [[Klejtrup]], [[Viborg Municipality]], [[Denmark]].

In 1943, Søren Poulsen, a local farmer, was working on the drainage of the surrounding meadows when he found a stone shaped like the [[Jutland]] peninsula.  This inspired him to create a small world of his own.&lt;ref name=amazing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amusingplanet.com/2015/11/the-world-map-at-lake-klejtrup.html |title=The World Map at Lake Klejtrup  |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |date=November 21, 2015 |format= |work=Amusing Planet }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter months, with the use of primitive tools, he placed big stones carefully on the ice.  When spring arrived, the stones could easily be tilted into place, and in this way the World Map took shape. Some of the stones used weighted more than 2 tonnes.&lt;ref name=ripley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ripleys.com/blog/world-map/ |title=Man Builds Entire World Map in His Back Yard |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |date=December 2, 2015 |format= |work=Ripley's Believe it or Not |publisher=Ripley Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Poulsen created the World Map between 1944 and 1969.  It measures 45 by 90 metres (49 by 98 yards), covering an area of over 4000 square meters (1 acre).&lt;ref name=amazing /&gt; &lt;ref name=bigthink&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigthink.com/strange-maps/a-very-danish-map-of-the-world |title=A Very Danish Map of the World |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |last=Jacobs |first=Frank |work=Big Think |publisher=The Big Think Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; One 111-kilometre (69 mi) [[Degree (angle)|degree]] of [[latitude]] corresponds to 27 centimetres (11 [[inch|inches]]) on the map.&lt;ref name=amazing /&gt; &lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; On Poulsen's map, [[Antarctica]] is not present and the [[Northern Hemisphere]] is marked in two places, ensuring a better impression of the correct distances between the countries to avoid the difficulties of spreading out our planet's globular shape.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; Red poles mark the [[equator]], and each country is represented by miniature flags, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/02/priority-world-map-lake-klejtrup-danish-farmer-spent-last-25-years-life-built-version-world/ |title=The World Map at Lake Klejtrup: A Danish farmer spent the last 25 years of his life building his own miniature version of the world |accessdate=September 9, 2016 |publisher=The Vintage News }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=ripley /&gt; which are updated yearly.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt; State borders in the [[United States of America]] are marked with yellow bricks; Poulsen lived 20 years in America.&lt;ref name=bigthink /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2580">[[File:CH-24 WAC 41 North.png|thumb|FAA World Aeronautical Chart, showing the northern part of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]]]

A '''World Aeronautical Chart''' (WAC) is a type of [[aeronautical chart]] used for navigation by [[aviator|pilot]]s of moderate speed aircraft and aircraft at high altitudes. They are at a [[scale (map)|scale]] of 1:1,000,000 (about 1 inch = 13.7 nautical miles or 16 statute miles).

These charts are similar to [[sectional chart]]s, and the symbols are the same.  However, there is less detail at the smaller scale, so it is seldom used for [[visual flight rules]] flight at slower speeds or for local flights.  WACs show [[topographic]] information, airports and radio [[navigational aid]]s. They are useful for strategic flight planning, where a view of the entire flight area is useful.

These charts are revised annually, except for several [[Alaska]]n charts and the [[Mexico|Mexican]]/[[Caribbean]] charts which are revised every 2 years. [[Australia]]n WAC charts are amended every 3 to 5 years. On June 25, 2015, the USA's Federal Aviation Administration  announced the discontinuation of all WACs covering the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/safety_alerts/media/ChartingNotice_EVCG_15-02.pdf FAA: World Aeronautical Chart Discontinuance]&lt;/ref&gt;

A set of 12 WACs covered the continental United States and 8 others covered Alaska. [[Canada|Canadian]] airspace is covered by a set of 18 WACs. The 43 Australian WACs are indexed according to a geographic name or a corresponding 4-digit number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airservices.gov.au/store/coveragemaps.asp?pg=60 Airservices Australia Online Store]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike sectional charts, North American WACs are named according to an international "grid system" having a combination of letters and numbers. For example, WAC CF-16 covered the [[Pacific Northwest]], and E-15 covers the [[British Columbia]] area. Letters progress from A at the [[north pole]] to U at the southern tip of [[Argentina]]. The numbers generally progress from 1 at the [[Greenwich meridian]] and increasing to the east, to a maximum of 29, depending upon the number of charts required at that [[latitude]].

In summary, estimates for the progression of world population since the late medieval period are in the following ranges:
{|class="wikitable"

[https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/DataQuery/ UN World Population Prospect 2017] gives a "median" estimate of 11.2 billion for 2100, with a "95% confidence interval" between 10 and 13 billion.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Estimates for pre-modern times are necessarily fraught with great uncertainties, and few of the published estimates have [[confidence interval]]s; in the absence of a straightforward means to assess the error of such estimates, a rough idea of expert consensus can be gained by comparing the values given in independent publications. Population estimates cannot be considered accurate to more than two decimal digits;
for example, world population for the year 2012 was estimated at
7.02,  7.06 and 7.08 billion by the  [[United States Census Bureau]], the [[Population Reference Bureau]]  and the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], respectively, corresponding to 
a spread of estimates of the order of 0.8%.

==Deep prehistory==
{{further|Paleodemography}}
[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|350px|Graph of world population over the past 12,000 years ([[Holocene]]).]]
As a general rule, the confidence of estimates on historical world population decreases for the more distant past. 
Robust population data only exists for the last two or three centuries. Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in [[Census in Egypt|Ancient Egypt]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt, A. (1995). ''The Ancient Near East, c. 3000–330 BCE''. Vol. 2. London: Routledge. p. 695.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Published estimates for the 1st century ("[[AD 1]]") suggest an uncertainty of the order of 50% (estimates range between 150 and 330 million).
Some estimates extend their timeline into deep prehistory, to "[[10,000 BC]]", i.e. the  [[Holocene|early Holocene]],  when world population estimates range roughly between one and ten million (with an uncertainty of up to an order of magnitude).&lt;ref&gt;Thomlinson (1975): "one to ten million".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22560092 | doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.04.003 | pmc=3376494 | volume=90 | title=Mitochondrial DNA signals of late glacial recolonization of Europe from near eastern refugia | year=2012 | journal=Am.

Estimates for yet deeper prehistory, into the [[Paleolithic]], are of a different nature. At this time human populations consisted entirely of non-sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] populations, with [[anatomically modern humans]] existing alongside [[Archaic humans|archaic human varieties]], some of which are still ancestral to the modern human population due to  [[archaic human admixture with modern humans|interbreeding with modern humans]] during the [[Upper Paleolithic]]. 
Estimates of the size of these populations are a topic of [[paleoanthropology]]. A late human [[population bottleneck]] is postulated by some scholars at approximately 70,000 years ago, during the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba catastrophe]], when ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' population may have dropped to as low as between 1,000 and 10,000 individuals.&lt;ref name=ambrose1998&gt;{{cite journal

For the time of speciation of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', some 200,000 years ago,  an [[effective population size]] of the order of 10,000  to 30,000 individuals has been estimated, with an actual "census population" of early ''Homo sapiens'' of roughly 100,000 to 300,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Per Sjödin, Agnès E Sjöstrand, Mattias Jakobsson and Michael G B Blum, "Resequencing data provide no evidence for a human bottleneck in Africa during the penultimate glacial period" Mol ''Biol Evol'' (2012) doi: 10.1093/molbev/mss061. "A small human effective population size, on the order of 10,000 individuals, which is smaller than the effective population size of most great apes, has been interpreted as a result of a very long history, starting ∼ 2 mya, of a small population size, coined as the long-necked bottle model (Harpending et al. 1998; Hawks et al. 2000). Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis, but, depending on the mutation rate, we find either an effective population size of NA = 12,000 (95% C.I. = 9,000–15,500 when averaging over all three demographic models) using the mutation rate calibrated with the human-chimp divergence or an effective population size of NA = 32,500 individuals (95% C.I. = 27,500–34,500) using the mutation rate given by whole-genome trio analysis (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium 2010) (supplementary figure 4 and table 6, Supplementary Material online). Not surprisingly, the estimated effective mutation rates θ = 4NAµ are comparable for the two mutation rates we considered, and are equal to 1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;/bp/generation (95% C.I. = (1.1–1.7) × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;). Relating the estimated effective population size to the census population size during the Pleistocene is a difficult task because there are many factors affecting the effective population size (Charlesworth 2009). Nevertheless, based on published estimates of the ratio between effective and census population size, a comprehensive value on the order of 10% has been found by Frankham (1995). This 10% rule roughly predicts that 120,000−325,[0]00 individuals (depending on the assumed mutation rate)"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Cumulative population}}{{anchor|Number of humans who have ever lived}}
The question of "how many people have ever lived?" or "what percentage of people who have ever lived are alive today" can be traced to the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Haub (1995): "at some time back in the 1970s, some now-forgotten writer made the statement that 75 percent of the people who had ever been born were alive at that moment." 
Haub (1995) is the basis of a 2007 article in Scientific American, {{cite web|title=Fact or Fiction|website=Scientificamerican.com|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-living-outnumber-dead/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The more dramatic phrasing of "the living outnumber the dead" also dates to the 1970s, a time of [[population explosion]] and growing fears of [[human overpopulation]] in the wake of [[decolonization]] and before the adoption of China's [[one-child policy]].
The claim that "the living outnumber the dead" was never accurate (although it may be roughly accurate if only [[Effective population size|ancestral population]] is considered). [[Arthur C. Clarke]] in ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) has the claim that "Behind every man now alive stand 30 ghosts, for that is the ratio by which the dead outnumber the living", which was roughly accurate at the time of writing.&lt;ref&gt;
Wesley Stephenson, [https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16870579 Do the dead outnumber the living?], BBC News 4 February 2012.
Ciara Curtin, [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-living-outnumber-dead/ Fact or Fiction?: Living People Outnumber the Dead], Scientific American,  1 March  2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates of the "total number of people who have ever lived" is 107.6 billion as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Kapitza, 'The phenomenological theory of world population growth', ''Physics-Uspekhi'' 39(1) 57–71 (1996) cites estimates ranging between 80 and 150 billion (Sergei P Kapitza, 'The phenomenological theory of world population growth', ''Physics-Uspekhi'' 39(1) 57–71, 1996), citing K. M. Weiss, ''Human Biology'' 56637, 1984, and N. Keyfitz, ''Applied Mathematical Demography'', New York: Wiley, 1977). 
Haub (1995) cited 105 billion, updated to 107 billion as of 2011 in {{Cite web |last=Haub |first=Carl |date=October 2011 |title=How Many People Have Ever Lived on Earth? |publisher=[[Population Reference Bureau]] |url=http://www.prb.org/Articles/2002/HowManyPeopleHaveEverLivedonEarth.aspx |accessdate=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The answer naturally depends on the definition of "people", i.e. is only ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' to be counted, or all of genus ''[[Homo]]'', but due to the small population sizes in the Lower Paleolithic, the order of magnitude of the estimate is not affected by the choice of cut-off date substantially more than by the uncertainty of estimates throughout the Neolithic to Iron Age.&lt;ref&gt;Haub (1995): "Clearly, the period 8000 B.C. to 1 A.D. is key to the magnitude of our number, but, unfortunately, little is known about that era. ... of course, pushing the date of humanity's arrival on the planet before 50,000 B.C. would also raise the number, although perhaps not by terribly much."&lt;/ref&gt;
The estimate is more crucially affected by the estimate of [[infant mortality|infant mortalities]] vs. [[stillborn]] infants, due to the very high infant mortality throughout the pre-modern period. An estimate on the "total number of people who have ever lived" as of 1995 was calculated by Haub (1995) at "about 105 billion births since the dawn of the human race" with a cut-off date at 50,000 BC (beginning of the Upper Paleolithic), and an inclusion of a high infant mortality rate throughout pre-modern history.&lt;ref&gt;Haub (1995): "Life expectancy at birth probably averaged only about 10 years for most of human history.  Estimates of average life expectancy in Iron Age France have been put at only 10 or 12 years. Under these conditions, the birth rate would have to be about 80 per 1,000 people just for the species to survive. ... Our birth rate assumption will greatly affect the estimate of the number of persons ever born. Infant mortality in the human  race's earliest days is thought to have been very high—perhaps 500 infant deaths per 1,000 births, or even higher. ...
Birth rates were set at 80 per 1,000 per year through 1 A.D. and at 60 per 1,000 from 2 A.D. to 1750. Rates then declined to the low 30s by the modern period.  (For a brief bibliography of sources consulted in the course of this alchemy, see [Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones 1978])."
"So, our estimate here is that about 5.5 percent of all people ever born are alive today."
Using the UN estimates for birth rates ({{cite web|url=http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=world+population&amp;d=PopDiv&amp;f=variableID%3A53%3BcrID%3A900 |title=UNdata: Crude birth rate  |publisher=United Nations |date=25 August 2011}}) and world population (U.S. Census Bureau, International Data Base), there were an estimated 3.0 billion births during 1995–2016, so that based on the estimate by Haub (1995), the figures for 2017 would be "about 108 billion births" and "about 7 percent of all people ever born are alive today."&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of the world reached 1 billion in 1804, 2 billion in 1927, 3 billion in 1960, 4 billion in 1974, 5 billion in 1987, and 6 billion in 1999. The population of the world is projected to reach 7 billion in 2012, 8 billion in 2025, and 9 billion in 2040.

===Before 1950===
The following table uses [[astronomical year numbering]] for dates, negative numbers corresponding roughly to the corresponding year BC (i.e. -10000 = 10,001 BC, etc.). The table starts counting around the [[Late Glacial Maximum]] period, in which ice retreated and humans started to spread into the northern hemisphere.

From the beginning of the [[early modern period]] until the 20th century, world population has been characterized by a faster-than-exponential growth.
For the period of [[Classical Antiquity]] to the [[Middle Ages]], roughly 500 BC to AD 1500, there has also been a general tendency of growth (estimated at roughly a factor 4 to 5 over the  2,000 year period), but not strictly [[Monotonic function|monotonic]]: A noticeable dip in world population is assumed due to the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century.&lt;ref name=Haub1650/&gt;

===1950 to present===
For times after [[World War II]], demographic data of some accuracy becomes available for a significant number of countries, and population estimates are often given as grand totals of numbers (typically given by country) of widely diverging accuracies. Some sources give these numbers rounded to the nearest million or the nearest thousand, while others give them without any rounding.

Taking these numbers at face value would 
be [[false precision]]; in spite of being stated to four, seven or even ten digits, they should not be interpreted as accurate to more than three digits at best (estimates by the [[United States Census Bureau]] and by the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|United Nations]] differ by about 0.5&amp;ndash;1.5%).

[[File:World-Population-1800-2100.svg|thumb|300px|World population estimates from 1800 to 2100, based on "high", "medium" and "low" [http://esa.un.org/wpp/unpp/panel_population.htm United Nations projections in 2010] (colored red, orange and green) and [https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/worldhis.html US Census Bureau historical estimates] (in black). Actual recorded population figures (as of 2010) are colored in blue. According to the highest estimate, the world population may rise to 16 [[thousand million|billion]] by 2100; according to the lowest estimate, it may decline to 6 billion.]]

{{asof|2015}}, the population of the world is projected to reach 8 billion in 2025, and 9 billion by about 2040/42. Kapitza (1996) estimated an asymptotic limit of population growth of 14 billion,  90% of which (12.6 billion) expected to be reached by 2135.&lt;ref&gt;"The expression for growth (6) indicates a limit for world population  N=πK&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=14×10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;, in the foreseeable future. Of this asymptotic limit 90% will be reached for Model III by year 2135, or in 3T years after T1 = 2007."
Sergei P. Kapitza, 'The phenomenological theory of world population growth', ''[[Physics-Uspekhi]]'' 39(1) 57-71 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasonable predictions of population development are possible for the next 30 years or so, representing the period of fertility of the children alive today. Projections of population reaching more than one generation into the future are highly speculative: Thus, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs report of 2004 projected the world population to peak at 9.22 billion in 2075 and then stabilise at a value close to 9 billion;&lt;ref name=un-esa1&gt;United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.  ''[https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf World Population to 2300]''.  2004. Executive Summary, Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; 
By contrast, a 2014 projection by the United Nations Population Division predicts a population close to 11 billion by 2100 without any declining trend in the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name = Science&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1257469| pmid = 25301627| title = World population stabilization unlikely this century| journal = Science| volume = 346| issue = 6206| pages = 234–7| publisher  = AAAS| date = September 14, 2014| url  = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/09/17/science.1257469| issn  =  1095-9203| last1 = Gerland | first1 = P.| last2 = Raftery | first2 = A.

Population estimates for world regions based on Maddison (2007),&lt;ref&gt;Angus Maddison, The World Economy: Historical Statistics,   Statistical Appendix (2007, ggdc.net).
Estimates cited are for the beginning of the 1st millennium ("year 0"), the beginning of the 2nd millennium ("year 1000"), and for the beginning each century since the 16th (years 1820 and 1913 are given for the 19th and 20th century, respectively, as Maddison presents detailed estimates for these years), and a projection for the year 2030.&lt;/ref&gt;  in millions.
The row showing total world population includes the average growth rate per year over the period separating each column from the preceding one.

When considering population estimates by world region, it is worth noting that [[population history of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]] before the 1492 voyage of Christopher Columbus has proven difficult to establish, with many historians arguing for an estimate of 50 million people throughout the Americas, and some estimating that populations may have reached 100 million people or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NPoAQRgkrOcC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=pre-Columbian+population+million&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=pre-Columbianpopulationmillion&amp;f=false|title=American Colonies|last=Taylor|first=Alan|date=2002|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780142002100|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore estimated by some that populations in Mexico, Central, and South America could have reached 37 million by 1492.&lt;ref&gt;"La catastrophe démographique" (The Demographic Catastrophe"), ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n°322, July–August 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the population estimate of 2 million for North America for the same time period represents the low end of modern estimates, and some estimate the population to have been as high as 18 million.&lt;ref&gt;Dobyns, Henry (1983).
