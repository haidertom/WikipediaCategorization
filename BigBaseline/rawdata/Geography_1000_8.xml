The '''Age of Sail''' (usually dated as 1571–1862) was a period roughly corresponding to the [[early modern period]] in which [[international trade]] and [[naval warfare]] were dominated by [[sailing ship]]s, lasting from the 16th to the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |title=The Age of Sail |publisher=[[HMS Trincomalee|HMS ''Trincomalee'']] |accessdate=12 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316114603/http://www.hms-trincomalee.co.uk/history/the-age-of-sail |archive-date=2016-03-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition==
Like most [[History by period|periodic eras]] the definition is inexact but close enough to serve as a general description. The age of sail runs roughly from the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, the last significant engagement in which [[oar]]-propelled [[galley]]s played a major role, to the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in 1862, in which the steam-powered [[ironclad]] [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']] destroyed the sailing ships [[USS Cumberland (1842)|USS ''Cumberland'']] and [[USS Congress (1841)|USS ''Congress'']], demonstrating that the advance of [[steam power]] had rendered sail power in warfare obsolete.

The [[Suez Canal]], in the Middle-East, which opened in 1869, was impractical for sailing ships, and made steamboats faster on the [[European-Asian sea route]].

==Golden Age of Sail==
The period between 1850 and the early 20th century when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity is sometimes referred to as the "Golden Age of Sail".&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html "Sailing Ship Rigs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228161737/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/mma/AtoZ/rigs.html |date=2010-12-28 }}. [[Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]]&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the efficiency and use of commercial sailing vessels was at its peak&amp;mdash;immediately before [[steamboat]]s started to take trade away from sail.

==Decline==
Sailing ships sometimes continued to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s, even if steamships also were used for such transports and became more and more common. Sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered; thus they tended to be more independent from requiring a dedicated support base on the mainland. Crucially though, steam-powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam-powered vessels from the necessity of following [[trade wind]]s. As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in half the time it took a sailing ship. 

Sailing vessels were pushed into narrower and narrower economic niches and gradually disappeared from commercial trade. Today, sailing vessels are only economically viable for small scale coastal fishing, along with recreational uses such as [[yachting]] and passenger sail excursion ships.

The '''American Cordillera''' is a chain of [[mountain range]]s ([[cordillera]]s) that consists of an almost continuous sequence of [[mountain range]]s that form the western "backbone" of [[North America]], [[South America]] and [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name="cw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Geology Notes - The Breakup of Pangea and Deformation in the Western Cordillera|url=http://myweb.cwpost.liu.edu/vdivener/notes/west_cord.htm|website=Long Island University, C.W. Post Campus faculty website|accessdate=June 25, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001124708/http://myweb.cwpost.liu.edu/vdivener/notes/west_cord.htm|archivedate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the backbone of the [[volcanic arc]] that forms the eastern half of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].

From north to south, this sequence of overlapping and parallel ranges begins with the [[Alaska Range]] and the [[Brooks Range]] in [[Alaska]] and runs through the [[Yukon]] into [[British Columbia]]. The main belt of the [[Rocky Mountains]] along with the parallel [[Columbia Mountains]] and [[Pacific Coast Ranges|Coast Ranges]] of mountains and islands continue through British Columbia and [[Vancouver Island]]. In the [[United States]], the Cordillera branches include the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]], the [[Sierra Nevadas (US)|Sierra Nevada]], the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]], and various small [[Pacific Coast Ranges|Pacific coastal ranges]]. In [[Mexico]], the Cordillera continues through the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] and [[Sierra Madre Oriental]], as well as the backbone mountains of the [[Baja California peninsula]].

The ranges of the Cordillera from Mexico northwards are collectively called the [[North American Cordillera]] or [[Western Cordillera (North America)|Western Cordillera]] in the United States and Canada, and also named as the [[Canadian Cordillera]] or Pacific Cordillera in Canada.

The Cordillera continues on through the mountain ranges of [[Central America]] in [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], and [[Panama]], and becomes the [[Andes Mountains]] of [[South America]]. The Andes with their parallel chains and the island chains off the coast of [[Chile]] continue through [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]] to the very tip of South America at [[Tierra del Fuego]]. The Cordillera continues along the [[Scotia Arc]] before reaching the mountains of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of//1998/of98-140/|title=The North American Cordillera:  A Color Shaded-Relief Map in Oblique Mercator Projection About the Pacific-North America Pole of Rotation, Scale Circa 1:5,000,000|website=pubs.usgs.gov|access-date=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''boundary marker''', '''border marker''', '''boundary stone''', or '''border stone''' is a robust physical marker that identifies the start of a land [[Border|boundary]] or the change in a boundary, especially a change in direction of a boundary.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; There are several other types of named border markers, known as '''pillars''', '''obelisks''', and '''corners'''.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;  Border markers can also be markers through which a border line runs in a straight line to determine that border.&lt;ref name="straight-border"&gt;{{cite conference | title=AN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE – Longitude 129 degrees east, and why it is not the longest, straight line in the world | publisher=Eyepiece – Official Organ of The Institution of Surveyors, Australia, W.A. Division | accessdate=15 January 2012 | author=Porter, John | conference=National Perspectives – 32nd Australian Surveyors Congress Technical Papers 31 March – 6 April 1990 | location=Canberra: The Institution | pages=18–24 |date=June 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also be the markers from which a border marker has been fixed.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;

==Purpose ==
According to Josiah Ober, boundary markers are "a way of imposing human, cultural, social meanings upon a once-undifferentiated natural environment." Boundary markers are linked to social hierarchies, since they derive their meaning from the authority of a person or group to declare the limits of a given space of land for political, social or religious reasons. Ober notes that "determining who can use parcels of arable land and for what purpose, has immediate and obvious economic implications."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Ober, Josiah. "Greek Horoi: Artifactual Texts and the Contingency of Meaning." ''Methods in the Mediterranean: Historical and Archaeological Views of Texts and Archaeology.'' Ed. David. B. Small. Leiden: Brill, 1995. URL: http://www.stanford.edu/group/dispersed_author/docs/GreekHoroi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many borders were drawn along invisible lines of [[latitude]] or [[longitude]], which often created a need to mark these borders on the ground, as accurately as possible, using the technology of the day.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; Advances in [[GPS]] technology have shown that there are many borders inaccurately marked on the ground.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;

Boundary markers have often been used to mark critical points{{clarify|date=February 2016}} on political boundaries, i.e. those between countries, [[Federated state|states]] or local administrations, but have also been used to mark out the limits of private landholdings, especially in areas where fences or walls are impractical or unnecessary.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In developed countries the use of markers for land ownership has in many places been replaced by maps and land ownership registration. Boundary markers are not legal markers in Western countries and may have troublesome legal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairview-industries.com/gismodule/PartTwoMisplacedBoundary.html |title=Cadastral Information For GIS Specialists - Case Of The Misplaced Boundary Marker |publisher=Fairview-industries.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921084505/http://www.fairview-industries.com/gismodule/PartTwoMisplacedBoundary.html |archivedate=21 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, boundary markers have legal meaning in [[Japan]], and are generally installed across the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ja.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E6%B0%91%E6%B3%95%E7%AC%AC229%E6%9D%A1 Civil Law 229]; [http://www.hiroshima-chousashi.or.jp/kanri/kan0page.htm more information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103125854/http://www.hiroshima-chousashi.or.jp/kanri/kan0page.htm |date=3 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Markers are still used extensively for marking international borders, which are traditionally classified into two categories: natural boundaries, correlating to topographical features such as rivers or mountain ranges, and artificial boundaries, which have no obvious relation to topography. The latter category includes borders defined by boundary markers such as stones and walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Settlement of Boundary Disputes in International Law|last = Cukwurah|first = A. Oye|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 1967|location = Manchester|pages = 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; International boundary markers are placed and can be maintained by mutual agreement of the bordering countries.

==Construction==
Boundary markers, traditionally, were often made of [[Rock (geology)|stone]], but later many have been made with concrete or a mixture of materials.&lt;ref name="kimberley"&gt;

== History ==

=== Asia ===

==== China ====
The oldest known boundary stone in China is from Jiangsu Province. Dating from 12 A.D., it bears the inscription "the sea area from Jiaozhou Bay to the east of Guixan county belongs to Langya Shire and the waters from the south of Guixan county to the east of the estuary of Guanhe River belongs to Donghai Shire."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/regional/2015-05/18/content_20750795.htm|title = The boundary stone of Han Dynasty in Suma Bay  - China - Chinadaily.com.cn|last = 潘其|website = www.chinadaily.com.cn|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the border between Russia and China was formally demarcated with boundary stones as the result of the Treaty of Kiakhta in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = China Marches West: The Qing Conquest of Central Asia|last = Perdue|first = Peter C.|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2009|location = Cambridge, MA|pages = 289}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century, stones were used to outline the limits of the International Settlement in Shanghai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Britain and China, 1840-1970: Empire, Finance and War|author1=Bickers, Robert |author2=Jonathan J. Howlett |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Routledge|year = 2015|location = London|pages = 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thailand ====
In ancient Thailand, sacred boundary stones called ''Sema Hin'' delimited Buddhist temple precincts. In some cases they feature inscriptions recounting the history of the temple;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Phetsanghan, Phairot |author2= Songkoon Chantachon |author3= Boonsom Yodmalee |last-author-amp= yes|date = 2009|title = Sema Hin Isan, the Origin of the Temple Boundary Stones in Northeast Thailand|url = http://medwelljournals.com/abstract/?doi=sscience.2009.186.190|journal = The Social Sciences |volume=4 |pages=186–190|access-date = March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; others were carved with wheels of the law,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Art and Architecture of Thailand: From Prehistoric Times Through the Thirteenth Century|last = Woodward|first = Hiram, W.|publisher = Brill|year = 2003|location = Leiden|pages = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; while some specimens consist of unfinished stone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Art and Architecture of Thailand: From Prehistoric Times Through the Thirteenth Century|last = Woodward|first = Hiram W.|publisher = Brill|year = 2003|location = Leiden|pages = 100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to temples, ''sema'' could enclose statues of Buddha or sacred mounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Near East and Africa ===

==== Israel ====
According to B. S. Jackson, stones were put in place in ancient Israel to "mark the boundary of a territory (public or private), and to seek to deter potential violators of that boundary through the use of threats."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The World of Ancient Israel: Sociological, Anthropological and Political Perspectives|editor-last = Clements|editor-first = Ronald E. |publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1991|location = Cambridge|pages = 190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hebrew Bible contains a strict prohibition against the unauthorized displacement or removal of boundary markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Settlement of Boundary Disputes in International Law|last = Cukwurah|first = A. Oye|publisher = Manchester University Press|year = 1967|location = Manchester|pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Egypt ====
An example of boundary markers in ancient Egypt were the boundary stelae of Akhenaten. They defined the limits of the sacred city of Akhet-Aten, built by Akhenaten as the center of the Aten religious cult which he founded. Egyptologists categorize the stelae based on whether they are inscribed with the "Earlier Proclamation," a general explanation of why the location was selected and how the city would be designed, or the "Later Proclamation," which provides additional details about the perimeters of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Boundary Stelae of Akhenaten|last = Murnane|first = William J.|publisher = Kegan Paul Int.|year = 1993|location = London|pages = 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
[[File:German troops crossing the Soviet border.jpg|thumb|upright|German troops at the Soviet state border marker during [[Operation Barbarossa]], 1941]]

==== Finland ====
[[File:Kaavi, Pohjois-Savo.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|left|A typical roadside border marker in Finland, entering [[Kaavi]] municipality in [[Pohjois-Savo]] region.]]
[[Glacial erratic]]s and similar natural stones were often used as boundary markers between properties. Knowledge of their locations was typically maintained by oral tradition, wherein men of each house would walk the length of the border. These stones then became boundary markers for [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]], and eventually provinces and countries. For example, Kuhankuono is a stone that marks the [[Quadripoint#Multipoints of greater numerical complexity|multipoint]] border between seven municipalities in [[Kurjenrahka National Park]] near [[Turku]]. Today, however, steel rods topped with a cube painted orange are usually used. Municipalities often post a traffic sign featuring their coat of arms on the border on major roads. On the [[Finnish-Russian border]], many historical border stones, marked with Swedish and Imperial Russian symbols, are still in use. The actual Finnish-Russian border is marked by small white bollard, but on both sides of the border there are large striped bollards decorated with a coat of arms: a blue/white bollard on the Finnish side, a red/green bollard on the Russian side.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iltalehti.fi/uutiset/2015082320139715_uu.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial cairns are found on the Norway-Russia-Finland tripoint ([[Treriksrøysa]]) and Norway-Sweden-Finland tripoint ([[Three-Country Cairn]]). The Sweden-Finland border on [[Märket]] is marked with holes drilled to the rock, because seasonal [[pack ice]] can shear off any protruding markers. In folklore, a type of [[haltija]], ''rajahaltija'', a kind of a local spirit, was believed to haunt borders that had been unjustly moved.

==== Greece ====
The earliest reference to a boundary stone in Greek literature is in the ''Iliad'', which describes the goddess Athena using one as a projectile. Boundary stones, known as ''horos'', could be made of either carved or undressed stones, and were typically inscribed with the Greek word ''horos''. One such stone was used to indicate the edge of the Athenian ''agora''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The practice of separating areas of land with boundary stones, though common, was widely considered by classical writers to be a violation of the principle of communal land ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Science and Civilization in China: Volume 2, History of Scientific Thought|last = Needham|first = Joseph|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1956|location = Cambridge|pages = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rome ====
In ancient Roman religion, the god [[Terminus (god)|Terminus]] was worshiped as the patron god of boundary markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Settlement of International Boundary Disputes in International Law|last = Cukwurah|first = A.

==== Monaco ====
In 1828, the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] and the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]] established a physical border with 91 boundary stones, each numbered 1 to 91, running along the border from present-day [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]] to [[Menton|Menton-Garavan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://bornes.frontieres.free.fr/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to 1848, the Principality of Monaco included the villages of Roquebrune, Monti, Garavan and Menton.  Of the original 91 boundary stones only 12 remain: 6 within the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]], 3 in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin]], and 3 in [[Menton]].  The boundary stones numbered 9, 12, 15, and 31 are located in [[Monaco]].  Another stone has been cast in concrete in the Sainte-Cécile area of [[Monaco]] thus rendering its number illegible.  Stone number 55, originally located in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]], was given as a gift from the city of [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]] to the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]] and is now located in [[Monaco]]'s city hall.  Stones numbered 56, 57, and 58 are located in [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]].  Stones numbered 62, 71, and 73 are located in [[Menton]].  All the boundary stones have three engraved sides: one side with their individual numbers (1 to 91), one side with the letter "M" indicating [[Monaco]]'s territory, and one side with a cross (+) indicating the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia's territory.  The cross represents the coat of arms of the [[House of Savoy]], rulers of Piedmont-Sardinia.

===Western Australia===
The history of [[Western Australia border#Marking the WA border on the ground|marking the Western Australian border on the ground]] states that the "Austral Pillar" and the "Deakin Pillar" are points used to determine their position east of [[Greenwich]] and then fix a border from, in this case used to determine the line of the [[129th meridian east]] [[longitude]], as the [[Western Australia border|Western Australian border]].&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; The Deakin [[Obelisk]] and the Kimberley Obelisk in Australia are used in a slightly different way, in that a line is run north and south through a point on the obelisks, formed by a copper plug embedded into the top centre of the concrete obelisks.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt; The "corners" in Australia, such as [[Cameron Corner Survey Marker|Cameron Corner]], [[Haddon Corner]], [[Poeppel Corner]], and [[Surveyor Generals Corner]], are where multiple borders meet or a border changes direction.&lt;ref name="straight-border" /&gt;

==== Hawaii ====
The basic unit of the ancient Hawaiian land division system was the ''ahupua'a'', a self-sustaining agricultural district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hawaii: A History of the Big Island|last = Oaks|first = Robert|publisher = Arcadia Publishing|year = 2003|location = Charleston|pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The places where a road crossed the border of an ''ahupua'a'' were marked with distinctive altars, known as ''ahu'' or (stone) piles. These altars served not only as boundary markers but also as sites for the performance of religious rituals related to land taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Dictionary of Hawaiian Legal Land Terms|last = Lucas|first = Paul Nahoa|publisher = University of Hawaii Press|year = 1995|location = Honolulu|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.

==== Washington, D.C. ====
The original boundaries of the District of Columbia were marked using boundary stones. These were made of saw-cut sandstone blocks and stood two feet high when set in the ground. Ten boundary stones were placed along each side of the 100 square mile (259 square kilometer) district of Columbia. Although the original surveyors intended each side to be ten miles (16 kilometers) long, their measurements were often inaccurate, resulting in the sometimes significant misplacement of stones and the overall skewing of the District boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Woodward|first = Fred E.|date = 1907|title = A Ramble Along the Boundary Stones of the District of Columbia with a Camera|journal = Historical Society of Washington, D.C. |pages=63–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these discrepancies are intentional, because the ground at the exact mile point was covered in water; “in such cases,” Andrew Ellicott, the leader of the surveying crew, noted in 1793, “the stones are placed on the nearest firm ground and the true distance in miles and poles is marked on them”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Nye|first = Edwin Darby|date = 1971|title = Revisiting Washington's Forty Boundary Stones|journal = Historical Society of Washington, D.C. |pages=740–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information engraved on the stones includes the number (1 through 10) of the stone within the sequence on that side of the District, the date of placement, and the words "Jurisdiction of the United States." In the twentieth century, the Daughters of the American Revolution voluntarily took responsibility for preserving the stones, which had fallen victim to vandalization and urban development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the late 1990s renewed interest in the boundary stones led to increased preservation efforts by the DAR and other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.boundarystones.org|title = Boundary Stones of Washington, D.C.|website = www.boundarystones.org|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clairaut's theorem''' is a general mathematical law giving the surface gravity on a viscous rotating [[ellipsoid]] in equilibrium under the action of its gravitational field and centrifugal force.  It was published in 1743 by [[Alexis Clairaut|Alexis Claude Clairaut]] in his ''Théorie de la figure de la terre, tirée des principes de l'hydrostatique'' (''Theory of the shape of the earth, drawn from the principles of hydrostatics'')&lt;ref name=RoyalSoc&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3owAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=%22Th%C3%A9orie+de+la+figure+de+la+terre%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=an0JW-H3C8&amp;sig=BMkuXfZEsK3p0tzrZ1Jvfcy7hmw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result From the catalogue of the scientific books in the library of the Royal Society.]&lt;/ref&gt; which synthesized physical and geodetic evidence that the Earth is an oblate rotational [[ellipsoid]].&lt;ref name= Torge&gt;{{cite book |title=Geodesy: An Introduction |edition=3rd |author=Wolfgang Torge |page=10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFO6VB_czRYC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22Clairaut%27s+theorem%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;sig=ACfU3U34GaPhl4tA9duUMLQpm77hiKb-RQ#PPA10,M1 |isbn=3-11-017072-8 |year=2001 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]   }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Routh&gt;{{cite book |author=Edward John Routh |title=A Treatise on Analytical Statics with Numerous Examples |page=154  |year=2001|isbn=1-4021-7320-2 |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |volume=Vol. 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yKmdk4LZxhMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA40&amp;dq=isbn=1-4021-7320-2&amp;sig=ACfU3U2uhAKDJtIYZEY-Jf-1e5wf7UgG1w#PPA154,M1 }} A reprint of the original work published in 1908 by Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially used to relate the gravity at any point on the Earth's surface to the position of that point, allowing the [[ellipticity]] of the Earth to be calculated from measurements of gravity at different latitudes.  Today it has been largely supplanted by the [[Somigliana equation]].

== History ==
Although it had been known since antiquity that the Earth was spherical, by the 17th century evidence was accumulating that it was not a perfect sphere.   In 1672 [[Jean Richer]] found the first evidence that gravity was not constant over the Earth (as it would be if the Earth were a sphere); he took a [[pendulum clock]] to [[Cayenne]], [[French Guiana]] and found that it lost {{frac|2|1|2}} minutes per day compared to its rate at Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Pendulum gravimeters began to be taken on voyages to remote parts of the world, and it was slowly discovered that gravity increases smoothly with increasing latitude, gravitational acceleration being about 0.5% greater at the poles than at the equator.

British physicist [[Isaac Newton]] explained this in his ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687) in which he outlined his theory and calculations on the shape of the Earth.  Newton theorized correctly that the Earth was not precisely a sphere but had an [[oblate]] [[ellipsoid]]al shape, slightly flattened at the poles due to the [[centrifugal force]] of its rotation.  Since the surface of the Earth is closer to its center at the poles than at the equator, gravity is stronger there.  Using geometric calculations, he gave a concrete argument as to the hypothetical ellipsoid shape of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principia, Book III, Proposition XIX, Problem III|last = Newton|first = Isaac|publisher =|year =|isbn =|location =|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]]'' was not to provide exact answer for natural phenomena, but to theorize potential solutions to these unresolved factors in science.  Newton pushed for scientists to look further into the unexplained variables. Two prominent researchers that he inspired were [[Alexis Clairaut]] and [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]]. They both sought to prove the validity of Newton's theory on the shape of the Earth. In order to do so, they went on an expedition to [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]] in an attempt to accurately measure the [[meridian arc]].  From such measurements they could calculate the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of the Earth, its degree of departure from a perfect sphere.   Clairaut confirmed that Newton's theory that the Earth was ellipsoidal was correct, but his calculations were in error, and wrote a letter to the [[Royal Society|Royal Society of London]] with his findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Problem of the Earth's Shape from Newton to Clairaut|last = Greenburg|first = John|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|year = 1995|isbn = 0-521-38541-5|location = New York|pages = 132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society published an article in [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions]] the following year in 1737 that revealed his discovery. Clairaut showed how Newton's equations were incorrect, and did not prove an ellipsoid shape to the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Clairaut|first = Alexis|last2 = Colson|first2 = John|date = 1737|title = An Inquiry concerning the Figure of Such Planets as Revolve about an Axis, Supposing the Density Continually to Vary, from the Centre towards the Surface|jstor = 103921|journal = Philosophical Transactions|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he corrected problems with the theory, that in effect would prove Newton's theory correct. Clairaut believed that Newton had reasons for choosing the shape that he did, but he did not support it in ''[[Principia Mathematica Philosophiae Naturalis|Principia]].'' Clairaut's article did not provide an valid equation to back up his argument as well. This created much controversy in the scientific community.

It was not until Clairaut wrote ''Théorie de la figure de la terre'' in 1743 that a proper answer was provided. In it, he promulgated what is more formally known today as Clairaut's theorem.

==Formula==
Clairaut's formula for the acceleration due to gravity ''g'' on the surface of a spheroid at latitude φ, was:&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;[http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Clairaut/RouseBall/RB_Clairaut.html  W.

:&lt;math&gt;   g(\varphi) = \mathbb{G}_e \left[ 1 + \left(\frac{5}{2} m - f\right) \sin^2 \varphi \right] \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_e&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the acceleration of gravity at the equator, ''m'' the ratio of the centrifugal force to gravity at the equator, and ''f'' the [[flattening]] of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] section of the earth, defined as:
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac {a-b}{a} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
(where ''a'' = semimajor axis, ''b'' = semiminor axis).

Clairaut derived the formula under the assumption that the body was composed of concentric coaxial spheroidal layers of constant density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;g(\varphi) = G_e \left[ \frac{1+k\sin^2 \varphi}{\sqrt{1-e^2 \sin^2 \varphi }} \right],\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where,
*&lt;math&gt;e^2=\frac{a^2-b^2}{a^2}&lt;/math&gt; is the spheroid's [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], squared;
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_e,\mathbb{G}_p&lt;/math&gt; is the defined gravity at the equator and poles, respectively;
*&lt;math&gt;k=\frac{b\mathbb{G}_p-a\mathbb{G}_e}{a\mathbb{G}_e}&lt;/math&gt; (formula constant);

For Earth, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_e&lt;/math&gt; = 9.7803253359 ms&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G}_p&lt;/math&gt; = 9.8321849378 ms&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;; ''k'' = 0.00193185265241 ; ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.00669437999013:&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Dioptra-principe.jpg|right|thumb|384px|Three stages in the evolution of the dioptra, from a simple horizontal sight, to a multi-angle measuring tool]]
A '''dioptra''' (sometimes also named '''dioptre''' or '''diopter''' from {{lang-el|διόπτρα}}) is a [[Hellenistic civilization|classical]] astronomical and [[surveying instrument]], dating from the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century BCE. The '''dioptra''' was a sighting tube or, alternatively, a rod with a sight at both ends, attached to a stand. If fitted with [[protractor]]s, it could be used to measure [[angle]]s.

==Use==
[[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomers]] used the dioptra to [[astrometry|measure the positions of stars]]; both [[Euclid]] and [[Geminus]] refer to the dioptra in their astronomical works. By the time of [[Ptolemy]] (2nd&amp;nbsp;century CE), it was obsolete as an astronomical instrument, having been replaced by the [[armillary sphere]].

It continued in use as an effective [[surveying]] tool. Adapted to surveying, the dioptra is similar to the [[theodolite]], or surveyor's transit, which dates to the sixteenth century. It is a more accurate version of the [[Groma surveying|groma]].

The dioptra may have been sophisticated enough, for example, to construct a tunnel through two opposite points in a mountain. There is some speculation that it may have been used to build the [[Eupalinian aqueduct]]. Called "one of the greatest engineering achievements of ancient times," it is a tunnel 1,036&amp;nbsp;meters (4,000&amp;nbsp;ft) long, "excavated through [[Mount Kastro]] on the Greek island of [[Samos Island|Samos]], in the 6th century BCE" during the reign of [[Polycrates]].  Scholars disagree whether the dioptra was available that early.&lt;ref name=Apostol&gt;{{cite web|last=Apostol|first=Tom M.|title=The Tunnel of Samos|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4106/1/Samos.pdf|publisher=caltech.edu|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An entire book about the construction and surveying usage of the dioptra is credited to [[Hero of Alexandria]] (also known as Heron; a brief description of the book is available online; see Lahanas link, below). Hero was "one of history’s most ingenious [[engineer]]s and applied [[mathematician]]s."

The dioptra was used extensively on [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] building projects. Screw turns on several different parts of the instrument made it easy to calibrate for very precise measurements

The dioptra was replaced as a surveying instrument by the [[theodolite]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3412">'''Distance decay''' is a [[Human geography|geographical]] term which describes the effect of [[distance]] on cultural or spatial [[interaction]]s.  The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.

With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-[[abandoned railway]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in [[communications technology]], such as telegraphs, telephones, [[broadcasting]], and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692313000653 | doi=10.1016/j.jtrangeo.2013.04.001 | volume=31 | title=Boots are made for walking: interactions across physical and social space in infrastructure-poor regions | year=2013 | journal=Journal of Transport Geography | pages=226–235 | author=Matous Petr, Todo Yasuyuki, Mojo Dagne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Distance decay is graphically represented by a curving line that swoops [[convex function|concavely]] downward as distance along the x-axis increases.  Distance decay can be mathematically represented as an [[Inverse-square law]] by the expression

&lt;math&gt;I = const. \times d^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; 
or
&lt;math&gt;I \propto 1/d^2&lt;/math&gt;,

where I is interaction and d is distance. It can take other forms such as [[Exponential decay|negative exponential]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nekola J. C., White P. S. | year = 1999 | title = The distance decay of similarity in biogeography and ecology | url = http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Peet/ecoinfo/distance_decay/nekolapeter.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Biogeography | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 867–878 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00305.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.

&lt;math&gt;I \propto e^{-d}&lt;/math&gt;
.

Distance decay is evident in town/[[city centre]]s. It can refer to various things which decline with greater distance from the center of the [[Central Business District]] (CBD):
* density of [[pedestrian]] traffic
* street quality 
* quality of shops (depending on definitions of 'quality' and 'center')
* height of buildings 
* [[bid rent theory|price of land]]

Distance decay weighs into the decision to migrate, leading many [[Human migration|migrants]] to move less far.

== Related concepts ==

Related terms include "[[friction of distance]]", which describes the force that creates distance decay and [[Waldo R. Tobler]]'s "[[Tobler's first law of geography|First law of geography]]", an informal statement that "All things are related, but near things are more related than far things." 
"[[Loss of Strength Gradient]]" holds that the amount of a nation's military power that could be brought to bear in any part of the world depends on geographic distance.

It is based on the layout of the [[Public Land Survey System]] used in the [[United States]], but has several differences.  The DLS is the dominant [[surveying|survey]] method in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie provinces]], and it is also used in [[British Columbia]] along the [[Railway Belt (British Columbia)|Railway Belt]] (near the main line of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]), and in the [[Peace River Block]] in the northeast of the province.  (Although British Columbia entered [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] with control over its own lands, unlike the [[Northwest Territories]] and the Prairie provinces, British Columbia transferred these lands to the federal Government as a condition of the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway.  The federal government then surveyed these areas under the DLS.)&lt;ref name=taylor&gt;[http://www.ltsa.ca/data/img/publication/Crown-Lands-A-History-of-Survey-Systems.pdf ''Crown Lands: A History of Survey Systems''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706184529/http://www.ltsa.ca/data/img/publication/Crown-Lands-A-History-of-Survey-Systems.pdf |date=July 6, 2011 }}, by W.A.

== History ==
The survey was begun in 1871, shortly after Manitoba and the North-West Territories became part of Canada, following the purchase of [[Rupert's Land]] from the Hudson’s Bay Company.  Covering about {{convert|800000|km2}}, the survey system and its terminology are deeply ingrained in the rural culture of the Prairies. The DLS is the world's largest survey grid laid down in a single integrated system. The first formal survey done in western Canada was by [[Peter Fidler (explorer)|Peter Fidler]] in 1813.&lt;ref name="DLwS"&gt;{{cite book |last= Thomson, Don W. |title="Men and meridians; the history of surveying and mapping in Canada vol 2". |year= 1966–69 |publisher= Ottawa, R. Duhamel, Queen's printer |pages= 20–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inspiration for the Dominion Land Survey System was the plan for Manitoba (and later Saskatchewan and Alberta) to be agricultural economies. With a large amount of European settlers arriving, Manitoba was undergoing a large change so grasslands and parklands were surveyed, settled, and farmed.&lt;ref name=poi&gt;Hanuta, Irene. "A dominion land survey map of the Red River Valley." Manitoba History 58 (2008): 23+.. Web. 15 Nov. 2012.), [[Gale World History In Context]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion Land Survey system was developed because the farm name and field position descriptions used in northern Europe were not organized or flexible enough, and the township and concession system used in eastern Canada was not satisfactory. The first meridian was chosen at 97°27′28.4″ west longitude and was established in 1869. Another 6 meridians were established after.&lt;ref name=DLS1&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wolfe | last2=McKercher |first1= Bertram |first2=Robert B. |title= Understanding Western Canada’s Dominion Land survey system |year= 1986 |publisher= University Extension Press |pages= 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of places are excluded from the survey system: these include federal lands such as Indian reserves, federal parks, and air weapon ranges. The surveys do not encroach on reserves because that land was established before the surveys began. When the Hudson's Bay Company relinquished their title to the Dominion on July 15, 1870, via the deed of surrender it received Section 8 and all of Section 26 excluding the northeast quarter. These lands were gradually sold by the company and in 1984 they donated the remaining {{convert|5100|acre|km2}} to the [[Saskatchewan Wildlife Association]].&lt;ref name=DLS2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wolfe | last2=McKercher  |first1= Bertram |first2=Robert B.  |title= Understanding Western Canada’s Dominion Land survey system |year= 1986 |publisher= University Extension Press |pages= 9–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surveying of western Canada was divided into five basic surveys. Each survey's layout was slightly different from the others. The first survey began in 1871 and ended in 1879 and covers some of southern Manitoba and a little of Saskatchewan. The second and smallest survey, in 1880, was used in only small areas of Saskatchewan. This system differs from the first survey because rather than running section lines parallel to the eastern boundary they run true north-south. The largest and most important of these surveys was the third which covers more land than all the others surveys put together. This survey began in 1881. That method of surveying is still used in Saskatchewan and Manitoba.&lt;ref name=DLS2 /&gt; The fourth and fifth surveys were used only in some townships in British Columbia.

The reason that the Canadian government was pushing to subdivide Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta was to affirm Canadian sovereignty over these lands. The United States was undergoing rapid expansion in the 1860s, and the Canadian government was afraid that the Americans would expand into Canadian territory. Canada's introduction of a railway and surveying was a means to discourage American encroachment. Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] remarked in 1870 that the Americans "are resolved to do all they can short of war, to get possession of our western territory, and we must take immediate and vigorous steps to counteract them."&lt;ref name=DLeS&gt;{{cite book |last1= Olsson |first1= Gord |last2= Rogers | first2= Steve |last3= Ballantyne| first3= Brain|title="Surveys, Parcels and Tenure On Canada Lands". |year= 2010 |publisher= Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada |pages= 17–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the Dominion Land Survey marked a new era for western Canada. Railways were making their way to the West and the population of western regions began to increase. The introduction of the survey system marked the end of the nomadic ways for the First Nations and Metis. This did not go over well and was a catalyst to the events of the [[Red River Rebellion]].&lt;ref name=DLeS /&gt;

Being a surveyor was not easy. The hours were long, the time away from civilization was longer, and the elements were unforgiving. A survey party generally consisted of up to 20 members, which would include a party chief, chain men, a cook, people to saw trees, a recorder, and people to turn angles. All travel was either on horseback or by foot. To begin surveying a party chief would have to buy approximately $400 worth of instruments. These instruments included an [[alidade]], [[dumpy level]], [[theodolite]], [[Gunter's chain]] (which was replaced by a steel tape), and a [[solar compass]] or a vernier compass.&lt;ref name=DLwS /&gt;

The Dominion Land Survey system was proposed in 1869 by [[John Stoughton Dennis]]. The initial plan, though based on the square townships of the American [[Public Lands Survey System]], involved 9 mile townships divided into sixty-four 800 acre sections consisting of four 200 acre lots each. Work to establish the first meridian and few township outlines began and quickly ended in 1869 when a party of Metis symbolically stepped on a survey chain, beginning the [[Red River Resistance]]. Work resumed in 1871; however, the system was redesigned to use 6 mile townships with 640 acre sections based on a suggestion from Lieutenant-Governor of the North-West Territories [[William McDougall (politician)|William McDougall]], who advocated that most of the settlers would come from the United States, so it was "advisable to offer them lots of a size to which they have been accustomed." The Dominion Land Survey System still differed from the Public Land System because it contained road allowances.&lt;ref name=DLeS /&gt;

The Dominion Land Survey was enormous. Around {{convert|178000000|acre|km2}} are estimated to have been subdivided into quarter sections, 27 million of which were surveyed by 1883 (14 years after the system's inception). The amount of work undertaken between 1871 and 1930 is given justice by the amount of paper work submitted: the maps, plans and memos transferred by the Canadian government to the provinces filled approximately 200 railway cars. This did not include the closed or dormant files which would be enough to fill 9000 filing cabinets, which would weigh about 227 tons.&lt;ref name=DLeS /&gt;

Until very recently, surveying was done with manually controlled instruments to take distance and angular measurements. Distance was measured using either a chain or more recently a transit or range finder. To turn angles a [[theodolite]] was used. To find their location they used astronomical observations, and to find elevation levels and barometers were used.&lt;ref name=asidf&gt;LAJEUNESSE CLAUDE.[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/surveying ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', "Surveying."]: 23+..

* The Coast Meridian at approximately 122°45′ West, originally established before British Columbia joined Confederation, was surveyed north from the point where the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] intersects the sea at [[Semiahmoo Bay]].&lt;ref name= taylor/&gt;

The meridians were determined by painstaking survey observations and measurements, and in reference to other benchmarks on the continent, but were determined using 19th century technology.  The only truly accurate benchmarks at that time were near the prime meridian in Europe.  Benchmarks in other parts of the world had to be calculated or estimated by the positions of the sun and stars.  Consequently, although they were remarkably accurate for the time, today they are known to be several hundred metres in error.  Before the survey was even completed it was established that for the purposes of laws based on the survey, the results of the physical survey would take precedence over the theoretically correct position of the meridians.  This precludes, for example any basis for a [[border dispute|boundary dispute]] between Alberta and Saskatchewan on account of surveying errors.

The main east–west lines are the [[Baseline (surveying)|baselines]].  The First Baseline is at [[49th parallel north|49° north]], which forms much of the [[Canada–United States border]] in the West.  Each subsequent baseline is about {{convert|24|mi|km}} to the north of the previous one,&lt;ref name=larmour/&gt; terminating at [[60th parallel north|60° north]], which forms the boundary with [[Yukon]], the [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]].

== Townships ==
[[File:Dominion-land-system-overview.png|thumb|350px|left|A part of the Dominion Land Survey (convergence of meridians exaggerated). The shaded township is Township 17, Range 8 west of the Third Meridian.]]
Starting at each intersection of a meridian and a baseline and working west (also working east of the First Meridian and the Coast Meridian&lt;ref name=western/&gt;), nearly square [[Township (Canada)|township]]s are surveyed, which are about {{convert|6|mi|km}} in both north–south and east–west extent.  There are two tiers of townships to the north and two tiers to the south of each baseline.

Because the east and west edges of townships, called "range lines", are meridians of [[longitude]], they converge towards the [[North Pole]].  Therefore, the north edge of every township is slightly shorter than the south.  Only along the baselines do townships have their nominal width from east to west.  The two townships to the north of a baseline gradually narrow as one moves north, and the two to the south gradually widen as one moves south.  Halfway between two base lines, wider-than-nominal townships abut narrower-than-nominal townships.  The east and west boundaries of these townships therefore do not align, and north–south roads that follow the survey system have to jog to the east or west.  These east–west lines halfway between baselines are called "correction lines".&lt;ref name=larmour/&gt;

Townships are designated by their "township number" and "range number".  Township 1 is the first north of the First Baseline, and the numbers increase to the north.  Range numbers recommence with Range 1 at each meridian and increase to the west (also east of First Meridian and Coast Meridian).  On maps, township numbers are marked in [[Arabic numeral]]s, but range numbers are often marked in [[Roman numeral]]s; however, in other contexts Arabic numerals are used for both.  Individual townships are designated such as "Township 52, Range 25 west of the Fourth Meridian," abbreviated "52-25-W4."  In Manitoba, the First Meridian is the only one used, so the abbreviations are even more terse, e.g., "3-1-W" and "24-2-E.". In Manitoba legislation, the abbreviations WPM and EPM are used: "3-1 WPM" and "24-2 EPM".

== Sections&lt;!--[[Section]], [[Quarter section]] and [[Annexations of Edmonton]] link here--&gt; ==
Every township is divided into 36 '''sections''', each about {{convert|1|mi|km}} square.  Sections are numbered within townships, beginning with the southeast section, as follows (north at top):
{| class="wikitable" cellpadding="3"
|- class="center"
|31||32||33||34||35||36
|- class="center"
|30||29||28||27||26||25
|- class="center"
|19||20||21||22||23||24
|- class="center"
|18||17||16||15||14||13
|- class="center"
|7||8||9||10||11||12
|- class="center"
|6||5||4||3||2||1
|}

In turn, each section is divided into four '''quarter sections''' (square land parcels roughly 1/2 mile on a side):  southeast, southwest, northwest and northeast. This quarter-section description is primarily used by the agricultural industry.  The full legal description of a particular quarter section is "the Northeast Quarter of Section 20, Township 52, Range 25 west of the Fourth Meridian", abbreviated "NE-20-52-25-W4."

A section may also be split into as many as 16 '''legal subdivisions''' (LSDs). LSDs are commonly used by the oil and gas industry as a precise way of locating wells, pipelines, and facilities.  LSDs can be "quarter-quarter sections" (square land parcels roughly {{convert|1/4|mi|m}} on a side, comprising roughly {{convert|40|acre|m2}} in area)—but this is not necessary. Many are other fractions of a section (a half-quarter section—roughly {{convert|80|acre|m2}} in area is common.)  LSDs may be square, rectangular, and occasionally even triangular. LSDs are numbered as follows (north at top):
{| class="wikitable"
|- class="center"
|13||14||15||16
|- class="center"
|12||11||10||9
|- class="center"
|5||6||7||8
|- class="center"
|4||3||2||1
|}

In order to fully understand how the townships, sections, quarter sections, and legal subdivisions were set out, one should refer to the ''Manual of Instructions for the Survey of Dominion Land''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clss.nrcan.gc.ca/standards-normes/toc-domlan-terredom-1-3-v1-eng.php Manual of Instructions for the Survey of Dominion Lands, 1st to 10th Editions], Surveyor General Branch, Earth Sciences Sector, [[Natural Resources Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, resource companies assign further divisions within LSDs such as "A, B, C, D etc." for example, to distinguish between multiple sites within an LSD.  These in no way constitute an official change to the Dominion Land Survey system, but nonetheless often appear as part of the legal description.

== Road allowances ==
[[File:Dominion-land-survey-township.png|thumb|400px|right|Road allowances and special sections in the Dominion Land Survey.]]
Between certain sections of a township run "road allowances" (but not all road allowances have an actual road built on them). The road allowances add to the size of the township (they do not cut down the size of the sections): this is the reason base lines are not exactly {{convert|24|mi|km}} apart. In townships surveyed from 1871 to 1880 (most of southern Manitoba, part of southeastern Saskatchewan and a small region near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan), there are road allowances of {{convert|1+1/2|chain|m|lk=in}} surrounding every section. In townships surveyed from 1881 to the present, road allowances are reduced both in width and in number. They are {{convert|1|chain|m}} wide and run north–south between all sections; however, there are only three east–west road allowances in each township, on the north side of sections 7 to 12, 19 to 24 and 31 to 36. This results in a north-south road allowance every mile going west, and an east-west road allowance every two miles going north. This arrangement reduced land allocation for roads, but still provides road-access to every quarter-section. Road allowances are one of the differences between the Canadian DLS and the American [[Public Land Survey System]], which leaves no extra space for roads.

== Special sections ==
Certain sections of townships were reserved for special purposes:
* As part of the deal that transferred [[Rupert's Land]] from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] to Canada, the HBC retained five per cent of the "fertile belt" (south of the [[North Saskatchewan River|North Saskatchewan]] and [[Winnipeg River|Winnipeg rivers]]).  Therefore, Section 8 and three-quarters of Section 26 were assigned to the company.  Additionally, the fourth quarter of Section 26 in townships whose numbers were divisible by five also belonged to the HBC in order to give the company exactly five per cent. Although the HBC sold all these sections long ago, they are still often locally called "the '''Bay section'''" today.
* The odd-numbered sections (except 11 and 29) were often used for [[railway]] land-grants.  The Prairies could not be settled without railways, so the Dominion government habitually granted large tracts of land to railway companies as an incentive to build lines.  Notably, the Canadian Pacific Railway was granted {{convert|25000000|acre|km2}} for the construction of its first line from Ontario to the Pacific.  These sections are colloquially called '''CPR sections''' regardless of the railway they were originally granted to.
* Sections 11 and 29 were '''school sections'''.  When [[school board]]s were formed, they gained title to these sections, which were then sold to fund the initial construction of schools.  The rural school buildings were often as not located on school sections; frequently, land trades were made between landowners and the school for practical reasons.
* The remaining quarter sections were available as '''homesteads''' under the provisions of the [[Dominion Lands Act]], the federal government's plan for settling the North-West.  A homesteader paid a $10 fee for a quarter section of his choice.  If after three years he had cultivated {{convert|30|acre|ha}} and had built a house (often just a [[sod house]]), he gained title to the quarter.  Homesteads were available as late as the 1950s, but the bulk of the settlement of the Prairies was 1885 to 1914.

Legal surveys conducted before and after the Dominion Land Survey grid was laid out often have their own legal descriptions and delineations.  Early settlement lots still retain their own original legal descriptions, but often have townships superimposed over them for the sake of convenience or for certain tasks.  Urban developments superimpose new survey lots and plans over the older section and township grid also.

== Political disputes over the survey ==
Certain areas otherwise within the surveys' boundaries were not part of the survey grid, or not available for homesteading. These were [[Indian reserves]], pre-existing "settlements" divided into "[[Seigneurial system of New France|river lots]]" based on the French system used in Quebec, and lands around Hudson's Bay Company trading posts reserved for the company when it transferred its claim over the West to Canada in 1870.

The rights of the pre-DLS settlers was a major political issue in the West in the late nineteenth century.  The settlers claimed [[squatters' rights]] over the land they had already farmed, but the sizes and boundaries of these farms were poorly defined, leading to frequent disputes.  As well the Métis in the [[Southbranch Settlement|Southbranch settlements]] of Saskatchewan were particularly with their land rights given that they had not been well protected by the ''[[Manitoba Act]]'' as they had been promised in 1870.  In the case of the closely clustered settlements of Edmonton, St. Albert, and Fort Saskatchewan in the Alberta District, a militant "settlers' rights" movement developed which demanded action from the federal government to grant the settlers legal title to their land and to end claim jumping.  The movement even resorted to vigilante action against suspected claim jumpers.  Most of these grievances were resolved by 1885, which is likely one of the reasons the area never joined the [[North-West Rebellion]] despite the fact that St. Albert, and to a lesser extent Edmonton, were largely populated by Métis people.&lt;ref name="Macleod1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5244">Fluvio refers to things related to rivers and glacial refers to something that is of ice. '''Fluvio-glacial''' refers to the [[meltwater]] created when a [[glacier]] melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/fluvio-|title=fluvio- - definition of fluvio- in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/glacial|title=glacial - definition... of glacial in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluvio-glacial processes can occur on the surface and within the glacier. The [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] that happen within the glacier are revealed after the entire glacier melts or partially retreats. Fluvio-glacial [[landform]]s and [[erosion]]al surfaces include: [[outwash plain]]s, [[kame]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, kame terraces, [[Kettle (landform)|kettle holes]], [[esker]]s, [[varve]]s, and [[proglacial lake]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/A-level/AQA/Year%2012/Cold%20environs/Fluvioglacial/Fluvioglacial%20landforms.htm|title=Fluvioglacial Landforms|last=|first=|date=|website=Coolgeography.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landforms ==

=== Outwash Plain ===
An outwash plain is both an erosional and depositional surface created by meltwater coming from the glacier. These plains are found in front of the glaciers and are typically characterized by small [[Braided river|braided streams]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The streams are usually small and braided because the [[sediment]] size varies and the original stream gets broken up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since these streams [[meander]] around, the erosion happens laterally (left to right)  instead of vertically (up and down).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These plains are usually found beyond the [[Terminal moraine|end moraine]] deposited by the glacier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Kame and Kame Terrace ===
[[Kame]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are small hills that consist of sediments ranging from sands to gravels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geomorphology|last=Gutierrez|first=Mateo|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=538–545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intraglacial movement of water carries sediments and deposits them inside cavaties, or holes, in the glacier; once the glacier melts or retreats, the kames is left behind as a deposit. These hills can range in size and be up to 50 m tall and 400 m wide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A kame terrace is a relatively flat surface of sediment that was deposited between the valley surface and the glacier. When kames, kame surfaces, and other fluvio-glacial landforms are combined into one landscape, it is called a kame complex or glacial [[Karst|karst topography]].

=== Kettle Holes ===
[[Kettle (landform)|Kettle holes]] are typically formed when a chunk of ice that came from the glacier is buried under fluvio-glacial sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/higher/geography/physical/lithosphere/revision/7/|title=BBC - Higher Bitesize Geography - Lithosphere : Revision, Page7|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the ice melts, the sediments fall and form a depression that can later be filled with rainwater and form [[Kettle (landform)|kettle lakes]]. Kettle holes can often be found in the outwash plain of a glacier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kettle holes can be anywhere from 5 m to 30&amp;nbsp;km wide.

=== Eskers ===
Eskers can be describes as long, curved ridges made up of sands and gravels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Soil_Geomorphology.html?id=H9FSveDbpbsC|title=Soil Geomorphology|last=Gerrard|first=A J|date=|website=Google Books|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These surfaces were created by intraglacial streams carrying and depositing sediments as they flow through the glacier. These landforms can range from 100 m to 500&amp;nbsp;km long and 3 m to 200 m tall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Varves ===
Varves are a depositional feature of a fluvio-glacial movement. They are layers of annual sediment deposits. The sizes of the sediments vary and depend on the volume of the streams, but are usually associated with mud deposits ([[silt]] and [[clay]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/varved-deposit|title=varved deposit {{!}} geology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color and amount of the sediment deposited also varies depending upon the season; summer deposits typically have larger volumes of deposition and are characterized as being light, whereas winter deposits are usually the opposite.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Winter deposits are fairly uncommon because the water is frozen into ice again.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Proglacial Lakes ===
[[Proglacial lake]]s form as meltwater trapped behind a glacial feature such as an end moraine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These lakes have an intake of sediment deposited by streams within the glacier and their deposits are recorded within the varves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''GPS-aided GEO augmented navigation''' ('''GAGAN''') is an implementation of a regional [[satellite-based augmentation system]] (SBAS) by the [[Government of India|Indian government]]. It is a system to improve the accuracy of a [[Global navigation satellite system|GNSS receiver]] by providing reference signals.&lt;ref name="ASM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asmmag.com/news/india-approves-gagan-system |title=India Approves Gagan System |date=15 September 2008 |work=Magazine article |publisher=Asian Surveying and Mapping |accessdate=2009-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519215721/http://www.asmmag.com/news/india-approves-gagan-system |archivedate=19 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Airports Authority of India|AAI]]'s efforts towards implementation of operational SBAS can be viewed as the first step towards introduction of modern [[Communication, navigation and surveillance]]/[[Air Traffic Management]] system over Indian airspace.&lt;ref name="mycoordinates.org"&gt;[http://www.mycoordinates.org/gagan-update-arjunsingh-mar-06.php GAGAN Update Dr. Arjin Singh, Additional GM, Directorate of Global Navigation System, Airport Authority of India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828035632/http://www.mycoordinates.org/gagan-update-arjunsingh-mar-06.php |date=28 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project has established 15 Indian reference stations, 3 Indian navigation land uplink stations, 3 Indian mission control centers, and installation of all associated software and communication links.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gagan-system-ready-for-operations/article5565700.ece&lt;/ref&gt; It will be able to help pilots to navigate in the Indian airspace by an accuracy of 3 m. This will be helpful for landing aircraft in marginal weather and difficult approaches like [[Mangalore Airport (India)|Mangalore]] and [[Kushok Bakula Rimpochhe Airport|Leh]] airports.

==Implementation==
The {{INRConvert|7.74|b|0}} project was created in three phases through 2008 by the [[Airports Authority of India|Airport Authority of India]] with the help of the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]]'s (ISRO) technology and space support.&lt;ref name=Isro&gt;{{cite news|title=Satellite Navigation – GAGAN|url=http://www.isro.org/scripts/futureprogramme.aspx#Satellite|accessdate=13 June 2012|newspaper=ISRO website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to provide navigation system for all phases of flight over the Indian airspace and in the adjoining area. It is applicable to safety-to-life operations, and meets the performance requirements of international civil aviation regulatory bodies.

The space component  became  available after the launch of the GAGAN payload on the GSAT-8 communication satellite, which was successfully launched. This payload was also part of the GSAT-4 satellite that was lost when the geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) failed during launch in April 2010. A final system acceptance test was conducted during June 2012 followed by system certification during July 2013.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt;

== Technology ==

To begin implementing a satellite-based augmentation system over the Indian airspace, [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] ([[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]]) codes for L1 frequency and L5 frequency were obtained from the [[United States Air Force]] and [[United States|U.S]] [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] on November 2001 and March 2005.&lt;ref name="mycoordinates.org" /&gt; The system will use eight reference stations located in [[Delhi]], [[Guwahati]], [[Kolkata]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], [[Bangalore]], [[Jammu]] and [[Port Blair]], and a master control center at [[Bangalore]]. US defense contractor [[Raytheon]] has stated they will bid to build the system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-defence.com/reports-3966 Raytheon to bid for geosynchronous augmented navigation system (GAGAN) Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology demonstration ==

A national plan for satellite navigation including implementation of technology demonstration system (TDS) over the Indian air space as a proof of concept had been prepared jointly by Airports Authority of India (AAI) and ISRO. TDS was successfully completed during 2007 by installing eight Indian Reference Stations (INRESs) at eight Indian airports and linked to the Master Control Center (MCC) located near Bangalore. Preliminary system acceptance testing has been successfully completed in December 2010.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt; The [[ground segment]] for GAGAN, which has been put up by the Raytheon, has 15 reference stations scattered across the country. Two mission control centres, along with associated uplink stations, have been set up at Kundalahalli in Bangalore. One more control centre and uplink station are to come up at Delhi. As a part of the programme, a network of 18 total electron content (TEC) monitoring stations were installed at various locations in India to study and analyse the behaviour of the ionosphere over the Indian region.

GAGAN's TDS signal in space provides a three-metre accuracy as against the requirement of 7.6 metres. Flight inspection of GAGAN signal is being carried out at [[Kozhikode]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Nagpur]] and [[Bangalore]] airports and the results have been satisfactory so far.

=== Study of Ionosphere ===
One essential component of the GAGAN project is the study of the ionospheric behaviour over the Indian region. This has been specially taken up in view of the uncertain nature of the behaviour of the ionosphere in the region. The study will lead to the optimisation of the algorithms for the ionospheric corrections in the region.

To study the ionospheric behaviour more effectively over entire Indian airspace, Indian universities and R&amp;D labs, which are involved in the development of regional based ionotropic model for GAGAN, have suggested nine more TEC stations.&lt;ref name="mycoordinates.org"/&gt;

== Technology Integration ==

GAGAN after its final operational phase completion, will be compatible with other SBAS systems such as the [[wide-area augmentation system]] (WAAS), the [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS) and the [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS) and will provide seamless air navigation service across regional boundaries. While the ground segment consists of eight reference stations and a master control center, which will have sub systems such as data communication network, [[SBAS]] correction and verification system, operations and maintenance system, performance monitoring display and payload simulator, Indian land uplinking stations will have dish antenna assembly. The space segment will consist of one geo-navigation transponder.

== Effective flight-management system ==

A flight-management system based on GAGAN will then be poised to save operators time and money by managing climb, descent and engine performance profiles. The FMS will improve the efficiency and flexibility by increasing the use of operator-preferred trajectories.
It will improve airport and airspace access in all weather conditions, and the ability to meet the environmental and obstacle clearance constraints. It will also enhance reliability and reduce delays by defining more precise terminal area procedures that feature parallel routes and environmentally optimised airspace corridors.

* GAGAN will increase safety by using a three-dimensional approach operation with course guidance to the runway, which will reduce the risk of controlled flight into terrain i.e., an accident whereby an airworthy aircraft, under pilot control, inadvertently flies into terrain, an obstacle, or water.
* GAGAN will also offer high position accuracies over a wide geographical area like the Indian airspace. These positions accuracies will be simultaneously available to 80 civilian and more than 200 non-civilian airports and airfields and will facilitate an increase in the number of airports to 500 as planned. These position accuracies can be further enhanced with ground-based, augmentation system.

== Developments ==

The first GAGAN transmitter was integrated into the [[GSAT-4]] [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellite, and had a goal of being operational in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-defence.com/reports/2239 ISRO, Raytheon complete tests for GAGAN satellite navigational system.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205075702/http://www.india-defence.com/reports/2239 |date=5 December 2006 }} India Defense Website. 20 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K.N.

In 2009, Raytheon had won an 82 million dollar contract. It was mainly dedicated to modernise Indian air navigation system.&lt;ref name="GovCon"/&gt; The vice president of Command &amp; Control Systems, Raytheon Network Centric Systems, Andy Zogg commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;GAGAN will be the world's most advanced air navigation system and further reinforces India's leadership in the forefront of air navigation. GAGAN will greatly improve safety, reduce congestion and enhance communications to meet India's growing air traffic management needs&lt;ref name="GovCon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Raytheon Wins $82M Air Navigation Contract From India|url=http://www.govconwire.com/2009/07/raytheon-wins-82m-air-navigation-contract-from-india/|accessdate=29 September 2012|newspaper=GovCon Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2012, the [[DRDO|Defence Research and Development Organisation]] received a "miniaturised version" of the device with all the features from [[global positioning systems]] (GPS) and [[global navigation satellite systems]] (GNSS). The module weighing just 17 gm, can be used in multiple platforms ranging from aircraft (e.g. winged or rotor-craft) to small boats, ships. Reportedly, it can also assist "survey applications". It is a cost-efficient device and can be of "tremendous" civilian use. The navigation output is composed of GPS, GLONASS and GPS+GLONASS position, speed and time data. According to a statement released by the DRDO, G3oM is a state-of-the-art technology receiver, integrating Indian GAGAN as well as both global positioning system and GLONASS systems.&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;

According to Deccan chronicle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[[G. Satheesh Reddy]], associate director of the city-based Research Centre Imarat, said the product is bringing about a quantum leap in the area of GNSS technology and has paved the way for highly miniaturised GNSS systems for the future.&lt;ref name=DC&gt;[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/17-gm-device-guide-missiles-968 17-gm device to guide missiles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905014057/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/channels/nation/south/17-gm-device-guide-missiles-968 |date=5 September 2012 }} Deccan Chronicle.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 30 December 2012, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), India provisionally certified the GPS-aided geo-augmented navigation (GAGAN) system to RNP0.1 (Required Navigation Performance, 0.1 Nautical Mile) service level. The certification enabled aircraft fitted with SBAS equipment to use GAGAN signal in space for navigation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.isro.org/pressrelease/scripts/pressreleasein.aspx?Jan03_2014 | title=GAGAN System Certified for RNP0.1 Operations | date=3 January 2014 | accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Satellites===

'''GSAT-8''' is an Indian geostationary satellites, which was successfully launched using [[Ariane 5]] on 21 May 2011 and is positioned in geosynchronous orbit at 55 degrees E longitude.

'''GSAT-10''' is envisaged to augment the growing need of Ku and C-band transponders and carries 12 Ku Band, 12 C Band and 12 Extended C Band transponders and a GAGAN payload. The spacecraft employs the standard I-3K structure with power handling capability of around 6&amp;nbsp;kW with a lift off mass of 3400&amp;nbsp;kg. GSAT-10 was successfully launched by [[Ariane 5]] on 29 September 2012.&lt;ref name=Isro/&gt;

'''GSAT-15''' carries 24 Ku band transponders with India coverage beam and a GAGAN payload. was successfully launched on 10 November 2015, 21:34:07 UTC, completing the constellation.

===Indian regional navigation satellite system===
{{main|Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System}}
The Indian government has stated that it intends to use the experience of creating the GAGAN system to enable the creation of an autonomous regional navigation system called the '''I'''ndian '''R'''egional '''N'''avigation '''S'''atellite '''S'''ystem [[IRNSS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isro.org/newsletters/spaceindia/aprsep2006/Satnavindustry.htm SATNAV Industry Meet 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331145825/http://www.isro.org/newsletters/spaceindia/aprsep2006/Satnavindustry.htm |date=31 March 2007 }}. ISRO Space India Newsletter. April – September 2006 Issue.&lt;/ref&gt;

IRNSS-1
Indian regional navigational satellite system (IRNSS)-1, the first of the seven satellites of the [[IRNSS]] constellation, carries a navigation payload and a C-band ranging transponder. The spacecraft employs an optimised I-1K structure with a power handling capability of around 1660W and a lift off mass of 1425&amp;nbsp;kg, and is designed for a nominal mission life of 10 years. The first satellite of IRNSS constellation was launched onboard PSLV (C22) on 1 July 2012. While the full constellation was planned to be realised during 2014 time frame, launch of subsequent satellites got delayed.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Currently all 7 satellites are in orbit but in 2017 it was announced that all three&amp;nbsp;[[rubidium]]&amp;nbsp;[[atomic clock]]s&amp;nbsp;on board&amp;nbsp;[[IRNSS-1A]]&amp;nbsp;had failed, mirroring similar failures in the&amp;nbsp;[[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] constellation. The first failure occurred in July 2016, following which two other clocks also failed. This rendered the satellite somewhat redundant and required replacement. Although the satellite still performs other functions, the data is coarse, and thus cannot be used for accurate measurements.&amp;nbsp;ISRO plans to replace it with IRNSS-1H in July or August 2017.

Two more clocks in the navigational system had started showing signs of abnormality, thereby taking the total number of failed clocks to five.

As a precaution to extend the operational life of navigation satellite, ISRO is running only one rubidium atomic clock instead of two in the remaining six satellites.&amp;nbsp;Each satellite has three clocks, therefore a total of 27 clocks for all satellites in the system (including standby satellites). The clocks of both IRNSS and GALILEO were supplied by SpectraTime. ISRO replaced the atomic clocks in two standby NavIC satellites.&amp;nbsp;The setback comes at a time when IRNSS is yet to start commercial operations.

== Applications ==

Karnataka Forest Department has used GAGAN to build a new, accurate and publicly available satellite based database of its forestlands. This is a followup to the Supreme Court directive to states to update and put up their respective forest maps. The geospatial database of forestlands pilot has used data from the Cartosat-2 satellite. The maps are meant to rid authorities of ambiguities related to forest boundaries and give clarity to forest administrators, revenue officials as also the public, according to R.K. Srivastava, chief conservator of forests (headquarters).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gagan-kicks-off-new-forest-database/article7118060.ece?w=city GAGAN kicks off new forest database].

'''GSHHG''' ('''Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Geography Database'''; formerly ''Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution Shoreline Database'' (''GSHHS'')) is a high-resolution shoreline data set amalgamated from two data bases (the CIA world database WDBII, and the World Vector Shoreline database) in the public domain. The data have undergone extensive processing and are free of internal inconsistencies such as [[erratic point]]s and crossing segments. The shorelines are constructed entirely from hierarchically arranged closed polygons. The four-level hierarchy is as follows: seashore, lakes, islands within lakes, ponds within islands within lakes.

The data can be used to simplify data searches and data selections, or to study the statistical characteristics of shorelines and land-masses. It comes with access software and routines to facilitate decimation based on a standard line-reduction algorithm.

GSHHS is developed and maintained by [[Paul Wessel (geophysicist)|Dr. Paul Wessel]] at the [[University of Hawai'i]], and Dr. Walter H. F. Smith at the [[NOAA Laboratory for Satellite Altimetry]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26863">{{Geodesy}}
A '''geodetic datum''' or '''geodetic system''' is a [[coordinate system]], and a set of reference points, used to locate places on the [[Earth]] (or similar objects).  An approximate definition of [[sea level]] is the datum [[World Geodetic System|WGS 84]], an [[reference ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], whereas a more accurate definition is Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008), using at least 2,159 [[spherical harmonics]]. Other datums are defined for other areas or at other times; [[ED50]] was defined in 1950 over Europe and differs from WGS 84 by a few hundred meters depending on where in Europe you look. 
[[Mars]] has no [[oceans]] and so no sea level, but at least two [[Geography of Mars#Zero elevation|martian datums]] have been used to locate places there.

Datums are used in [[geodesy]], [[navigation]], and [[surveying]] by [[cartographer]]s and [[satellite navigation system]]s to translate positions indicated on [[map]]s (paper or digital) to their real position on [[Earth]]. Each starts with an [[ellipsoid]] (stretched sphere), and then defines [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[altitude]] coordinates.  One or more locations on the Earth's surface are chosen as anchor "base-points".

The difference in co-ordinates between datums is commonly referred to as ''datum shift''. The datum shift between two particular datums can vary from one place to another within one country or region, and can be anything from zero to hundreds of meters (or several kilometers for some remote islands). The [[North Pole]], [[South Pole]] and [[Equator]] will be in different positions on different datums, so [[True North]] will be slightly different. Different datums use different interpolations for the precise shape and size of the Earth ([[reference ellipsoid]]s).

Because the Earth is an imperfect ellipsoid, localised datums can give a more accurate representation of the area of coverage than WGS 84. [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|OSGB36]], for example, is a better approximation to the [[geoid]] covering the British Isles than the global WGS 84 ellipsoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|title=Geoid—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202054013/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/geoid.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the benefits of a global system outweigh the greater accuracy, the global WGS 84 datum is becoming increasingly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|title=Datums—Help {{!}} ArcGIS for Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-01-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202052131/http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/10.3/guide-books/map-projections/datums.htm|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums  measure elevations or depths.

== Definition ==

In [[surveying]] and [[geodesy]], a ''datum'' is a reference system or an approximation of the Earth's surface against which positional measurements are made for computing locations. Horizontal datums are used for describing a point on the [[Earth]]'s surface, in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or another coordinate system. Vertical datums are used to measure elevations or underwater depths.

=== Horizontal datum ===
The horizontal datum is the model used to measure positions on the Earth. A specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates, depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of local horizontal datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The [[WGS 84]] datum, which is almost identical to the [[NAD83]] datum used in North America and the [[ETRS89]] datum used in Europe, is a common standard datum.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

For example, in Sydney there is a 200 metres (700&amp;nbsp;feet) difference between GPS coordinates configured in GDA (based on global standard WGS 84) and AGD (used for most local maps), which is an unacceptably large error for some applications, such as [[surveying]] or site location for [[scuba diving]].&lt;ref&gt;McFadyen, [http://www.michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 GPS and Diving] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819064902/http://michaelmcfadyenscuba.info/viewpage.php?page_id=80 |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertical datum ===
{{further|Chart datum}}

[[File:Vertical references in Europe.svg|thumbnail|Vertical datums in Europe]]
A vertical datum is used as a reference point for [[elevation]]s of surfaces and features on the Earth including terrain, bathymetry, water levels, and man-made structures. Vertical datums are either: tidal, based on [[sea level]]s; gravimetric, based on a [[geoid]]; or geodetic, based on the same ellipsoid models of the Earth used for computing horizontal datums.

In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above [[sea level]], although what “sea level” actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, [[tide]]s, topography, and even differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of mountains etc.

For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is [[mean sea level]] (MSL).  This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard “sea level” for all mapping and surveying in that country.  (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at [[Newlyn]] in [[Cornwall]] between 1915 and 1921).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} However, zero elevation as defined by one country is not the same as zero elevation defined by another (because MSL is not the same everywhere), which is why locally defined vertical datums differ from one another.

A different principle is used when choosing a datum for [[nautical charts]].  For safety reasons, a mariner must be able to know the minimum depth of water that could occur at any point.  For this reason, depths and tides on a nautical chart are measured relative to [[chart datum]], which is defined to be a level below which tide rarely falls.  Exactly how this is chosen depends on the tidal regime in the area being charted and on the policy of the hydrographic office producing the chart in question; a typical definition is Lowest Astronomical Tide (the lowest tide predictable from the effects of gravity), or Mean Lower Low Water (the average lowest tide of each day), although MSL is sometimes used in waters with very low tidal ranges.

Conversely, if a ship is to safely pass under a low bridge or overhead power cable, the mariner must know the minimum clearance between the masthead and the obstruction, which will occur at high tide.  Consequently, bridge clearances etc. are given relative to a datum based on high tide, such as Highest Astronomical Tide or Mean High Water Springs.

Sea level does not remain constant throughout [[geological time]], and so tidal datums are less useful when studying very long-term processes. In some situations sea level does not apply at all — for instance for [[Geography of Mars|mapping Mars' surface]] — forcing the use of a different "zero elevation", such as mean radius.

A geodetic vertical datum takes some specific zero point, and computes elevations based on the geodetic model being used, without further reference to sea levels. Usually, the starting reference point is a tide gauge, so at that point the geodetic and tidal datums might match, but due to sea level variations, the two scales may not match elsewhere.  An example of a gravity-based geodetic datum is [[NAVD88]], used in North America, which is referenced to a point in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].  Ellipsoid-based datums such as [[WGS 84]], [[GRS80]] or [[NAD83]] use a theoretical surface that may differ significantly from the [[geoid]].

== Geodetic coordinates ==
{{Main|Reference ellipsoid#Coordinates}}
[[File:Geocentric vs geodetic latitude.svg|thumb|right|300px|The same position on a [[spheroid]] has a different angle for latitude depending on whether the angle is measured from the normal line segment ''CP'' of the [[ellipsoid]] (angle ''α'') or the line segment ''AP'' from the center (angle ''β''). Note that the "[[flatness]]" of the spheroid (orange) in the image is greater than that of the Earth; as a result, the corresponding difference between the "geodetic" and "geocentric" latitudes is also exaggerated.]]

In geodetic coordinates, the Earth's surface is approximated by an [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and locations near the surface are described in terms of [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), [[longitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;), and height (&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref group="footnotes"&gt;About the right/left-handed order of the coordinates, i.e., &lt;math&gt;(\lambda, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;(\phi, \lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, see [[Spherical coordinate system#Conventions]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geodetic versus geocentric latitude ===
Geodetic [[latitude]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;), resp. [[altitude]], is different from geocentric latitude (&lt;math&gt;\phi'&lt;/math&gt;), resp. altitude. Geodetic latitude is determined by the angle between the [[equator]]ial plane and [[surface normal|normal]] to the ellipsoid, whereas geocentric latitude is determined by the angle between the equatorial plane and line joining the point to the centre of the ellipsoid (see figure). Unless otherwise specified, latitude is geodetic latitude.

=== Defining and derived parameters ===
{{Main|Reference ellipsoid#Ellipsoid parameters}}

The ellipsoid is completely parameterised by the semi-major axis &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and the flattening &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.

From &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; it is possible to derive the semi-minor axis &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, first eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and second eccentricity &lt;math&gt;e'&lt;/math&gt; of the ellipsoid

== Conversion calculations ==
{{further|Geographic coordinate conversion}}

Datum conversion is the process of converting the coordinates of a point from one datum system to another. Datum conversion may frequently be accompanied by a change of [[Map projection|grid projection]].

== Reference datums ==
{{see also|Reference ellipsoid}}

A reference datum is a known and constant surface which is used to describe the location of unknown points on the Earth. Since reference datums can have different radii and different center points, a specific point on the Earth can have substantially different coordinates depending on the datum used to make the measurement. There are hundreds of locally developed reference datums around the world, usually referenced to some convenient local reference point. Contemporary datums, based on increasingly accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth, are intended to cover larger areas. The most common reference Datums in use in [[North America]] are NAD27, NAD83, and [[WGS 84]].

The [[North American Datum]] of 1927 (NAD 27) is "the horizontal control datum for the United States that was defined by a location and azimuth on the Clarke spheroid of 1866, with origin at (the survey station) [[Meades Ranch Triangulation Station|Meades Ranch (Kansas)]]." ... The geoidal height at Meades Ranch was assumed to be zero, as sufficient gravity data was not available, and this was needed to relate surface measurements to the datum. "Geodetic positions on the North American Datum of 1927 were derived from the (coordinates of and an azimuth at Meades Ranch) through a readjustment of the triangulation of the entire network in which Laplace azimuths were introduced, and the Bowie method was used." (http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatDatum )  NAD27 is a local referencing system covering North America.

The North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) is "The horizontal control datum for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America, based on a geocentric origin and the Geodetic Reference System 1980 ([[GRS80]]). "This datum, designated as NAD 83 ...is based on the adjustment of 250,000 points including 600 satellite Doppler stations which constrain the system to a geocentric origin." NAD83 may be considered a local referencing system.

WGS 84 is the [[World Geodetic System]] of 1984. It is the reference frame used by the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) and is defined by the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] (NGA) (formerly the Defense Mapping Agency, then the National Imagery and Mapping Agency). WGS 84 is used by DoD for all its mapping, charting, surveying, and navigation needs, including its [[GPS]] "broadcast" and "precise" orbits. WGS 84 was defined in January 1987 using Doppler satellite surveying techniques. It was used as the reference frame for broadcast GPS Ephemerides (orbits) beginning January 23, 1987. At 0000 GMT January 2, 1994, WGS 84 was upgraded in accuracy using GPS measurements. The formal name then became WGS 84 (G730), since the upgrade date coincided with the start of GPS Week 730. It became the reference frame for broadcast orbits on June 28, 1994. At 0000 GMT September 30, 1996 (the start of GPS Week 873), WGS 84 was redefined again and was more closely aligned with [[International Earth Rotation Service]] (IERS) frame [[International Terrestrial Reference System|ITRF]] 94. It was then formally called WGS 84 (G873). WGS 84 (G873) was adopted as the reference frame for broadcast orbits on January 29, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|title=National Geodetic Survey - Frequently Asked Questions FAQ|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Geodetic|last=Survey|date=|website=www.ngs.noaa.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019024226/https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WGS84|archivedate=2011-10-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another update brought it to WGS84(G1674).

The WGS 84 datum, within two meters of the NAD83 datum used in North America, is the only world referencing system in place today. WGS 84 is the default standard datum for coordinates stored in recreational and commercial GPS units.

Users of GPS are cautioned that they must always check the datum of the maps they are using. To correctly enter, display, and to store map related map coordinates, the datum of the map must be entered into the GPS map datum field.

The '''Geographic Names Information System''' ('''GNIS''') is a database that contains name and locative information about more than two million physical and cultural features located throughout the [[United States|United States of America]] and its territories. It is a type of [[gazetteer]].  GNIS was developed by the [[United States Geological Survey]] in cooperation with the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] (BGN) to promote the standardization of feature names.

The database is part of a system that includes topographic map names and bibliographic references. The names of books and historic maps that confirm the feature or place name are cited. Variant names, alternatives to official federal names for a feature, are also recorded. Each feature receives a permanent, unique feature record identifier, sometimes called the GNIS identifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=US Census County Based TIGER/Line® 2009 Data Dictionary: Entity, Joins, Attributes, and Domains |url=http://www.scribekey.com/EntityAttributes/AREALM.singles.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qea5SVUR?url=http://www.scribekey.com/EntityAttributes/AREALM.singles.html |archivedate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The database never removes an entry, "except in cases of obvious duplication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first=| last=Cartographic Users Advisory Council (CUAC) | title=2007 Agency Presentation Minutes | publisher=US Geological Survey | date=April 26–27, 2007 | location=Reston, VA | url=http://cuac.wustl.edu/annualmtg2007.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111180726/http://cuac.wustl.edu/annualmtg2007.htm|archivedate=11 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5120">'''Geographic information science''' or '''geographical information science''' ('''GIScience''') is the scientific discipline that studies data structures and computational techniques to capture, represent, process, and analyze [[geographic information]]. It can be contrasted with [[geographic information systems]] (GIS), which are software tools.
British geographer [[Michael Frank Goodchild|Michael Goodchild]] defined this area in the 1990s and summarized its core interests, including spatial analysis, visualization, and the representation of uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Twenty years of progress: GIScience in 2010 {{!}} Goodchild {{!}} Journal of Spatial Information Science|url = http://www.josis.org/index.php/josis/article/viewArticle/32|website = www.josis.org|accessdate = 2015-09-18|doi = 10.5311/JOSIS.2010.1.32|doi-broken-date = 2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GIScience is conceptually related to [[geography]], [[information science]], [[computer science]], [[geomatics]] and [[geoinformatics]], but it claims the status of an independent scientific discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Foundations of Geographic Information Science|url = https://books.google.com/?id=_0sDF-0vT0wC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Foundations+of+Geographic+Information+Science#v=onepage&amp;q=Foundations%2520of%2520Geographic%2520Information%2520Science&amp;f=false|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2004-11-23|isbn = 9780203009543|language = en|first = Matt|last = Duckham|first2 = Michael F.|last2 = Goodchild|first3 = Michael|last3 = Worboys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
{{Expand section|date=September 2015}}
Since its inception in the 1990s, the boundaries between GIScience and cognate disciplines are contested, and different communities might disagree on what GIScience is and what it studies. In particular, Goodchild stated that "information science can be defined as the systematic study according to scientific principles of the nature and properties of information. Geographic information science is the subset of information science that is about geographic information."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Geographical information science|last = Goodchild|first = Michael|journal = International Journal of Geographical Information Systems|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |year = 1992|volume = 6|issue = 1|pages = 31–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another influential definition is that by GIScientist [[David Mark (scientist)|David Mark]], which states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Geographic Information Science (GIScience) is the basic research field that seeks to redefine geographic concepts and their use in the context of geographic information systems. GIScience also examines the impacts of GIS on individuals and society, and the influences of society on GIS. GIScience re-examines some of the most fundamental themes in traditional spatially oriented fields such as geography, cartography, and geodesy, while incorporating more recent developments in cognitive and information science. It also overlaps with and draws from more specialized research fields such as computer science, statistics, mathematics, and psychology, and contributes to progress in those fields. It supports research in political science and anthropology, and draws on those fields in studies of geographic information and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Foundations of Geographic Information Science|url = https://books.google.com/?id=_0sDF-0vT0wC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Foundations+of+Geographic+Information+Science#v=onepage&amp;q=Foundations%2520of%2520Geographic%2520Information%2520Science&amp;f=false|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2004-11-23|isbn = 9780203009543|language = en|first = Matt|last = Duckham|first2 = Michael F.|last2 = Goodchild|first3 = Michael|last3 = Worboys|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Fictional Map 1.jpg|right|thumb|400px|A typical map displaying grid reference]]

'''Grid references''' define locations in [[map]]s using [[Cartesian coordinates]]. Grid lines on maps define the [[coordinate system]], and are numbered to provide a unique reference to features. This reference is normally based on [[Map projection|projected]] [[easting and northing]]s

==History==
Although professional map-making and use of the grid had [[History of cartography#China|existed in China before]], the Chinese cartographer and geographer [[Pei Xiu]] of the Three Kingdoms period was the first to mention a plotted geometrical grid reference and graduated scale displayed on the surface of maps to gain greater accuracy in the estimated distance between different locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ancient Inventions |last=Thorpe |first= I. J. |last2=James |first2=Peter J. |last3=Thorpe |first3=Nick |publisher=Michael O'Mara Books Ltd |year=1996 |isbn= 978-1854796080 |publication-date=March 8, 1996 |page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 106 107"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 106&amp;ndash;107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 538 540"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 538&amp;ndash;540.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Howard Nelson asserts that there is ample written evidence that Pei Xiu derived the idea of the grid reference from the map of [[Zhang Heng]] (78&amp;ndash;139 CE), a polymath inventor and statesman of the Eastern Han dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, 359.&lt;/ref&gt; The American writer [[Robert K. G. Temple]] asserts that Zhang Heng should also be credited as the first to establish the mathematical grid in cartography, as evidenced by his work in maps, the titles of his lost books, and the hint given in the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' (i.e. Zhang Heng "cast a network of coordinates about heaven and earth, and reckoned on the basis of it").&lt;ref&gt;Temple (1986) 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of grid referencing==
Grid systems vary, but the most common is a square grid with grid lines intersecting each other at right angles and numbered sequentially from the origin at the bottom left of the map. The grid numbers on the east-west (horizontal) axis are called Eastings, and the grid numbers on the north-south (vertical) axis are called Northings.

Numerical grid references consist of an even number of digits. Eastings are written before Northings. Thus in a 6 digit grid reference 123456, the Easting component is 123 and the Northing component is 456.

Grids may be arbitrary, or can be based on specific distances, for example some maps use a one-kilometre square grid spacing.

A grid reference locates a unique square region on the map. The precision of location varies, for example a simple town plan may use a simple grid system with single letters for Eastings and single numbers for Northings. A grid reference in this system, such as 'H3', locates a particular square rather than a single point.

Points can be located by grid references on maps that use a standard system for Eastings and Northings, such as the [[Universal Transverse Mercator]] used worldwide, or the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid]] used by [[Ordnance Survey]] in the UK.  These points can then be located by someone else using grid references, even if using maps of a different scale.

In the [[Universal Transverse Mercator]] (UTM) system, grid reference is given by three numbers: zone, easting and northing.  In the UTM system, the earth is divided into 60 zones. Northing values are given by the metres north, or south (in the southern hemisphere) of the equator. Easting values are established as the distance from the central meridian of a zone.  The central meridian is arbitrarily set at 500,000 metres, to avoid negative numbers.  A position 100 kilometres west of a central meridian would have an easting of 400,000 metres.  Due to its popularity, and worldwide cover, the UTM system is used worldwide by NATO as well as many countries, including Australia and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icsm.gov.au/mapping/map_projections.html#grid_amg {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008080452/http://www.icsm.gov.au/mapping/map_projections.html |date=2014-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, a proprietary grid system is used. In [[Ordnance Survey]] maps, each Easting and Northing grid line is given a two-digit code, based on the [[British national grid reference system]] with origin point just off the southwest coast of the [[United Kingdom]]. Since the Eastings and Northings are one kilometre apart, a combination of a Northing and an Easting will give a four-digit grid reference describing a one-kilometre square on the ground. The convention is the grid reference numbers call out the lower-left corner of the desired square.  In the example map below, the town Little Plumpton lies in the square 6901, even though the writing which labels the town is in 6802 and 6902, most of the buildings (the orange boxed symbols) are in square 6901.

The more digits added to a grid reference, the more precise the reference becomes. To locate a specific building in Little Plumpton, a further two digits are added to the four-digit reference to create a six-digit reference. The extra two digits describe a position within the 1-kilometre square. Imagine (or draw or superimpose a [[Romer]]) a further 10x10 grid within the current grid square. Any of the 100 squares in the superimposed 10×10 grid can be accurately described using a digit from 0 to 9 (with 0 0 being the bottom left square and 9 9 being the top right square).

For the church in Little Plumpton, this gives the digits 6 and 7 (6 on the left to right axis (Eastings) and 7 on the bottom to top axis (Northings). These are added to the four-figure grid reference after the two digits describing the same [[coordinate axis]], and thus our six-figure grid reference for the church becomes 696017. This reference describes a 100-metre by 100-metre square, and not a single point, but this precision is usually sufficient for navigation purposes. The symbols on the map are not precise in any case, for example the church in the example above would be approximately 100x200 metres if the symbol was to scale, so in fact, the middle of the black square represents the map position of the real church, independently of the actual size of the church.

Grid references comprising larger numbers for greater precision could be determined using large-scale maps and an accurate [[Romer]]. This might be used in [[surveying]] but is not generally used for land navigating for walkers or cyclists, etc. The growing availability and decreasing cost of handheld [[GPS]] receivers enables determination of accurate grid references without needing a map, but it is important to know how many digits the [[GPS]] displays to avoid reading off just the first six digits. A [[GPS]] unit commonly gives a ten-digit grid reference, based on two groups of five numbers for the Eastings and Northing values. Each successive increase in precision (from 6 digit to 8 digit to 10 digit) pinpoints the location by a factor of 10. Since, in the UK at least, a 6-figure grid reference identifies a square of 100-metre sides, an 8-figure reference would identify a 10-metre square, and a 10-digit reference a 1-metre square. In order to give a standard 6-figure grid reference from a 10-figure GPS readout, the 4th, 5th, 9th and 10th digits must be omitted so it is important not to read just the first 6 digits.

== Formation ==
These landforms are created by [[earth flow]] ("[[solifluction]]"). They can also be former [[river terrace]]s that are subsequently bisected by [[fluvial erosion]]. In cases where there is a deposit of younger sedimentary beds ([[loess]], [[colluvium]]) the interfluves have a rounder and less rugged appearance. A consequence of interfluve formation is the so-called "interfluvial landscape."&lt;ref name=Leser/&gt;

'''Landscape connectivity''' in [[ecology]] is, broadly, "''the degree to which the [[landscape]] facilitates or impedes movement among [[Natural resource|resource]] patches''".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.D., Fahrig, L., Henein, K. and Merriam, G. 1993. Connectivity is a vital element of landscape structure. Oikos 68:571–573.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, connectivity may be a continuous property of the landscape and independent of patches and paths.&lt;ref name="Fischer, J. 2004"&gt;Fischer, J., Lindenmayer, D.B. and I. Fazey. 2004. Appreciating ecological complexity: habitat contours as a conceptual landscape model. Conservation Biology, 18: 1245–1253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer, J 2006"&gt;Fischer, J. and D.B. Lindenmayer. 2006. Beyond fragmentation: the continuum model for fauna research and conservation in human-modified landscapes. Oikos, 112: 473–480.&lt;/ref&gt; Connectivity includes both structural connectivity (the physical arrangements of disturbance and/or patches) and functional connectivity (the movement of individuals across contours of disturbance and/or among patches).&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, C. P. 2003. A scalar analysis of landscape connectivity. Oikos 102:433-439.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baguette, M., S. Blanchet, D. Legrand, V. M. Stevens, and C. Turlure. 2013. Individual dispersal, landscape connectivity and ecological networks. Biological Reviews Of The Cambridge Philosophical Society 88:310–326.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which a landscape is connected determines the amount of [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] there is among patches, which influences [[gene flow]], local [[adaptation]], [[extinction]] risk, [[colonization]] [[probability]], and the potential for organisms to move as they cope with [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, J.A., C.D. Thomas, B.A. Wintle, and A. Moilanen. 2009. Climate change, connectivity and conservation decision-making: back to basics. Journal of Applied Ecology, 46: 964-969.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McRae, B. H., Hall, S. A., Beier, P., Theobald, D. M. 2012. Where to Restore Ecological Connectivity? Detecting Barriers and Quantifying Restoration Benefits. PLoS ONE 7:e52604.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
The concept of “Landscape connectivity” was first introduced by Dr. Gray Merriam in 1984. Merriam noted that movement among habitat patches was not merely a function of an organism’s attributes, but also, a quality of the landscape elements through which it must move.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Tischendorf, L. and Fahrig, L. (2000). On the usage and measurement of landscape connectivity. ''Oikos. Vol.'' 90, Pg 7-19.&lt;/ref&gt; To emphasize this fundamental interaction in determining a particular movement pathway, Merriam (1984), defined landscape connectivity as “the degree to which absolute isolation is prevented by landscape elements which allow organisms to move among habitat patches.” &lt;ref&gt;Merriam, G. (1984). Connectivity: a fundamental ecological characteristic of landscape pattern. In: Brandt, J. and Agger, P. (eds), Proceedings of the 1st international seminar on methodology in landscape ecological research and planning. Roskilde University. Denmark, Pg 5-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years later, Merriam and colleagues, revised the definition to “the degree to which the landscape impedes or facilitates movement among resource patches.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Taylor, P. D., Fahrig, L., Henein, K. and Merriam, G. (1993). Connectivity is a vital element of landscape structure. ''Oikos. Vol.'' 68, Pg 571-572.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this definition has undoubtedly become the most accepted and cited meaning within the scientific literature, many authors have continued to create their own definitions. With et al (1997), presented their interpretation as “the functional relationship among habitat patches, owing to the spatial contagion of habitat and the movement responses of organisms to landscape structure.”,&lt;ref&gt;With, K., Gardner, R., Turner, M. (1997). Landscape Connectivity and Population Distributions in Heterogeneous Environments. ''Oikos. Vol''. 78, Pg 151-169&lt;/ref&gt; and Ament et al. (2014) defined it as “the degree to which regional landscapes, encompassing a variety of natural, semi-natural, and developed [[land cover]] types, are conducive to wildlife movement and to sustain ecological processes.” &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ament, R., R. Callahan, M. McClure, M. Reuling, and G. Tabor. (2014). Wildlife Connectivity: Fundamentals for conservation action. Center for Large Landscape Conservation: Bozeman, Montana&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although there have been many definitions of landscape connectivity over the past 30 years, each new description emphasizes both a structural and a behavioural element to the landscape connectivity concept. The physical component is defined by the spatial and temporal configuration of the landscape elements ([[landform]], landcover and [[land use]] types), and the behavioural component is defined by the behavioural responses, of organisms and/or processes, to the physical arrangement of the landscape elements,&lt;ref&gt;Crooks KR, Sanjayan M. (2006) Connectivity Conservation. New York: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, A.F. (1998, 2003). Linkages in the Landscape: The Role of Corridors and Connectivity in Wildlife Conservation. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK&lt;/ref&gt;,.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Importance==
Habitat loss and [[habitat fragmentation]] have become ubiquitous in both natural and human modified landscapes, resulting in detrimental consequences for local [[species]] interactions and global [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahrig, L. (2003). Effects of Habitat Fragmentation on Biodiversity. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics. Vol. 34:487-515

&lt;/ref&gt; Human development now modifies over 50% of the earth’s landscape, leaving only patches of isolated natural or semi-natural habitats for the millions of other species we share this planet with.&lt;ref&gt;Barnosky et al. (2012). Nature 486, 52–58&lt;/ref&gt; Patterns of biodiversity and [[ecosystem function]]s are changing worldwide resulting in a loss of connectivity and [[ecological integrity]] for the entire global [[ecological network]].&lt;ref&gt;Foley et al. (2005). Science 309, 570–574&lt;/ref&gt; Loss of connectivity can influence individuals, [[Population dynamics|populations]] and communities through within species, between species, and between ecosystem interactions. These interactions affect ecological mechanisms such as nutrient and energy flows, predator-prey relationships, [[pollination]], [[seed dispersal]], demographic rescue, [[inbreeding avoidance]], colonization of unoccupied habitat, altered species interactions, and spread of disease,&lt;ref&gt;Rudnick DA, et al. The role of landscape connectivity in planning and implementing conservation and restoration priorities. Issues Ecol. 2012;16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanski I. Metapopulation dynamics. Nature. 1998;396(6706):41–9.&lt;/ref&gt; ,.&lt;ref&gt;Ayram, C., Mendoza, M., Etter, A., Salicrup, D.  (2016). Habitat connectivity in biodiversity conservation: A review of recent studies and applications. Progress in Physical Geography. Vol. 40 (1) Pg 7–37&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, landscape connectivity facilitates the movement of biotic processes such as animal movement, plant propagation, and genetic exchange, as well as abiotic processes such as water, energy, and material movement within and between ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Types of animal movement==

===Daily movements===
Within their [[home range]] or [[Territory (animal)|territory]] most animals must move daily among multiple primary habitat patches to forage for food and obtain all the resources they need.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Migration===
Some species travel to different locations throughout the year to access the resources they need. These movements are usually predictable and are due to changes in the environmental conditions at the primary habitat site, or to facilitate access to [[breeding grounds]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Animal migration|Migratory]] behaviour is seen in land animals,&lt;ref&gt;Dingle, H. (1996). Migration: The biology of life on the move. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; birds &lt;ref&gt;Somveille M, Manica A, Butchart SHM, Rodrigues ASL (2013) Mapping Global Diversity Patterns for Migratory Birds. PLoS ONE 8(8):&lt;/ref&gt; and marine species,&lt;ref&gt;Luschi, P. (2013). Long-Distance Animal Migrations in the Oceanic Environment: Orientation and Navigation Correlates. ISRN Zoology, vol. 2013

&lt;/ref&gt; and the routes they follow are usually the same year after year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Dispersal===
Is the once in a lifetime movement of certain individuals from one population to another for the purpose of breeding.&lt;ref&gt;Traill, L., Brook, B., Frankham, R., and Bradshaw, C. (2010). Pragmatic population viability targets in a rapidly changing world. Biological Conservation. Vol. 143, (1) Pg 28–34&lt;/ref&gt; These exchanges maintain genetic and demographic diversity among populations.&lt;ref&gt;Frankel, O. H. and M. E. Soule 1981. Conservation and Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disturbance movement===
Is the unpredictable movement of individuals or populations to new locations of suitable habitat due to an environmental disturbance. Major disturbances such as fire, natural disasters, human development, and climate change can impact the quality and distribution of habitats and necessitate the movement of species to new locations of suitable habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Incidental movement===
Movement of species in areas that are typically used by humans. These include [[Green belt|greenbelts]], recreational trail systems, [[hedgerows]], and [[golf course]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Connectivity conservation===
Preserving or creating landscape connectivity has become increasingly recognized as a key strategy to protect biodiversity, maintain viable ecosystems and wildlife populations, and facilitate the movement and adaptation of wildlife populations in the face of [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Meiklejohn, K., R. Ament, and G. Tabor. (2010). Habitat corridors &amp; landscape connectivity: clarifying the terminology. Center for Large Landscape Conservation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which landscapes are connected determines the overall amount of movement taking place within and between local populations. This connectivity has influences on [[gene flow]], local [[adaptation]], extinction risk, colonization probability, and the potential for organisms to move and adapt to climate change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With habitat loss and fragmentation increasingly deteriorating natural habitats, the sizes and isolation of the remaining habitat fragments are particularly critical to the long-term [[Conservation biology|conservation]] of biodiversity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, connectivity among these remaining fragments, as well as the characteristics of the surrounding matrix, and the permeability and structure of the habitat edges are all important for biodiversity conservation and affect the overall persistence, strength and integrity of the remaining [[Biological interaction|ecological interactions]].&lt;ref&gt;Fortuna, M., Bascompte, J. (2006). Habitat loss and the structure of plant–animal mutualistic networks. Ecology Letters, (2006) 9: 281–286&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantifying landscape connectivity===
Since the definition of landscape connectivity has both a physical and a behavioural component, quantifying landscape connectivity is consequently organism-, process- and landscape-specific.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to (Wiens &amp; Milne, 1989), the first step in the quantification process of landscape connectivity is defining the specific habitat or habitat network of the focal species, and in turn, describe the landscape elements from its point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J. A. and Milne, B. T. 1989. Scaling of ‘landscapes’ in landscape ecology, or, landscape ecology from a beetle’s perspective. – Landscape Ecol. 3: 87–96.&lt;/ref&gt; The next step is to determine the scale of the landscape structure as perceived by the [[organism]]. This is defined as the scale at which the species responds to the array of landscape elements, through its fine-scale (grain), and large-scale (extent), movement behaviours.&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J. A. 1997. Metapopulation dynamics and landscape ecology. – In: Hanski, I. and Gilpin, M. E. (eds), Metapopulation biology. Academic Press, pp. 43–62&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, how the species responds to the different elements of a landscape is determined. This comprises the species’ movement pattern based on behavioural reactions to the mortality risk of the landscape elements, including habitat barriers and edges.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Connectivity metrics===

Although connectivity is an intuitive concept, there is no single consistently-used metric of connectivity. Theories of connectivity include consideration of both binary representations of connectivity through "corridors" and "linkages" and continuous representations of connectivity, which include the binary condition as a sub-set &lt;ref name="Fischer, J. 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fischer, J 2006"/&gt;

Generally, connectivity metrics fall into three categories:&lt;ref&gt;Calabrese, J. M., and W. F. Fagan. 2004. A comparison-shopper's guide to connectivity metrics. Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment 2:529-536.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Structural connectivity metrics are based on the physical properties of landscapes, which includes the idea of patches (size, number of patches, average distance to each other) and relative disturbance (human structures such as roads, parcelization, urban/agricultural land-use, human population).
# Potential connectivity metrics are based on the landscape structure as well as some basic information about the study organism's [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] ability such as average dispersal distance, or dispersal kernel.
# Actual (also called realized, or functional) connectivity metrics are measured based on the actual movements of individuals along and across contours of connectivity, including among patches (where these exist). This takes into account the actual number of individuals born at different sites, their reproduction rates, and mortality during dispersal.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, J. R., S. Mitarai, D. A. Siegel, J. E. Caselle, C. Dong, and J. C. McWilliams. 2010. Realized and potential larval connectivity in the Southern California Bight. Marine Ecology Progress Series 401:31-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors make a further distinction based on the number of individuals that not only disperse between sites, but that also survive to reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;Pineda, J., J. A. Hare, and S. Sponaungle. 2007. Larval transport and dispersal in the coastal ocean and consequences for population connectivity. Oceanography 20:22-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Typically, the "natural" form of connectivity as an ecological property perceived by organisms is modeled as a continuous surface of permeability, which is the corollary to disturbance. This can be accomplished by most geographic information systems (GIS) able to model in grid/raster format. A critical component of this form of modeling is the recognition that connectivity and disturbance are perceived and responded to differently by different organisms and ecological processes. This variety in responses is one of the most challenging parts of attempting to represent connectivity in spatial modeling. Typically, the most accurate connectivity models are for single species/processes and are developed based on information about the species/process.&lt;ref&gt;LaPoint, S., P. Gallery, M. Wikelski, and R. Kays. 2013. Animal behavior, cost-based corridor models, and real corridors. Landscape Ecology, 28: 1615-1630.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little, and often no evidence that spatial models, including those described here, can represent connectivity for the many species or processes that occupy many natural landscapes. The disturbance-based models are used as the basis for the binary representations of connectivity as paths/corridor/linkages through landscapes described below.

Circuitscape is an open source program that uses circuit theory to predict connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes for individual movement, gene flow, and conservation planning. Circuit theory offers several advantages over common analytic connectivity models, including a theoretical basis in random walk theory and an ability to evaluate contributions of multiple dispersal pathways. Landscapes are represented as conductive surfaces, with low resistances assigned to habitats that are most permeable to movement or best promote gene flow, and high resistances assigned to poor dispersal habitat or to movement barriers. Effective resistances, current densities, and voltages calculated across the landscapes can then be related to ecological processes, such as individual movement and gene flow.

Graphab is a software application devoted to the modelling of landscape networks. It is composed of four main modules: graph building, including loading the initial landscape data and identification of the patches and the links; computation of the connectivity metrics from the graph; connection between the graph and exogenous point data set; visual and cartographical interface.
Graphab runs on any computer supporting Java 1.6 or later (PC under Linux, Windows, Mac...). It is distributed free of charge for non-commercial use.

'''Landscape ecology''' is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and [[sustainability science]]. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a highly interdisciplinary field in [[systems science]], landscape ecology integrates [[biophysical]] and [[Analytic induction|analytical]] approaches with [[humanistic]] and [[holistic]] perspectives across the [[natural sciences]] and [[social sciences]].  Landscapes are spatially heterogeneous geographic areas characterized by diverse interacting patches or ecosystems, ranging from relatively natural terrestrial and aquatic systems such as forests, grasslands, and lakes to human-dominated environments including agricultural and urban settings.&lt;ref name="wu-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"&gt;Turner, M.G., R. H. Gardner and R. V. O'Neill 2001.  Landscape Ecology in Theory and Practice.  Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"&gt;Forman, R.T.T. 1995.  Land Mosaics: The Ecology of Landscapes and Regions.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most salient characteristics of landscape ecology are its emphasis on the relationship among pattern, process and scale, and its focus on broad-scale ecological and environmental issues. These necessitate the coupling between biophysical and socioeconomic sciences.  Key research topics in landscape ecology include ecological flows in landscape mosaics, land use and land cover change, scaling, relating landscape pattern analysis with ecological processes, and landscape conservation and [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;Wu &amp; Hobbs 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

The German term ''Landschaftsökologie''–thus ''landscape ecology''–was coined by German [[Geography|geographer]] [[Carl Troll]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 1939. Luftbildplan und ökologische Bodenforschung (Aerial photography and ecological studies of the earth).  Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde, Berlin: 241-298.&lt;/ref&gt;  He developed this terminology and many early concepts of landscape ecology as part of his early work, which consisted of applying aerial photograph interpretation to studies of interactions between environment and vegetation.

== Explanation ==
Heterogeneity is the measure of how parts of a landscape differ from one another.  Landscape ecology looks at how this spatial structure affects organism abundance at the landscape level, as well as the behavior and functioning of the landscape as a whole.  This includes studying the influence of pattern, or the internal order of a landscape, on process, or the continuous operation of functions of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, M.G.  1989.  Landscape ecology: the effect of pattern on process. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 20:171-197.&lt;/ref&gt;  Landscape ecology also includes geomorphology as applied to the design and architecture of landscapes.&lt;ref name="Allaby-1998"&gt;Allaby, M. 1998.  Oxford Dictionary of Ecology.  Oxford University Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Geomorphology]] is the study of how geological formations are responsible for the structure of a landscape.

==History==

=== Evolution of theory ===
One central landscape ecology theory originated from [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] &amp; [[Edward Osborne Wilson|Wilson's]] ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''.  This work considered the biodiversity on islands as the result of competing forces of colonization from a mainland stock and [[stochastic]] [[extinction]].  The concepts of [[island biogeography]] were generalized from physical islands to abstract patches of [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] by Levins' [[metapopulation]] model (which can be applied e.g. to forest islands in the agricultural landscape&lt;ref&gt;Banaszak J. (ed.) 2000. Ecology of Forest Islands. Bydgoszcz University Press, Bydgoszcz, Poland, 313 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;).  This generalization spurred the growth of landscape ecology by providing [[conservation biology|conservation biologists]] a new tool to assess how [[habitat fragmentation]] affects population viability.  Recent growth of landscape ecology owes much to the development of [[geographic information system]]s (GIS)&lt;ref name="sstein-2009"&gt;Steiniger, S., and Hay, G.J. 2009. Free and Open Source Geographic Information Tools for Landscape Ecology. Ecological Informatics 4(4): 183-195. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/jump-pilot/files/w_other_freegis_documents/articles/sstein_freegitools_ecoinf2009.pdf/download preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; and the availability of large-extent habitat data (e.g. [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] datasets).

=== Development as a discipline ===
Landscape ecology developed in [[Europe]] from historical planning on human-dominated landscapes.  Concepts from general ecology theory were integrated in [[North America]].{{when|date=May 2014}}  While general ecology theory and its sub-disciplines focused on the study of more homogenous, discrete community units organized in a hierarchical structure (typically as [[ecosystem]]s, [[population]]s, [[species]], and communities), landscape ecology built upon heterogeneity in space and time. It frequently included human-caused landscape changes in theory and application of concepts.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"&gt;Sanderson, J. and L. D. Harris (eds.).  2000.  Landscape Ecology: A Top-Down Approach.  Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, landscape ecology was a discrete, established discipline. It was marked by the organization of the [http://www.landscape-ecology.org/ International Association for Landscape Ecology] (IALE) in 1982.  Landmark book publications defined the scope and goals of the discipline, including Naveh and Lieberman&lt;ref name="Naveh-1984"&gt;Naveh, Z. and A. Lieberman.  1984.  Landscape ecology: theory and application.  Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; and Forman and Godron.&lt;ref name="Forman-1986"&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron.  1986. Landscape Ecology.  John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryszkowski-2002"&gt;Ryszkowski, L. (ed.).  2002.  Landscape Ecology in Agroecosystems Management.  CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt; wrote that although study of "the ecology of spatial configuration at the human scale" was barely a decade old, there was strong potential for theory development and application of the conceptual framework.  Today, theory and application of landscape ecology continues to develop through a need for innovative applications in a changing landscape and environment.  Landscape ecology relies on advanced technologies such as remote sensing, GIS, and [[computer simulation|models]].  There has been associated development of powerful quantitative methods to examine the interactions of patterns and processes.&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"/&gt;  An example would be determining the amount of [[carbon cycle|carbon]] present in the [[soil]] based on landform over a landscape, derived from GIS maps, [[vegetation]] types, and [[rainfall]] data for a region.

=== Definitions/conceptions of landscape ecology ===
Nowadays, at least six different conceptions of landscape ecology can be identified: one group tending toward the more disciplinary concept of [[ecology]] (subdiscipline of [[biology]]; in conceptions 2, 3, and 4) and another group—characterized by the [[interdisciplinary]] study of relations between human societies and their environment—inclined toward the [[Integrated geography|integrated]] view of [[geography]] (in conceptions 1, 5, and 6):&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T.; Trepl, L. &amp; Vicenzotti, V. 2012: ''What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions''. Landscape Research 2012, online first, DOI:10.1080/01426397.2011.640751. All the following quotations and descriptions come from this source.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Interdisciplinary scientific analysis of subjectively defined landscape units'' (e.g. [[Ernst Neef|Neef]] School&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Neef, E. 1967: Die theoretischen Grundlagen der Landschaftslehre. Gotha: Haack; Haase, G. 1990: Approaches to, and methods of landscape diagnosis as a basis of landscape planning and landscape management. Ekológia 9(1): 31-44.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Landscapes are defined in terms of uniformity in land use. Landscape ecology explores the landscape's natural potential in terms of functional utility for human societies. To analyse this potential, it is necessary to draw on several natural sciences.
# ''Topological ecology at the landscape scale'' (e.g. Forman &amp; Godron&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. &amp; Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10): 733-740; Forman, R.T.T. &amp; Godron, M. 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;):  'Landscape' is defined as a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems (woods, meadows, marshes, villages, etc.) that is repeated in similar form throughout.  It is explicitly stated that landscapes are areas at a kilometres wide ''human scale'' of perception, modification, etc.  Landscape ecology describes and explains the landscapes' characteristic patterns of ecosystems and investigates the flux of energy, mineral nutrients, and species among their component ecosystems, providing important knowledge for addressing land-use issues.
# ''Organism-centred, multi-scale topological ecology'' (e.g. [[John A. Wiens]]&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. &amp; Milne, B.T. 1989: Scaling of 'landscapes' in landscape ecology, or, landscape ecology from the beetle's perspective. Landscape Ecology 3(2): 87-96; Wiens, J. A. 1999: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. &amp; Gardner, R.H. (eds): Landscape ecological analyses: Issues and applications. Springer, NY: 371-383.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Explicitly rejecting views expounded by Troll, Zonneveld, Naveh, Forman &amp; Godron, etc., landscape and landscape ecology are defined independently of human perceptions, interests, and modifications of nature. 'Landscape' is defined – regardless of scale – as the 'template' on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes.  Not humans, but rather the respective species being studied is the point of reference for what constitutes a landscape.
# ''Topological ecology at the landscape level of biological organisation'' (e.g. Urban et al.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, D.L.; O'Neill, R.V. &amp; Shugart, H.H., Jr. 1987: Landscape ecology. A hierarchical perspective can help scientists understand spatial patterns. BioScience 37(2): 119-127.&lt;/ref&gt;):  On the basis of ecological hierarchy theory, it is presupposed that nature is working at multiple scales and has different levels of organisation which are part of a rate-structured, nested hierarchy. Specifically, it is claimed that, above the ecosystem level, a landscape level exists which is generated and identifiable by high interaction intensity between ecosystems, a specific interaction frequency and, typically, a corresponding spatial scale. Landscape ecology is defined as ecology that focuses on the influence exerted by spatial and temporal patterns on the organisation of, and interaction among, functionally integrated multispecies ecosystems.
# ''Analysis of social-ecological systems using the natural and social sciences and humanities'' (e.g. Leser;&lt;ref&gt;Leser, H. 1991: Landschaftsökologie. Ansatz, Modelle, Methodik, Anwendung. Ulmer, Stuttgart.&lt;/ref&gt; Naveh;&lt;ref&gt;Naveh, Z. &amp; Lieberman, A.S. 1984: Landscape ecology. Theory and application. Springer, NY; Naveh, N. 2000: What is holistic landscape ecology? A conceptual introduction. Landscape and Urban Planning 50(1-3): 7-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Zonneveld&lt;ref&gt;Zonneveld, I.S. 1995: Land ecology: an introduction to landscape ecology as a base for land evaluation, land management and conservation. SPB, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Landscape ecology is defined as an interdisciplinary super-science that explores the relationship between human societies and their specific environment, making use of not only various natural sciences, but also social sciences and humanities. This conception is grounded in the assumption that social systems are linked to their specific ambient ecological system in such a way that both systems together form a co-evolutionary, self-organising unity called 'landscape'. Societies' cultural, social and economic dimensions are regarded as an integral part of the global ecological hierarchy, and landscapes are claimed to be the manifest systems of the 'Total Human Ecosystem' (Naveh) which encompasses both the physical ('geospheric') and mental ('noospheric') spheres.
# ''Ecology guided by cultural meanings of lifeworldly landscapes'' (frequently pursued in practice&lt;ref&gt;However, not always under the designation 'landscape ecology', but as part of landscape stewardship, landscape architecture and, first and foremost, environmental or urban and landscape planning.&lt;/ref&gt; but not defined, but see, e.g., Hard;&lt;ref&gt;Hard, G. 1973: Die Geographie. Eine wissenschaftstheoretische Einführung. deGruyter, Berlin: 92-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Trepl&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T.; Trepl, L. &amp; Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research 2012, online first, DOI:10.1080/01426397.2011.640751.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Landscape ecology is defined as ecology that is guided by an external aim, namely, to maintain and develop [[lifeworld]]ly [[landscapes]]. It provides the ecological knowledge necessary to achieve these goals. It investigates how to sustain and develop those populations and ecosystems which (i) are the material 'vehicles' of lifeworldly, aesthetic and symbolic landscapes and, at the same time, (ii) meet societies' functional requirements, including provisioning, regulating, and supporting [[ecosystem services]]. Thus landscape ecology is concerned mainly with the populations and ecosystems which have resulted from traditional, regionally specific forms of land use.

== Relationship to ecological theory ==
Some research programmes of landscape ecology theory, namely those standing in the European tradition, may be slightly outside of the "classical and preferred domain of scientific disciplines" because of the large, heterogeneous areas of study. However, general [[ecology theory]] is central to landscape ecology theory in many aspects.  Landscape ecology consists of four main principles: the development and dynamics of spatial heterogeneity, interactions and exchanges across heterogeneous landscapes, influences of spatial heterogeneity on biotic and [[abiotic]] processes, and the management of spatial heterogeneity.  The main difference from traditional ecological studies, which frequently assume that systems are spatially homogenous, is the consideration of [[spatial pattern]]s.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"&gt;Turner, M.G. and R. H. Gardner (eds.).  1991.  Quantitative Methods in Landscape Ecology.  Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important terms ==
Landscape ecology not only created new terms, but also incorporated existing ecological terms in new ways.  Many of the terms used in landscape ecology are as interconnected and interrelated as the discipline itself.

=== Landscape ===
{{Main|Landscape}}

Certainly, 'landscape' is a central concept in landscape ecology. It is, however, defined in quite different ways. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T., Trepl, L. and V. Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research online first.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carl Troll]] conceives of landscape not as a mental construct but as an objectively given 'organic entity', a ''harmonic individuum of space''.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 2007: The geographic landscape and its investigation. In: Wiens, J.A., Moss, M.R., Turner, M.G. &amp; Mladenoff, D.J. (eds): Foundation papers in landscape ecology. New York, Columbia University Press:71–101 [First published as: Troll, C. 1950: Die geographische Landschaft und ihre Erforschung. Studium Generale 3(4/5):163–181].&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ernst Neef]]&lt;ref&gt;Neef, E. 1967: Die theoretischen Grundlagen der Landschaftslehre. Haack, Gotha; cf. Haase, G. and H. Richter 1983: Current trends in landscape research. GeoJournal 7(2):107–119.&lt;/ref&gt; defines landscapes as sections within the uninterrupted earth-wide interconnection of geofactors which are defined as such on the basis of their uniformity in terms of a specific land use, and are thus defined in an anthropocentric and relativistic way.
According to [[Richard Forman]] and [[Michael Godron]],&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10):733–740; Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; a landscape is a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that is repeated in similar form throughout, whereby they list woods, meadows, marshes and villages as examples of a landscape's ecosystems, and state that a landscape is an area at least a few kilometres wide. 
[[John A. Wiens]]&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. and B.T. Milne, B.T. 1989: Scaling of 'landscapes' in landscape ecology, or, landscape ecology from the beetle's perspective. Landscape Ecology 3(2):87–96; Wiens, J.A.: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. and R.H. Gardner (eds) 1999: Landscape ecological analyses: issues and applications. Springer, New York:371–383.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes the traditional view expounded by [[Carl Troll]], Isaak S. Zonneveld, Zev Naveh, Richard T. T. Forman/Michel Godron and others that landscapes are arenas in which humans interact with their environments on a kilometre-wide scale; instead, he defines 'landscape'—regardless of scale—as "the template on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes".&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1999: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. and R.H. Gardner (eds): Landscape ecological analyses: issues and applications. Springer, New York:371–383; cf. Wiens, J.A. 2005: ''Toward a unified landscape ecology''. In: Wiens, J.A. and M.R. Moss (eds): Issues and perspectives in landscape ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge:365–373.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some define 'landscape' as an area containing two or more [[ecosystem]]s in close proximity.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"/&gt;

=== Scale and heterogeneity (incorporating composition, structure, and function) ===
{{Main|Scale (spatial)|Heterogeneity}}

A main concept in landscape ecology is ''scale''. Scale represents the real world as translated onto a map, relating distance on a map image and the corresponding distance on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Malczewski, J. 1999. GIS and Multicriteria Decision Analysis. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Scale is also the spatial or temporal measure of an object or a process,&lt;ref name="Turner-1991" /&gt; or amount of spatial resolution.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Components of scale include composition, structure, and function, which are all important ecological concepts. Applied to landscape ecology, ''composition'' refers to the number of patch types (see below) represented on a landscape and their relative abundance. For example, the amount of [[forest]] or [[wetland]], the length of forest edge, or the density of [[road]]s can be aspects of landscape composition. ''Structure'' is determined by the composition, the configuration, and the proportion of different patches across the landscape, while ''function'' refers to how each element in the landscape interacts based on its life cycle events.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991" /&gt; ''Pattern'' is the term for the contents and internal order of a heterogeneous area of land.&lt;ref name="Forman-1986" /&gt;

A landscape with structure and pattern implies that it has spatial ''heterogeneity'', or the uneven distribution of objects across the landscape.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Heterogeneity is a key element of landscape ecology that separates this discipline from other branches of ecology. Landscape heterogeneity is able to quantify with agent-based methods as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wirth|first=E.|last2=Szabó|first2=Gy.|last3=Czinkóczky|first3=A.|date=2016-06-07|title=MEASURE OF LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY BY AGENT-BASED METHODOLOGY|url=http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/III-8/145/2016/|journal=ISPRS Annals of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences|language=English|volume=III-8|pages=145–151|doi=10.5194/isprs-annals-iii-8-145-2016|issn=2194-9042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patch and mosaic===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Patch]] --&gt;

{{See also|Patch dynamics}}
''Patch'', a term fundamental to landscape ecology, is defined as a relatively homogeneous area that differs from its surroundings.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  Patches are the basic unit of the landscape that change and fluctuate, a process called ''patch dynamics''.  Patches have a definite shape and spatial configuration, and can be described compositionally by internal variables such as number of trees, number of tree species, height of trees, or other similar measurements.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;

''Matrix'' is the "background ecological system" of a landscape with a high degree of [[Landscape connectivity|connectivity]].  ''Connectivity'' is the measure of how connected or spatially continuous a corridor, network, or matrix is.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  For example, a forested landscape (matrix) with fewer gaps in forest cover (open patches) will have higher connectivity.  ''Corridors'' have important functions as strips of a particular type of landscape differing from adjacent land on both sides.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  A ''network'' is an interconnected system of corridors while ''mosaic'' describes the pattern of patches, corridors, and matrix that form a landscape in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;

=== Boundary and edge ===
{{Main|Edge effect}}

Landscape patches have a boundary between them which can be defined or fuzzy.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000" /&gt; The zone composed of the edges of adjacent ecosystems is the ''boundary''.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; ''Edge'' means the portion of an ecosystem near its perimeter, where influences of the adjacent patches can cause an environmental difference between the interior of the patch and its edge. This edge effect includes a distinctive species composition or abundance.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; For example, when a landscape is a mosaic of perceptibly different types, such as a forest adjacent to a [[grassland]], the edge is the location where the two types adjoin. In a continuous landscape, such as a forest giving way to open woodland, the exact edge location is fuzzy and is sometimes determined by a local gradient exceeding a threshold, such as the point where the tree cover falls below thirty-five percent.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991" /&gt;

=== Ecotones, ecoclines, and ecotopes ===
{{Main|Ecotone|Ecocline|Ecotype}}

A type of boundary is the ''ecotone'', or the transitional zone between two communities.&lt;ref name="Allaby-1998" /&gt; Ecotones can arise naturally, such as a [[Shore|lakeshore]], or can be human-created, such as a cleared [[agricultural field]] from a forest.&lt;ref name="Allaby-1998" /&gt; The ecotonal community retains characteristics of each bordering community and often contains species not found in the adjacent communities. Classic examples of ecotones include fencerows, forest to marshlands transitions, forest to grassland transitions, or land-water interfaces such as [[riparian zone]]s in forests. Characteristics of ecotones include [[vegetational sharpness]], [[physiognomic]] change, occurrence of a spatial community mosaic, many [[exotic species]], [[ecotonal species]], [[spatial mass effect]], and [[Biodiversity|species richness]] higher or lower than either side of the ecotone.&lt;ref name="Walker-2003"&gt;Walker, S., W. J. Barstow, J. B. Steel, G. L. Rapson, B. Smith, W. M. King, and Y. H. Cottam. 2003. Properties of ecotones: evidence from five ecotones objectively determined from a coastal vegetation gradient. Journal of Vegetation Science 14:579-590.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[wikt:ecocline|ecocline]]'' is another type of landscape boundary, but it is a gradual and continuous change in environmental conditions of an ecosystem or community. Ecoclines help explain the distribution and diversity of organisms within a landscape because certain organisms survive better under certain conditions, which change along the ecocline. They contain heterogeneous communities which are considered more environmentally stable than those of ecotones.&lt;ref name="Attrill-2002"&gt;Attrill, M.J. and S.D. Rundle. 2002. Ecotone or ecocline: ecological boundaries in estuaries. Estuarine, Coastal, and Shelf Science 55:929-936.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''ecotope'' is a spatial term representing the smallest ecologically distinct unit in mapping and classification of landscapes.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Relatively homogeneous, they are spatially explicit landscape units used to stratify landscapes into ecologically distinct features. They are useful for the measurement and mapping of landscape structure, function, and change over time, and to examine the effects of disturbance and fragmentation.

=== Disturbance and fragmentation ===
{{Main|Disturbance (ecology)|Habitat fragmentation}}

''Disturbance'' is an event that significantly alters the pattern of variation in the structure or function of a system. ''Fragmentation'' is the breaking up of a habitat, ecosystem, or land-use type into smaller parcels.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Disturbance is generally considered a natural process. Fragmentation causes land transformation, an important process in landscapes as development occurs.

An important consequence of repeated, random clearing (whether by natural disturbance or human activity) is that contiguous cover can break down into isolated patches. This happens when the area cleared exceed a critical level, which means that landscapes exhibit two phases: connected and disconnected.&lt;ref name="Green-2006"&gt;Green, D.G., Klomp, N.I., Rimmington, G.R. and Sadedin, S. 2006. Complexity in Landscape Ecology, Springer, Amsterdam. {{cite web |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dgreen/books/springer/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619025437/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dgreen/books/springer/ |archivedate=2008-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Landscape ecology theory stresses the role of human impacts on landscape structures and functions. It also proposes ways for restoring degraded landscapes.&lt;ref name="Naveh-1984"/&gt; Landscape ecology explicitly includes humans as entities that cause functional changes on the landscape.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"/&gt; Landscape ecology theory includes the landscape stability principle, which emphasizes the importance of landscape structural heterogeneity in developing resistance to disturbances, [[regeneration (ecology)|recovery from disturbances]], and promoting total system stability.&lt;ref name="Forman-1986"/&gt; This principle is a major contribution to general ecological theories which highlight the importance of relationships among the various components of the landscape. Integrity of landscape components helps maintain resistance to external threats, including development and land transformation by human activity.&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"/&gt; Analysis of land use change has included a strongly geographical approach which has led to the acceptance of the idea of multifunctional properties of landscapes.&lt;ref name="Ryszkowski-2002"/&gt; There are still calls for a more unified theory of landscape ecology due to differences in professional opinion among ecologists and its interdisciplinary approach (Bastian 2001).

An important related theory is hierarchy theory, which refers to how systems of discrete functional elements operate when linked at two or more scales.  For example, a forested landscape might be hierarchically composed of [[drainage basin]]s, which in turn are composed of local ecosystems, which are in turn composed of individual trees and gaps.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  Recent theoretical developments in landscape ecology have emphasized the relationship between pattern and process, as well as the effect that changes in spatial scale has on the potential to extrapolate information across scales.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"/&gt;  Several studies suggest that the landscape has critical thresholds at which ecological processes will show dramatic changes, such as the complete transformation of a landscape by an [[invasive species]] due to small changes in temperature characteristics which favor the invasive's [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] requirements.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"/&gt;

== Application ==

===Research directions===
Developments in landscape ecology illustrate the important relationships between spatial patterns and ecological processes. These developments incorporate quantitative methods that link spatial patterns and ecological processes at broad spatial and temporal scales.  This linkage of time, space, and environmental change can assist managers in applying plans to solve [[Natural environment|environmental]] problems.&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"/&gt;  The increased attention in recent years on spatial dynamics has highlighted the need for new quantitative methods that can analyze patterns, determine the importance of spatially explicit processes, and develop reliable models.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"/&gt;  [[Multivariate analysis|Multivariate]] analysis techniques are frequently used to examine landscape level vegetation patterns.  Studies use statistical techniques, such as [[cluster analysis]], [[canonical correspondence analysis]] (CCA), or [[detrended correspondence analysis]] (DCA), for classifying vegetation.  [[Gradient analysis]] is another way to determine the vegetation structure across a landscape or to help delineate critical wetland habitat for conservation or mitigation purposes (Choesin and Boerner 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, J. and C. L. Sagers, C.L. 1998.  Structure of herbaceous plant assemblages in a forested riparian landscape.  Plant Ecology 138:1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Climate change]] is another major component in structuring current research in landscape ecology.  Ecotones, as a basic unit in landscape studies, may have significance for management under climate change scenarios, since change effects are likely to be seen at ecotones first because of the unstable nature of a fringe habitat.&lt;ref name="Walker-2003"/&gt;  Research in northern regions has examined landscape ecological processes, such as the accumulation of snow, melting, freeze-thaw action, percolation, soil moisture variation, and temperature regimes through long-term measurements in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Loffler, J. and O.-D. Finch.  2005.  Spatio-temporal gradients between high mountain ecosystems of central Norway.  Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research 37:499-513.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study analyzes gradients across space and time between ecosystems of the central high mountains to determine relationships between distribution patterns of animals in their environment.  Looking at where animals live, and how vegetation shifts over time, may provide insight into changes in snow and ice over long periods of time across the landscape as a whole.

Other landscape-scale studies maintain that human impact is likely the main determinant of landscape pattern over much of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, J.B. and W. M. King.  1995.  Human-mediated vegetation switches as processes in landscape ecology.  ''[[Landscape Ecology (journal)|Landscape Ecology]]'' 10:191-196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Landscapes may become substitutes for [[biodiversity]] measures because plant and animal composition differs between samples taken from sites within different landscape categories.  Taxa, or different species, can “leak” from one habitat into another, which has implications for landscape ecology.  As human land use practices expand and continue to increase the proportion of edges in landscapes, the effects of this leakage across edges on assemblage integrity may become more significant in conservation. This is because taxa may be conserved across landscape levels, if not at local levels.&lt;ref&gt;Dangerfield, J.M., A.J. Pik, D.Britton, A. Holmes, M. Gillings, I. Oliver, D. Briscoe, and A. J. Beattie.  2003.  Patterns of invertebrate biodiversity across a natural edge.  Austral Ecology 28:227-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to other disciplines===
Landscape ecology has been incorporated into a variety of ecological subdisciplines. For example, a recent development has been the more explicit consideration of spatial concepts and principles applied to the study of lakes, streams, and wetlands in the field of [[landscape limnology]]. [[Seascape ecology]] is a marine and coastal application of landscape ecology&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ (ed.). 2017. Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, landscape ecology has important links to application-oriented disciplines such as [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]].  In agriculture, landscape ecology has introduced new options for the management of environmental threats brought about by the intensification of agricultural practices.  Agriculture has always been a strong human impact on ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Ryszkowski-2002"/&gt;  In forestry, from structuring stands for fuelwood and timber to ordering stands across landscapes to enhance aesthetics, consumer needs have affected conservation and use of forested landscapes.  Landscape forestry provides methods, concepts, and analytic procedures for landscape forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, S.G. 1995.  Landscape Forestry.  John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscape ecology has been cited as a contributor to the development of [[fishery|fisheries]] biology as a distinct biological science discipline,&lt;ref&gt;Magnuson, J.J. 1991.  Fish and fisheries ecology.  Ecological Applications 1:13-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently incorporated in study design for wetland delineation in [[hydrology]].&lt;ref name="Attrill-2002"/&gt; It has helped shape [[integrated landscape management]].&lt;ref name="Sayer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayer|first1=J|title=Reconciling conservation and development: are landscapes the answer?|journal=Biotropica|date=2009|volume=41|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, landscape ecology has been very influential for progressing sustainability science and sustainable development planning.  In example, a recent study assessed sustainable urbanization across Europe using evaluation indices, country-landscapes, and landscape ecology tools and methods.&lt;ref&gt;Shaker, R.R. (2015) The well-being of nations: an empirical assessment of sustainable urbanization for Europe. International Journal of Sustainable Development &amp; World Ecology, 22(5), 375-387. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2015.1055524&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape ecology has also been combined with [[population genetics]] to form the field of landscape genetics, which addresses how landscape features influence the population structure and gene flow of plant and animal populations across space and time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manel|first=Stéphanie|last2=Schwartz|first2=Michael K.|last3=Luikart|first3=Gordon|last4=Taberlet|first4=Pierre|date=April 2003|title=Landscape genetics: combining landscape ecology and population genetics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534703000089|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=18|issue=4|pages=189–197|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00008-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on how the quality of intervening landscape, known as "matrix," influences spatial variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Storfer|first=A.|last2=Murphy|first2=M.

==[[Border|Boundaries]]==
Below are separate lists of [[countries]] and [[Dependent territory|dependencies]] with their land boundaries, and lists of which countries and dependencies border [[oceans]] and major [[sea]]s.  The first short section describes the borders or edges of [[continents]] and oceans/major seas.  Disputed areas are not considered.

===[[Continent]]s===
''(Notes: Dependencies and islands remote from continental land masses{{vague|date=October 2018}} are not considered and are '''excluded''' from this list section; thus only continental land borders are considered.   The only countries listed either straddle continents or are on a continent border.)''

Historically - that is, before the development of engineering technology that allowed the construction of tunnels and high-level road bridges - the lowest bridging point of a river was frequently the point at which an important town or city grew up, and particularly where trade and commerce took place.  The place could be served by roads on either side of the river, allowing access from a wide [[hinterland]]; had river transport available upstream; and often was at a location that allowed seagoing traffic to approach it from a downstream direction.

'''Marconi Plaza''' is an urban park square located in [[South Philadelphia]], Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Plaza was named to recognize the 20th Century cultural identity in Philadelphia of the surrounding [[Italian-American]] enclave neighborhood and became the designation location of the annual Columbus Day Parade.

Marconi Plaza has two main halves, East and West, which are divided in the middle by [[Broad Street (Philadelphia)|Broad Street]].  It is located at the most southern end of the city and within the northern border of the [[Sports Complex Special Services District]].  The park plaza is accessible via the Oregon Avenue Station of the [[Broad Street Line|Broad Street Subway]].

The urban park plaza itself, from which the neighborhood derives its name(Marconi East and "Marco" Marconi West), is a {{convert|19|acre|m2|sing=on}} rectangular park. The Roman styled plaza is divided in the center by Broad Street and is bordered by 13th Street, 15th Street, Bigler Street, and Oregon Avenue.

==History==
[[File:1926 Sesqui-Centennial Exposition "Luminous Liberty Bell", Philadelphia, PA.jpg|thumb|right|Grand pre-entrance for the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition -demolished 1927]]
The plaza design is credited to the strong influence of renowned architect [[Paul Philippe Cret]] in 1904 as part of his participation in the Art Jury reviewing the preliminary plans presented by landscape architects the [[Olmsted Brothers]], who were then charged with a modified design to complete the work.  
.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UzQCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=oregon+square+philadelphia+olmsted+brothers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yHdOs8z1-D&amp;sig=BCsUNxSmQzMJ7AApO7WozyGJoQo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBmoVChMIgYLFz8aPxwIVBhc-Ch3iAg32#v=onepage&amp;q=oregon%20square%20philadelphia%20olmsted%20brothers&amp;f=false Annual Report - City Parks Association of Philadelphia, Issues 16-26 (pp. 67-70)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Plaza later served as the grand pre-entrance for the 1926 [[Sesquicentennial Exposition]], leading visitors south along a tree lined [[Southern Boulevard Parkway (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania)]] ( landscaped segment of South Broad Street) to the exhibition grounds that started at Packer Avenue and continued to [[League Island Park]]. This neighborhood twin park is mirrored on both sides of Broad Street and became property of the [[Fairmount Park]] system. It held the common name of Oregon Plaza until October 18, 1937 when it was officially named Marconi Plaza in honor of the Nobel Prize Laureate [[Guglielmo Marconi]], the inventor of Radio.

The [[F. Amadee Bregy School]] was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The original design of the Plaza was a two level [[Terrace garden|terrace]] with pathways, marble trims, urns, influenced by landscaped architecture modeling after [[Roman gardens]] and [[English gardens]]. The east and west plaza reflected the same winding pathways leading to a raised stepped terrace surrounded by stone railings and entrance sculptures of large urns with two small "reflecting" pools of water facing Broad Street at the center point, which at that time was cut away from the curbline forming half circles open to traffic on both the east and west. This accent was used in 1926 to position a large Liberty Bell at the center of the street permitting traffic to circle around.

Over the years many of the fine details have been erased including the half circled indented curbline on either side of Broad Street at the center. This location also had on both sides of the plaza, two reflecting pools of water. The pools were filled in to provide the foundation for the two statues that were later erected to support the cultural history of the immigrant Italian community and respond to [[Anti-Italianism]].

The park is currently lushly covered with 25% trees adorned with park benches, open areas for two tot lots, a baseball field, basketball court, and country cottage style enclosed [[bocce]] court. The sidewalk border surrounding the park is densely lined with large maple trees with heights of 30–50 feet high.

==Public Art==
[[File:Guglielmo_Marconi_Statue_by_Giancarlo_Saleppichi,_1975-erected_at_Marconi_Plaza_Philadelphia_PA.jpg|150px|thumb|right| Sculpted by Giancarlo Saleppichi,1975-erected at Marconi Plaza Philadelphia_PA]]
A bronze statue of [[Guglielmo Marconi]], sculpted by Saleppichi Giancarlo was erected on the east Plaza in 1975 though the efforts of the Marconi Memorial Association headed by Dr. Frank P. DiDio. The statue was dedicated on April 25, 1980, to commemorate the 106th anniversary of the birthday of the world-famous Italian scientist and inventor.

[[File:Columbus Broad St Philly art.JPG|150px|thumb|left| Marble Statue sculpted by Emanuele Caroni, erected October 12, 1876. Relocated 1982 to the west Plaza]]A statue of [[Christopher Columbus]] was erected on the west plaza in 1982. This work was originally located along Belmont Avenue in Fairmount Park, having been erected on October 12, 1876 for Philadelphia's [[Centennial Exposition]]. Thought to be the work of Emanuele Caroni, this is said to be first publicly funded monument to Christopher Columbus in the United States. It was purchased for $18,000 with money raised by Italian-Americans and the Columbus Monument Association, through the efforts of Alonzo Viti of Philadelphia and his brothers. The statue's initial installation began an annual tradition for the colony of mostly Italian Americans in South Philadelphia to march each year on Columbus Day to the statue in Fairmount Park. The {{convert|6|mi|km|sing=on}} journey was found to be too exhausting and in 1920 the celebration changed locations.

==Marconi East: Residential==
'''Mollbore Terraces of Marconi''': The 1930s Mollbore Terrace was a unique urban change from the densely lined row houses that characterized most of South Philadelphia. The design included front porches and a rear yard with an access service roadway for trash pick-up. Three separate Mollbore Terrace sections were constructed east of the plaza within the boundaries of 13th Street to 7th Street, and from Oregon Ave to Johnston Street. The layout departed from the standard street grid, offsetting the numbered streets that permitted placing a "mini-public-square" of green space for houses to face inward on all four sides and directions. The center large rectangular common parks space was originally designated as a "Terrace" that included pathways, grass and trees with an octagon-shaped wading pool at the west end and a raised octagon sand pit platform with a flag pole at the east end.

==Marconi West: Residential==
'''Roman Terraces of Marconi:''' The [[Greco-Roman]]–accented homes west of the plaza from 15th to 19th street, using the same concept but on a smaller scale, include two oval-shaped terrace streets at Smedley and Colorado.  The terrace at Colorado Street became well known citywide for its annual decorations and street lighting during the Christmas holidays from 1950 to 2000.

'''Moyamensing Avenue Parkway of Marconi:''' This main angular dual street with an approximately 50-foot center median landscaped area and tree-lined street, crosses the standard street grid and was designed as an alternative roadway access to the 1926 Sesquicentennial Exposition. It begins at Oregon Avenue, that once was a headhouse entrance for the 1926 Expo, through to the intersection of 20th Street, Penrose Avenue and Packer Avenue.  An architectural design for a grand public square like the squares of Center City Philadelphia (inspired by the [[Benjamin Franklin Parkway]]) was planned at the parkway's end point of Penrose Avenue, which was viewed by city planners to be the significant southern gateway to the City. The 1926 square was never developed.

==Boundaries==
In 2002 the City of Philadelphia legislated boundaries of the Sports Complex Special Service District. The residential communities defined included Marconi Plaza. The Special District established an overlay providing the basis for a new definition to Marconi East as community "three" and Marconi West as community "four".

[[File:Noaa3-2006-0602-1206 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Sea ice]] at the North Pole in 2006]]

The '''North Pole''', also known as the '''Geographic North Pole''' or '''Terrestrial North Pole''', is (subject to the caveats explained below) defined as the point in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] where the [[Earth's rotation|Earth's axis of rotation]] meets its surface.

The North Pole is the northernmost point on the Earth, lying diametrically opposite the [[South Pole]]. It defines geodetic [[latitude]] 90° North, as well as the direction of [[true north]]. At the North Pole all directions point south; all lines of [[longitude]] converge there, so its longitude can be defined as any degree value. Along tight latitude circles, counterclockwise is east and clockwise is west. The North Pole is at the center of the Northern Hemisphere.

While the South Pole lies on a continental [[Antarctica|land mass]], the North Pole is located in the middle of the [[Arctic Ocean]] amid waters that are almost permanently covered with constantly shifting [[sea ice]]. This makes it impractical to construct a permanent station at the North Pole ([[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station|unlike the South Pole]]). However, the [[Soviet Union]], and later [[Russia]], constructed a number of [[Drifting ice station|manned drifting stations]] on a generally annual basis since 1937, some of which have passed over or very close to the Pole. Since 2002, the Russians have also annually established a base, [[Barneo]], close to the Pole. This operates for a few weeks during early spring. Studies in the 2000s predicted that the North Pole may become seasonally ice-free because of [[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic ice shrinkage]], with timescales varying from 2016&lt;ref&gt;Black, Richard (8 April 2001). [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13002706 New warning on Arctic sea ice melt]. BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ljunggren, David (5 March 2009). [https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/05/us-canada-arctic-idUSTRE52468B20090305 Arctic summer ice could vanish by 2013: expert]. Reuters&lt;/ref&gt; to the late 21st century or later.

The sea depth at the North Pole has been measured at {{convert|4261|m|abbr=on}} by the Russian [[MIR (submersible)|Mir submersible]] in [[Arktika 2007|2007]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL0286134520070802 Russian sub plants flag at North Pole], Reuters, 2 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and at  4,087 m (13,410&amp;nbsp;ft)  by [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://militera.lib.ru/memo/usa/anderson_w/18.html | title="Наутилус" у Северного полюса |publisher=[[Voenizdat|Воениздат]] | year=1965 | accessdate=12 January 2012 | author=[[William Anderson (naval officer)|Андерсон, Уильям Роберт]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7rftTUAUXOIC&amp;pg=PA202| title=The International Regime of the Polar Regions | publisher=[[Hague Academy of International Law|Acadimie de Droit International de La Ha]] | year=1968 | accessdate=12 January 2012 | author=Mouton, M.W. | pages=202 (34)| isbn=9028614427 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest land is usually said to be [[Kaffeklubben Island]], off the northern coast of [[Greenland]] about {{convert|700|km|abbr=on}} away, though some perhaps semi-permanent gravel banks lie slightly closer. The nearest permanently inhabited place is [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]] in the [[Qikiqtaaluk Region]], Nunavut, Canada, which is located {{convert|817|km|abbr=on}} from the Pole.

==Precise definition==
{{See also|Polar motion}}
The Earth's axis of rotation&amp;nbsp;– and hence the position of the North Pole&amp;nbsp;– was commonly believed to be fixed (relative to the surface of the Earth) until, in the 18th century, the mathematician [[Leonhard Euler]] predicted that the axis might "wobble" slightly. Around the beginning of the 20th century astronomers noticed a small apparent "variation of latitude," as determined for a fixed point on Earth from the observation of stars. Part of this variation could be attributed to a wandering of the Pole across the Earth's surface, by a range of a few metres. The wandering has several periodic components and an irregular component. The component with a period of about 435 days is identified with the eight-month wandering predicted by Euler and is now called the [[Chandler wobble]] after its discoverer. The exact point of intersection of the Earth's axis and the Earth's surface, at any given moment, is called the "instantaneous pole", but because of the "wobble" this cannot be used as a definition of a fixed North Pole (or South Pole) when metre-scale precision is required.

It is desirable to tie the system of Earth coordinates (latitude, longitude, and elevations or [[orography]]) to fixed landforms. Of course, given [[plate tectonics]] and [[isostasy]], there is no system in which all geographic features are fixed. Yet the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] and the [[International Astronomical Union]] have defined a framework called the [[International Terrestrial Reference System]].

===Pre-1900===

As early as the 16th century, many prominent people correctly believed that the North Pole was in a sea, which in the 19th century was called the [[Polynya]] or [[Open Polar Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wright, John K. |journal=Geographical Review|volume=43|issue=3|date=July 1953|pages=338–365 |title=The Open Polar Sea}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was therefore hoped that passage could be found through ice floes at favorable times of the year. Several expeditions set out to find the way, generally with whaling ships, already commonly used in the cold northern latitudes.

One of the earliest expeditions to set out with the explicit intention of reaching the North Pole was that of British naval officer [[William Parry (explorer)|William Edward Parry]], who in 1827 reached latitude 82°45′ North. In 1871 the [[Polaris expedition]], a US attempt on the Pole led by [[Charles Francis Hall]], ended in disaster. Another British [[Royal Navy]] attempt on the pole, part of the [[British Arctic Expedition]], by Commander [[Albert Hastings Markham|Albert H. Markham]] reached a then-record 83°20'26" North in May 1876 before turning back. An 1879–1881 expedition commanded by [[United States Navy|US naval]] officer [[George W. DeLong]] ended tragically when their ship, the [[USS Jeannette (1878)|USS ''Jeanette'']], was crushed by ice. Over half the crew, including DeLong, were lost.

[[File:Nansen-fram.jpg|thumb|left|Nansen's ship ''Fram'' in the Arctic ice]]
In April 1895 the Norwegian explorers [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and [[Hjalmar Johansen]] struck out for the Pole on skis after leaving Nansen's icebound ship ''[[Fram]]''. The pair reached latitude 86°14′ North before they abandoned the attempt and turned southwards, eventually reaching [[Franz Josef Land]].

In 1897 Swedish engineer [[Salomon August Andrée]] and two companions tried to reach the North Pole in the hydrogen balloon ''Örnen'' ("Eagle"), but came down {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} north of [[Kvitøya]], the northeasternmost part of the [[Svalbard]] archipelago. They trekked to Kvitøya but died there three months later.  In 1930 the remains of [[S. A. Andrée's Arctic Balloon Expedition of 1897|this expedition]] were found by the Norwegian [[Bratvaag Expedition]].

The Italian explorer [[Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi|Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi]] and Captain [[Umberto Cagni]] of the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] (Regia Marina) sailed the converted whaler ''[[Jason (ship)|Stella Polare]]'' ("Pole Star") from Norway in 1899. On 11 March 1900 Cagni led a party over the ice and reached latitude 86° 34’ on 25 April, setting a new record by beating Nansen's result of 1895 by {{convert|35|to|40|km|abbr=on}}. Cagni barely managed to return to the camp, remaining there until 23 June. On 16 August the ''Stella Polare'' left [[Rudolf Island]] heading south and the expedition returned to Norway.

The US explorer [[Frederick Cook]] claimed to have reached the North Pole on 21 April 1908 with two [[Inuit]] men, Ahwelah and Etukishook, but he was unable to produce convincing proof and his claim is not widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bryce ''Cook and Peary: the Polar Controversy Resolved'' Stackpole 1997; Henderson, B. (2005) ''True North'' W W Norton &amp; Company {{ISBN|0-393-32738-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conquest of the North Pole was for many years credited to US Navy engineer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the Pole on 6 April 1909, accompanied by [[Matthew Henson]] and four Inuit men, Ootah, Seeglo, Egingwah, and Ooqueah. However, Peary's claim remains highly disputed and controversial. Those who accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey were not trained in [Western] navigation, and thus could not independently confirm his navigational work, which some claim to have been particularly sloppy as he approached the Pole.

The distances and speeds that Peary claimed to have achieved once the last support party turned back seem incredible to many people, almost three times that which he had accomplished up to that point. Peary's account of a journey to the Pole and back while traveling along the direct line&amp;nbsp;– the only strategy that is consistent with the time constraints that he was facing&amp;nbsp;– is contradicted by Henson's account of tortuous detours to avoid [[Pressure ridge (ice)|pressure ridge]]s and [[Lead (sea ice)|open lead]]s.

The  British explorer [[Wally Herbert]], initially a supporter of Peary, researched Peary's records in 1989 and found that there were significant discrepancies in the explorer's navigational records. He concluded that Peary had not reached the Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-wally-herbert-453324.html |title=Sir Wally Herbert |work=The Independent |date=16 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224045237/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sir-wally-herbert-453324.html |archivedate=24 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Peary came again in 2005, however, when British explorer [[Tom Avery]] and four companions recreated the outward portion of Peary's journey with replica wooden sleds and [[Canadian Eskimo Dog]] teams, reaching the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours&amp;nbsp;– nearly five hours faster than Peary. However, Avery's fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles, significantly short of the 135 claimed by Peary. Avery writes on his web site that "The admiration and respect which I hold for Robert Peary, Matthew Henson and the four Inuit men who ventured North in 1909, has grown enormously since we set out from [[Cape Columbia]]. Having now seen for myself how he travelled across the pack ice, I am more convinced than ever that Peary did indeed discover the North Pole."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomavery.net/gallery_np2005.php Tom Avery website].

Another rejection of Peary's claim arrived in 2009, when [[E. Myles Standish]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]], an experienced referee of scientific claims, reported numerous alleged [[Lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] and inconsistencies.&lt;ref name="DIOI"&gt;[http://www.dioi.org/spe.htm Roald Amundsen First to Each Pole – Three Prior North Pole Claims: Each Unproven &amp; Highly Suspect].

The first claimed flight over the Pole was made on 9 May 1926 by US naval officer [[Richard E. Byrd]] and pilot [[Floyd Bennett]] in a [[Fokker F.VII|Fokker tri-motor]] aircraft.

In 1982 [[Ranulph Fiennes]] and [[Charles R. Burton]] became the first people to cross the Arctic Ocean in a single season. They departed from Cape Crozier, [[Ellesmere Island]], on 17 February 1982 and arrived at the geographic North Pole on 10 April 1982. They travelled on foot and snowmobile. From the Pole, they travelled towards Svalbard but, due to the unstable nature of the ice, ended their crossing at the ice edge after drifting south on an ice floe for 99 days. They were eventually able to walk to their expedition ship ''MV Benjamin Bowring'' and boarded it on 4 August 1982 at position 80:31N 00:59W. As a result of this journey, which formed a section of the three-year [[Transglobe Expedition]] 1979–1982, Fiennes and Burton became the first people to complete a circumnavigation of the world via both North and South Poles, by surface travel alone. This achievement remains unchallenged to this day.

On 4 May 1990 Børge Ousland and Erling Kagge became the first explorers ever to reach the North Pole unsupported, after a 58-day ski trek from Ellesmere Island in Canada, a distance of 800&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-1000/first-people-to-reach-the-north-pole/ First people to reach the north pole]. Guinnessworldrecords.com. Retrieved 4 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 September 1991 the German research vessel [[RV Polarstern|''Polarstern'']] and the Swedish [[icebreaker]] [[Oden (1988 icebreaker)|''Oden'']] reached the North Pole as the first conventional powered vessels.&lt;ref&gt;Fütterer, D. et al.

In 1998, 1999, and 2000 [[Lada Niva]] Marshs (special very large wheeled versions made by BRONTO, Lada/Vaz's experimental product division) were driven to the North Pole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ladaniva.co.uk/baxter/resources/LadaOddities.htm "Lada Oddities"].

''amphibiousvehicle.net''.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1998 expedition was dropped by parachute and completed the track to the North Pole. The 2000 expedition departed from a Russian research base around 114&amp;nbsp;km from the Pole and claimed an average speed of 20–15&amp;nbsp;km/h in an average temperature of −30&amp;nbsp;°C.

Commercial airliner flights on the [[Polar route]]s may pass within viewing distance of the North Pole.  For example, the flight from [[Chicago]] to [[Beijing]] may come close as latitude 89° N, though because of prevailing winds return journeys go over the [[Bering Strait]].  In recent years journeys to the North Pole by air (landing by helicopter or on a runway prepared on the ice) or by icebreaker have become relatively routine, and are even available to small groups of tourists through [[Adventure travel|adventure holiday]] companies. Parachute jumps have frequently been made onto the North Pole in recent years. The temporary seasonal Russian camp of [[Barneo]] has been established by air a short distance from the Pole annually since 2002, and caters for scientific researchers as well as tourist parties. Trips from the camp to the Pole itself may be arranged overland or by helicopter.

The first attempt at [[Scuba diving|underwater]] exploration of the North Pole was made on 22 April 1998 by Russian firefighter and diver Andrei Rozhkov with the support of the Diving Club of [[Moscow State University]], but ended in fatality. The next attempted dive at the North Pole was organized the next year by the same diving club, and ended in success on 24 April 1999. The divers were Michael Wolff (Austria), Brett Cormick (UK), and Bob Wass (USA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.divernetxtra.com/technol/0200northpole.htm |last=Cormick |first=Brett |title=Diving the top of the world |date=February 2000 |publisher=Diver |accessdate=9 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324132821/http://www.divernetxtra.com/technol/0200northpole.htm |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the United States Navy submarine [[USS Charlotte (SSN-766)|USS ''Charlotte'']] (SSN-766) surfaced through {{convert|155|cm|abbr=on}} of ice at the North Pole and spent 18 hours there.&lt;ref&gt;Ozeck, Dave (12 January 2005)  [https://web.archive.org/web/20081201130555/http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=21223 USS Charlotte Achieves Milestone During Under-Ice Transit]. news.navy.mil.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007 British endurance swimmer [[Lewis Gordon Pugh]] completed a {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} swim at the North Pole. His feat, undertaken to highlight the [[effects of global warming]], took place in clear water that had opened up between the ice floes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6899612.stm Swimmer rises to Arctic challenge], BBC news (15 July 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; His later attempt to paddle a [[kayak]] to the North Pole in late 2008, following the erroneous prediction of clear water to the Pole, was stymied when his expedition found itself stuck in thick ice after only three days. The expedition was then abandoned.

By September 2007 the North Pole had been visited 66 times by different surface ships: 54 times by Soviet and Russian icebreakers, 4 times by Swedish ''Oden'', 3 times by German [[RV Polarstern|''Polarstern'']], 3 times by [[USCGC Healy (WAGB-20)|USCGC ''Healy'']] and [[USCGC Polar Sea|USCGC ''Polar Sea'']], and once by [[CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent|CCGS ''Louis S. St-Laurent'']] and by Swedish ''[[Vidar Viking]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2007/09/19/arktika-shelf.html |title=Вчера и сегодня мы – первые.

[[File:Mir front.jpg|thumb|[[MIR (submersible)|MIR submersible]], one of the two vehicles that were used in [[Arktika 2007|the first ever manned descent to the seabed under the North Pole]]]]
On 2 August 2007 a Russian scientific expedition [[Arktika 2007]] made the first ever manned descent to the ocean floor at the North Pole, to a depth of {{convert|4.3|km|abbr=on}}, as part of the research programme in support of Russia's [[Territorial claims in the Arctic#2001 Russian claim|2001 extended continental shelf claim]] to a large swathe of the Arctic Ocean floor. The descent took place in two [[MIR (submersible)|MIR submersible]]s and was led by Soviet and Russian polar explorer [[Artur Chilingarov]]. In a symbolic act of visitation, the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]] was placed on the ocean floor exactly at the Pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20081221152823/http://www.aari.nw.ru/docs/press_release/20070709_fedorov.html «Академик Федоров» – выходит из порта Санкт-Петербург в экспедицию «Арктика-2007»].

The expedition was the latest in a series of efforts intended to give Russia a dominant influence in the [[Arctic]] according to ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/russias-north-pole-obsession/ Russia’s North Pole Obsession], The New York Times (2 August 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The warming [[Climate of the Arctic|Arctic climate]] and summer shrinkage of the iced area has attracted the attention of many countries, such as China and the United States, toward the top of the world, where resources and shipping routes may soon be exploitable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140104112559/http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/series/thebigmelt/ "The Big Melt"], ''The New York Times'' (October 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

====MLAE 2009 Expedition====
In 2009 the Russian [[MLAE-2009|Marine Live-Ice Automobile Expedition (MLAE-2009)]] with [[Vasily Elagin]] as a leader and a team of Afanasy Makovnev, Vladimir Obikhod, Alexey Shkrabkin, Sergey Larin, Alexey Ushakov and Nikolay Nikulshin reached the North Pole on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire ATVs — Yemelya-1 and Yemelya-2, designed by Vasily Elagin, a known Russian mountain climber, explorer and engineer. The vehicles reached the North Pole on 26 April 2009, 17:30 (Moscow time). The expedition was partly supported by Russian State Aviation. The Russian Book of Records recognized it as the first successful vehicle trip from land to the Geographical North Pole.

====MLAE 2013 Expedition====

[[File:ML130310.JPG|thumb|Yemelya — all terrain amphibious vehicle]]

On 1 March 2013 the Russian Marine Live-Ice Automobile Expedition (MLAE 2013) with Vasily Elagin as a leader, and a team of Afanasy Makovnev, Vladimir Obikhod, Alexey Shkrabkin, Andrey Vankov, Sergey Isayev and Nikolay Kozlov on two custom-built 6 x 6 low-pressure-tire ATVs — Yemelya-3 and Yemelya-4,— started from Golomyanny Island (the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago) to the North Pole across drifting ice of the Arctic Ocean. The vehicles reached the Pole on 6 April and then continued to the Canadian coast. The coast was reached on 30 April 2013 (83°08N, 075°59W Ward Hant Island), and on 5 May 2013 the expedition finished in Resolute Bay, NU. The way between the Russian borderland (Machtovyi Island of the Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago, 80°15N, 097°27E) and the Canadian coast (Ward Hant Island, 83°08N, 075°59W) took 55 days; it was ~2300&amp;nbsp;km across drifting ice and about 4000&amp;nbsp;km in total. The expedition was totally self-dependent and used no external supplies. The expedition was supported by the [[Russian Geographical Society]].&lt;ref name="yemelya.ru"&gt;[http://www.yemelya.ru/diary2013_en.php?lnk=2013 "Diary of MLAE-2013"]. ''yemelya.ru''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Day and night==
The sun at the North Pole is continuously [[Midnight sun|above the horizon]] during the summer and continuously [[Polar night|below the horizon]] during the winter. [[Sunrise]] is just before the [[March equinox]] (around 20 March); the sun then takes three months to reach its highest point of near 23½° elevation at the summer [[solstice]] (around 21 June), after which time it begins to sink, reaching [[sunset]] just after the [[September equinox]] (around 23 September). When the sun is visible in the polar sky, it appears to move in a horizontal circle above the horizon. This circle gradually rises from near the horizon just after the vernal equinox to its maximum elevation (in degrees) above the horizon at summer solstice and then sinks back toward the horizon before sinking below it at the autumnal equinox.  Hence the North and South Poles experience the slowest rates of sunrise and sunset on Earth.

A civil [[twilight]] period of about two weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset, a nautical twilight period of about five weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset and an astronomical twilight period of about seven weeks occurs before sunrise and after sunset.

These effects are caused by a combination of the Earth's [[axial tilt]] and its revolution around the sun. The direction of the Earth's axial tilt, as well as its angle relative to the plane of the Earth's orbit around the sun, remains very nearly constant over the course of a year (both change very slowly over long time periods). At northern midsummer the North Pole is facing towards the sun to its maximum extent. As the year progresses and the Earth moves around the sun, the North Pole gradually turns away from the sun until at midwinter it is facing away from the Sun to its maximum extent. A similar sequence is observed at the South Pole, with a six-month time difference.

==Time==
In most places on Earth, local time is determined by longitude, such that the time of day is more-or-less synchronised to the position of the sun in the sky (for example, at midday the sun is roughly at its highest). This line of reasoning fails at the North Pole, where the sun rises and sets only once per year, and all lines of longitude, and hence all time zones, converge. There is no permanent human presence at the North Pole and no particular time zone has been assigned. Polar expeditions may use any time zone that is convenient, such as [[Greenwich Mean Time]], or the time zone of the country from which they departed{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}.

==Climate==
[[File:2007 Arctic Sea Ice.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic ice shrinkage]]s of 2007 compared to 2005 and also compared to the 1979–2000 average.]]
{{main|Climate of the Arctic}}
{{See also|Climate change in the Arctic}}
The North Pole is substantially warmer than the [[South Pole]] because it lies at sea level in the middle of an ocean (which acts as a reservoir of heat), rather than at altitude on a continental land mass. Despite being an ice cap, it shares some characteristics with a tundra climate (''ETf'') due to the July and August temperatures peaking just above freezing.{{Citation needed|reason=Temperatures peak above freezing in the Greenland weather station but there is not evidence that's true at the North Pole|date=July 2018}}

Winter temperatures at the northernmost weather station in Greenland can range from about {{convert|-50|to|-13|C|0}}, averaging around {{convert|-31|C|0}}, with the North Pole being slightly colder.{{Ref|A|A}} However, a freak storm caused the temperature to reach {{convert|0.7|C|0}} for a time at a [[World Meteorological Organization]] buoy, located at 87.45°N, on December 30, 2015. It was estimated that the temperature at the North Pole was between {{convert|30|and|35|F|0}} during the storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2015/12/30/freak-storm-has-pushed-north-pole-to-freezing-point-50-degrees-above-normal/|title=Freak storm pushes North Pole 50 degrees above normal to melting point|first1=Angela|last1=Fritz|first2=Angela|last2=Fritz|date=30 December 2015|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer temperatures (June, July, and August) average around the freezing point ({{convert|0|C|0}}). The highest temperature yet recorded is {{convert|13|C|0}},&lt;ref name = weather /&gt; much warmer than the South Pole's record high of only {{convert|-12.3|C}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antarcticsun.usap.gov/features/contenthandler.cfm?id=2563 "Antarctic Sun: Heat Wave"], US Antarctic Program&lt;/ref&gt; A similar spike in temperatures occurred on November 15, 2016 when temperatures hit freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://weather.com/news/climate/news/north-pole-above-freezing-siberia-cold-nov2016|title=Bizarre Temperatures: North Pole Rises Above Freezing While Parts of Russia Plunge Below -40 Degrees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet again, February 2018 featured a storm so powerful that temperatures at Cape Morris Jesup, the world's northernmost weather station in Greenland, reached {{convert|6.1|C|0}} and spent 24 straight hours above freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/february-2018-heatwave-across-far-north|title=February 2018 heatwave across the Far North|publisher=NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the pole itself was estimated to reach a high temperature of {{convert|1.6|C|0}}. This same temperature of {{convert|1.6|C|0}} was also recorded at the [[Hollywood Burbank Airport]] in [[Los Angeles]] at the very same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=lox|title=NOWData - NOAA Online Weather Data|publisher=NOAA/NWS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sea ice at the North Pole is typically around {{convert|2|to|3|m|abbr=on}} thick,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/11/1108_041108_north_pole.html Beyond "Polar Express": Fast Facts on the Real North Pole], National Geographic News&lt;/ref&gt; although ice thickness, its spatial extent, and the fraction of open water within the ice pack can vary rapidly and profoundly in response to weather and climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sea Ice|url=http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/sotc/sea_ice.html|work=State of the Cryosphere|publisher=NSIDC|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that the average ice thickness has decreased in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3353930/Arctic-ice-thickness-drops-by-up-to-19-per-cent.html "Arctic ice thickness drops by up to 19 percent"], ''The Daily Telegraph'' (28 October 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that [[global warming]] has contributed to this, but it is not possible to attribute the recent abrupt decrease in thickness entirely to the observed warming in the Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Model-Based Estimates of Change|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch4s4-4-3-4.html|publisher=IPCC|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports have also predicted that within a few decades the Arctic Ocean will be entirely free of ice in the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Amos (12 December 2006).

The retreat of the Arctic sea ice will accelerate global warming, as less ice cover reflects less solar radiation, and may have serious climate implications by contributing to Arctic cyclone generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future of Arctic Climate and Global Impacts |url=http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/future/heat.html |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=6 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909120812/http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/future/heat.html |archivedate=9 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
[[Polar bear]]s are believed to travel rarely beyond about 82° North owing to the scarcity of food, though tracks have been seen in the vicinity of the North Pole, and a 2006 expedition reported sighting a polar bear just {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} from the Pole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/what_we_do/species/about_species/species_factsheets/polar_bear/pbear_population_distribution/index.cfm Polar Bear&amp;nbsp;– Population &amp; Distribution], WWF, January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectthinice.org/blog/view/13723/ Explorers' Blog] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013155730/http://www.projectthinice.org/blog/view/13723/ |date=13 October 2007 }}, Greenpeace Project Thin Ice (1 July 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ringed seal]] has also been seen at the Pole, and [[Arctic fox]]es have been observed less than {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} away at 89°40′&amp;nbsp;N.&lt;ref&gt;Halkka, Antti (February 2003).

Birds seen at or very near the Pole include the [[snow bunting]], [[northern fulmar]] and [[black-legged kittiwake]], though some bird sightings may be distorted by the tendency of birds to follow ships and expeditions.&lt;ref name=calgary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic56-3-309.pdf |title=FARTHEST NORTH POLAR BEAR (Ursus maritimus) |format=PDF |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish have been seen in the waters at the North Pole, but these are probably few in number.&lt;ref name="calgary"/&gt; A member of the Russian team that descended to the North Pole seabed in August 2007 reported seeing no sea creatures living there.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; However, it was later reported that a [[sea anemone]] had been scooped up from the seabed mud by the Russian team and that video footage from the dive showed unidentified [[shrimp]]s and [[Amphipoda|amphipods]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/02/sea-anemone-biology-arctic-north-pole-russia "North Pole sea anemone named most northerly species"], ''Observer'', 2 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Territorial claims to the North Pole and Arctic regions==
{{Main|Territorial claims in the Arctic}}
[[File:Sunset over the North Pole at the International Date line at 20,000 feet Aug 6th 2015 by D Ramey Logan.JPG|thumb|Sunset over the North Pole at the [[International Dateline]], 2015]]
&lt;!-- NOTE: please add detail to the "Territorial claims in the Arctic" article, and keep this as a short summary --&gt;
Currently, under [[international law]], no country owns the North Pole or the region of the Arctic Ocean surrounding it. The five surrounding Arctic countries, Russian Federation, Canada, Norway, Denmark (via Greenland), and the United States, are limited to a {{convert|200|nmi|adj=on|lk=in}} [[exclusive economic zone]] off their coasts, and the area beyond that is administered by the [[International Seabed Authority]].

Upon ratification of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], a country has 10 years to make claims to an extended continental shelf beyond its 200-mile exclusive economic zone.  If validated, such a claim gives the claimant state rights to what may be on or beneath the sea bottom within the claimed zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/annex2.htm|title=United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Annex 2, Article 4)|accessdate=26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norway (ratified the convention in 1996&lt;ref name="ratif"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070711135020/http://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/status2007.pdf Status of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, of the Agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of the Convention and of the Agreement for the implementation of the provisions of the Convention relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks]. un.org (4 June 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;), Russia (ratified in 1997&lt;ref name="ratif"/&gt;), Canada (ratified in 2003&lt;ref name="ratif"/&gt;) and Denmark (ratified in 2004&lt;ref name="ratif"/&gt;) have all launched projects to base claims that certain areas of Arctic continental shelves should be subject to their sole sovereign exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/arctic.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080808103058/http://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/arctic.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 August 2008 |title=Territorial claims in the Arctic |format=PDF |accessdate=16 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Aug2007-TheBattleforthenextenergyfrontier-ShamilYenikeyeff-and-TimothyFentonKrysiek.pdf The Battle for the Next Energy Frontier: The Russian Polar Expedition and the Future of Arctic Hydrocarbons], by Shamil Yenikeyeff and Timothy Fenton Krysiek, [[Oxford Institute for Energy Studies]], August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural associations==
In some children's [[Western culture]]s, the geographic North Pole is described as the location of [[Santa's workshop|Santa Claus' workshop and residence]],&lt;ref name="Legends"&gt;{{cite book |title=Legends of Santa Claus |last= Jeffers|first= Harry Paul|year= 2000|publisher= Twenty-First Century Books|isbn= 0-8225-4983-2|page= 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/living/bay-city/index.ssf/2009/12/meet_your_neighbor_santa_claus.html|title=Meet your neighbor: Santa Claus of the North Pole|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the depictions have been inconsistent between the geographic and magnetic North Pole.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Canada Post]] has assigned postal code [[H0H 0H0]] to the North Pole (referring to Santa's traditional exclamation of "[[Ho ho ho]]!").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadapost.ca/business/corporate/about/newsroom/pr/archive-e.asp?prid=1197 |title=Canada Post Launches 24th Annual Santa Letter-writing Program – Post Office Sends Joy to Salvation Army with $25,000 Donation |website=Canada Post |date=15 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411032948/http://www.canadapost.ca/business/corporate/about/newsroom/pr/archive-e.asp?prid=1197 |archivedate=11 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This association reflects an age-old esoteric mythology of [[Hyperborea]] that posits the North Pole, the otherworldly world-axis, as the abode of God and superhuman beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1993|title=Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival|isbn=0932813356|author=Godwin, Joscelyn|location=Grand Rapids|publisher= Phanes Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popular figure of the pole-dwelling Santa Claus thus functions as an archetype of spiritual purity and transcendence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livingheritage.org/pole-spirits.htm |title=Pole-Spirits North and South|website= Livingheritage.org|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Henry Corbin]] has documented, the North Pole plays a key part in the cultural worldview of [[Sufism]] and Iranian mysticism. "The Orient sought by the mystic, the Orient that cannot be located on our maps, is in the direction of the north, beyond the north."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Corbin, Henry and Pearson, N. (Translator)|title=The Man of Light in Iranian Sufism|date= 1978|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=0394734416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to its remoteness, the Pole is sometimes identified with a mysterious mountain of ancient [[Culture of Iran|Iranian]] tradition called [[Mount Qaf]] (Jabal Qaf), the "farthest point of the earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=[[Ibrahim Muhawi]] &amp; Sharif Kanaana| title=Speak, Bird, Speak Again: Palestinian Arab Folktales|location= Berkeley|publisher= University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Irgam Yigfagna|title=al-Jabal al-Lamma}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to certain authors, the Jabal Qaf of [[Cosmology in medieval Islam|Muslim cosmology]] is a version of [[Rupes Nigra]], a mountain whose ascent, like [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] climbing of the [[Purgatorio|Mountain of Purgatory]], represents the pilgrim's progress through spiritual states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Irgam Yigfagna|title=al-Jabal al-Lamma|page= 44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iranian theosophy, the heavenly Pole, the focal point of the spiritual ascent, acts as a magnet to draw beings to its "palaces ablaze with immaterial matter." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Irgam Yigfagna|title=al-Jabal al-Lamma|page= 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''philosophy of environment''' is a trend of [[Freethought|free thought]] located between [[philosophy]], [[epistemology]] and [[anthropology]]. It combines various schools of philosophy such as humanist ecology, philosophy of evolution and environmental [[humanism]]. It is also meant to be a cultural trend having an influence in society.

==Environment and evolution==

The philosophical current indicated under the name philosophy of evolution has been developed since the 1970s by Humanist Ecology (also called Environmental or Evolutive Humanism) and by the [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-darwinian]] school. Its purpose is the long-term evolution of the complex [[Organism|living being]] in its universal environment, analysed through its Human cultural expression.

This trend is unique to the quasi religious Evolutionist Humanism advocated by [[Julian Huxley]], notably during the founders congress of the IHEU ([[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]) in 1952.

Further than the basic [[Theory|scientific theory]] of evolution (notably neo-[[darwinian]], Evolutive Humanism, developed by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]),  looks at the necessity for Man of a permanent adaptation of both his organism and his thoughts to his universal [[natural environment|environment]]. And from there to the relativized relation to belief and to uncertainty, because human ideas evolve and are transformed, as are physical qualities, in a universal process of [[evolution]] and adaptive improvement in their environment. But this does not suppose [[determinism]], genetic or cultural, it refers to the evolutive interactivity and reactivity, partly random, of the living being with his surroundings. According to [[Marc Carl]], "Man must necessarily learn to manage the insufficient appearance and the uncertainty of information to fit and to develop in his relational interactions with his environment, as well as physically and culturally". In a universal environment still as much as 90% unknown, this evolutive cogitation therefore tries not to be locked in premature schemata and answers. It encourages humility in proposals and intuitive boldness in investigations.
A subjacent humanist thought encourages human beings to deliberately take his destiny in his hands, in careful correlation with his environment, knowing that human thought is one of the most impacting manifestations of the living being, as an agent of transformation of the environment, and consequently not only of the Earth's environment. In terms of philosophy of evolution, the organized collective thought of humanity, and in general his evolutive culture, appears as the key to development of our [[species]] in its universal environment, and the key to a possibly significant interactive modification, in the long term, of this environment. It is principally a prospective step.

This cultural trend seems to have emerged because the concept of progressive permanent adaptation, which is no longer appreciated only by its scientific aspects, also took a metaphysical dimension (in a sense of research of the essence of the human), which consequently encourages analysis of [[human evolution]], an agent which potentially modifies our environment, in philosophical terms. The possibilities and the risks of this evolution, [[Nondeterministic algorithm|non-deterministic]] because of its integration into a dynamic complex living system, gives the human existence and destiny a new sense. And to be involved in such a cogitation opens a philosophical way in which curious minds could not miss advancing sooner or later, a way which rests on a regenerated [[metaphysics]], encouraging us to take back in an evolutive way Aristoteles original concept of physis and its substance, and to search with modern conceptual tools the essence and the sense of our life.

==Humanist ecology (environmental humanism)==

Supported by the philosophy of evolution, this international emerging concept has expressed since the 1970s an evolutive humanism, extending the naturalist tradition of ancient Greek philosophers. Humanist ecology encourages us to better understand and situate the place and the destiny of humanity in its environment in permanent evolution. Human destiny is put in perspective in a universal context where many things remain to be learned.  Because it encourages every human in a responsibility in front of his conscience, humanist ecology  can be defined too as a will of ethical responsibility of civilized humanity, favouring its permanent improvement and its happiness, in useful interaction with its evolutive environment, in a beneficial way as much for a human being particularly as for mankind in general, and in common symbiosis with their local and global bioscape in evolution. That serves to optimize [[Society|human society]] in its own interactions and in its interactions with its bioscape, notably by preserving the planetary equilibrium of the Earth. This solidarity of all of mankind is necessary to preserve its environment and its best development in this environment inspired a particular political expression of humanist ecology, taken up notably by Statesmen such as [[Jacques Chirac]] (France) or Mohammed VI (Morocco) in the main meetings of the United Nations.

==Evolution and its relativisation==

Humanist ecology naturally favours the permanent adaptation and the best possible development of humanity, and of the human being, in an uncertain universal environment in permanent evolution, with a mind open enough to consider all the possibilities. In humanist ecological comprehension, it is vain to want to freeze an arbitrary cultural schemata and choose the apparent equilibrium and the supposed future of one moment of evolution. A permanent evolutive adaptation is necessary, as much biologically as mentally. That requires relativity and a caution in the analysis. According to this concept, for the [[Mind|human mind]], any representation belongs to the domain of belief, considering the uncertainty of the relation of man to the universe, and the natural imperfection of his senses to represent his environment and his interactions with this environment; the reality perceived by Man being only one representation of reality, particular in mankind. Humanist ecology admits this relativized relation with [[belief]] but refutes any final and locking form, knowing that no truth can be final for the human mind without upsetting its natural evolutive necessity. This [[School (discipline)|school of thought]] accepts belief in the present, for want of anything better, but dictates that you must take care to verify and update beliefs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5057">'''Proportional navigation''' (also known as '''PN''' or '''Pro-Nav''') is a [[Guidance, navigation and control|guidance law]] (analogous to [[proportional control]]) used in some form or another by most homing air target [[missiles]].&lt;ref&gt;Yanushevsky, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the fact that two vehicles are on a [[collision course]] when their direct [[Line-of-sight (missile)|Line-of-Sight]] does not change direction as the range closes. PN dictates that the missile velocity vector should rotate at a rate proportional to the rotation rate of the line of sight (Line-Of-Sight rate or LOS-rate), and in the same direction.

: &lt;math&gt; a_n  = N\dot \lambda V&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt; a_n&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration perpendicular to instantaneous line of sight, &lt;math&gt; N&lt;/math&gt; is the proportionality constant generally having an integer value 3-5 (dimensionless), &lt;math&gt;\dot \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the line of sight rate, and V is the closing velocity.

For example, if the line of sight rotates slowly from north to east, the missile should turn to the right by a certain factor faster than the LOS-rate. This factor is called the Navigation Constant.
[[image:Navigation Constant illustration.png]]

Since the line of sight is not in general co-linear with the missile velocity vector, the applied acceleration does not necessarily preserve the missile kinetic energy. In practice, in the absence of engine throttling capability, this type of control may not be possible.

Proportional navigation can also be achieved using an acceleration normal to the instantaneous velocity difference:

: &lt;math&gt; \vec a = N\vec V_r \times \vec \Omega&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Angular velocity#Components from the vectors of the frame|rotation vector]] of the line of sight:

: &lt;math&gt; \vec \Omega = \frac {\vec R \times \vec V_r }{ \vec R \cdot \vec R } &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\vec V_r = \vec V_t - \vec V_m&lt;/math&gt; is the target velocity relative to the missile and &lt;math&gt;\vec R  = \vec R_t- \vec R_m&lt;/math&gt; is the range from missile to target. This acceleration depends explicitly on the velocity difference vector, which may be difficult to obtain in practice. By contrast, in the expressions that follow, dependence is only on the change of the line of sight and the magnitude of the  closing velocity. If acceleration normal to the instantaneous line of sight is desired (as in the initial description), then the following expression is valid:

: &lt;math&gt; \vec a = -N|\vec V_r|\frac{\vec R}{|\vec R|} \times \vec \Omega&lt;/math&gt;

If energy conserving control is required (as is the case when only using control surfaces), the following acceleration, which is orthogonal to the missile velocity, may be used:

: &lt;math&gt; \vec a = -N|\vec V_r|\frac{\vec V_m}{|\vec V_m|} \times \vec \Omega&lt;/math&gt;

A rather simple hardware implementation of this guidance law can be found in early [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] missiles. These missiles use a rapidly rotating [[parabolic mirror]] as a seeker. Simple electronics detect the directional error the seeker has with its target (an [[Infrared|IR]] source), and apply a moment to this gimballed mirror to keep it pointed at the target. Since the mirror is in fact a [[gyroscope]] it will keep pointing at the same direction if no external force or moment is applied, regardless of the movements of the missile. The [[voltage]] applied to the mirror while keeping it locked on the target is then also used (although amplified) to deflect the control surfaces that steer the missile, thereby making missile velocity vector rotation proportional to line of sight rotation. Although this does not result in a rotation rate that is always exactly proportional to the LOS-rate (which would require a constant airspeed), this implementation is equally effective.

The basis of proportional navigation was first discovered at sea, and was used by navigators on ships to ''avoid'' collisions. Commonly referred to as [[Constant Bearing Decreasing Range]] (CBDR), the concept continues to prove very useful for conning officers (the person in control of navigating the vessel at any point in time) because CBDR will result in a collision or near miss if action is not taken by one of the two vessels involved. Simply altering course until a change in bearing (obtained by compass sighting) occurs, will provide some assurance of avoidance of collision. Obviously not foolproof, the conning officer of the vessel having made the course change, must continually monitor bearing lest the other vessel does the same. Significant course change, rather than a modest alteration, is prudent. [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]] dictate which vessel must give way but they, of course, provide no guarantee that action will be taken by that vessel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7661">'''Q-guidance''' is a method of missile [[guidance system|guidance]] used in some U.S. [[ballistic missiles]] and some civilian space flights. It was developed in the 1950s by [[J. Halcombe Laning]] and Richard Battin at the [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory|MIT Instrumentation Lab]].

Q-guidance is used for missiles whose trajectory consists of a relatively short [[boost phase]] (or powered phase) during which the missile's propulsion system operates, followed by a [[coast phase|ballistic phase]] during which the missile coasts to its target under the influence of gravity. ([[Cruise missile]]s use different guidance methods).  The objective of Q-guidance is to hit a specified target at a specified time (if there is some flexibility as to the time the target should be hit then other types of guidance can be used).

==Early Implementations==

At the time Q-guidance was developed the main competitive method was called Delta-guidance. According to Mackenzie,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Mackenzie: Inventing Accuracy&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titan missile|Titan]], some versions of [[Atlas missile|Atlas]], [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] I and II used Delta-guidance, while Q-guidance was used for [[Thor missile|Thor IRBM]] and [[Polaris missile|Polaris]], and presumably [[Poseidon missile|Poseidon]]. It appears, from monitoring of test launches, that early Soviet ICBMs used a variant of Delta-guidance.

==Delta-guidance overview==

Delta-guidance is based on adherence to a planned reference trajectory, which is developed before the flight using ground-based computers and stored in the missile's guidance system. In flight, the actual trajectory is modeled mathematically as a [[Taylor series]] expansion around the reference trajectory. The guidance system attempts to zero the linear terms of this expression, i.e. to bring the missile back to the planned trajectory.  For this reason, Delta-guidance is sometimes referred to as "fly [along] the wire", where the (imaginary) wire refers to the reference trajectory.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In contrast, Q-guidance is a dynamic method, reminiscent of the theories [[dynamic programming]] or [[State space (controls)|state based feedback]].  In essence, it says "never mind where we were supposed to be, given where we are what should we do to make progress towards the goal of reaching the required target at the required time".  To do this it relies on the concept of "velocity to be gained".

==Velocity To Be Gained==
At a given time ''t'' and for a given vehicle position ''r'', the correlated velocity vector ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as follows: if the vehicle had the velocity ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and the propulsion system was turned off, then the missile would reach the desired target at the desired time under the influence of gravity.  In some sense, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the desired velocity.

The actual velocity of the missile is denoted by ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and the missile is subject to both the acceleration due to gravity ''g'' and that due to the engines ''a''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;.  The velocity to be gained is defined as the difference between ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;V_{TBG} = V_c - V_m&lt;/math&gt;

A simple guidance strategy is to apply acceleration (i.e. engine thrust) in the direction of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt;.  This will have the effect of making the actual velocity come closer to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.  When they become equal (i.e. when ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; becomes identically zero) it is time to shut off the engines, since the missile is by definition able to reach the desired target at the desired time on its own.

The only remaining issue is how to compute ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; easily from information available on board the vehicle.

==The Q Matrix==

A remarkably simple differential equation can be used to compute the velocity to be gained:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV_{TBG}}{dt} = -a_T - Q V_{TBG}&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''Q'' matrix is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \left. \frac{\partial V_c}{\partial r}\right|_{r_T,t_f}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q'' is a symmetric 3 by 3 time-varying matrix.  (The vertical bar refers to the fact that the derivative must be evaluated for a given target position ''r''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and time of free flight ''t''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;.)&lt;ref&gt;Battin: Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation of this matrix is non-trivial, but can be performed offline before the flight; experience shows that the matrix is only slowly time varying, so only a few values of Q corresponding to different times during the flight need to be stored on board the vehicle.

In early applications the integration of the differential equation was performed using analog hardware, rather than a digital computer. Information about vehicle acceleration, velocity and position is supplied by the onboard [[Inertial measurement unit]].

'''Derivation of the equation'''

Notation:

''t'' the current time

''r'' the current vehicle position vector

''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; the current vehicle velocity vector

''T'' the time the vehicle will reach the target

''t''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; the time of free flight for the correlated vehicle, i.e. t-T

[...]

==Cross Product Steering==

A reasonable strategy to gradually align the thrust vector to the ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; vector is to steer at a rate proportional to the cross product between them.  A simple control strategy that does this is to steer at the rate

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \kappa (a_T \times V_{TBG})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. This implicitly assumes that ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; remains roughly constant during the maneuver.  A somewhat more clever strategy can be designed that takes into account the rate of time change of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; as well, since this is available from the differential equation above.

This second control strategy is based on Battin's insight&lt;ref&gt;Battin: An Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; that "If you want to drive a vector to zero, it is [expedient] to align the time rate of change of the vector with the vector itself". This suggests setting the auto-pilot steering rate to

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \kappa (V_{TBG} \times \frac{d V_{TBG}}{dt})&lt;/math&gt;

Either of these methods are referred to as '''cross-product steering''', and they are easy to implement in analog hardware.

Finally, when all components of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; are small, the order to cut-off engine power can be given.

A '''quadrant''' is an instrument that is used to measure angles up to 90°. Different versions of this instrument could be used to calculate various readings, such as longitude, latitude, and time of day. It was originally proposed by [[Ptolemy]] as a better kind of [[astrolabe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of the Telescope |first=Henry C. |last=King |publisher=Dover Publications |year=2003 |orig-year=1955 |isbn=978-0-486-43265-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several different variations of the instrument were later produced by [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Muslim astronomers]].

==Etymology==
The term “quadrant”, meaning one fourth, refers to the fact that early versions of the instrument were derived from astrolabes. The quadrant condensed the workings of the astrolabe into an area one fourth the size of the astrolabe face; it was essentially a quarter of an astrolabe.

==History==
[[File:Ptolemy Astrology 1564.jpg|thumb|[[Ptolemy]] using a quadrant]]
One of the earliest accounts of a quadrant comes from [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy's]] Almagest around 150 CE. He described a “plinth” that could measure the altitude of the noon sun by projecting the shadow of a peg on a graduated arc of 90 degrees.&lt;ref name="Quadrant"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackermann|first1=Silke|last2=Van Gent|first2=Robert|title=Quadrant|url=https://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/epact/article.php?ArticleID=14|website=Epact: Scientific Instruments of Medieval and Renaissance Europe|publisher=Museum of the History of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quadrant was unlike later versions of the instrument; it was larger and consisted of several moving parts. Ptolemy’s version was a derivative of the astrolabe and the purpose of this rudimentary device was to measure the meridian angle of the sun.

Islamic astronomers in the Middle Ages improved upon these ideas and constructed quadrants throughout the Middle East, in observatories such as [[Maragheh observatory|Marageh]], [[Rey, Iran|Rey]] and [[Samarkand]]. At first these quadrants were usually very large and stationary, and could be rotated to any bearing to give both the altitude and azimuth for any celestial body.&lt;ref name="Quadrant"/&gt; As Islamic astronomers made advancements in astronomical theory and observational accuracy they are credited with developing four different types of quadrants during the Middle Ages and beyond. The first of these, the sine quadrant, was invented by [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi]] in the 9th century at the [[House of Wisdom]] in Baghdad.&lt;ref name=king1987&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=David A.|title=Islamic Astronomical Instruments|date=1987|publisher=Variorum Reprints|location=London|isbn=0860782018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|128}} The other types were the universal quadrant, the horary quadrant and the astrolabe quadrant.

During the Middle Ages the knowledge of these instruments spread to Europe. In the 13th century Jewish astronomer [[Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon]] was crucial in further developing the quadrant.&lt;ref name="Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon"&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Connor|first1=J.J.|title=Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Tibbon.html|website=Tibbon Biography|publisher=University of St. Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a skilled astronomer and wrote several volumes on the topic, including an influential book detailing how to build and use an improved version of the quadrant. The quadrant that he invented came to be known as the “novus quadrans”, or new quadrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Astrolabe Quadrant|url=https://www.astrolabes.org/pages/quadrant.htm|website=Astrolabes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This device was revolutionary because it was the first quadrant to be built that did not involve several moving parts and thus could be much smaller and more portable.

Tibbon’s Hebrew manuscripts were translated into Latin and improved upon by French scholar [[Peter Nightingale]] several years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Philomena of Dacia, also known as Petrus Dacus, Petrus Danus, Peter Nightingale |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/peter-philomena-daciaalso-known-petrus-dacus-petrus-danus-peter-nightingale |website=Encyclopedia.com |publisher=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Lindberg|editor-first1=David C.|title=Science in the Middle Ages|date=1988|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Ill. [u.a.]|isbn=0226482332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the translation, Tibbon, or Prophatius Judaeus as he was known in Latin, became an influential name in astronomy. His new quadrant was based upon the idea that the stereographic projection that defines a planispheric astrolabe can still work if the astrolabe parts are folded into a single quadrant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pedersen|first1=Olaf|title=Early physics and astronomy : a historical introduction |date=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge|isbn=0521408997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was a device that was far cheaper, easier to use and more portable than a standard astrolabe. Tibbon’s work had a far reach and influenced [[Copernicus]], [[Christopher Clavius]] and [[Erasmus Reinhold]]; and his manuscript was referenced in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante’s]] [[Divine Comedy]].&lt;ref name="Jacob ben Machir ibn Tibbon"/&gt;

As the quadrant became smaller and thus more portable, its value for navigation was soon realized. The first documented use of the quadrant to navigate at sea is in 1461, by [[Diogo Gomes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quadrant|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/quadrant.htm|website=Department of Mathematics|publisher=University of Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sailors began by measuring the height of Polaris to ascertain their latitude. This application of quadrants is generally attributed to Arab sailors who traded along the east coast of Africa and often travelled out of sight of land. It soon became more common to take the height of the sun at a given time due to the fact that Polaris disappears south of the equator.

In 1618 English Mathematician [[Edmund Gunter]] further adapted the quadrant with an invention that came to be known as the Gunter quadrant.&lt;ref name=NMAH&gt;{{cite web |title=Gunter Quadrant |url=http://amhistory.si.edu/navigation/type.cfm?typeid=9 |website=National Museum of American History |publisher=Smithsonian |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pocket sized quadrant was revolutionary because it was inscribed with projections of the tropics, the equator, the horizon and the ecliptic. With the correct tables one could use the quadrant to find the time, the date, the length of the day or night, the time of sunrise and sunset and the meridian. The Gunter quadrant was extremely useful but it had its drawbacks; the scales only applied to a certain latitude so the instrument's use was limited at sea.

==Types==
[[File:Tycho-Brahe-Mural-Quadrant.jpg|thumb|Tycho Brahe Mural Quadrant 1598, picturing the two clocks.]]
There are several types of quadrants:
*[[Mural instrument|Mural quadrant]]s, used for determining the time by measuring the altitudes of [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]]s of astronomical objects. [[Tycho Brahe]] created one of the largest mural quadrants. In order to tell time he would place two clocks next to the quadrant so that he could identify the minutes and seconds in relation to the measurements on the side of the instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dreyer |first1=John |title=Tycho Brahe |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-108-06871-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

*Large frame-based instruments used for measuring angular distances between astronomical objects.
*Geometric quadrant used by [[surveying|surveyor]]s and [[navigation|navigator]]s.
*[[Davis quadrant]] a compact, framed instrument used by navigators for measuring the [[altitude]] of an astronomical object.

They can also be classified as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerard L'E. |last=Turner |title=Antique Scientific Instruments |publisher=Blandford Press Ltd. |year=1980 |isbn=0-7137-1068-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Horary-quadrant.jpg|thumb|Horary quadrant for a latitude of about 51.5° as depicted in an instructional text of 1744: ''To find the Hour of the Day: Lay the thread just upon the Day of the Month, then hold it till you slip the small Bead or Pin-head'' [along the thread] ''to rest on one of the 12 o'Clock Lines; then let the Sun shine from the Sight G to the other at D, the Plummet hanging at liberty, the Bead will rest on the Hour of the Day.'']]
*'''Altitude''' - The plain quadrant with plumb line, used to take the [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] of an object.
*'''Gunner's''' - A type of [[clinometer]] used by an [[Artillery|artillerist]] to measure the elevation or depression angle of a gun barrel of a cannon or mortar, both to verify proper firing elevation, and to verify the correct alignment of the weapon-mounted fire control devices. 
*'''Gunter's''' - A quadrant used for time determination as well as the length of day, when the sun had risen and set, the date, and the meridian using scales and curves of the quadrant along with related tables.  It was invented by [[Edmund Gunter]] in 1623.  Gunter's quadrant was fairly simple which allowed for its widespread and long-lasting use in the 17th and 18th centuries.  Gunter expanded the basic features of other quadrants to create a convenient and comprehensive instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Davis |first1=John |title=A Medieval Gunter's Quadrant? |url=http://sundialsoc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Bulletin-23iii-Davis.pdf |journal=British Sundial Society Bulletin |volume=23 |issue=iii |date=September 2011 |accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its distinguishable feature included projections of the tropics, equator, ecliptic, and the horizon.&lt;ref name=NMAH/&gt;
*'''Islamic''' - King identified four types of quadrants that were produced by Muslim astronomers.&lt;ref name=king1987/&gt;
#'''The [[sine quadrant]]''' (Arabic: Rubul Mujayyab) - also known as the "Sinecal Quadrant" – was used for solving trigonometric problems and taking astronomical observations.  It was developed by al-Khwarizmi in 9th century Baghdad and prevalent until the nineteenth century.  Its defining feature is a graph-paper like grid on one side that is divided into sixty equal intervals on each axis and is also bounded by a 90 degree graduated arc. A cord was attached to the apex of the quadrant with a bead, for calculation, and a plumb bob.  They were also sometimes drawn on the back of astrolabes.
#'''The universal (shakkāzīya) quadrant''' – used for solving astronomical problems for any latitude: These quadrants had either one or two sets of shakkāzīya grids and were developed in the fourteenth century in Syria. Some [[astrolabes]] are also printed on the back with the universal quadrant like an astrolabe created by Ibn al-Sarrāj.
#'''The horary quadrant''' – used for finding the time with the sun: The horary quadrant could be used to find the time either in equal or unequal (length of the day divided by twelve) hours. Different sets of markings were created for either equal or unequal hours. For measuring the time in equal hours, the horary quadrant could only be used for one specific latitude while a quadrant for unequal hours could be used anywhere based on an approximate formula. One edge of the quadrant had to be aligned with the sun, and once aligned, a bead on the plumbline attached to the centre of the quadrant showed the time of the day. An example exists dated 1396, from European sources ([[Richard II]] of England).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-09/one-man27s-trash-is-another27s-centuries-old-treasure/3654974 |title=14th century timepiece unearthed in Qld farm shed |author=Clayton Bloom |date=9 November 2011 |website=[[ABC News Online]] |access-date=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest horary quadrant was found during an excavation in 2013 in the Hanseatic town of [[Zutphen]] (Netherlands), is dated ca. 1300, and is in the local Stedelijk Museum in Zutphen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Davis |title=The Zutphen Quadrant – A Very Early Equal-Hour Instrument Excavated in The Netherlands |journal=British Sundial Society Bulletin |volume=26 |issue=i |url=http://www.flowton-dials.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Zutphen-quadrant-Bull-26i.pdf |date=March 2014 |pages=36-42 |access-date=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fermin |first=B. |first2=D. |last2=Kastelein |title=Het Zutphense Kwadrant.

#'''The astrolabe/[[almucantar]] quadrant''' – a quadrant developed from the astrolabe: This quadrant was marked with one half of a typical astrolabe plate as astrolabe plates are symmetrical. A cord attached from the centre of the quadrant with a bead at the other end was moved to represent the position of a celestial body (sun or a star). The ecliptic and star positions were marked on the quadrant for the above. It is not known where and when the astrolabe quadrant was invented, existent astrolabe quadrants are either of Ottoman or Mamluk origin, while there have been discovered twelfth century Egyptian and fourteenth century Syrian treatises on the astrolabe quadrant. These quadrants proved to be very popular alternatives to astrolabes.

==Geometric quadrant==
[[File:quadrant.png|thumb|Geometric quadrant with plumb bob.]]
The geometric quadrant is a quarter-circle panel usually of wood or brass.  Markings on the surface might be printed on paper and pasted to the wood or painted directly on the surface.  Brass instruments had their markings scribed directly into the brass.

For marine navigation, the earliest examples were found around 1460.  They were not [[graduation (instrument)|graduated]] in degrees but rather had the [[latitude]]s of the most common destinations directly scribed on the [[wiktionary:Limb#Etymology 2|limb]].  When in use, the navigator would sail north or south until the quadrant indicated he was at the destination's latitude, turn in the direction of the destination and sail to the destination maintaining a course of constant latitude.  After 1480, more of the instruments were made with limbs graduated in degrees.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;{{cite book |last=May |first=William Edward |title=A History of Marine Navigation |publisher={{nowrap| G. T. Foulis}} &amp; Co. Ltd. |location=Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire |year=1973 |isbn=0-85429-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along one edge there were two sights forming an [[alidade]].  A [[plumb bob]] was suspended by a line from the centre of the arc at the top.

In order to measure the [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] of a star, the observer would view the star through the sights and hold the quadrant so that the plane of the instrument was vertical.  The plumb bob was allowed to hang vertical and the line indicated the reading on the arc's [[Graduation (instrument)|graduation]]s.  It was not uncommon for a second person to take the reading while the first concentrated on observing and holding the instrument in proper position.

The accuracy of the instrument was limited by its size and by the effect the wind or observer's motion would have on the plumb bob.  For navigators on the deck of a moving ship, these limitations could be difficult to overcome.

===Solar observations===
[[File:Back-observation-quadrant.png|thumb|Drawing of a back observation quadrant.  This instrument was used in the manner of a backstaff to measure the elevation of the sun by observing the position of a shadow on the instrument.]]
In order to avoid staring into the sun to measure its altitude, navigators could hold the instrument in front of them with the sun to their side.  By having the sunward sighting vane cast its shadow on the lower sighting vane, it was possible to align the instrument to the sun.  Care would have to be taken to ensure that the altitude of the centre of the sun was determined.  This could be done by averaging the elevations of the upper and lower [[umbra]] in the shadow.

===Back observation quadrant===

In order to perform measurements of the altitude of the sun, a back observation quadrant was developed.&lt;ref name="may"/&gt;

With such a quadrant, the observer viewed the horizon from a ''sight vane'' (C in the figure on the right) through a slit in the ''horizon vane'' (B).  This ensured the instrument was level.  The observer moved the ''shadow vane'' (A) to a position on the graduated scale so as to cause its shadow to appear coincident with the level of the horizon on the horizon vane.  This angle was the elevation of the sun.

==Framed quadrant==
Large frame quadrants were used for astronomical measurements, notably determining the [[Celestial coordinate system#Altitude|altitude]] of [[Astronomical object|celestial]] objects.  They could be permanent installations, such as [[mural instrument|mural quadrant]]s.  Smaller quadrants could be moved.  Like the similar [[sextant (astronomical)#Framed sextants|astronomical sextant]]s, they could be used in a vertical plane or made adjustable for any plane.

When set on a [[pedestal]] or other mount, they could be used to measure the angular distance between any two celestial objects.

The details on their construction and use are essentially the same as those of the [[sextant (astronomical)#Framed sextants|astronomical sextant]]s; refer to that article for details.

Navy:  Used to gauge elevation on ships cannon, the quadrant had to be placed on each gun's trunnion in order to judge range, after the loading.  The reading was taken at the top of the ship's roll, the gun adjusted,and checked, again at the top of the roll, and he went to the next gun, until all that were going to be fired were ready.  The ship's Gunner was informed, who in turn informed the captain...You may fire when ready...at the next high roll, the cannon would be fired.

In more modern applications, the quadrant is attached to the trunion ring or of a large naval gun to align it to benchmarks welded to the ship's deck.  This is done to ensure firing of the gun hasn't "warped the deck."  A flat surface on the mount gunhouse or turret is also checked against benchmarks, also, to ensure large bearings and/or bearing races haven't changed... to "calibrate" the gun.

==Customization==

During the Middle Ages, makers often added customization to impress the person for whom the quadrant was intended. In large, unused spaces on the instrument, a sigil or badge would often be added to denote the ownership by an important person or the allegiance of the owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Silke Ackermann |last-author-amp=yes |author2=John Cherry |title=Richard II, John Holland and Three Medieval Quadrants |journal=Annals of Science |volume=56 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=3-23 |doi=10.1080/000337999296508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Radio navigation''' or '''radionavigation''' is the application of [[radio]] frequencies to determine a position of an object on the [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=DuttonNN15&gt;{{cite book|last=Dutton|first=Benjamin|title=Dutton's Nautical Navigation|year=2004|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=155750248X|pages=154–163|edition=15|chapter=15 – Basic Radio Navigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kay-Fried-ANS&gt;{{cite book|last=Kayton|first=Myron|title=Avionics Navigation Systems|year=1997|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=99–177|author2=Walter R. Fried |chapter=4 – Terrestrial Radio-Navigation Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Like [[radiolocation]], it is a type of [[radiodetermination]].

The basic principles are measurements from/to [[electric beacon]]s, especially
* [[Direction (geometry)|directions]], e.g. by bearing, radio phases or interferometry,
* [[Distance measuring equipment|distances]], e.g. [[ranging]] by measurement of [[time of arrival|travel times]],
* partly also [[velocity]], e.g. by means of radio [[Doppler shift]].

==Bearing-measurement systems==
These systems used some form of directional radio antenna to determine the location of a broadcast station on the ground. Conventional navigation techniques are then used to take a [[radio fix]]. These were introduced prior to World War I, and remain in use today.

===Radio direction finding===
[[File:Earhart-electra 10.jpg|thumb|right|[[Amelia Earhart]]'s [[Lockheed Model 10 Electra|Lockheed Electra]] had a prominent RDF loop on the cockpit roof.]]
{{Main article|Radio direction finder}}

The first system of radio navigation was the ''Radio Direction Finder'', or RDF.&lt;ref name="KF116"&gt;Kayton, Fried 1977, p.116&lt;/ref&gt;  By tuning in a [[radio station]] and then using a [[directional antenna]], one could determine the direction to the broadcasting antenna. A second measurement using another station was then taken. Using [[triangulation]], the two directions can be plotted on a map where their [[Line-line intersection|intersection]] reveals the location of the navigator. Commercial [[AM radio]] stations can be used for this task due to their long range and high power, but strings of low-power [[Nondirectional beacon|radio beacon]]s were also set up specifically for this task, especially near [[airport]]s and harbours.

Early RDF systems normally used a [[loop antenna]], a small loop of metal wire that is mounted so it can be rotated around a vertical axis.&lt;ref name="KF116"/&gt; At most angles the loop has a fairly flat reception pattern, but when it is aligned perpendicular to the station the signal received on one side of the loop cancels the signal in the other, producing a sharp drop in reception known as the "null". By rotating the loop and looking for the angle of the null, the relative bearing of the station can be determined. Loop antennas can be seen on most pre-1950s aircraft and ships.

===Reverse RDF===
[[File:The 'Black Beacon', Orford Ness - geograph.org.uk - 935140.jpg|thumb|right|The Orfordness Beacon as it appears today.]]

The main problem with RDF is that it required a special antenna on the vehicle, which may not be easy to mount on smaller vehicles or single-crew aircraft. A smaller problem is that the accuracy of the system is based to a degree on the size of the antenna, but larger antennas would likewise make the installation more difficult.

During the era between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], a number of systems were introduced that placed the rotating antenna on the ground. As the antenna rotated through a fixed position, typically due north, the antenna was keyed with the [[morse code]] signal of the station's identification letters so the receiver could ensure they were listening to the right station. Then they waited for the signal to either peak or disappear as the antenna briefly pointed in their direction. By timing the delay between the morse signal and the peak/null, then dividing by the known rotational rate of the station, the bearing of the station could be calculated.

The first such system was the German [[Telefunken Kompass Sender]], which began operations in 1907 and was used operationally by the [[Zeppelin]] fleet until 1918.&lt;ref name=bauer2004&gt;{{cite web|last=Bauer|first=Arthur O.|title=Some historical and technical aspects of radio navigation, in Germany, over the period 1907 to 1945|url=http://www.cdvandt.org/Navigati.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2013|date=Dec 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An improved version was introduced by the UK as the [[Orfordness Beacon]] in 1929 and used until the mid-1930s. A number of improved versions followed, replacing the mechanical motion of the antennas with phasing techniques that produced the same output pattern with no moving parts. One of the longest lasting examples was [[Sonne (navigation)|Sonne]], which went into operation just before [[World War II]] and was used operationally under the name Consol until 1991. The modern VOR system is based on the same principles (see below).

=== ADF and NDB===
{{Main article|Non-directional beacon}}

A great advance in the RDF technique was introduced in the form of phase comparisons of a signal as measured on two or more small antennas, or a single highly directional [[solenoid]]. These receivers were dramatically smaller, more accurate, and simpler to operate. Combined with the introduction of the [[transistor]] and [[integrated circuit]], RDF systems were so reduced in size and complexity that they once again became quite common during the 1960s, and were known by the new name, [[automatic direction finder]], or ADF.

This also led to a revival in the operation of simple radio beacons for use with these RDF systems, now referred to as ''non-directional beacons'' (NDB). As the LF/MF signals used by NDBs can follow the curvature of earth, NDB has a much greater range than [[VHF Omnidirectional Range|VOR]] which travels only in ''line of sight''. NDB can be categorized as ''long range'' or ''short range'' depending on their power. The frequency band allotted to non-directional beacons is 190–1750&amp;nbsp;kHz, but the same system can be used with any common AM-band commercial station.

===VOR===
[[File:VOR DME BUB.JPG|right|thumb|VOR transmitter station]]
{{Main article|VHF omnidirectional range}}

[[VHF omnidirectional range]], or VOR, is an implementation of the reverse-RDF system, but one that is more accurate and able to be completely automated.

Instead of a single signal, the VOR transmitter sends out three signals – one is a simple voice channel that sends morse code to identify the station, another is a continuous signal sent in all directions, and the last is a signal that is rotated at 30 RPM. Like the Orfordness concept, the bearing of the station is measured by finding the rotating signal's peak or null. But instead of timing the signal, the rotating signal is changed in [[phase (waves)|phase]] in synchronicity with its rotation, such that it is in-phase when pointed north, 90 degrees off when it points east, and so forth. By comparing the phase of the received signal with the one being broadcast omnidirectionally, the angle can be determined using simple electronics. This angle is then displayed in the [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] of the [[aircraft]], and can be used to take a [[position fixing|fix]] just like the earlier RDF systems, although it is easier to use.&lt;ref name="KF123"&gt;Kayton, Fried 1977, p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

As VOR required two VHF receivers as well as a conventional radio for station identification, the system did not become popular until the era of miniaturized electronics, first with small tubes in the 1950s, and then transistorized systems in the 1960s. During this period it quickly took over from the older Radio Range system (see below). The signals from the stations could be received anywhere, as opposed to the beams which were only broadcast in certain directions, so in theory the VOR system could be used for free navigation from any to any point. In practice, the older Radio Range procedures were so widely used and standardized that VOR was used to produce a similar set of [[Airway (aviation)|airways]] that remain in use today.

The US military also introduced a VOR-like system known as [[TACAN]]. It differed from VOR primarily in its modulation system, adding a Lorentz-like signal to accurately define the center of the rotating beam and thereby improve accuracy. It requires five receiver channels and additional electronics, an expensive requirement when it was introduced.&lt;ref name="KF133"&gt;Kayton, Fried 1977, p.133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beam systems==
Beam systems broadcast narrow signals in the sky, and navigation is accomplished by keeping the aircraft centred in the beam. A number of stations are used to create an [[Airway (aviation)|airway]], with the navigator tuning in different stations along the direction of travel. These systems were common in the era when electronics were large and expensive, as they placed minimum requirements on the receivers – they were simply voice radio sets tuned to the selected frequencies. However, they did not provide navigation outside of the beams, and were thus less flexible in use. The rapid miniaturization of electronics during and after World War II made systems like VOR practical, and most beam systems rapidly disappeared.

===Lorenz===
{{Main article|Lorenz beam}}

In the post-World War I era, the Lorenz company of Germany developed a means of projecting two narrow radio signals with a slight overlap in the center. By broadcasting different audio signals in the two beams, the receiver could position themselves very accurately down the centreline by listening to the signal in their headphones. The system was accurate to less than a degree in some forms.

Originally known as "Ultrakurzwellen-Landefunkfeuer" (LFF), or simply "Leitstrahl" (guiding beam), little money was available to develop a network of stations. Deployment was instead led by the US, where it formed the basis of a wide-area navigation system through the 1930s and 40s (see LFF, below). Development was restarted in Germany in the 1930s as a short-range system deployed at airports as a [[blind landing]] aid. Although there was some interest in deploying a medium-range system like the US LFF, deployment had not yet started when the beam system was combined with the Orfordness timing concepts to produce the highly accurate [[Sonne (navigation)|Sonne]] system. In all of these roles, the system was generically known simply as a "Lorenz beam".

In the immediate pre-World War II era the same concept was also developed as a blind-bombing system. This used very large antennas to provide the required accuracy at long distances (over England), and very powerful transmitters. Two such beams were used, crossing over the target to triangulate it. Bombers would enter one of the beams and use it for guidance until they heard the second one in a second radio receiver, using that signal to time the dropping of their bombs. The system was highly accurate, and the '[[Battle of the Beams]]' broke out when [[United Kingdom]] [[intelligence service]]s attempted, and then succeeded, in rendering the system useless through [[electronic warfare]]. Sonne, however, proved just as useful to the UK as Germany, and was left to operate unhindered throughout the war.

===Low frequency radio range===
[[File:LFR-photo.jpg|thumb|right|LFR ground station]]
{{Main article|Low frequency radio range}}
The low-frequency radio range (LFR, also other names) was the main navigation system used by aircraft for [[Instrument flight rules|instrument flying]] in the 1930s and 1940s in the U.S. and other countries, until the advent of the VOR in the late 1940s. It was used for both en route navigation as well as [[instrument approach]]es.

The ground stations consisted of a set of four antennas that projected Lorenz beams in four cardinal directions. One of the beams was "keyed" with the morse code signal "A", dit-dah, with the second beam "N", dah-dit. Flying down the centreline produced a steady tone. The beams were pointed to the next station to produce a set of [[Airway (aviation)|airways]], allowing an aircraft to travel from airport to airport by following a selected set of stations. Effective course accuracy was about three degrees, which near the station provided sufficient safety margins for [[instrument approach]]es down to low minimums. At its peak deployment, there were nearly 400 LFR stations in the US.

=== Glide path and the localizer of ILS ===
The remaining widely used beam systems are '''glide path''' and the '''localizer''' of the ''[[instrument landing system]]'' (ILS). ILS uses a ''localizer'' to provide horizontal position, distance to the runway, and airport information, and ''glide path'' to provide vertical positioning. ILS can provide enough accuracy and redundancy to allow automated landings.&lt;br /&gt;
For more information see also: {{main article|Instrument landing system glide path|Instrument landing system localizer}}

==Transponder systems==
{{main article|Transponder}}
{{see also|Transponder landing system}}
Positions can be determined with any two measures of angle or distance. The introduction of [[radar]] in the 1930s provided a way to directly determine the distance to an object even at long distances. Navigation systems based on these concepts soon appeared, and remained in widespread use until recently. Today they are used primarily for aviation, although GPS has largely supplanted this role.

===Radar and transponders===

Early [[radar]] systems, like the UK's [[Chain Home]], consisted of large transmitters and separate receivers. The transmitter periodically sends out a short pulse of a powerful radio signal, which is sent into space through broadcast antennas. When the signal reflects off a target, some of that signal is reflected back in the direction of the station, where it is received. The received signal is a tiny fraction of the broadcast power, and has to be powerfully amplified in order to be used.

The same signals are also sent over local electrical wiring to the operator's station, which is equipped with an [[oscilloscope]]. Electronics attached to the oscilloscope provides a signal that increases in voltage over a short period of time, a few microseconds. When sent to the X input of the oscilloscope, this causes a horizontal line to be displayed on the scope. This "sweep" is triggered by a signal tapped off the broadcaster, so the sweep begins when the pulse is sent. Amplified signals from the receiver are then sent to the Y input, where any received reflection causes the beam to move upward on the display. This causes a series of "blips" to appear along the horizontal axis, indicating reflected signals. By measuring the distance from the start of the sweep to the blip, which corresponds to the time between broadcast and reception, the distance to the object can be determined.

Soon after the introduction of radar, the radio [[transponder]] appeared. Transponders are a combination of receiver and transmitter whose operation is automated – upon reception of a particular signal, normally a pulse on a particular frequency, the transponder sends out a pulse in response, typically delayed by some very short time. Transponders were initially used as the basis for early [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] systems; aircraft with the proper transponder would appear on the display as part of the normal radar operation, but then the signal from the transponder would cause a second blip to appear a short time later. Single blips were enemies, double blips friendly.

Transponder-based distance-distance navigation systems have a significant advantage in terms of positional accuracy. Any radio signal spreads out over distance, forming the fan-like beams of the Lorenz signal, for instance. As the distance between the broadcaster and receiver grows, the area covered by the fan increases, decreasing the accuracy of location within it. In comparison, transponder-based systems measure the timing between two signals, and the accuracy of that measure is largely a function of the equipment and nothing else. This allows these systems to remain accurate over very long range.

The latest transponder systems (mode S) can also provide position information, possibly derived from [[Satellite navigation|GNSS]], allowing for even more precise positioning of targets.

===Bombing systems===
The first distance-based navigation system was the German [[Y-Gerät (navigation)|Y-Gerät]] blind-bombing system. This used a [[Lorenz beam]] for horizontal positioning, and a transponder for ranging. A ground-based system periodically sent out pulses which the airborne transponder returned. By measuring the total round-trip time on a radar's oscilloscope, the aircraft's range could be accurately determined even at very long ranges. An operator then relayed this information to the bomber crew over voice channels, and indicated when to drop the bombs.

The British introduced similar systems, notably the [[Oboe (navigation)|Oboe]] system. This used two stations in England that operated on different frequencies and allowed the aircraft to be triangulated in space. To ease pilot workload only one of these was used for navigation – prior to the mission a circle was drawn over the target from one of the stations, and the aircraft was directed to fly along this circle on instructions from the ground operator. The second station was used, as in Y-Gerät, to time the bomb drop. Unlike Y-Gerät, Oboe was deliberately built to offer very high accuracy, as good as 35&amp;nbsp;m, much better than even the best optical [[bombsight]]s.

One problem with Oboe was that it allowed only one aircraft to be guided at a time. This was addressed in the later [[Gee-H (navigation)|Gee-H]] system by placing the transponder on the ground and broadcaster in the aircraft. The signals were then examined on existing [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] display units in the aircraft (see below). Gee-H did not offer the accuracy of Oboe, but could be used by as many as 90 aircraft at once. This basic concept has formed the basis of most distance measuring navigation systems to this day.

===Beacons===
{{main article|Electric beacon}}
The key to the transponder concept is that it can be used with existing radar systems. The [[List of World War II British naval radar#ASV II|ASV]] radar introduced by [[RAF Coastal Command]] was designed to track down submarines and ships by displaying the signal from two antennas side by side and allowing the operator to compare their relative strength. Adding a ground-based transponder immediately turned the same display into a system able to guide the aircraft towards a transponder, or "beacon" in this role, with high accuracy.

The British put this concept to use in their [[Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar|Rebecca/Eureka]] system, where battery-powered "Eureka" transponders were triggered by airborne "Rebecca" radios and then displayed on ASV Mk. II radar sets. Eureka's were provided to French resistance fighters, who used them to call in supply drops with high accuracy. The US quickly adopted the system for paratroop operations, dropping the Eureka with pathfinder forces or partisans, and then homing in on those signals to mark the drop zones.

The beacon system was widely used in the post-war era for blind bombing systems. Of particular note were systems used by the [[US Marines]] that allowed the signal to be delayed in such a way to offset the drop point. These systems allowed the troops at the front line to direct the aircraft to points in front of them, directing fire on the enemy. Beacons were widely used for temporary or mobile navigation as well, as the transponder systems were generally small and low-powered, able to be man portable or mounted on a [[Jeep]].

===DME===
{{main article|Distance measuring equipment}}
{{see also|Tactical air navigation system}}
In the post-war era, a general navigation system using transponder-based systems was deployed as the [[distance measuring equipment]] (DME) system.

DME was identical to Gee-H in concept, but used new electronics to automatically measure the time delay and display it as a number, rather than having the operator time the signals manually on an oscilloscope. This led to the possibility that DME interrogation pulses from different aircraft might be confused, but this was solved by having each aircraft send out a different series of pulses which the ground-based transponder repeated back.

DME is almost always used in conjunction with VOR, and is normally co-located at a VOR station. This combination allows a single VOR/DME station to provide both angle and distance, and thereby provide a single-station fix. DME is also used as the distance-measuring basis for the military [[TACAN]] system, and their DME signals can be used by civilian receivers.

==Hyperbolic systems==
{{main article|Hyperbolic navigation}}
Hyperbolic navigation systems are a modified form of transponder systems which eliminate the need for an airborne transponder. The name refers to the fact that they do not produce a single distance or angle, but instead indicate a location along any number of hyperbolic lines in space. Two such measurements produces a fix. As these systems are almost always used with a specific [[navigational chart]] with the hyperbolic lines plotted on it, they generally reveal the receiver's location directly, eliminating the need for manual triangulation. As these charts were digitized, they became the first true location-indication navigational systems, outputting the location of the receiver as latitude and longitude. Hyperbolic systems were introduced during World War II and remained the main long-range advanced navigation systems until GPS replaced them in the 1990s.

===Gee===
{{main article|Gee (navigation)}}
The first hyperbolic system to be developed was the British [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] system, developed during [[World War II]]. Gee used a series of transmitters sending out precisely timed signals, with the signals leaving the stations at fixed delays. An aircraft using Gee, [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s heavy [[bomber]]s, examined the time of arrival on an [[oscilloscope]] at the navigator's station. If the signal from two stations arrived at the same time, the aircraft must be an equal distance from both transmitters, allowing the navigator to determine a line of position on his chart of all the positions at that distance from both stations. More typically, the signal from one station would be received earlier than the other. The ''difference'' in timing between the two signals would reveal them to be along a curve of possible locations. By making similar measurements with other stations, additional lines of position can be produced, leading to a fix. Gee was accurate to about 165&amp;nbsp;yards (150&amp;nbsp;m) at short ranges, and up to a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) at longer ranges over Germany. Gee remained in use long after World War II, and equipped RAF aircraft as late as the 1960s (approx freq was by then 68&amp;nbsp;MHz).

===LORAN===
{{main article|LORAN}}
With Gee entering operation in 1942, similar US efforts were seen to be superfluous. They turned their development efforts towards a much longer-ranged system based on the same principles, using much lower frequencies that allowed coverage across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The result was [[LORAN]], for "LOng-range Aid to Navigation". The downside to the long-wavelength approach was that accuracy was greatly reduced compared to the high-frequency Gee. LORAN was widely used during convoy operations in the late war period.&lt;ref name=JBLoran-C&gt;{{cite web|title=The Loran-C System of Navigation|url=http://www.loran-history.info/Loran-C/Jansky%20_%20Bailey%201962.pdf|publisher=Jansky &amp; Bailey|accessdate=25 July 2013|pages=18–23|date=February 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decca===
{{main article|Decca Navigator System}}
Another British system from the same era was Decca Navigator. This differed from Gee primarily in that the signals were not pulses delayed in time, but continuous signals delayed in phase. By comparing the phase of the two signals, the time difference information as Gee was returned. However, this was far easier to display; the system could output the phase angle to a pointer on a dial removing any need for visual interpretation. As the circuitry for driving this display was quite small, Decca systems normally used three such displays, allowing quick and accurate reading of multiple fixes. Decca found its greatest use post-war on ships, and remained in use into the 1990s.

===LORAN-C===
{{main article|Loran-C}}
Almost immediately after the introduction of LORAN, in 1952 work started on a greatly improved version. LORAN-C (the original retroactively became LORAN-A) combined the techniques of pulse timing in Gee with the phase comparison of Decca.

The resulting system (operating in the [[low frequency]] (LF) radio spectrum from 90 to 110&amp;nbsp;kHz) that was both long-ranged (for 60&amp;nbsp;kW stations, up to 3400 miles) and accurate. To do this, LORAN-C sent a pulsed signal, but modulated the pulses with an AM signal within it. Gross positioning was determined using the same methods as Gee, locating the receiver within a wide area. Finer accuracy was then provided by measuring the phase difference of the signals, overlaying that second measure on the first. By 1962, high-power LORAN-C was in place in at least 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Jansky &amp; Baily 1962, pp.23–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

LORAN-C was fairly complex to use, requiring a room of equipment to pull out the different signals. However, with the introduction of [[integrated circuit]]s, this was quickly reduced further and further. By the late 1970s, LORAN-C units were the size of a stereo amplifier and were commonly found on almost all commercial ships as well as some larger aircraft. By the 1980s, this had been further reduced to the size of a conventional radio, and it became common even on pleasure boats and personal aircraft. It was the most popular navigation system in use through the 1980s and 90s, and its popularity led to many older systems being shut down, like Gee and Decca. However, like the beam systems before it, civilian use of LORAN-C was short-lived when GPS technology drove it from the market.

===Other hyperbolic systems===
Similar hyperbolic systems included the US global-wide [[VLF]]/[[Omega Navigation System]], and the similar [[Alpha (radio navigation)|Alpha]] deployed by the USSR. These systems determined pulse timing not by comparison of two signals, but by comparison of a single signal with a local [[atomic clock]]. The expensive-to-maintain Omega system was shut down in 1997 as the US military migrated to using [[GPS]]. Alpha is still in use.

==Satellite navigation==
[[File:Cessna T182T Cockpit - Garmin G1000.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cessna 182 with GPS-based "glass cockpit" avionics]]
{{Main article|Global Navigation Satellite System}}

Since the 1960s, navigation has increasingly moved to [[satellite navigation system]]s. These are essentially DME systems located in space. The fact that the satellites are in orbit and normally move with respect to the receiver means that the calculation of the position of the satellite needs to be taken into account as well, which can only be handled effectively with a computer.

The [[Global Positioning System]], better known simply as GPS, sends several signals that are used to decode the position and distance of the satellite. One signal encodes the satellite's "ephemeris" data, which is used to accurately calculate the satellite's location at any time. Space weather and other effects causes the orbit to change over time so the ephemeris has to be updated periodically. Other signals send out the time as measured by the satellite's onboard [[atomic clock]]. By measuring this signal from several satellites, the receiver can re-build an accurate clock signal of its own. Comparing the two produces the distance to the satellite, and several such measurements allows a form of triangulation to be carried out.

GPS has better accuracy that any previous land-based system, is available at almost all locations on the Earth, can be implemented in a few cents of modern electronics, and requires only a few dozen satellites to provide worldwide coverage. As a result of these advantages, GPS has led to almost all previous systems falling from use. LORAN, Omega, Decca, Consol and many other systems disappeared during the 1990s and 2000s. The only other systems still in use are aviation aids, which are also being turned off for long-range navigation while new [[differential GPS]] systems are being deployed to provide the local accuracy needed for blind landings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4473">'''Reduced Level''' in [[surveying]] refers to  equating  elevations of survey points  with reference to a common assumed datum.

==Datum used==
The most common and convenient datum which is internationally accepted is [[mean sea level]]. Countries take their nearby sea levels  as datum planes for calculations of Reduced levels . For example, [[Pakistan]] takes sea near [[Karachi]] as its datum while [[India]] takes sea near [[Mumbai]]  as its  datum for  calculation of Reduced levels of different places in their respective countries. The term Reduced Level is denoted shortly by ‘RL’. National survey departments of each country determines RL’s of significantly important locations or points. These points are called as ''permanent [[Benchmark (surveying)|benchmarks]]'' and this survey process is known as Great Trigonometrical Surveying (GTS). The permanent bench marks act  as reference points for determining RL’s of other locations in a particular country.&lt;ref name="Datum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.agriinfo.in/?page=topic&amp;superid=8&amp;topicid=54 | title=Datum of India and Pakistan | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Datum2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.shtml?stnid=490-021 | title=Datum Surface | accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RL of a survey point can be determined by two methods:-
# Height of Instrument method
# Rise and Fall method

==Significance==
# For drainage of [[water]] under [[gravity]] a suitable slope is required. Thus roads are built in the fashion that their RL’s on  sides  are comparatively smaller than the RL at the mid-span of the road. This ensures proper drainage of water from roads.
# To construct a buildings, roads, [[dams]] a horizontal  levelled surface is required. So, at construction sites, RLs of different points are obtained. The ground surface is then being levelled to the RL which is obtained by taking [[arithmetic mean]] of RLs of different points.&lt;ref name="RL"&gt;{{cite book | title=A text book of Surveying Vol. 1 | author=Dr. B.C Punmia and Ashok Kumar Jain. | chapter=Levelling | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rivinletto Light.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Rivinletto Light]] on Kaasanmatala rock at the mouth of [[Kiiminkijoki]] in [[Haukipudas]], [[Finland]] is a typical sector light beacon.]][[Image:Leitfeuer_001.svg|thumb|Example of a sector light. The ship is navigating in the safe sector (white light is commonly marked as yellow in nautical charts).]]

A '''sector light''' is a man-made [[pilotage]] and [[position fixing]] aid that consists of strictly de-limited horizontal angle light beams to guide water-borne traffic through a safe channel at night in reasonable visibility. Sector lights are most often used for safe passage through shallow or dangerous waters. This may be when leaving or entering harbour. Nautical charts (paper and electronic) give all the required information.

Sectors of colored glass (or plastic) are placed in the lanterns of these lights. The light will then show these colors when observed certain bearings. Bearings referring to a sector are given in degrees true as observed from sea. Though the colors of the light will change, the characteristics will not. The change of color is not abrupt. The transition is made through an arc of uncertainty of 2° or greater.

The colors that are used, are conform to the IALA Maritime Bouyage system that is designed by the [[International Association of Lighthouse Authorities]]:
* white - this sector is in the middle of the safe channel
* red - indicates the [[port (nautical)|port]] edge of the channel for vessels approaching the light source
* green - indicates the [[starboard]] edge of the channel for vessels approaching the light source.
A ship that is sailing in safe water and then sees the red (or green) color of the light has to make an alteration in course.

The world has different navigation stereotypes managed by IALA (International Association of Lighthouse Authorities). For example, the United States uses a signalling stereotype which is the opposite of Europe. In USA, the red light indicates the starboard side of the channel for harbour bound vessels, while the green light indicates the port side of the same channel. An expression to remind of this is "red right returning".
[[File:Diego Garcia PEL.jpg|thumb|Diego Garcia PEL Sector Light. 3.5 million candela which is visible for over 18.5km by day. Total beam width of 1.6° with white sector of 0.2°.]]

== Example of a sector light ==
An example of a sector light is the light of the [[Fisgard Lighthouse National Historic Site|Fisgard Lighthouse]] in [[British Columbia]]. The lighthouse as built to guide ships through the entrance of Esquimalt harbour. The white sector is an isophase light of 2s from 322° to 195°. If the ship sees this white light, it can pass safely. The rest shows a red light from 195 to 322°. If a vessel sees this light, it should alter its course.

Another example is the [[PEL sector light]] at [[Diego Garcia]]. The PEL sector light was constructed to guide US Navy vessels into the Diego Garcia port through a narrow entrance in the lagoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.msc.navy.mil/sealift/2003/March/diegogarcia.htm|title = US Navy Military Sealift Command|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PEL sector light produces 3.5 million candela and is visible for 10 nautical miles (18.5&amp;nbsp;km) by day. The beam with 3 colors is narrow at 1.6°.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://vega.co.nz/price-list/gallery/case-study-diego-garcia/|title = PEL-6 Diego Garcia|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was required because the PEL sector light was built over 7NM (13&amp;nbsp;km) from the atoll entrance and it had to illuminate a safe entrance which is only 228 meters wide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7767">'''Sight reduction''' is the process of deriving from a [[Sight (device)|sight]] the information needed for establishing a [[line of position]].

Sight is defined as the observation of the altitude, and sometimes also the azimuth, of a celestial body for a line of position; or the data obtained by such observation.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The American Practical Navigator]]'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays sight reduction uses the equation of the [[circle of equal altitude]] to calculate the altitude of the celestial body,

'''&lt;math&gt;\sin(Hc) = \sin(B) \sin(Dec) + \cos(B) \cos(Dec) \cos(LHA)&lt;/math&gt;'''

and the azimuth ''Zn'' is obtained from ''Z'' by:

'''&lt;math&gt;\cos(Z) = (\sin(Dec) - \sin(Hc) \sin(B)) / (\cos(Hc) \cos(B))&lt;/math&gt;'''

With the observed altitude ''Ho'', ''Hc'' and ''Zn'' are the parameters of the [[Marcq St Hilaire]] intercept for the line of position:

[[File:Corrections for Sextant Altitude.en.jpg|thumb|Correction to the sextant altitude]]
[[File:MarcqSaintHilaire.en.jpg|thumb|Marcq St Hilaire intercept for the line of position]]

With ''B'' the latitude (+N/S), ''L'' the longitude (+E/−W), ''LHA'' = ''GHA'' + ''L'' is the local hour angle, ''Dec'' and ''GHA'' are the declination and Greenwich hour angle of the star observed, and ''Hc'' the calculated altitude. ''Z'' is the calculated azimuth of the body.

Basic procedures involved computer sight reduction or longhand tabular methods.

== Tabular sight reduction ==
The methods included are:
* The Nautical Almanac Sight Reduction (NASR, originally known as Concise Tables for Sight Reduction or Davies, 1984, 22pg)
* Pub. 249 (formerly H.O. 249, Sight Reduction Tables for Air Navigation, A.P. 3270 in the UK, 1947&amp;ndash;53, 1+2 volumes)
* Pub. 229 (formerly H.O. 229, Sight Reduction Tables for Marine Navigation, H.D. 605/NP 401 in the UK, 1945ish, 6 volumes.  And the variant of HO-229: Sight Reduction Tables for Small Boat Navigation, known as Schlereth, 1983, 1 volume) 
* H.O. 214 (Tables of Computed Altitude and Azimuth, H.D. 486 in the UK, 1936&amp;ndash;46, 9 vol.)
* H.O. 211 (Dead Reckoning Altitude and Azimuth Table, known as Ageton, 1931, 36pg.  And 2 variants of H.O. 211: Compact Sight Reduction Table, also known as Ageton&amp;ndash;Bayless, 1980, 9+ pg.  S-Table, also known as Pepperday, 1992, 9+ pg.)
* H.O. 208 (Navigation Tables for Mariners and Aviators, known as Dreisonstok, 1928, 113pg.)

== Longhand haversine sight reduction ==
This method is a practical procedure to reduce celestial sights with the needed accuracy, without using electronic tools such as calculator or a computer. And it could serve as a backup in case of malfunction of the positioning system aboard.

=== Doniol ===
The first approach of a compact and concise method was published by R. Doniol in 1955&lt;ref&gt;. Table de point miniature (Hauteur et azimut), by R. Doniol, Navigation IFN Vol. III Nº 10, Avril 1955 [http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Table-De-Point-Miniature-R-Doniol-FrankReed-jul-2015-g32063 Paper]&lt;/ref&gt; The altitude is derived from sin(''Hc'') = ''n'' − ''a'' (''m'' + ''n''), in which ''n'' = cos(''B'' − ''Dec''), ''m'' = cos(''B'' + ''Dec''), ''a'' = hav(''LHA'').

The calculation is:
 ''n'' = cos(''B'' − ''Dec'')
 ''m'' = cos(''B'' + ''Dec'')
 ''a'' = hav(''LHA'')
 ''sin_Hc'' = ''n'' − ''a'' (''m'' + ''n'')
 ''Hc'' = arcsin(''sin_Hc'')

=== Ultra compact sight reduction ===
[[File:Haversine Sight Reduction.jpg|thumb|Haversine Sight Reduction algorithm]]

A practical and friendly method using only haversines was developed between 2014 and 2015,&lt;ref name="Rudzinski_2015"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ultra compact sight reduction |author-first1=Greg |author-last1=Rudzinski |others=Ix, Hanno |journal=Ocean Navigator |publisher=Navigator Publishing LLC | location=Portland, ME, USA |date=July&lt;!-- /August --&gt; 2015 |issue=227 | issn=0886-0149 |pages=42-43 |url=http://issuu.com/navigatorpublishing/docs/on227_download_edition |access-date=2015-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published in [http://fer3.com/arc/ NavList].

A compact expression for the altitude was derived&lt;ref&gt;Altitude haversine formula by Hanno Ix http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Longhand-Sight-Reduction-HannoIx-nov-2014-g29121&lt;/ref&gt; using [[haversine]]s, hav, for all the terms of the equation:

hav(''ZD'') = hav(''B'' − ''Dec'') + (1 − hav(''B'' − ''Dec'') − hav(''B'' + ''Dec'')) hav(''LHA'')

where ''ZD'' is the [[zenith distance]]

''Hc'' = (90 − ''ZD'') the calculated altitude

The algorithm if [[absolute value]]s are used is:
 if same name for latitude and declination
  ''n'' = hav(|''B''| − |''Dec''|)
  ''m'' = hav(|''B''| + |''Dec''|)
 if contrary name
  ''n'' = hav(|''B''| + |''Dec''|)
  ''m'' = hav(|''B''| − |''Dec''|)
 ''q'' = ''n'' + ''m''
 ''a'' = hav(''LHA'')
 hav(''ZD'') = ''n'' + (1 − ''q'') ''a''
 ''ZD'' = invhav -&gt; look at the haversine tables
 ''Hc'' = 90° − ''ZD''

For the azimuth a diagram&lt;ref&gt;Azimuth diagram by Hanno Ix. http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Gregs-article-havDoniol-Ocean-Navigator-HannoIx-jun-2015-g31689&lt;/ref&gt; was developed for a faster solution without calculation, and with an accuracy of 1°.
[[File:Azimuth diagram by Hanno Ix.jpg|thumb|Azimuth diagram by Hanno Ix]]
This diagram could be used also for star identification.&lt;ref&gt;Hc by Azimuth Diagram http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Hc-Azimuth-Diagram-finally-HannoIx-aug-2013-g24772&lt;/ref&gt;

An ambiguity in the value of azimuth may arise since in the diagram 0 ≤ ''Z'' ≤ 90°. ''Z'' is E/W as the name of the meridian angle, but the N/S name is not determined. In most situations azimuth ambiguities are resolved simply by observation.

When there are reasons for doubt or for the purpose of checking the following formula&lt;ref&gt;Azimuth haversine formula by Lars Bergman http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Longhand-Sight-Reduction-Bergman-nov-2014-g29441&lt;/ref&gt; should be used.
  
hav(''Z'') = [hav(90° − ''Dec'') − hav(''B'' − ''Hc'')] / (1 − hav(''B'' − ''Hc'') − hav(''B'' + ''Hc''))

The algorithm if [[absolute value]]s are used is:
 if same name
  ''a'' = hav(90° − |''Dec''|)
 if contrary name
  ''a'' = hav(90° + |''Dec''|)
 ''m'' = hav(''B'' + ''Hc'')
 ''n'' = hav(''B'' − ''Hc'')
 ''q'' = ''n'' + ''m''
 hav(''Z'') = (''a'' − ''n'') / (1 − ''q'')
 ''Z'' = invhav -&gt; look at the haversine tables
 if Latitude ''N'':
  if ''LHA'' &gt; 180°, ''Zn'' = ''Z''
  if ''LHA'' &lt; 180°, ''Zn'' = 360° − ''Z''
 if Latitude ''S'':
  if ''LHA'' &gt; 180°, ''Zn'' = 180° − ''Z''
  if ''LHA'' &lt; 180°, ''Zn'' = 180° + ''Z''

This computation of the altitude and the azimuth needs a haversine table. For a precision of 1 minute of arc, a four figure table is enough.&lt;ref&gt;http://fer3.com/arc/m2.aspx/Longhand-Sight-Reduction-HannoIx-nov-2014-g29172&lt;/ref&gt;

==== An example ====
 Data:
  ''B'' = 34° 10.0′ N (+)
  ''Dec'' = 21° 11.0′ S (−)
  ''LHA'' = 302° 43.0′
 Altitude ''Hc'':
  ''a'' = 0.2298
  ''m'' = 0.0128
  ''n'' = 0.2157
  hav(''ZD'') = 0.3930 -&gt; table -&gt;
  ''ZD'' = 77° 39′
  ''Hc''  = 12° 21′
 Azimuth ''Zn'':
  ''a'' = 0.6807
  ''m'' = 0.1560
  ''n'' = 0.0358
  hav(''Z'') = 0.7979
  ''Zn''  = 126.6°

[[Image:LakeBadwater crop.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Death Valley, Spring 2005: [[ephemeral]] [[Lake Badwater]] in the flooded [[Badwater Basin]]]]

{{technical|date=November 2017}}

A geographic '''sink''' is a depression within an [[endorheic basin]] where water collects with no visible outlet.  Instead of [[discharge (hydrology)|discharging]], the collected water is lost due to evaporation and/or [[Standard penetration test|penetration]] (water sinking underground, e.g., to become [[groundwater]] in an [[aquifer]]).  If the sink has [[Karst topography|karstic terrain]], water will sink at a higher rate than the surface evaporation, and conversely if the lakebed or sink bed has a layer of soil that is largely impervious to water ([[hardpan]]), evaporation will predominate.  Since dry lakes in sinks with hardpan have little penetration, they require more severe aridity/heat to eliminate collected water at a comparable rate as for a similar sink with appreciable penetration.

Depending on losses, precipitation, and [[Inflow (hydrology)|inflow]] (e.g., a spring, a tributary, or flooding); the [[Hydrology|temporal result]] of a lake in a sink may be a persistent [[lake]], an [[Lake#How lakes disappear|intermittent lake]], a [[Dry lake|playa]] lake (temporarily covered with water), or an [[ephemeral]] lake.

The '''Standard Geographical Classification''' ('''SGC''') is a system maintained by [[Statistics Canada]] for categorizing and enumerating the [[census geographic units of Canada]].   Each geographic area receives a unique numeric '''code''' ranging from 1 to 10 digits, which extend telescopically to refer to increasingly small areas.  This [[geocode]] is roughly analogous to the [[ONS coding system]] in use in the [[United Kingdom]].

==Regions==
The SGC code format for [[List of regions of Canada|regions]] is &lt;tt&gt;X&lt;/tt&gt;, where ''X'' is a unique identifier incrementing from east to west, then north.

&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Atlantic Canada]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;2&lt;/tt&gt;: Quebec&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;3&lt;/tt&gt;: Ontario&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;4&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;5&lt;/tt&gt;: British Columbia&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;6&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Northern Canada]]

==Provinces and Territories==
The SGC code format for [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] is &lt;tt&gt;XY&lt;/tt&gt;, where
''X'' is the above regional prefix, and ''Y'' is a further identifier incrementing from east to west.  Taken as a single digit, each value of ''Y'' is unique within the province group, or unique within the territory group.

&lt;tt&gt;10&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;11&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Prince Edward Island]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;12&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Nova Scotia]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;13&lt;/tt&gt;: [[New Brunswick]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;24&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Quebec]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Ontario]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;46&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Manitoba]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;47&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Saskatchewan]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;48&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Alberta]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;59&lt;/tt&gt;: [[British Columbia]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;60&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Yukon]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;61&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Northwest Territories]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;62&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Nunavut]]

==Census divisions==
The SGC code format for [[Census geographic units of Canada|census divisions]] is &lt;tt&gt;XX YY&lt;/tt&gt;, where ''XX'' is the above province/territory code, and ''YY'' is the census division's code, unique within its own province.  Census divisions are generally numbered from east to west.  In some locations, a similar policy to American [[FIPS county code]]s has been adopted, with even-numbered slots being left vacant for future expansion.

Examples:&lt;br/&gt;

==Census subdivisions==
The SGC code format for census subdivisions is &lt;tt&gt;XX YY ZZZ&lt;/tt&gt;, where ''XX'' is the province/territory code, ''YY'' is the census division code, and ''ZZZ'' is the census subdivision's code, unique within its own census division.  Census subdivisions are again generally numbered from east to west, and the practice has been to leave even-numbered slots vacant for future expansion.

Examples:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 12 001&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Tyendinaga, Ontario]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 12 002&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Deseronto, Ontario]]&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;35 12 003&lt;/tt&gt;: ''[vacant slot]''&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;35 12 005&lt;/tt&gt;: [[Belleville, Ontario]]&lt;br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2378">'''Synekism'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Greek language|Greek]]: σύνοικος "joint dweller", συνοικία "cohabitation".&lt;/ref&gt; is a concept in [[List of urban studies topics|urban studies]] coined by [[Edward Soja]]. It refers to the dynamic formation of the [[polis]] state — the union of several small urban settlements under the rule of a "capital" city (or so-called [[city-state]] or urban system). Soja's definition of synekism, mentioned in ''Writing the city spatially'', is "the stimulus of urban agglomeration."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soja|first=Edward|date=2003-01-01|title=Writing the city spatially|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/ccit/2003/00000007/00000003/art00003|journal=City: analysis of urban trends, culture, theory, policy, action|volume=7|issue=3|pages=269–281|doi=10.1080/1360481032000157478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social science==
From the [[social sciences]]' view, it is also a "nucleated and hierarchically nested process of political governance, economic development, social order, and cultural identity" Soja.&lt;ref&gt;''Postmetropolis: Critical Studies of Cities and Regions''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 2000, p.13-14.
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In densely settled urban places, a critical-mass provides potential for innovation that is not typically available in rural environments, therefore synekism can be thought of as the geographical relationships that create and give importance to cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3079">The '''Tellurometer''' was the first successful microwave [[electronic distance measurement]] equipment. The name derives from the Latin ''tellus'', meaning Earth.

[[File:Line of sight to Plynlimon - geograph.org.uk - 963435.jpg|thumb|Typical distance measurements were between mountain tops]]

==History==
The original Tellurometer, known as the Micro-Distancer MRA 1, was introduced in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/distance_tools/tellurometermra1.html Tellurometer MRA 1]&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by [[Trevor Wadley|Dr. Trevor Lloyd Wadley]] of the Telecommunications Research Laboratory of the [[South Africa]]n [[Council for Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR), also responsible for the [[Wadley Loop]] receiver, which allowed precision tuning over wide bands, a task that had previously required switching out multiple [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qsl.net/vk3jeg/b_wadley.html Wadley Loop HF receivers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The Tellurometer emits an electronic wave: the remote station reradiates the incoming wave in a similar wave of more complex [[modulation]], and the resulting phase shift was a measure of the distance travelled. The results appear on a [[cathode ray tube]] with circular sweep. This instrument penetrates haze and mist in daylight or darkness and has a normal range of 30–50&amp;nbsp;km but can extend up to 70&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.fig.net/pub/fig2008/papers/hs01/hs01_03_sturman_wright_2833.pdf History of the Tellurometer]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The Tellurometer design yields high accuracy distance measurements over [[geodesy|geodetic]] distances, but it is also useful for second order survey work, especially in areas where the terrain was rough and/or the temperatures extreme.

Examples of remote locations mapped using Tellurometer surveys are [[Adams Bluff]], [[Churchill Mountains]], [[Cook Mountains]], [[Jacobsen Glacier]], [[Mount Albright]], [[Mount Predoehl]], [[Mount Summerson]], [[Queen Elizabeth Range (Antarctica)|Sherwin Peak]] and [[Vogt Peak]].

The MRB2 or Hydrodist was a marine version&lt;ref name=history /&gt; that was used in coastal surveys and calibrating ships using other survey navigation systems.

They were used by the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ham (Editor)|first=Paul|title=Captain Bullen's War|year=2009|publisher=Harper Collins|location=Australia|isbn=978 0 7322 8843 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial exploitation==
[[Plessey]], the [[United Kingdom|British]] electronics company, formed a new subsidiary known as ''Tellurometer (Pty) Limited'' in the 1960s to manufacture the product and to develop and sell derivatives.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;  The Company subsequently introduced numerical displays, solid state transmitters, integrated circuits and eventually [[microprocessor]]s for the product.

'''''The Exploration of the Colorado River and Its Canyons''''' by [[John Wesley Powell]] is a classic&lt;ref&gt;According to [[Wallace Stegner]] "Nearly everyone who runs any part of the canyons now .. either carries this story of Powell's in his duffelbag or has it read or recited to him around the fire while the tamed Colorado slips past."

It is about the [[Powell Geographic Expedition of 1869]] which was the first trip down the Colorado River by boat, including the first trip through the [[Grand Canyon]]. 

Powell's first written accounts of his exploration appeared in the January, February and March 1875 editions of ''[[Scribner’s Monthly]]'' as "The Canons of the Colorado".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Canons of the Colorado |journal=[[Scribner's Monthly]] |author1=[[John Wesley Powell]] |date=1875 |volume=9 |number= |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924079633172;view=1up;seq=3 }} Pages 293, 394 and 523.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smithsonian]] published it in book form in 1875 under title ''Report of the Exploration of the Colorado River of the West and Its Tributaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2315">[[Major-General]] '''Sir Thomas Aiskew Larcom, 1st Baronet''' [[Privy Council of Ireland|PC]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (24 December 1801 – 15 June 1879) was a leading official in the early [[Ordnance Survey Ireland|Irish Ordnance Survey]] that started in 1824. He later became a poor law commissioner, census commissioner and finally executive head of the British administration in Ireland as [[Under Secretary for Ireland|under-secretary]] to the [[Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland]], a position the government of the day was eager for him to take.

The longest-serving under-secretary (1853–1868), and a man of unusual abilities, Larcom had a distinguished career in his adopted country and acted with an impartiality that won him respect from all parties. In 1868 he was admitted to the [[Irish Privy Council]] and created a Baronet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2925">A '''townsite''' is a legal [[subdivision (land)|subdivision of land]] for the development of a [[town]] or [[community]].  In the historical development of the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and other former [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[Colonialism|colonial]] [[nation]]s, the [[filing (legal)|filing]] of a townsite [[plat]] (United States) or [[plat|plan]] (Canada) was often the first legal act in the establishment of a new town or community.

== Townsites in British Columbia ==
Numerous townsites were filed in [[British Columbia]], Canada, in the early 19th century. Some of those filed in what is now [[Metro Vancouver]] included:
*[[Gastown|Granville]] Townsite, 1870&lt;ref&gt;Vancouver, A Visual History, Bruce MacDonald, 1992, page 18&lt;/ref&gt; (Gastown, [[Vancouver]])
*Hastings Townsite, 1869 (Vancouver)
*[[North Vancouver, British Columbia (city)#History|Moodyville]] Townsite, 1865 (City of North Vancouver)
*[[New Westminster]] Townsite, 1860 (original capital of Colony of British Columbia, now New Westminster)
*[[North Vancouver, British Columbia (city)|North Vancouver]] Townsite, 1907&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;North Vancouver Official Community Plan 2002, Chapter 2, Historical overview&lt;/ref&gt; (City of North Vancouver)
*[[Port Mann]] Townsite, 1911&lt;ref&gt;New townsite of Port Mann, Ottawa Citizen, Feb 2, 1911, page 2, Canadian Press dispatch&lt;/ref&gt; (Surrey)
*[[Steveston]] Townsite, 1889 ([[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]])

Although most of these townsites were incorporated into newly created cities and municipalities of Metro Vancouver, official survey plans still continue to designate [[Land lot|lots]] as being part of these townsites. For example, a 2008 strata plan in Vancouver's Gastown is indicated as being in the Granville Townsite.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/12560230/36-Water-Street-The-Terminus-Strata-Plan&lt;/ref&gt;

Townsite planning was either done by government authorities or by private developers. In the case of North Vancouver townsite in 1907 most of the land was owned by the North Vancouver Land and Improvement Company.
By owning large amount of land they were able to plan on a grand scale.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; New Westminster was surveyed by the Royal Engineers under government direction.

As existing towns grow, they develop [[Official Community Plan]]s (OCPs) that expand upon the already existing townsites. However, periodically new communities are still created. In 1975, the [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]] townsite was created and eventually incorporated as a municipality. The new municipality was given {{convert|53|acre|m2}} of [[Crown land]] to develop the townsite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whistlerhorizons.com/whistlerhistory.shtml Chronological milestones in the development of Whistler Village]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In warfare==

===Sieges===
Tunnel networks were sometimes developed during [[siege warfare]], even dating back to [[classical antiquity]]. Starting with a single tunnels being dug to undermine a wall that might be detected by the defenders and met with counter-tunnels, leading to [[tunnel warfare]]. Defenders might first create a series of underground listing posts to preempt such mining attacks.

===Trench systems===
[[File:Gros Ouvrage du Michelsberg - Hohlgang.jpg|thumb|Connecting tunnel under [[Ouvrage Michelsberg]], a fortress of the [[Maginot Line]]]]

Any time the use of [[Trench warfare|trenches]] becomes extensive, this naturally leads to connecting them with tunnel networks for safe passage both along the trench lines and with rear areas. In [[World War I#Trench warfare begins|World War I]], when given enough time and resources, the underground components of the defenses could become more extensive than those above ground.

The French [[Maginot Line]], constructed from 1929 to 1939, was a chain of fortresses, bunkers, retractable turrets, outposts, obstacles, and sunken artillery emplacements, all linked by an extensive shell-proof underground tunnel network. It included underground barracks, shelters, ammo dumps and depots, and even had its own underground [[narrow gauge]] railways.

===In Vietnam===
[[Image:VietnamCuChiTunnels.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Part of the tunnel complex at Củ Chi, this tunnel has been made wider and taller to accommodate tourists.]]
The [[Củ Chi tunnels|tunnels of Củ Chi]] are an immense network of connecting underground tunnels located in the [[Củ Chi District]] of [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (Saigon), [[Vietnam]], and are part of a much larger network of tunnels that underlie much of the country. The Củ Chi tunnels were the location of several military campaigns during the [[Vietnam War]], and were the [[Viet Cong]]'s base of operations for the [[Tết Offensive]] in 1968.&lt;br/&gt;
The tunnels were used by Viet Cong soldiers as [[secret passage|hiding spots]] during combat, as well as serving as communication and supply routes, hospitals, food and weapon caches and living quarters for numerous North Vietnamese fighters. The tunnel systems were of great importance to the Viet Cong in their resistance to American forces, and helped to counter the growing American military effort.

[[Image:The Structureplan of Vinh Moc Tunnels.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Structureplan of Vinh Moc Tunnels.]]
The [[Vịnh Mốc tunnels]] are a tunnel complex in [[Quảng Trị]], [[Vietnam]]. During the [[Vietnam War]] it was strategically located on the border of [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]]. The tunnels were built to shelter people from the intense bombing of Son Trung and Son Ha communes in Vinh Linh county of [[Quảng Trị Province]] in the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]].  The American forces believed the villagers of Vinh Moc were supplying food and armaments to the North Vietnamese garrison on the island of Con Co which was in turn hindering the American bombers on their way to bomb Hanoi. The idea was to force the villagers of Vinh Moc to leave the area but as is typical in Vietnam there was nowhere else to go. The villagers initially dug the tunnels to move their village 10 metres underground but the American forces designed bombs that burrowed down 10 metres. Eventually against these odds, the villagers moved the village to a depth of 30 metres. It was constructed in several stages beginning in 1966 and used until early 1972. The complex grew to include wells, kitchens, rooms for each family and spaces for healthcare. Around 60 families lived in the tunnels; as many as 17 children were born inside the tunnels.&lt;br/&gt;
The tunnels were a success and no villagers lost their lives. The only direct hit was from a bomb that failed to explode; the resulting hole was utilized as a ventilation shaft.&lt;br/&gt;
Three levels of tunnels were eventually built.

==In terrorism==
During the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], the Israeli military uncovered and destroyed 32 cross-border tunnels that went on for miles beneath [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] and reached into [[State of Israel|Israeli]] territory. According to intelligence officials, Israeli engineers are developing a system that could detect and destroy cross-border tunnels for which the Israeli government has reportedly spent more than $250 million since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel Is Building a Secret Tunnel-Destroying Weapon|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/10/israel-is-building-a-secret-tunnel-destroying-weapon-hamas-us-gaza/|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=21 Hamas members killed in tunnel collapses this year|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/222621|website=israelnationalnews.com|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gaza Tunnel Collapsed; 2 Hamas Militants Killed|url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2016/12/09/074826727/Gaza-Tunnel-Collapsed-2-Hamas-Militants-Killed|website=Tempo.co|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A network of caves beneath the cities of [[Mosul]] and [[Badana]] were built by [[ISIS]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9645">The '''United States Geography Olympiad''', often abbreviated as '''USGO''', is a nationwide academic geography competition for primary and secondary school students in the United States. It was introduced during the 2012-2013 school year. It currently consist of approximately 105 National Qualifying Exam sites held around the United States and its territories, along with a certain number of international schools, and a National Championships held in Arlington, VA at the end of April. The National Qualifying Exam sites are held in conjunction with the high school-level regional and state tournaments of [[National History Bee and Bowl|The National History Bee and The National History Bowl]].

The United States Geography Olympiad is also the official qualifying competition for American students looking to qualify for the [[International Geography Olympiad]], an international geography competition, which is held every summer in a different country. The international competition consists of three parts: a written test, a multimedia test and some fieldwork-related activity. James Mullen of Cupertino, CA, won the 2014 International Geography Olympiad while the USA finished 10th out of 36 countries overall.

The United States Geography Olympiad currently includes two categories: a Junior Varsity category and a Varsity category.  For each academic school year, students who are younger than 16 years of age, as of July 1 of the summer following the school year, can participate in the Junior Varsity category - there is no younger age limit. Students who are 16 or older (up to 19), as July 1 of the summer following the school year, must participate in the Varsity category. Only students in the Varsity category are eligible to qualify for the US National Team which will participate during that summer in the International Geography Olympiad.

The US Geography Olympiad is not associated with [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] or the National Geographic Bee.

== History of the competition ==
The US Geography Olympiad was founded in the summer of 2012 under the name "United States Geography Challenge" by [[David Madden (Jeopardy! contestant)|David Madden]] and Enrico Contolini. David Madden is a former 19-day champion on Jeopardy!, who also serves as Executive Director for both The National History Bee and [[National History Bowl and Bee|The National History Bowl]]. Enrico Contolini is an engineer and self-taught geography enthusiast and researcher who coached his daughter Isabella to be the top female student nationally in the National Geographic Bee in both 2010 and 2011. The name of the competition was changed to the United States Geography Olympiad in October 2013.

Along with acting as the qualifying competition for American students looking to attend the International Geography Olympiad, the US Geography Olympiad was founded to test the geography skills of American students and to help promote geography education. The competition aims to reward students who have devoted themselves to studying the world, and its countries and peoples, as a thorough knowledge of geography is essential to being an educated citizen today. The US Geography Olympiad aims at being more than a competition, and for this reason it also runs a USGeoChallenge Facebook page where geography-related articles and news, quizzes, links to relevant websites and blogs are posted on a regular bases to foster educational discussions and opportunities for those interested in geography as a subject.

The Elementary and Middle School divisions were introduced in 2015. The Middle School division was divided into 7th and 8th grade divisions in 2016.

== Format of the competition ==
The Regional and/or State Qualifying event is currently organized as a 50 multiple-choice question written test to be completed in 20 minutes. Students may take the Qualifying Exam up to three times, as three different versions of the Exam are offered at different regional tournaments. To qualify for Nationals, students must finish in either the top half of the students in their division (Varsity or JV) at their site, or in the top 50% of students taking that particular version of the Qualifying Exam nationally. 

The National competition currently consists of three different events: A written exam, a map skills exam, and an 80 question multiple choice exam. Participants are given one hour to finish the first set of 40 multiple choice questions and the map skills exam. After a break, participants are given another hour to finish the second set of 40 multiple choice questions and the written exam. The written exam is based on the written exam at the International Geography Olympiad (iGeo), and the multiple choice exam is based on the multimedia exam at iGeo. 

After the competition, participants are given a rank score in each event, based on how their scores placed within that event. Any ties are shown by a .5 ranking; thus, a student that is tied for 1st place would have a rank score of 1.5. To determine participants' final rank, rank values in the three events are added together and ranked from greatest to least. The most favorable rank score would be 3.0, signifying that the participant ranked 1st in all three events. Rankings for Junior Varsity and Varsity divisions are separate, because the top 4 students in Varsity earn a seat in the US Team going to iGeo.

==Past locations==

The JV and Varsity Championships have always been held at the Crystal Gateway Marriott in the [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia|Crystal City]] neighborhood of [[Arlington, Virginia]].

In 2015, the Elementary and Middle School Championships were held at the Marriott Downtown Louisville in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]]. In 2016, the Elementary, 7th Grade, and 8th Grade Championships were held at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare in [[Rosemont, Illinois]]. The Hyatt Regency O'Hare also hosted the Elementary and Middle School Championships for 2017 on Memorial Day weekend. In 2018, the Middle School and Elementary National Championships were held at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis.

'''Visual geography''' is the study of [[geography]] as represented in paintings, photos and other forms of the [[visual arts]]. Both [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]] in the visual arts are studied. Typical studies in Visual Geography include the [[geographical]] symbols within visual arts. Another is cross referencing the date a piece of visual art was produced with known weather records to see if the art was drawn accurately in the field or from memory in a studio.

The '''Wild (Heerbrugg)''' company was founded in 1921 in [[Switzerland]]. The company manufactured optical instruments, such as [[surveying]] instruments, [[microscope]]s and instruments for [[photogrammetry]] among others. The company changed its name several times, first being known as "Heinrich Wild, Werkstätte für Feinmechanik und Optik", then "Verkaufs-Aktiengesellschaft Heinrich Wild's Geodätische Instrumente", later "Wild Heerbrugg AG", later "Wild-Leitz". The company was linked with Leica in 1989, then it became part of Leica Holding B.V. Its subsidiary [[Leica Geosystems]] AG became part of the Swedish [[Hexagon AB]] Group of companies in 2005.

==History==
On 26 April 1921 the company '''Heinrich Wild, Werkstätte für Feinmechanik und Optik''' was founded in Heerbrugg by three Swiss personalities: 
* the surveyor and inventor Heinrich Wild from Glarus
* the investor Jacob Schmidheiny from Balgach
* and the geologist Dr. Robert Helbling from Flums.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Braunecker: "Werdegang der industriellen Optikentwicklung in Heerbrugg." Swiss Physical Society, September 2011 [http://www.sps.ch/artikel/physik-anekdoten/werdegang-der-industriellen-optikentwicklung-in-heerbrugg-vom-strahlen-berechnenden-damenkollektiv-zur-auswertung-kollektiver-strahldaten-12/ (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinrich Wild]] (1877–1951), a leading designer of geodetic and astronomical instruments, was born in [[Switzerland]] and began his career as an apprentice [[surveying|surveyor]]. In 1908, having invented a military rangefinder and convinced [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] to manufacture it, Wild moved to Jena and became head of GEO, the new Zeiss branch responsible for surveying instruments. Wild returned to Switzerland after the First World War. In 1921, with the help of Swiss financiers, he established a Werkstätte für Feinmechanik und Optik in Heerbrugg, in the Rhine Valley. As the first major product, Wild developed the [[Theodolite]] Wild T2. Later models were launched when Wild already had left the company, still bearing his name, such as the theodolite WILD Heerbrugg T4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surveyequipment.com/wild-heerbrugg-t4-universal-theodolite-used/ "WILD Heerbrugg T4 Universal Theodolite", product description by opti-cal]&lt;/ref&gt; Another important new product engineered by Wild was an [[Aerial photography|aerial camera]], later called "Aviophot" for [[cartography]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Hildebrand and R. Schlienger: "Scharfer Blick von oben." [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]], April 24, 1984, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, having recognized that he was not cut out to be a factory manager, Wild moved to Zurich, severed his connections with the firm in Heerbrugg, and designed instruments for Kern &amp; Co in [[Aarau]]. His old firm became Wild Heerbrugg in 1937. It merged with the optical firm of [[Ernst Leitz GmbH]] of Wetzlar in 1987. It also acquired a majority interest in Kern in 1988, was renamed Wild-Leitz AG in 1989. The combined company had about 8000 employees and revenues of approx. one billion Swiss Francs (CHF).&lt;ref&gt;"Wild Heerbrugg und Leitz Wetzlar mit gemeinsamem Namen." New name Wild-Leitz AG from 1989. Neue Zürcher Zeitung, December 28, 1988, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Then, it became part of the Leica holding company in 1990.

Starting from 1996 the company was divided gradually again into smaller units. 
Thus 1996 the [[Leica Camera]] AG developed, in October 1997 the [[Leica Geosystems]] AG and on 1 April 1998 the [[Leica Microsystems]] AG. Leica Geosystems produced—in continuation of Wild Heerbrugg—the geodetic instruments and is the global market leader in this sector as part of the new parent company Hexagon AB.

The brand name "Wild Heerbrugg" is still in use for stereo microscopes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag/artnov14/rjk-StereomicroscopeWildHeerbrugg.pdf R. Jordan Kreindler: "WILD Stereomicroscopes." Micscape Magazin (UK), November 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and precision level measuring such as the WILD Heerbrugg N3 Level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aps.anl.gov/Xray_Science_Division/Detectors/Detector_Pool/Equipment_Information/Wild_N3/ "WILD Heerbrugg N3 Level." Argonne National Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;
