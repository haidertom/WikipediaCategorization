''' Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics''' ('''ALSO''') is a program that was developed by the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP). This course helps [[physicians]], certified [[nurse midwife|nurse midwives]] (CNM), [[OBGYN]] [[registered nurses]], and other health care providers involved in potential emergencies in perinatal care of mothers.  This course is important and even required in some hospitals for family practice physicians as well as a learning tool in most family practice residencies.&lt;ref name=ALSO&gt;[http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home/cme/aafpcourses/clinicalcourses/also/aboutalso.html About ALSO - Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics - American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ALSO was developed at [[University of Wisconsin]] Department of [[Family Medicine]] by Dr. Damos and John W.

ALSO aims to decrease [[Disease#Morbidity|morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] for both the mother and baby.  ALSO does this by incorporating both [[didactic]] and practical hands on workstations with lifelike mannequins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.also.net.au/whatis.html What is ALSO?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719070100/http://www.also.net.au/whatis.html |date=July 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Topics include assisted vaginal delivery, [[Doppler fetal monitor]]ing, fetal [[dystocia]]s, [[neonatal]] [[resuscitation]], management [[premature labor]], management of [[postpartum hemorrhage]], along with [[forceps]] and [[vacuum]]-assisted delivery. Participants must pass a written test as well as a practical hands-on case management of a birth (mega-delivery) incorporating many elements learned throughout the course.

ALSO helps serve the same function as [[advanced trauma life support]] (ATLS) and [[advanced cardiac life support]] (ACLS) to help keep physicians who work with rural or underserved populations up to date on [[evidence-based medicine]] and curriculum.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;

'''Blood sugar regulation''' is the process by which the levels of [[blood sugar]], primarily [[glucose]], are maintained by the body within a narrow range. This tight regulation is referred to as '''glucose homeostasis'''. [[Insulin]], which lowers blood sugar,  and [[glucagon]], which raises it,  are the most well known of the hormones involved, but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process.&lt;ref name=Aronoff&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronoff SL, Berkowitz K, Shreiner B, Want L | title = Glucose metabolism and regulation: Beyond insulin and glucagon | journal = Diabetes Spectrum | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–90 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | doi = 10.2337/diaspect.17.3.183 | url = http://spectrum.diabetesjournals.org/content/17/3/183.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
[[File:Negative Feedback Gif.gif|thumb|The flat line is the optimal blood sugar level (i.e. the homeostatic set point). Blood sugar levels are balanced by the tug-of-war between 2 functionally opposite hormones, glucagon and insulin.]]
Blood sugar levels are regulated by [[negative feedback]] in order to keep the body in [[homeostasis|balance]]. The levels of [[glucose]] in the blood are monitored by many tissues, but the cells in the [[pancreatic islets]] are among the most well understood and important.

===Glucagon===
If the blood glucose level falls to dangerous levels (as during very heavy exercise or lack of food for extended periods), the [[alpha cells]] of the pancreas release [[glucagon]], a [[hormone]] whose effects on liver cells act to increase blood glucose levels. They convert [[glycogen]] into glucose (this process is called [[glycogenolysis]]).  The glucose is released into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar. [[Hypoglycemia]], the state of having low blood sugar, is treated by restoring the blood glucose level to normal by the ingestion or administration of [[dextrose]] or [[carbohydrate]] foods. It is often self-diagnosed and self-medicated orally by the ingestion of balanced meals. In more severe circumstances, it is treated by injection or infusion of glucagon.

===Insulin===

When levels of blood sugar rise, whether as a result of [[glycogen]] conversion, or from digestion of a meal, a different hormone is released from [[beta cells]] found in the [[Islets of Langerhans]] in the pancreas. This hormone, [[insulin]], causes the liver to convert more glucose into glycogen (this process is called [[glycogenesis]]), and to force about 2/3 of body cells (primarily [[muscle]] and fat tissue cells) to take up glucose from the blood through the [[GLUT4]] transporter, thus decreasing blood sugar. When insulin binds to the receptors on the cell surface, vesicles containing the GLUT4 transporters come to the plasma membrane and fuse together by the process of endocytosis, thus enabling a facilitated diffusion of glucose into the cell. As soon as the glucose enters the cell, it is phosphorylated into Glucose-6-Phosphate in order to preserve the concentration gradient so glucose will continue to enter the cell.&lt;ref&gt;Ebey Soman, [[Scienceray]], [http://scienceray.com/biology/human-biology/regulation-of-glucose-by-insulin Regulation of Glucose by Insulin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022545/http://scienceray.com/biology/human-biology/regulation-of-glucose-by-insulin |date=July 16, 2011 }}, May 4, 2009. Retrieved November 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Insulin also provides signals to several other body systems, and is the chief regulator of metabolic control in humans.

There are also several other causes for an increase in blood sugar levels. Among them are the 'stress' hormones such as [[epinephrine]] (also known as adrenaline), several of the steroids, infections, trauma, and of course, the ingestion of food.

[[Diabetes mellitus]] type 1 is caused by insufficient or non-existent production of insulin, while type 2 is primarily due to a decreased response to insulin in the tissues of the body ([[insulin resistance]]). Both types of diabetes, if untreated, result in too much glucose remaining in the blood ([[hyperglycemia]]) and many of the same complications.  Also, too much insulin and/or exercise without enough corresponding food intake in diabetics can result in low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]).

Two particular programs have been implemented throughout America: the [[Medical home|Medical Home]] concept for primary care that has been promoted by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.aap.org/member/spotlight-sia.htm |title=AAP MEMBER SPOTLIGHT |publisher=Aap.org |accessdate=23 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810031640/http://www2.aap.org/member/spotlight-sia.htm |archivedate=10 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Palfrey"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZuVbzss5WoC&amp;pg=PA40 |title=Child Health in America|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the federal [[Emergency Medical Services for Children]] program administered by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]’ [[Health Resources and Services Administration]], [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309048885|title=Emergency Medical Services for Children|publisher=Nap.edu|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Medical Home model for pediatric care and early childhood development began to take root in several Asian countries in 2003.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp3/pdf/AUSPIII_FinalReport.pdf |format=PDF|title=Asia-US Partnership 2006: Early Child Development in Primary Care |date=2006|publisher=Department of Pediatrics, John A.

Sia is also creator of Hawaii Healthy Start Home Visiting Program to prevent child abuse and neglect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/114/3/e317.abstract|title=Hawaii's Healthy Start Home Visiting Program: Determinants and Impact of Rapid Repeat Birth|author=Samer S. El-Kamary|publisher=Pediatrics.apapublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder of Hawaii's Zero to Three program and Healthy and Ready to Learn Center. The Hawaii Healthy Start program, which targets expecting and new parents who may be at risk of abusing or neglecting their children, became the model for the Healthy Families America home visiting program that the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Justice Programs]] identified in 2010 as a "promising" approach to child abuse prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crimesolutions.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?ID=200 |title=Program: Healthy Families America |publisher=CrimeSolutions.gov |date=2011-09-23 |accessdate=2015-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Healthy and Ready to Learn Center was a three-year pilot project to initiate training and health delivery services in an integrated system of care, with pediatric residents and graduate students in social work and early childhood education working as a team.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clas.uiuc.edu/fulltext/cl00910/cl00910.html|title=CLAS: Building Bridges: Lessons Learned in Interprofessional Collaboration|publisher=Clas.uiuc/edu|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Sia spearheaded the creation of the Variety School for learning disabled children, a Honolulu-based educational institution for children ages 5 through 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://varietyschool.org/about.html|title=Variety School of Hawaii|publisher=Varietyschool.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sia retired from his Honolulu-based medical practice in 1996, after almost 40 years of treating patients,&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/96/10/30/news/story2.html|title=The godfather and the grandfather|last=Altonn|first=Helen|date=October 30, 1996|website=|publisher=Archives.starbulletin.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but continues to promote Medical Home and community pediatrics as professor of Pediatrics at the [[University of Hawaii]] [[John A.

==Education==
Sia is a 1945 graduate of [[Punahou School]] in [[Honolulu]] and a graduate of [[Dartmouth College]] in 1950. He received his medical degree at [[Western Reserve University School of Medicine]] in 1955 and did a general rotating internship as a lieutenant in the [[U.S. Army Medical Corps]] at [[William Beaumont Army Hospital]] in El Paso, Texas from 1955-1956. Sia then served his pediatric residency under Dr. Irvine McQuarrie at Kauikeolani Children's Hospital in Honolulu,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/90/3/419|title=Abraham Jacobi Award Address, April 14, 1992 The Medical Home: Pediatric Practice and Child Advocacy in the 1990s|publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and obtained his license to practice medicine in Hawaii in 1958. He was certified by the American Board of Pediatrics in 1960 and recertified in 1987. The [[University of Hawaii]] awarded Sia an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hawaii.edu/offices/bor/honorary.php|title=Honorary degrees conferred by the University of Hawaii|publisher=Hawaii.edu|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public service==

===Early years===
As a young practicing pediatrician, Sia joined the early cadre of American Academy of Pediatrics consultants for Head Start and Parent Child Centers in Hawaii in the 1960s and developed a strong interest in prenatal, neonatal, and postnatal causes of physical and mental disabilities in children. In a paper he presented in 1964 to the Hawaii Academy of Sciences on advances in neonatology, Sia cited progress in the care of premature babies but also noted that "completeness" of the first physical exam and the education of nurses to be on the alert for early signs of disabilities were possible ways to save newborns with previously lethal birth defects. He concluded by observing, "One of the basic problems will be in solving the causes and prevention of prematurity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sia|first=Calvin C.J.|date=1964|title=Advances in neonatology|url=https://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10524/2159/PHAS1964.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Hawaiian Academy of Science|volume=|pages=16-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by one of his mentors, Dr. Robert E. Cooke, the Johns Hopkins pediatrician behind the creation of the Hopkins hospital's Kennedy Institute for Handicapped Children, Sia helped establish Hawaii's Variety School for Learning Disabilities in 1967 and served as chairman of its board of directors for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiiaap.org/pdfs/AAP%20Member%20Spotlight%20Article%20-%20Sia_HS%203%202010_1_.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calvin C.J. Sia, MD, FAAP - Resume |publisher=Hawaiiaap.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sia broadened the scope of his community work to address all children with special health care needs. In the early 1970s, he invited Dr. [[C. Henry Kempe]], founder of the Denver-based National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect, and Dr. Ray E. Helfer of Michigan—two pioneers in the identification and treatment of child abuse—to help him and a small group of child advocates develop a plan to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect in the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/hawaiihs.txt |format=TXT |title=Helping to Prevent Child Abuse -- and Future Criminal Consequences: Hawai'i Healthy Start |publisher=Ncjrs.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That effort netted one of the first 12 demonstration grant awards by the newly created National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in 1975, with $1 million going to establish the first Hawaii Family Stress Center. The center, later renamed the Hawaii Family Support Center, established several child abuse and neglect programs on Oahu, including a home-visiting program based on Kempe's effective use of "lay therapists." These were home visitors from the community, properly trained and supervised by public health nurses and social workers who could earn the trust of at-risk families and focus on family strengths to reduce environmental risk and prevent child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite web|url=http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=49&amp;articleid=246&amp;sectionid=1609|title= - The Future of Children -|author=Princeton University|publisher=Futureofchildren.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"&gt;The Future of Children (Princeton University-Brookings Institution), Home Visiting: Recent Program Evaluations, "Evaluation of Hawaii's Healthy Start Program," by Anne K. Duggan, Sc.D, et al., Vol. 9 No. 1, Spring-Summer 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The center's goal was to identify vulnerable families before their day-to-day stresses, isolation, and lack of parenting knowledge and good role models gave rise to abusive and neglectful behavior.

The center's operations coincided with an effort launched by Dr. Vince L. Hutchins and Dr. Merle McPherson of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau in 1977 to revise and update the
mission of the federal agency's Title V and companion "crippled children's" programs to address child development and the prevention of developmental, behavioral and psychosocial problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fv-ncfpp.org/index.php/download_file/view/465/95/ |format=PDF |title=Celebrate 2010 |publisher=Fv-ncfpp.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; McPherson took note of Sia's call for a continuous system of care originating with the primary care pediatrician.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.long|title=History of the Medical Home Concept|work=aappublications.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAP collaborated in this effort by asking each state’s AAP chapter to develop a Child Health Plan that set priorities for using MCHB block grants. Sia spearheaded the Hawaii planning effort, bringing together representatives from the Hawaii AAP Chapter, the UH medical school, the Hawaii Medical Association, and [[Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children]]. Armed with anecdotal evidence showing home visitors were able to promote
effective parenting and ultimately improve outcomes, the group wrote a plan that incorporated a coordinated system of care that emphasized wellness and prevention for
children, especially those with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journals.lww.com/iycjournal/Abstract/2003/10000/Building_Medical_Homes_for_Children_With_Special.6.aspx|title=Building Medical Homes for Children With Special Health Care... : Infants &amp; Young Children|work=LWW|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the birth of the Medical Home concept for primary care,&lt;ref&gt;[http://facm.unjbg.edu.pe/revistaspediatria/Clinical%20Pediatrics/2009/August/16%20The%20Medical%20Home-Improving%20Quality%20of%20Primary%20Care%20for%20Children.pdf] {{dead link|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Sia attached the slogan, “Every Child Deserves a Medical Home.” Under this idea, which the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] adopted as a policy statement in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/110/1/184|title=The Medical Home|work=aappublications.org|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the medical care of all infants, children and adolescents should be accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amchp.org/AboutAMCHP/Newsletters/Pulse/Archive/2010/April2010/Pages/article.aspx|title=From the Presidents|publisher=Amchp.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be delivered or directed by well-trained physicians who provide primary care and help to manage and facilitate essentially all aspects of pediatric care. The physician should be known to the child and family and should be able to develop a partnership of mutual responsibility and trust with them. As Sia and his co-authors of a 2006 monograph on the Medical Home noted, this new model broadens the traditional focus on acute care to include prevention and well care at one end of the continuum and chronic care management of children with special health care needs at the other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aap.org/commpeds/CPTI/MedicalHome2006.pdf]{{dead link|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccic.acf.hhs.gov/node/33969|title=The Medical Home and Early Child Development in Primary Care|last=|first=|date=2006|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027080143/http://nccic.acf.hhs.gov/node/33969|archivedate=October 27, 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One expert observed, for example, that for a child born with [[spina bifida]], Sia's Medical Home model would have the family and its health care provider compose a list of specialists and therapists who would be caring for the child and a timeline of anticipated surgeries and interventions. The aim would be to have as few emergencies and unanticipated events as possible.&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt;

As the lead author of an often-cited article published by the journal [[Pediatrics (journal)|Pediatrics]] in May 2004, Sia traced the development of the Medical Home concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.long|title=History of the Medical Home Concept|author=Calvin Sia|publisher=Pedriatrics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilot programs===
By 1984, Sia had begun to implement the Medical Home concept in Hawaii. As chairman of an ad hoc state legislative task force on child abuse, he persuaded Hawaii lawmakers to authorize the Hawaii Healthy Start Home Visiting Program for the prevention of child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; This state-funded pilot program, carried out by Hawaii Family Support Center in collaboration with the Hawaii Department of Health, focused on a neighborhood in the Ewa community on Oahu, a community with relatively high rates of child abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"/&gt; A year later, he spearheaded the Hawaii Medical Association's effort to obtain a grant from the U.S. [[Maternal and Child Health Bureau]], under the Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://perfdata.hrsa.gov/mchb/mchreports/LEARN_More/Block_Grant_Program/block_grant_program.asp|title=Block Grant Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115044032/https://perfdata.hrsa.gov/mchb/mchreports//LEARN_More/Block_Grant_Program/block_grant_program.asp|archivedate=January 15, 2009|deadurl=yes|accessdate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to train primary care physicians to provide a "Medical Home" for all children with special health care needs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/Supplement_4/1473.full.pdf |format=PDF |title=History of the Medical Home Concept |publisher=Pediatrics.aappublications.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration project—which sought to help first-time families give their newborn children the best start in life—was so successful it was expanded from a small part of [[Oahu]] to other areas of Hawaii, and as word of the demonstrated positive outcomes spread, Hawaii’s Healthy Start became a model for parenting education programs nationwide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; In the early 1990s, Healthy Families America and the National Healthy Start Association began to standardize and credential programs to ensure effectiveness and research-based practices. Across the United States, according to the MCHB, the home visiting program has shown that it can reduce child maltreatment and increase children’s readiness for school.

Meanwhile, Sia launched the Hawaii Early Intervention Program for infants and toddlers in 1986 and also became actively involved with Hawaii’s Early Intervention Coordinating Council for Zero to Three, placing this under Hawaii’s Department of Health instead of the Department of Education.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;  The focus of this effort was to support the Medical Home system of care with prevention and early intervention programs.

===Implementation===
At a June 1987 conference called by [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]] [[C. Everett Koop]] and sponsored by the AAP and MCHB to address children with special needs, Sia and his delegation from Hawaii made a presentation of the Medical Home concept. Koop appeared to embrace it by issuing a report that endorsed a system of family-centered, community-based, coordinated care for children with special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/83/6/1055|title=Family-Centered, Community-Based, Coordinated Care for Children With Special Health Care Needs|author=Earl J. Brewer Jr|publisher=Pedriatics.aappublications.org|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1989 by the first National Medical Home Conference, which drew 26 AAP state chapters to Hawaii for presentations organized by Sia and MCHB officials on how to train pediatricians in the Medical Home system of care. This led to consultations to introduce the Medical Home training program to interdisciplinary teams of pediatricians, families, and other health care–related professionals in Florida, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Washington and other states.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The pace of activity prompted Sia to close his private medical practice in 1996 so he could devote his time as principal investigator on various early childhood grant projects promoting the Medical Home and its integrated system of care. He launched several initiatives with a MCHB Health Education Collaboration grant in support of interprofessional training in early childhood, a [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] Starting Points planning grant in early childhood, and Consuelo Foundation of Hawaii's Healthy and Ready to Learn grant–all with the emphasis on integrating the continuum of care of the Medical Home with other health, family, and community services from a holistic approach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; The MCHB funding enabled him to travel across the country to promote the Medical Home concept to various
communities, state AAP chapters, family advocacy groups and state Title V maternal and child health officers.

A three-year pilot project creating a Healthy and Ready to Learn Center in Hawaii began in 1992 and helped gauge the effectiveness of Sia's family-centered interprofessional collaboration approach.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Lessons learned from this project were subsequently adopted by the Office of Children and Youth of the Governor's Office of Hawaii with Sia as Co-Principal Investigator.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; The Carnegie Corp. Starting Points grant then was assumed by the Good Beginnings Alliance in Hawaii.

Sia, serving as chairman of the American Medical Association's Section Council on Pediatrics and other AMA- and AAP-related posts, used those platforms and his network of contacts with other groups to help introduce the Medical Home concept into the care of adults&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/391/1177/EvidenceReport208_ClosingTheQualityGap-Patient-Centered-Medical-Home_ExecutiveSummary_20120703.pdf |format=PDF |title=2. The Patient-Centered Medical Home Closing the Quality Gap: Revisiting the State of the Science : Executive Summary |publisher=Effectibvehealthcare.ahrq.gov |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as children, although his primary focus has remained on pediatric care. In 2007, the AAP, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians and the [[American Osteopathic Association]] adopted the Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home that set a standard definition of a Medical Home. A year later, the AMA adopted the principles, which have since received support from over 700 member organizations of the [[Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative]], including primary care and specialty care societies, all major health plans and consumer organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccp.org/publications/pdf/text_1041.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pediatric Medical Homes : Laying the Foundation of a Promising Model of Care |publisher=Nccp.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the term Medical Home now regularly shows up in the literature of parent groups such as Family Voices, in family practice journals and on the websites of state public health and medical agencies.&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt;

===Focus on Asia===

Beginning in 2000, Sia expanded his efforts related to early child development and the Medical Home to Asia. In 2003, he created the Asia-US Partnership, a think tank based at the University of Hawaii medical school whose mission is to improve child health in Asia and the United States through cross-cultural
exchanges with leaders in pediatrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp1/pdf/AUSP1_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=Early Child Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Sia initiated and chaired the first of several AUSP Early Child Development and Primary Care conferences, bringing together pediatric and early childhood development experts from Asia and the United States to translate the science of early child development into policy and action. Participants have come from China (Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong), the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand and the United States. According to conference reports, these international exchanges have stimulated translation of the science on early child development and primary care into action programs in the broad areas of advocacy, service delivery, research, and training among the Asian early childhood professionals leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Sia has continued to serve as co-chairman of these events, including the sixth international conference, held in the Philippines capital of Manila, in May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp6/pdf/AUSPVI_BriefingBook.pdf |format=PDF |title=Briefing Book : Asia-US Partnership 2011 : Early Childhood Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hosting the earliest AUSP conferences in Hawaii, Sia decided to move the 2009 event to Shanghai and tapped a team of Chinese doctors to serve as conference host, signaling what he called a new phase of activity aimed at developing greater shared leadership and stronger "country teams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cds.hawaii.edu/sites/default/files/downloads/ausp/ausp5/pdf/AUSPV_FinalReport.pdf |format=PDF |title=Asia-US Partnership 2011 : Early Childhood Development in Primary Care |publisher=Cds.hawaii.edu |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pediatric emergency medicine===
While planting the seeds of the Medical Home concept in Hawaii, Sia embarked on a related advocacy campaign focused on emergency care for children. In 1979, as president of the Hawaii Medical Association, Sia urged members of the American Academy of Pediatrics to develop multifaceted Emergency Medical Services programs designed to decrease disability and death in children. By January 1981, AAP's Executive Board had approved formation of a Section on Emergency Medicine, with Sia as one of its seven charter members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.aap.org/sections/pem/25AnniversaryBookletFinal.pdf |format=PDF |title=The AAP Section on Emergency Medicine |publisher=2.aap.org |accessdate=2015-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He along with José B. Lee then-executive officer of the Hawaii Medical Association Emergency Medical Services Program began working closely with Senator [[Daniel Inouye]], whom he happened to meet on a flight to Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref name="Palfrey" /&gt; to create a National Emergency Medical Services for Children System ([[Emergency Medical Services for Children|EMSC]]) demonstration grant program to address acute injuries, illnesses and other childhood crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oDI8Rxe34U8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=snippet&amp;q=Calvin%20Sia&amp;f=false|title=APLS : the Pediatric Emergency Medicine Resource|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was launched after the October 1984 enactment of EMSC legislation (Public Law 98-555), a bipartisan measure sponsored by Inouye and Republican Senators [[Orrin Hatch]] of Utah and [[Lowell Weicker]] of Connecticut and endorsed by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.ny.gov/nysdoh/ems/emsc/index.htm|title=Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC)|publisher=Health.ny.gov|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensnational.org/files/PDF/EMSC/EMSC_An_Historical_Perspective.pdf|title=EMSC: an historical perspective|last=|first=|date=|website=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203204651/http://www.childrensnational.org/files/PDF/EMSC/EMSC_An_Historical_Perspective.pdf|archivedate=February 3, 2012|deadurl=yes|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; States receiving these demonstration grants established an emergency medical care service system for children that upgraded training and equipment for first responders and emergency departments to treat children. Hawaii ultimately received a grant to initiate its own emergency care system for children, which improved care coordination with the primary care physician. EMSC is now an established statewide system of care for children in all 50 states and territories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Several national and state organizations have recognized Sia for developing innovative and responsive family-centered grassroots services.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Among the awards he has received are these:

'''Circle of Health International''', known as COHI for short, is a US based [[non-governmental organization]] founded in 2004 with the mission to work with women and their communities with a community based approach in times of crisis. As of 2016, COHI has responded to eighteen humanitarian emergencies and served over three million women globally. COHI has worked with [[Midwife|midwives]] and [[public health]] professionals in [[Sri Lanka]], [[Louisiana]], [[Tibet]], [[Tanzania]], [[Israel]], the [[Philippines]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Sudan]], [[Haiti]], and [[Afghanistan]].

As of 2016 COHI supports [[Maternal health|maternal]] and [[child health]] clinics in Haiti, midwives in an indigenous women's forum in Nicaragua, midwifery students and [[sexual health]] advocates in [[Nepal]], a clinic for [[refugee]]s in the [[Rio Grande Valley]] on the Mexico/US border, and works with survivors of [[human trafficking]] globally. COHI is also engaged in Austin's [[social enterprise]] community through a program, known as the COHI Cloth Network, to address women's [[poverty]] through income generation initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This Foundation Is Improving Maternal Health Worldwide, One Birth At A Time|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2015/12/98629/circle-of-health-international-psa|website=Refinery29.com|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How U.S. moms can help celebrate International Women's Day|url=http://www.sheknows.com/parenting/articles/1075897/international-womens-day-how-you-can-reach-moms-across-the-globe|date=8 March 2015|website=Sheknows.com|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sera Bonds helps refugee women get the care they need|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/sera-bonds-helps-refugee-women-get-the-care-they-need|website=Msnbc.com|accessdate=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Missions==
=== Tibet ===
In 2004, COHI partnered with a local host organization, Tibetan Healing Fund, in Tongren, also known as Repkong, Eastern Tibet to aid with the training of midwives in order to create a more sustainable maternal health care system.

=== Israel/West Bank ===
In 2004, COHI and their partners worked with Israeli and Palestinian woman to address midwifery and gender based violence (GBV). Conducted an assessment based on three main categories

# To produce a substantial GBV ethnography of the region;
# To design and implement specialized programming targeting the cultural nuances of each group; and
# Coalition-building among Israeli and Palestinian organizations to implement relevant projects in partnership with local women's rights organizations.

The assessment included in depth interviews and recommendations for each sector of Israel and the West Bank's diverse populations: religious and secular Jews, immigrant populations (Ethiopian, Russian, Congolese), the Bedouin, and the Palestinian populations of Israel and the West Bank, both Muslim and Christian

The results from the assessment were used to advocate for the needs of Israeli and Palestinian women such as better postpartum care.

'''Clinical research''' is a branch of [[healthcare science]] that determines the safety and effectiveness ([[efficacy]]) of [[medications]], [[Medical device|devices]], [[diagnostics|diagnostic products]] and [[medical treatment|treatment regimens]] intended for human use. These may be used for prevention, treatment, diagnosis or for relieving symptoms of a disease. Clinical research is different from clinical practice. In clinical practice established treatments are used, while in clinical research evidence is collected to establish a treatment.

==Overview==
The term "clinical research" refers to the entire bibliography of a drug/device/biologic, in fact any test article from its inception in the lab to its introduction to the consumer market and beyond. Once the promising candidate or the molecule is identified in the lab, it is subjected to pre-clinical studies or animal studies where different aspects of the test article (including its safety [[toxicity]] if applicable and [[efficacy]], if possible at this early stage) are studied.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, J.W. (2008). Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008, p. 300. {{ISBN|0-13-613550-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchmedics.com/ |title=Professional Medical Writing |accessdate=October 29, 2016 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6lcighdfv?url=http://researchmedics.com/ |archivedate=October 29, 2016 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=news1309&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20130916/Adaptive-Clinical-Trials-for-Overcoming-Research-Challenges.aspx |title=Adaptive Clinical Trials for Overcoming Research Challenges |publisher=News-medical.net |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], when a test article is unapproved or not yet cleared by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] ([[FDA]]), or when an approved or cleared test article is used in a way that may significantly increase the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks), the data obtained from the pre-clinical studies or other supporting evidence, case studies of off label use, etc. are submitted in support of an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) application&lt;ref&gt;FDA Page last updated 27 October 2014 [http://www.fda.gov/cder/regulatory/applications/ind_page_1.htm Investigational New Drug (IND) Application]&lt;/ref&gt; to the FDA for review prior to conducting studies that involve even one human and a test article if the results are intended to be submitted to or held for inspection by the FDA at any time in the future (in the case of an already approved test article, if intended to submit or hold for inspection by the FDA in support of a change in labeling or advertising). Where devices are concerned the submission to the FDA would be for an [[Investigational Device Exemption]] (IDE) application if the device is a significant risk device or is not in some way exempt from prior submission to the [[FDA]]. In addition, clinical research may require [[Institutional Review Board]] (IRB) or Research Ethics Board (REB) and possibly other institutional committee reviews, Privacy Board, Conflict of Interest Committee, Radiation Safety Committee, Radioactive Drug Research Committee, etc. approval whether or not the research requires prior submission to the FDA. Clinical research review criteria will depend on which federal regulations the research is subject to (e.g., ([[Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) if federally funded, FDA as already discussed) and will depend on which regulations the institutions subscribe to, in addition to any more stringent criteria added by the institution possibly in response to state or local laws/policies or accreditation entity recommendations. This additional layer of review (IRB/REB in particular) is critical to the protection of human subjects especially when you consider that often research subject to the FDA regulation for prior submission is allowed to proceed, by those same FDA regulations, 30 days after submission to the FDA unless specifically notified by the FDA not to initiate the study.

Clinical research is often conducted at academic medical centers and affiliated research study sites. These centers and sites provide the prestige of the academic institution as well as access to larger metropolitan areas, providing a larger pool of medical participants. These academic medical centers often have their internal [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Boards]] that oversee the ethical conduct of medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohamadi|first=Amin|last2=Asghari|first2=Fariba|last3=Rashidian|first3=Arash|date=2014|title=Continuing review of ethics in clinical trials: a surveillance study in Iran|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine|volume=7|pages=22|pmc=4648212|pmid=26587202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical research ecosystem involves a complex network of sites, pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions. This has led to a growing field of technologies used for managing the data and operational factors of clinical research. Clinical research management is often aided by [[eClinical]] systems to help automate the management and conducting of [[clinical trials]].

In the [[European Union]], the [[European Medicines Agency]] (EMA) acts in a similar fashion for studies conducted in their region. These human studies are conducted in four phases in research subjects that give [[consent]] to participate in the [[clinical trials]].

==Phases==
{{main|Phases of clinical research}}
Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate [[clinical trial]]. The drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through Phases I, II, and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV are 'post-approval' studies.

Phase I includes 20 to 100 healthy volunteers or individuals with the disease/condition. This study typically lasts several months and its purpose is safety and dosage. Phase II includes larger number of individual participants ranging 100-300, and phase III includes Approximately 1000-3000 participants to collect more data about the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/basics|title=The Basics|website=National Institutes of Health|date=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70% of drugs advance to the next phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/ForPatients/Approvals/Drugs/ucm405622.htm|title=The Drug Development Process|last=|first=|website=www.fda.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before pharmaceutical companies start clinical trials on a drug, they conduct extensive [[pre-clinical development|pre-clinical studies]].

A '''component cause''' of a [[disease]] is an event required for the disease to develop.
Given a disease or medical condition, there is a causality chain of events from the first event to the appearance of the [[clinical disease]]
A cause of a disease event is an event that preceded the disease event in a disease causal chain. Without this [[:wikt:antecedent|antecedent]] event the disease event either would not have occurred at all or would not have occurred until some later time. However, no specific event is sufficient by itself to produce disease. Hence such an event is a component of a [[sufficient cause]].

'''Dental assistants''' (also known as dental nurses) are members of the dental team.&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017" /&gt; They may support a dental operator (such as a [[dentist]] or other treating [[dental auxiliary]]) in providing more efficient [[dentistry|dental treatment]]. ''Dental assistants'' are distinguished from other groups of [[Dental auxiliary|dental auxiliaries]] (such as [[dental therapist]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s and [[dental technician]]s) by differing training, roles and patient scopes.&lt;ref name="ADA_Careers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017" /&gt;

== History ==

=== The first dental assistant ===
[[File:Dr. James McCarl and dental assistant with young patient.jpg|thumb|Infection control was very different in historical dentistry when compared to dentistry nowadays in 2018. Dental assistants and dentists did not wear all or if any personal protection equipment when practicing. We can see that the dentist, in this case on the left, is not wearing a mask, gloves or eye protection (apart from his glasses). Additionally, the dental assistant on the right, is also not wearing any gloves, mask or eye protection.]]
The first dental assistant in modern history is believed to trace back to 1885. Dr Edmund Kells, a pioneering dentist operating from New Orleans, enlisted the help of his wife, Malvina Cueria to assist him during dental procedures.&lt;ref name="Langland_1972"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Langland OE | title = C. Edmund Kells | journal = Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, and Oral Pathology | volume = 34 | issue = 4 | pages = 680–9 | date = October 1972 | pmid = 4560600 | doi = 10.1016/0030-4220(72)90353-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DCE"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dentalcareersedu.org/2015/06/the-birth-of-the-dental-assistant-profession/|title=The Birth of the Dental Assistant Profession |date=2015 | website = Dental Careers Education }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dental field was initially dominated by males, but after this first addition of a female, it was then acceptable for women to seek dental treatment without their husbands. This led to dental assistants of that era also being known as "Ladies in Attendance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunter|first=Tija | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011|title=Assisting; Past present, and future|url=https://www.dentistryiq.com/articles/2011/12/assisting--past-present.html|journal=Dentistry IQ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the addition of [[Women in dentistry|women to dentistry]], the profession flourished with more and more women seeking treatment and more patients overall receiving care.&lt;ref name="DCE" /&gt;

=== The first association ===
It was not until almost four decades later that in 1923 the first dental assistant association was founded by [[Juliette southard|Juliette Southard]], named the American Dental Assistant Association and it is still in practise now.&lt;ref name="ADAA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adaausa.org/About-ADAA/History-of-ADAA|title=History of ADAA|last=|first=|date=2018| website = American Dental Assistants Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; It began with just five members, now reaching more than 10,000.&lt;ref name="ADAA" /&gt;

== Roles ==

The dental assistant's role is often thought to be to support the dental operator by typically passing [[Dental instruments|instruments]] during clinical procedures. However, in fact, their role extends much further to include: providing patients help with their oral hygiene skills, preparing the patient for treatment, sterilising instruments, assisting during general anaesthetic dental procedures, positioning suction devices, exposing dental [[Radiography|radiographs]], taking [[dental impression]]s, recording patient notes and administration roles such as scheduling appointments.&lt;ref name="ADA_Careers"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.adansw.com.au/Careers/Dental-Assistant | website = Australian Dental Association |date=16 May 2018| title = Dental Assistant }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ATOMO_Dental_premium_quality_barrier_film_for_dental_clinics.jpg|thumb|Plastic barriers that are typically used to cover dental equipment for infection control purposes.]]

=== Infection control ===
It was customary for oral health care workers and dental assistants in the 1980s to practice oral health care without wearing gloves, masks or eye protection.&lt;ref name="Oosthuysen_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oosthuysen J, Potgieter E, Fossey A | title = Compliance with infection prevention and control in oral health-care facilities: a global perspective | journal = International Dental Journal | volume = 64 | issue = 6 | pages = 297–311 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25244364 | doi = 10.1111/idj.12134 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was at a crucial time due to the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) spreading rapidly at a global rate.&lt;ref name="Oosthuysen_2014" /&gt; However, in 2018 gloves, masks and eye protection have become part of the standard [[infection control]] guidelines which has been implemented in all oral health care settings as a means of preventing the spread of [[Infectious Disease|infectious disease]].&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ada.org.au/Dental-Professionals/Publications/Infection-Control/Guidelines-for-Infection-Control/1ADA_GuidelinesforInfectionControl_3|title=Guidelines for Infection Control| website = Australia Dental Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infection control]] in oral health care not only protects the patient but it also protects the oral health care workers.&lt;ref name="Oosthuysen_2014" /&gt; This includes: [[dentist]]s, dental specialists, oral health therapists, dental hygienists and dental assistants.&lt;ref name="Oosthuysen_2014" /&gt;

Dental assistants play a crucial role in maintaining high levels of [[infection control]] in the oral health care setting.&lt;ref name="Oosthuysen_2014" /&gt; The dental assistant is the major link between oral health care workers and the patient.&lt;ref name="Manasi_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manasi R|date= December 2016 | title=Awareness about Occupational Exposure for Blood Borne Infections among Medical and Dental Students |journal=Journal of Medical Science and Clinical Research|volume=04|issue=12|pages=14898–14902|doi=10.18535/jmscr/v4i12.96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To perform infection control responsibilities well, the dental assistant must have the appropriate education, training and work experience. Examples of infection control protocols that the dental assistant needs to follow in an oral health setting include:

=== Hand hygiene  ===

[[Hand washing|Hand hygiene]] aims to reduce the number of [[microorganism]]s on hands. [[Antimicrobial agents]] such as alcohol-based hand rub or [[antimicrobial]] soap and water are effective agents to remove most [[antimicrobial agents|antimicrobial]] [[bacteria]] on hands in dental settings.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manasi_2016" /&gt;

=== Personal protective equipment (PPE)  ===

Gloves, gown and eye protection are essential barrier protection items that enable the dental assistant to reduce the transmission of [[infectious diseases]] to themselves, other dental co-workers and patients.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manasi_2016" /&gt; Gloves and masks need to be disposed after each patient, eyewear can be disposable or reusable and gowns need to be replaced if visibly soiled.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manasi_2016" /&gt; Lastly, footwear must include leather closed toe shoes; this minimises the risk of sharps injury.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;

=== Surgical procedures and aseptic technique  ===

It is crucial to wear sterile gloves when the dental assistant is assisting in surgery with the oral health care clinician.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; Hand hygiene using [[antimicrobial]] soap and water is imperial to maintaining adequate [[infection control]] in this setting, as this minimises the risk of [[infection]].&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;

=== Management of sharps injury  ===

It is crucial that sharp instruments which include: needles, scalers, scalpels, burs, orthodontics bands and endodontic files need to be handled with care and appropriate techniques to minimise any potential sharps injury.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; Sharps also need to be disposed accordingly into the sharps containers, separate from other disposable bins.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; The dental assistant needs to be aware of what is required to go into the sharps containers and what is not.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; This minimises the chance of spreading [[infectious diseases]].&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;
[[File:Container_for_medical_sharp_and_infectious_waste.jpg|thumb|Container for medical sharps and infectious waste - typically found in dental surgeries.]]

=== Management of clinical waste  ===

It is imperative that when performing change over, that the dental assistant is able to distinguish the difference between medical related waste compared to contaminated waste.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; Contaminated waste needs to be placed in a leak proof thick yellow bag with a [[biohazard symbol]] label.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;

=== Environment  ===

The dental assistant should put on new gloves when cleaning working surfaces during the changeover between patients.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; They must also be able to distinguish between clean and dirty zones as this minimises the spread of [[infectious diseases]] between co-workers and patients.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; Additionally, plastic barriers are placed on: instruments such as; hand pieces connected to the chair, overhead lights, amalgamators, [[x-ray machine]]s, mixing materials and other miscellaneous [[dental instruments]], materials or appliances.&lt;ref name="Prathima_2017"&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Prathima V, Vellore KP, Kotha A, Malathi S, Kumar VS, Koneru M | date = May 2017 | title = Knowledge, attitude and practices towards eco-friendly dentistry among dental practitioners | url = http://portaldeperiodicos.unisul.br/index.php/JR_Dentistry/article/view/4816 | journal = Journal of Research in Dentistry | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 123–127 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the roles that the dental assistant participates in is changing these plastic barriers after each patient has left that surgery.&lt;ref name="Prathima_2017" /&gt; This ensures that the surgery is set up ready for the next patient.&lt;ref name="Prathima_2017" /&gt;

* These infection control procedures and protocols not only apply to the dental assistant, but to all co-workers in the oral health care setting.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; However, the dental assistant is the major connection between the patient and the oral health care clinician.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt; Therefore, it is imperative that they follow these guidelines to minimise the risk of spreading possible [[infectious diseases]] to co-workers, patients and themselves.&lt;ref name="ADA_Infection_Control" /&gt;

=== Sterilisation, disinfectant and antiseptic ===
Dental assistants play a large role in ensuring that the reusable [[dental instruments]] used daily in dental practices are sterilised adequately after each use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ball | first1 = Samantha | name-list-format = vanc | title = Duty of care | journal = Dental Nursing | date = September 2011 | volume = 7 | issue = Sup1 | pages = S4–S5 | doi = 10.12968/denn.2011.7.Sup1.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sterilization (microbiology)|Sterilisation]] is an essential part of the [[infection control]] protocol. This can be defined as free of all life forms where the elimination of considerable number of the most heat resistant spores (bacterial and mycotic) is the basic criteria sterilisation. Sterilisation process consists of&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bev|first=Wasp | name-list-format = vanc |date=October 2013|title=A Review of Pre-Sterilisation Cleaning Methods | doi = 10.12968/denn.2013.9.Sup2.20 |journal=Dental Nursing|volume=9|pages=20–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Autoclaving]] where moist heat kills bacteria by denaturation of high protein- containing bacteria at 250F (121&amp;nbsp;°C) for 15 to 20 minutes or 270 F for 3 minutes. Biological monitors and Process indicators are 2 methods used to ensure the effectiveness of sterilization process.   
## Biological monitor (spore test) where bacterial spores are placed in strips or envelops along with the instruments. This method shows that the microorganisms have been eradicated and must be conducted weekly.   
## Process indicators; where the load has reached a certain temperature, the indicators change their colour.   
# [[Dry heat sterilization]] which requires a higher temperature and longer time (1–2 hours) than steam autoclave, therefore, only glass or metal objects can be steamed by dry heat.  
# Chemiclave by using Ethylene oxide at relatively low temperature for 2–3 hours.  
# Cold/ chemical test which can be done by soaking instruments (heat- sensitive) in a specific chemical solution such as 2% glutaraldehyde for 10 hours in order to kill bacterial spores. However, this method does not destroy hepatitis viruses and spores.

[[Disinfectant]] is also one of the major roles of dental assistant where chemicals applied to inanimate surfaces such as lab tops, counter tops, headrests, light handles, etc. This is to make sure that germicide and/or microbiostatic are achieved.&lt;ref name = "US"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sydney.edu.au/whs/guidelines/biosafety/decontamination_guidelines.shtml |title=Decontamination of Decontamination of Clinical/Biological Waste and Spill Management  | publisher = The University of Sydney }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery|Antiseptic]] chemical agents similar to disinfectants but they may be applied safely to living tissue, is another task for dental assistant where Alcohol is the most commonly used.&lt;ref name = "US" /&gt;

=== Health promotion ===
Dental assistants make a difference in the community by participating in [[health promotion]] activities and programs. These programs may take place at schools, preschools, [[immunisation]] events or at [[maternal health]] clinics. Dental operators may also be supported by dental assistants during pre-school or school screenings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall M, Christian B | title = A health-promoting community dental service in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia: protocol for the North Richmond model of oral health care | journal = Australian Journal of Primary Health | volume = 23 | issue = 5 | pages = 407–414 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 28823310 | doi = 10.1071/PY17007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dental assistants can extend their scope to provide oral health promotion to patients in Australia by completing the Certificate IV in Dental Assisting (Oral Health Promotion).&lt;ref name="Dyer_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dyer TA, Brocklehurst P, Glenny AM, Davies L, Tickle M, Issac A, Robinson PG | title = Dental auxiliaries for dental care traditionally provided by dentists | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = | issue = 8 | pages = CD010076 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25140869 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010076.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dental assistant will have the ability to implement an individualised oral health promotion program and oral hygiene program. After the appropriate training the dental assistant may; 
[[File:Group session oral health promotion Nepal.JPG|thumb|Health promotion for good oral health.]]
[[File:Altenheim 05.jpg|thumb|Residential aged care and dental assistants engaging in recreational activities - its not always about teeth.]]

# Promote the dental team concept in achieving good oral health and promoting good oral hygiene habits                                          
# Assist in making dental treatment accessible and affordable to the community
# Perform health promotion activities by promoting good oral health to the community
# Support and educate on oral health promotion to allied health professionals

Dental assistants help other dental and allied health professionals in health promotion. These dental assistants implement oral health programs by providing resources and presentation promoting oral health messages to several target groups and community settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Petersen PE, Torres AM | title = Preventive oral health care and health promotion provided for children and adolescents by the Municipal Dental Health Service in Denmark | journal = International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–91 | date = June 1999 | pmid = 10530216 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-263x.1999.00111.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These settings include:

* [[Assisted living|Residential Aged Care]] Facilities                                                                                                                                                    
* [[Special needs dentistry|Special Needs]]                                                                                                                                                                              
* Schools
* Early childhood services                                                                                                                                                             
* Culturally diverse communities
* Community sport clubs

Dental assistant can educate the community and schools by advising on:

* Oral diseases
* Diet analysis and counselling
* Oral hygiene strategies
* Preventive strategies
* Care of fixed &amp; removable prosthesis and fixed appliances 
* [[Smoking cessation]]
* Preventing sports injuries

=== Radiography ===
Currently in [[Australia]], dental assistants are not required to be registered under the Dental Board of Australia.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt; However, dental assistants who have attained their certificate IV in dental assisting – [[Dental radiography|Dental Radiography]] must hold a current license with the relative state or territory radiation authority.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt; Dental assistants that decide to take on further study into their certificate IV in dental assisting - dental radiography, have an advantage of exposing patients to radiation also known as an x-ray, with regards to oral health care.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt; The dental assistant will take training to further their practical and theoretical skills relevant to the role of the dental radiographer.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt; 
[[File:Dental Radiography.JPG|thumb|Dental Radiography - pictures of intra oral radiographs of the whole mouth.]]Upon successful completion of the training program dependent on the course structure, the dental assistant may:

Expose [[Intraoral|intra-oral]] radiographs that ensures an optimum radiographic image.&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dentalnursingaustralia.com/SHORT%20COURSE%20DENTAL%20RADIOGRAPHY%202015.pdf|title = Short Course Dental Radiology| website = Dental Nursing Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*&lt;nowiki/&gt;Process, mount and file [[Intraoral|intra-ora]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;l radiographs.&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course" /&gt;
* Able to identify technical faults&lt;nowiki/&gt; and their causes.&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course" /&gt;
* Be able to demonstrate an understanding of potential hazards of exposure to [[radiation]] and to practice high standards of [[radiation therapy]].&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course" /&gt;
* To recognise normal [[anatomy]].&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course" /&gt;
* Maintain [[infection control]] throughout all practical procedures.&lt;ref name="DNA_Short_Course" /&gt;

== Potential future roles ==

=== Aging population ===
[[File:Basic_dental_screening_150218-N-QK202-017.jpg|thumb|School screening where children are screened for dental decay or gum disease or other abnormalities of the mouth.]]Looking to the future of dentistry and oral health, the roles for dental assistants are ever-changing and expanding. With the increase in an ageing population, it will become more and more commonplace for dental assistants to be employed to support dental operators with providing oral health promotion and treatment within [[Residential care facility|residential care]] facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Better oral health in residential care: staff portfolio | date = 2009 | publisher = South Australian Dental Service, Government of South Australia | location = Adelaide | isbn = 978-0-7308-9791-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increasing demand to match new dental graduates ===

The number of newly graduated dentists and dental auxiliaries is increasing and with that the need for dental assistants.&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kracher C, Breen C, McMahon K, Gagliardi L, Miyasaki C, Landsberg K, Reed C | title = The Evolution of the Dental Assisting Profession | journal = Journal of Dental Education | volume = 81 | issue = 9 | pages = eS30–eS37 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28864801 | doi = 10.21815/JDE.017.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics of America the rate of employed dental assistants will likely increase by 18% in the ten years between 2014 and 2024.&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017" /&gt; With an increase in dental assistants comes the possibility of extension in the dental assistant roles and scope. As seen in some states of the United States of America, dental assistants are able to perform some simple [[Dental filling|fillings]] with the supervision of a practising dentist.&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017" /&gt; By allowing dental assistants to extend their scope alongside the appropriate training, the workload of the other members of the dental team is lessened and increases efficiency of the dental clinic management. This may have the potential to reach other countries in the future as the need for dental and oral health treatments increase.&lt;ref name="Kracher_2017" /&gt;

== Variations around the world ==
Dental assistant roles can vary depending on different country qualifications and regulations. Below are examples of dental assisting roles which the dental assistant is able to perform, respective to that country.

=== Australia ===
[[File:Australian_Flag_Flying_animated.gif|thumb|Australian Flag - animated.]]
According to the Australian Government, Department of Health, in 2006 there were 15,381 registered dental assistants supporting dental operators. Of those, 171 were Indigenous.

In Australia Dental Assistants should have the following skills:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ada.org.au/Careers/Dental-Team/Assistant | title = Careers in Dentistry - Australian Dental Association| website =  Australian Dental Association |access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paschall L | title = The professional dental assistant | journal = Dental Assistant | volume = 83 | issue = 1 | pages = 4, 47 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24741898 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Dental assistants perform limited and restricted duties and are not permitted to perform any of the following:&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dapa.asn.au/home/working-in-australia|title= Working in Australia | website = The Dental Assistants Professional Association |access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraser HJ | title = The training and examination of dental nurses in New Zealand and Australia | journal = British Dental Nurses' Journal | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 12 | date = 1995 | pmid = 9790009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* any irreversible procedure on the human teeth or jaw or associated structures&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser_1995" /&gt;
* correcting malpositions of the human teeth or jaw or associated structures;&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser_1995" /&gt;
* fitting or intra-orally adjusting artificial teeth or corrective or restorative dental appliances for a person&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser_1995" /&gt;
* performing any irreversible procedure on, or the giving of any treatment or advice to, a person that is preparatory to or for the purpose of fitting, inserting, adjusting, fixing, constructing, repairing or renewing artificial dentures or a restorative dental appliance&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser_1995" /&gt;

Dental Assisting is not a registered profession in Australia and as such training courses are not mandatory, although those with nationally recognised qualifications will enjoy the benefits of higher wages and better employment opportunities.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;

There is no formal training required of entry level dental assistants in order to commence or undertake work in private practice in Australia.&lt;ref name="Chrisopoulos_2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/768469756|title=Oral health and dental care in Australia : key facts and figures 2011 | first1 = Sergio | last1 = Chrisopoulos | first2 = Katie | last2 = Beckwith | first3 = Jane | last3 = Harford | name-list-format = vanc  | date = 2011 | publisher = Australian Institute of Health and Welfare|isbn=978-1-74249-266-7|location=Canberra|oclc=768469756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most dental assistants gain practical experience at a place of employment although there are vocational qualifications which are nationally recognised and highly recommended for increasing a person's job prospects, remuneration, and professional development.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;

The National Vocational Qualification  HLT35015 Certificate III in Dental Assisting is the entry level of vocational training for dental assisting while  HLT45015 Certificate IV in Dental Assisting are suitable for those who seek to further their skills and duties and elect units from particular streams such as dental radiography, oral health promotion, practice administration, general anaesthesia and conscious sedation.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chrisopoulos_2011" /&gt; These formal qualifications can be offered only by registered training organisations such as TAFE and professional associations while Certificate III in Dental Assisting may also be offered as a traineeship in most States of Australia and as a School-based Traineeship for years 11 and 12 in some States.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chrisopoulos_2011" /&gt;

Currently dental assistants are not required to be registered under the Dental Board of Australia or with any State and Territory Boards since dental assisting is not a registered profession. Dental Assistants who have attained a Certificate IV in Dental Assisting – Dental Radiography and are required to operate dental radiography apparatus as part of their job role, must hold a current license with the relevant state or territory Radiation Authority.&lt;ref name="DAPA_Working_Australia" /&gt;

Dental assistants are strongly encouraged to have current vaccinations for Hepatitis B, and Tetanus along with the normal childhood vaccination recommendations (Measles, mumps, varicella, polio) and influenza. Many state and territory public health care facilities and training providers will require students and workers to present evidence of Hepatitis B immunity and the results of a criminal history check prior to commencing clinical placement. Most private dental clinics will also require employees to have current vaccination records and may also require workers to undertake annual influenza vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dapa.asn.au/home/dental-assistants|title=Becoming a Dental Assistant | website = The Dental Assistants Professional Association |access-date=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adavb.net/ForthePublic/DentalProfessions/DentalAssistant/tabid/230/language/en-AU/Default.aspx#ADAVB-the-voice-of-dentistry-in-Victoria-0101011101000011 |title=ADAVB &gt; For the Public &gt; Dental Professions &gt; Dental Assistant | author = ADAVB| website = Australian Dental Association Victorian Branch Inc. | access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education and licensing ====
In some U.S. states, dental assistants can work in the field without a college degree, while in other states, dental assistants must be licensed or registered/&lt;ref name = "Bird_2015" /&gt;

Dental assistants can receive formal education through academic programs at community colleges, vocational schools, career colleges, technical institutes, universities and dental schools with most programs needing only 8 to 11 months to complete.&lt;ref name = "Bird_2015" /&gt;

The Commission on Dental Accreditation of the American Dental Association accredits dental assisting school programs, of which there are over 200 in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.ada.org/en/coda | title = Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) | website = Commission on Dental Accreditation | access-date = 2018-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To become a Certified Dental Assistant, or CDA, dental assistants must take the DANB (Dental Assisting National Board) CDA examination after they have completed an accredited dental assisting program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.danb.org/Home/Become-Certified/Exams-and-Certifications.aspx|title=Exams &amp; Certifications| website = Dental Assisting National Board, Inc |access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; while those who have been trained on the job or have graduated from non-accredited programs are eligible to take the national certification examination after they have completed two years of full-time work experience as dental assistants.&lt;ref name="ADA_Education"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/careers-in-dentistry/dental-team-careers/dental-assistant/education-training-requirements-dental-assistant|title=Dental Assistant Education and Training Requirements| website = American Dental Association |access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Michigan Dental Association | title = The MDA's new policy on non-accredited dental assistant training programs | journal = The Journal of the Michigan Dental Association | volume = 89 | issue = 8 | pages = 50, 52–3 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17844678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some dentists are willing to pay a dental assistant-in-training that has a good attitude and work ethic.&lt;ref name="ADA_Education" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hernandez A, Montellano V | title = Integrity, service and excellence: the experiences of USAF dental assistant instructors | journal = Dental Assistant | volume = 80 | issue = 6 | pages = 40–1 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22359820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA the Dental Assisting National Board offers three nationally recognised certifications, namely:&lt;ref name = "Bird_2015" /&gt;

# Certified Dental Assistant (CDA)
# Certified Orthodontic Assistant (COA)
# Certified Preventative Functions Dental Assistant (CPFDA)

A minimum 2 GCSEs (C grade or above) in English language and maths or a science subject are usually required for part-time courses while full-time courses may require evidence of A-level or AS-level study. A level 3 apprenticeship in dental nursing is an alternative pathway to gaining the required qualifications in dental nursing.&lt;ref name = "NHS_dental_nurse" /&gt;

In the Republic of Ireland, it is often dental nurses (and teeth whitening technicians) who carry out teeth whitening procedures rather than dentists.&lt;ref name="Sheridan_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=Carmen | name-list-format = vanc |date= January 2011|title=Dental nursing abroad: rules, regulations and requirements 6|journal=Dental Nursing|volume=7|issue=1|pages=36–40|doi=10.12968/denn.2011.7.1.36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice mainly occurs in clinics focusing solely on laser teeth whitening. In Ireland, registration as a dental nurse with The Irish Dental Council is voluntary; however, nurses who are registered and who carry out teeth whitening may face disciplinary action if caught.&lt;ref name = "IDA_Dental_nurse"&gt;{{cite web | title = Dental Nurses | url = https://www.dentist.ie/careers-in-dentistry/dental-nurse.144.html | website = Irish Dental Association (IDA) | date = 16 May 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sheridan_2011" /&gt;

Since about 2011, the increasing recognition of the need for better cyber-security and regulation may result in the need for these specialized resources to develop safer eHealth solutions that can withstand these growing threats.

==Types==

The term can encompass a range of services or systems that are at the edge of medicine/healthcare and information technology, including:

* [[Electronic health record]]: enabling the communication of patient data between different healthcare professionals (GPs, specialists ''etc.'');
* [[Computerized physician order entry]]: a means of requesting diagnostic tests and treatments electronically and receiving the results
* [[Electronic prescribing|ePrescribing]]: access to prescribing options, printing prescriptions to patients and sometimes electronic transmission of prescriptions from doctors to pharmacists
* [[Clinical decision support system]]: providing information electronically about protocols and standards for healthcare professionals to use in diagnosing and treating patients&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.exploris.info/Cardio-Explorer/|title=Exploris - Cardio Explorer|website=www.exploris.info|language=de-CH|access-date=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Telemedicine]]: physical and psychological diagnosis and treatments at a distance, including telemonitoring of patients functions;
* [[Consumer health informatics]]: use of electronic resources on medical topics by healthy individuals or patients;
* Health [[knowledge management]]: ''e.g.'' in an overview of latest medical journals, best practice guidelines or epidemiological tracking (examples include physician resources such as [[Medscape]] and MDLinx);
* Virtual healthcare teams: consisting of healthcare professionals who collaborate and share information on patients through digital equipment (for [[transmural care]]);
* [[mHealth|mHealth or m-Health]]: includes the use of mobile devices in collecting aggregate and patient-level [[health data]], providing healthcare information to practitioners, researchers, and patients, real-time monitoring of patient vitals, and direct provision of care (via mobile telemedicine);
* Medical research using [[Grid computing|grids]]: powerful computing and data management capabilities to handle large amounts of heterogeneous data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |first1=Jochen |last1=Fingberg |first2=Marit |last2=Hansen |first3=Markus |last3=Hansen |first4=Henry |last4=Krasemann |first5=Luigi Lo |last5=Iacono |first6=Thomas |last6=Probst |first7=Jessica |last7=Wright |url=http://www.ccrl-nece.de/publications/paper/public/LR-06-262.pdf |format=PDF |title=Integrating Data Custodians in eHealth Grids: Security and Privacy Aspects |series=NEC Lab Report |date=2006 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929041307/http://www.ccrl-nece.de/publications/paper/public/LR-06-262.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Health informatics|Health informatics / healthcare information systems]]: also often refer to software solutions for appointment scheduling, patient data management, work schedule management and other administrative tasks surrounding health

==Contested definition==
Several authors have noted the variable usage in the term; from being specific to the use of the Internet in healthcare to being generally around any use of computers in healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eysenbach |first1=G |author1-link=Gunther Eysenbach |date=18 June 2001 |url=http://www.jmir.org/2001/2/e20/ | title=What is e-health? | accessdate=2012-04-15 | journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume=3 | issue=2 | pages=e20 | doi=10.2196/jmir.3.2.e20 |doi-access=free | pmid=11720962 | pmc=1761894 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various authors have considered the evolution of the term and its usage and how this maps to changes in health informatics and healthcare generally.&lt;ref name="jmir" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1=Claudia | url=http://www.jmir.org/2005/1/e9/ | title=What Is eHealth (4): A Scoping Exercise to Map the Field | accessdate=2012-04-15 | last2=Sloan | first2=David | last3=Gregor | first3=Peter | last4=Sullivan | first4=Frank | last5=Detmer | first5=Don | last6=Kahan | first6=James P. | last7=Oortwijn | first7=Wija | last8=MacGillivray | first8=Steve | journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=e9 | doi=10.2196/jmir.7.1.e9 |doi-access=free | last1=Pagliari | pmc=1550637 | pmid=15829481 |date=31 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ahern | first1=David K. | url=http://www.jmir.org/2006/1/e4/ | title=What Is eHealth (6): Perspectives on the Evolution of eHealth Research | accessdate=2012-04-15 | last2=Kreslake | first2=Jennifer M. | last3=Phalen | first3=Judith M. | journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume=8 | doi=10.2196/jmir.8.1.e4 |doi-access=free |date=31 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oh ''et al.'', in a 2005 systematic review of the term's usage, offered the definition of eHealth as a set of technological themes in health today, more specifically based on commerce, activities, stakeholders, outcomes, locations, or perspectives.&lt;ref name=Oh_et_al-2005/&gt; One thing that all sources seem to agree on is that e-Health initiatives do not originate with the patient, though the patient may be a member of a patient organization that seeks to do this, as in the [[e-Patient]] movement.

==eHealth literacy==
eHealth literacy is defined as “the ability to seek, find, understand and appraise health information from electronic sources and apply knowledge gained to addressing or solving a health problem.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norman|first=C. D.|last2=Skinner|first2=H. A.|date=|year=2006|title=eHEALS: The eHealth Literacy Scale.|url=|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=8|issue=2|pages=e9|doi=10.2196/jmir.8.2.e9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayat|first=T|last2=Brainin|first2=E|last3=Neter|first3=E|date=|year=2017|title=With Some Help From My Network: Supplementing eHealth Literacy With Social Ties|pmc=5391437|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=19|issue=3|pages=e98|doi=10.2196/jmir.6472|via=|pmid=28360024}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, eHealth literacy encompasses six types of literacy: traditional (literacy and numeracy), information, media, health, computer, and scientific. Of these, media and computer literacies are unique to the Internet context, with eHealth media literacy being the awareness of media bias or perspective, the ability to discern both explicit and implicit meaning from media messages, and to derive meaning from media messages. The literature includes other definitions of perceived media capability or efficacy, but these were not specific to health information on the Internet.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=E|last2=West|first2=D|date=|year=2007|title=Characteristics associated with use of public and private web sites as sources of health care information: results from a national survey.|url=|journal=Med Care|volume=45|issue=3|pages=245–251|doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000244509.60556.49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having the composite skills of eHealth literacy allows health consumers to achieve positive outcomes from using the Internet for health purposes. eHealth literacy has the potential to both protect consumers from harm and empower them to fully  participate in informed health-related decision making.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; People with high levels of eHealth literacy are also more aware of the risk of encountering unreliable information on the Internet &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neter|first=E|last2=Brainin|first2=E|date=|year=2012|title=eHealth literacy: extending the digital divide to the realm of health information.|url=|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=14|issue=1|pages=e19|doi=10.2196/jmir.1619|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the extension of digital resources to the health domain in the form of eHealth literacy can also create new gaps between health consumers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; eHealth literacy hinges not on the mere access to technology, but rather on the skill to apply the accessed knowledge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Data exchange==
One of the factors blocking the use of e-Health tools from widespread acceptance is the concern about privacy issues regarding patient records, most specifically the EPR ([[Electronic patient record]]). This main concern has to do with the confidentiality of the data. There is also concern about non-confidential data however. Each medical practise has its own jargon and diagnostic tools. To standardize the exchange of information, various coding schemes may be used in combination with international medical standards. Systems that deal with these transfers are often referred to as Health Information Exchange (HIE). Of the forms of e-Health already mentioned, there are roughly two types; front-end data exchange and back-end exchange.

Front-end exchange typically involves the patient, while back-end exchange does not. A common example of a rather simple front-end exchange is a patient sending a photo taken by mobile phone of a healing wound and sending it by email to the family doctor for control. Such an actions may avoid the cost of an expensive visit to the hospital.

A common example of a back-end exchange is when a patient on vacation visits a doctor who then may request access to the patient's health records, such as medicine prescriptions, x-ray photographs, or blood test results. Such an action may reveal allergies or other prior conditions that are relevant to the visit.

===Thesaurus===
Successful e-Health initiatives such as [[e-Diabetes]] have shown that for data exchange to be facilitated either at the front-end or the back-end, a common thesaurus is needed for terms of reference.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diabetesfederatie.nl/ndf/e-diabetes.html | title=e-Diabetes on the website of the Dutch Diabetes foundation | publisher=Diabetesfederatie.nl | accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various medical practises in chronic patient care (such as for [[diabetic]] patients) already have a well defined set of terms and actions, which makes standard communication exchange easier, whether the exchange is initiated by the patient or the caregiver.

In general, explanatory diagnostic information (such as the standard [[ICD-10]]) may be exchanged insecurely, and private information (such as personal information from the patient) must be secured. E-health manages both flows of information, while ensuring the quality of the data exchange.

==Early adopters==
Patients living with long term conditions (also called Chronic conditions) over time often acquire a high level of knowledge about the processes involved in their own care, and often develop a routine in coping with their condition. For these types of routine patients, front-end e-Health solutions tend to be relatively easy to implement.

== E-mental health ==
{{See also|Use of technology in treatment of mental disorders}}
E-mental health is frequently used to refer to internet based interventions and support for [[mental health]] conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bennett |first1=Kylie |last2=Reynolds |first2=Julia |last3=Christensen |first3=Helen |last4=Griffiths |first4=Kathleen M. |title=e-hub: an online self-help mental health service in the community |journal=Medical Journal of Australia |date=7 June 2010 |volume=192 |issue=11 Suppl |pages=S48–S52 |pmid=20528710 |url=https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2010/192/11/e-hub-online-self-help-mental-health-service-community |url-access=registration |via=MJA }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can also refer to the use of information and communication technologies that also includes the use of social media, landline and mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Cotton |first1=Rebecca |last2=Hyatt |first2=Jen |last3=Patrick |first3=Matthew |date=29 January 2013 |title=E-Mental Health: what's all the fuss about? |series=Discussion Paper |volume=12 |publisher=[[NHS Confederation]] |location=London, UK |url=http://www.nhsconfed.org/resources/2013/01/e-mental-health-whats-all-the-fuss-about }}&lt;/ref&gt; E-mental health services can include information; peer support services, computer and internet based programs, virtual applications and games as well as real time interaction with trained clinicians.&lt;ref name="Australian Government"&gt;{{cite report |author=Department of Health and Ageing |date=June 2012 |title=E-Mental Health Strategy for Australia |publisher=Australian Government |location=Canberra, Australia |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/7C7B0BFEB985D0EBCA257BF0001BB0A6/$File/emstrat.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Programs can also be delivered using telephones and interactive voice response (IVR).&lt;ref name=NICE-CCBT&gt;{{cite web |date=1 May 2013 |orig-year=2006 |title=Computerised cognitive behaviour therapy for depression and anxiety |website=NICE |publisher=National Institute for Health &amp; Clinical Excellence |location=London, UK |url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This includes appropriate collection and handling of user data, the protection of data from unauthorized access and modification and the safe storage of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bennett |first1=Kylie |last2=Bennett | first2=Anthony James |last3=Griffiths |first3=Kathleen Margaret |title=Security Considerations for E-Mental Health Interventions |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research |date=19 December 2010 |volume=12 |issue=5 |page=e61 |doi=10.2196/jmir.1468 |doi-access=free | pmid=21169173 | pmc=3057317 |url=http://www.jmir.org/2010/5/e61/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-mental health has been gaining momentum in the academic research as well as practical arenas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sprenger |first1=Michaela |last2=Mettler | first2=Tobias |last3=Osma |first3=Jorge |title=Health professionals' perspective on the promotion of e-mental health apps in the context of maternal depression |journal=PLOS ONE |date=12 July 2017 |volume=12 |issue=7 |page=e0180867 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0180867 | url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0180867&amp;type=printable}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a wide variety of disciplines such as psychology, clinical social work, family and marriage therapy, and mental health counseling. Testifying to this momentum, the E-Mental Health movement has its own international organization, the International Society for Mental Health Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ismho.org/|title=ISHMO |publisher=International Society for Mental Health Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, e-Mental health implementation into clinical practice and healthcare systems remains limited and fragmented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gehring |first1=ND |title=Pediatric eMental healthcare technologies: a systematic review of implementation foci in research studies, and government and organizational documents |journal=Implementation Science |date=June 21, 2017 |volume=12 |issue=76 |doi=10.1186/s13012-017-0608-6 |pmid=28637479 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Pediatric+eMental+healthcare+technologies%3A+a+systematic+review+of+implementation+foci+in+research+studies%2C+and+government+and+organizational+documents}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wozney |first1=L |title=Implementation of eMental Health care: viewpoints from key informants from organizations and agencies with eHealth mandates |journal=BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making |date=December 2017 |volume=17 |issue=78 |doi=10.1186/s12911-017-0474-9 |pmid=28577543 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Implementation+of+eMental+Health+care%3A+viewpoints+from+key+informants+from+organizations+and+agencies+with+eHealth+mandates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programs===
There are at least five programs currently available to treat [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Several programs have been identified by the UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] as cost effective for use in primary care.&lt;ref name=NICE-CCBT/&gt; These include ''Fearfighter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fearfighter.cbtprogram.com/ |title=FearFighter |publisher=CCBT Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; a text based [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] program to treat people with phobias, and ''Beating the Blues'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatingtheblues.co.uk/|title=Beating the Blues |publisher=365 Health and Wellbeing Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt; an interactive text, cartoon and video CBT program for anxiety and depression. Two programs have been supported for use in primary care by the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} The first is ''Anxiety Online'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anxietyonline.org.au/ |title=Mental Health Online |publisher=[[Swinburne University of Technology]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; a text based program for the anxiety, depressive and eating disorders, and the second is ''THIS WAY UP'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thiswayup.org.au |title=THIS WAY UP |publisher=[[St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney|St Vincent's Hospital Sydney Limited]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of interactive text, cartoon and video programs for the anxiety and depressive disorders. Another is ''iFightDepression®''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ifightdepression.com/ |title=iFightDepression® |publisher=European Alliance Against Depression }}&lt;/ref&gt; a multilingual, free to use, web-based tool for self-management of less severe forms of depression, for use under guidance of a GP or psychotherapist.

There are a number of online programs relating to [[smoking cessation]]. ''QuitCoach''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quitcoach.org.au/ |title=QuitCoach |publisher=Quit Victoria }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a personalised quit plan based on the users response to questions regarding giving up smoking and tailored individually each time the user logs into the site. ''Freedom From Smoking''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffsonline.org/ |title=Freedom From Smoking® Online |publisher=[[American Lung Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; takes users through lessons that are grouped into modules that provide information and assignments to complete. The modules guide participants through steps such as preparing to quit smoking, stopping smoking and preventing relapse.

Other internet programs have been developed specifically as part of research into treatment for specific disorders. For example, an online self-directed therapy for [[problem gambling]] was developed to specifically test this as a method of treatment.&lt;ref name="Hodgins, D.C. 2013"/&gt; All participants were given access to a website. The treatment group was provided with behavioural and cognitive strategies to reduce or quit gambling. This was presented in the form of a workbook which encouraged participants to self-monitor their gambling by maintaining an online log of gambling and gambling urges. Participants could also use a smartphone application to collect self-monitoring information. Finally participants could also choose to receive motivational email or text reminders of their progress and goals.

An internet based intervention was also developed for use after [[Hurricane Ike]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="Ruggiero, K.J. 2012"/&gt; During this study, 1,249 disaster-affected adults were randomly recruited to take part in the intervention. Participants were given a structured interview then invited to access the web intervention using a unique password. Access to the website was provided for a four-month period. As participants accessed the site they were randomly assigned to either the intervention. those assigned to the intervention were provided with modules consisting of information regarding effective coping strategies to manage mental health and health risk behaviour.

==Cybermedicine==
Cybermedicine is the use of the [[Internet]] to deliver [[medicine|medical]] services, such as [[medical consultations]] and [[medical prescription|drug prescriptions]]. It is the successor to [[telemedicine]], wherein [[physician|doctors]] would consult and treat [[patient]]s remotely via [[telephone]] or [[fax]].

Cybermedicine is already being used in small projects where images are transmitted from a [[primary care]] setting to a [[medical specialist]], who comments on the case and suggests which intervention might benefit the patient. A field that lends itself to this approach is [[dermatology]], where images of an eruption are communicated to a hospital specialist who determines if referral is necessary.

The field has also expanded to include online "ask the doctor" services that allow patients direct, paid access to consultations (with varying degrees of depth) with medical professionals (examples include [[Bundoo|Bundoo.com]], [[Doctor Spring]], [[Teladoc]], and [[Ask The Doctor]]).

A Cyber [[Physician|Doctor]],&lt;ref name=Allday2007&gt;{{cite web|last=Allday|first=Erin|title=Online visits a boon for far-off patients|url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Online-visits-a-boon-for-far-off-patients-In-2558574.php|work=SFGate|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=27 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; known in the UK as a Cyber [[Physician]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Patrick|title=Future care to be provided by cyber doctors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/dec/07/health.healthandwellbeing|work=The Guardian|date=7 December 2000|quote=Patients' first contact with the NHS in 20 years time will be via interactive ‘cyber-physicians’ accessed through domestic television sets, according to a government-sponsored study.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a medical [[professional]] who does [[wikt:consultation|consultation]] via the internet, treating virtual patients, who may never meet face to face. This is a new area of medicine which has been utilized by the armed forces and teaching [[hospitals]] offering [[online]] consultation to patients before making their decision to travel for unique medical treatment only offered at a particular medical facility.&lt;ref name=Allday2007/&gt;

== Self-monitoring healthcare devices ==
Self-monitoring is the use of sensors or tools which are readily available to the general public to track and record personal data. The sensors are usually wearable devices and the tools are digitally available through mobile device applications. 
Self-monitoring devices were created for the purpose of allowing personal data to be instantly available to the individual to be analyzed. As of now, fitness and health monitoring are the most popular applications for self-monitoring devices.&lt;ref name="Paddock2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Paddock | first=Catharine | title=How self-monitoring is transforming health |website=Medical News Today |publisher=Healthline Media UK Ltd | date=15 August 2013 | url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/264784.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest benefit to self-monitoring devices is the elimination of the necessity for third party hospitals to run tests, which are both expensive and lengthy. These devices are an important advancement in the field of personal health management.

Self-monitoring healthcare devices exist in many forms. An example is the [[Nike+ FuelBand]], which is a modified version of the original [[pedometer]].&lt;ref name="Paddock2013"/&gt; This device is wearable on the wrist and allows one to set a personal goal for a daily energy burn. It records the calories burned and the number of steps taken for each day while simultaneously functioning as a watch. To add to the ease of the user interface, it includes both numeric and visual indicators of whether or not the individual has achieved his or her daily goal. Finally, it is also synced to an [[iPhone]] app which allows for tracking and sharing of personal record and achievements.

Other monitoring devices have more medical relevance. A well-known device of this type is the [[Blood glucose monitoring|blood glucose monitor]]. The use of this device is restricted to diabetic patients and allows users to measure the blood glucose levels in their body. It is extremely quantitative and the results are available instantaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/invitrodiagnostics/glucosetestingdevices/default.htm|title=Blood Glucose Monitoring Devices |date=22 December 2016 |website=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this device is not as independent of a self-monitoring device as the Nike+ Fuelband because it requires some [[patient education]] before use. One needs to be able to make connections between the levels of glucose and the effect of diet and exercise. In addition, the users must also understand how the treatment should be adjusted based on the results. In other words, the results are not just static measurements.

The demand for self-monitoring health devices is skyrocketing, as wireless health technologies have become especially popular in the last few years. In fact, it is expected that by 2016, self-monitoring health devices will account for 80% of wireless medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dolan |first=Brian |date=31 May 2012 |url=http://mobihealthnews.com/17498/by-2017-50m-consumer-wireless-health-devices-to-ship/|title=By 2017: 50M consumer wireless health devices to ship |website=MobiHealthNews |publisher=HIMSS Media }}&lt;/ref&gt; The key selling point for these devices is the mobility of information for consumers. The accessibility of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has increased significantly within the past decade. This has made it easier for users to access real-time information in a number of peripheral devices.

There are still many future improvements for self-monitoring healthcare devices. Although most of these wearable devices have been excellent at providing direct data to the individual user, the biggest task which remains at hand is how to effectively use this data. Although the blood glucose monitor allows the user to take action based on the results, measurements such as the pulse rate, EKG signals, and calories do not necessarily serve to actively guide an individual's personal healthcare management. Consumers are interested in qualitative feedback in addition to the quantitative measurements recorded by the devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfah.org/blog/2014/self-monitoring-health-it-falls-short-of-providing-the-information-we-need|title=Self-Monitoring Health IT Falls Short of Providing the Information We Need|first=Jessie |last=Gruman |date=16 April 2014 |website=Center for Advancing Health: Prepared Patient Blog |publisher=George Washington University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Knowledge of the socio-economic performance of eHealth is limited, and findings from evaluations are often challenging to transfer to other settings. Socio-economic evaluations of some narrow types of mHealth can rely on health economic methodologies, but larger scale eHealth may have too many variables, and tortuous, intangible cause and effect links may need a wider approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenhalgh |first1=Trisha |last2=Russell |first2=Jill |date=2 November 2010 |title=Why Do Evaluations of eHealth Programs Fail? An Alternative Set of Guiding Principles |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=7 |issue=11 |page=e1000360 |pmid=21072245 |pmc=2970573 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000360 |doi-access=free |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000360 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In developing countries ==
eHealth in general, and telemedicine in particular, is a vital resource to remote regions of emerging and developing countries but is often difficult to establish because of the lack of communications infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adesina |last=Iluyemi |date=14 April 2009 |title=Refocusing Europe-Africa Strategy: Strategic Importance of eHealth |website=SlideShare |url=https://www.slideshare.net/Adesina/euafrica-ict-forumv2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Benin, hospitals often can become inaccessible due to flooding during the rainy season&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Payer |first=Markus |publisher=SES |date=4 June 2015 |location=Luxembourg |url=http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2015/21260022|title=SES Improves Quality Healthcare Access in Benin |accessdate=26 February 2016 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305000119/http://www.ses.com/4233325/news/2015/21260022 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and across Africa, the low population density, along with severe weather conditions and the difficult financial situation in many African states, has meant that the majority of the African people are badly disadvantaged in medical care. In many regions there is not only a significant lack of facilities and trained health professionals, but also no access to eHealth because there is also no internet access in remote villages, or even a reliable electricity supply.&lt;ref name="WTA"&gt;{{cite web |first=Gerhard |last=Bethscheider |url=http://www.worldteleport.org/news/249029/Satellite-Is-Vital-For-A-Unified-Global-e-Health-System...-An-SES-Techcom-Services-Perspective-.htm |title=Satellite is vital for a unified, global, E-Health system... An SES Techcom Services Perspective |date=2 September 2015 |editor-first=Randall |editor-last=Barney |website=World Teleport Association |access-date=28 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet connectivity, and the benefits of eHealth, can be brought to these regions using [[Satellite Internet access|satellite broadband]] technology, and satellite is often the only solution where terrestrial access may be limited, or poor quality, and one that can provide a fast connection over a vast coverage area.&lt;ref name="WTA"/&gt;

[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/bod/en/index.html ''Global burden of disease'']. Geneva, WHO Health statistics and health information systems. Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a global measure of so-called [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALY's) assigned to a certain disease/disorder, which is a sum of the years lived with disability and years of life lost due to this disease within the total population.  [[Neuropsychiatry|Neuropsychiatric]] conditions account for 14% of the global burden of disease. Among [[non-communicable disease]]s, they account for 28% of the DALY's – more than [[cardiovascular disease]] or [[cancer]]. However, it is estimated that the real contribution of [[mental disorders]] to the global burden of disease is even higher, due to the complex interactions and co-morbidity of physical and mental illness.

Around the world, almost one million people die due to suicide every year, and it is the third leading cause of death among young people. The most important causes of disability due to health-related conditions worldwide include [[unipolar depression]], [[alcoholism]], [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar depression]] and [[dementia]]. In low- and middle-income countries, these conditions represent a total of 19.1% of all disability related to health conditions.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/mental_health/policy/mhtargeting/development_targeting_mh_summary.pdf ''Mental Health and Development: Targeting People with Mental Health Conditions as Vulnerable Group''.] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatment gap ==
It is estimated that one in four people in the world will be affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/whr/2001/media_centre/press_release/en/index.html ''Mental disorders affect one in four people.''] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although many effective interventions for the treatment of mental disorders are known, and awareness of the need for treatment of people with mental disorders has risen, the proportion of those who need mental health care but who do not receive it remains very high.  This so-called "treatment gap" is estimated to reach between 76–85% for low- and middle-income countries, and 35–50% for high-income countries.

Despite the acknowledged need, for the most part there have not been substantial changes in mental health care delivery during the past years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turekian|first1=Vaughan|title=Mental Health Diplomacy|journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy|date=2014-06-23|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/editorial/2014/mental-health-diplomacy-building-global-response}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main reasons for this problem are public health priorities, lack of a mental health policy and legislation in many countries, a lack of resources – financial and human resources – as well as inefficient resource allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61263-X|title=Barriers to improvement of mental health services in low-income and middle-income countries|journal=The Lancet|volume=370|issue=9593|pages=1164–1174|year=2007|last1=Saraceno|first1=Benedetto|last2=Van Ommeren|first2=Mark|last3=Batniji|first3=Rajaie|last4=Cohen|first4=Alex|last5=Gureje|first5=Oye|last6=Mahoney|first6=John|last7=Sridhar|first7=Devi|last8=Underhill|first8=Chris | pmid = 17804061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the World Health Organization estimated a shortage of 1.18 million [[mental health professional]]s, including 55,000 psychiatrists, 628,000
nurses in mental health settings, and 493,000 psychosocial care providers needed to treat mental disorders in 144 low- and middle-income countries. The annual wage bill to remove this [[Health Human Resources|health workforce]] shortage was estimated at about US$4.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffler RM et al. (2011). [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501019_eng.pdf ''Human resources for mental health: workforce shortages in low- and middle-income countries'']. Geneva, World Health Organization Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interventions ==
Information and evidence about cost-effective interventions to provide better mental health care are available.  Although most of the research (80%) has been carried out in high-income countries, there is also strong evidence from low- and middle-income countries that [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] and [[psychosocial]] interventions are effective ways to treat mental disorders, with the strongest evidence for depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hazardous alcohol use.

Recommendations to strengthen mental health systems around the world have been first mentioned in the WHO's [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2001'']],&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2001) [http://www.who.int/whr/2001/en/index.html ''The world health report 2001 – Mental Health: New Understanding, New Hope'']. Geneva, WHO Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which focused on mental health:

# Provide treatment in primary care
# Make [[psychotropic drug]]s available
# Give care in the community
# Educate the public
# Involve communities, families and consumers
# Establish national policies, programs and [[legislation]]
# Develop [[Health Human Resources|human resources]]
# Link with other sectors
# Monitor community mental health
# Support more research

Based on the data of 12 countries, assessed by the ''WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems'' (WHO-AIMS),&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization: [http://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/WHO-AIMS/en/''Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems''.] Accessed 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the costs of scaling up mental health services by providing a core treatment package for schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depressive episodes and hazardous alcohol use have been estimated. Structural changes in mental health systems according to the WHO recommendations have been taken into account.

For most countries, this model suggests an initial period of investment of US$0.30 – 0.50 per person per year. The total expenditure on mental health would have to rise at least ten-fold in low-income countries. In those countries, additional financial resources will be needed, while in middle- and high-income countries the main challenge will be the reallocation of resources within the health system to provide better mental health service.

==Prevention==

Prevention is beginning to appear in mental health strategies, including the 2004 WHO report "Prevention of Mental Disorders", the 2008 EU "Pact for Mental Health" and the 2011 US National Prevention Strategy. NIMH or the National Institute of Mental Health has over 400 grants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/research-areas/index.shtml|title=NIMH » Research Areas|website=www.nimh.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stakeholders==

=== World Health Organization (WHO) ===

Two of WHO's core programmes for mental health are WHO MIND (Mental health improvements for Nations Development) and Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP).

WHO MIND focuses on 5 areas of action to ensure concrete changes in people's daily lives.  These are:
#  Action in and support to countries to improve mental health, such as the WHO Pacific Island Mental Health network (PIMHnet)
#  Mental health policy, planning and service development
#  Mental health human rights and legislation
#  Mental health as a core part of human development
#  The QualityRights Project which works to unite and empower people to improve the quality of care and promote human rights in mental health facilities and social care homes.

Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) is WHO’s action plan to scale up services for mental, neurological and substance use disorders for countries especially with low and lower middle incomes. The aim of mhGAP is to build partnerships for collective action and to reinforce the commitment of governments, international organizations and other stakeholders.

The mhGAP Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) was launched in October 2010.  It is a technical tool for the management of mental, neurological and substance use disorders in non-specialist health settings.  The priority conditions included are: depression, psychosis, bipolar disorders, epilepsy, developmental and behavioural disorders in children and adolescents, dementia, alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, self-harm/suicide and other significant emotional or medically unexplained complaints.

== Criticism ==

One of the most prominent critics of the Movement for Global Mental Health has been China Mills, author of the book ''Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World''.

Mills writes that:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Mills, China. [https://www.academia.edu/4905979/Decolonizing_Global_Mental_Health_The_Psychiatrization_of_the_Majority_World Decolonizing Global Mental Health: The Psychiatrization of the Majority World]. Retrieved October 17, 2014, from&lt;/ref&gt;

[[periodontitis|Apical periodontitis]] is typically the body’s defense response to the threat of microbial invasion from the [[root canal]].&lt;ref name="Lopez-Marcos, JF. Aetiology pages 58-62"&gt;Lopez-Marcos, JF. Aetiology, classification and pathogenesis of pulp and periapical disease, ''Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal'' 2004 9:Suppl pages 58-62, 52-7.&lt;/ref&gt;   Primary among the members of the host defense mechanism is the polymorphonuclear [[leukocyte]], otherwise known as the [[neutrophil]].  The task of the neutrophil is to locate and destroy [[microbe]]s that intrude into the [[human anatomy|body]] – anywhere in the body – and they represent the hallmark of acute [[inflammation]].&lt;ref&gt;Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The body's response to microbial invasion==
[[File:Chronic apical periodontitis (with arrows).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tooth #5, the upper right first premolar, after extraction.  The two single-headed arrows point to the [[Cementoenamel junction|CEJ]], which is the line separating the [[crown (tooth)|crown]] (in this case, heavily decayed) and the roots.  The double headed arrow (bottom right) shows the extent of the abscess that surrounds the apex of the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|palatal]] root.]]
In response to tissue [[injury]], neutrophils leave the [[circulatory system]] in great numbers and gather at the site of tissue injury.  They are drawn to the site by [[chemotaxis]], following a [[concentration gradient]] of chemotactic [[molecule]]s until they reach the site of greatest concentration: the site of injury and microbial presence.  Once there, the [[antimicrobial]] action of [[superoxide]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]], derived from the [[metabolism|metabolic processes]] of the neutrophils, act to combat the microbial invasion.  While primarily mobilized to kill the invading [[microorganism]]s, the neutrophils actually cause a significant amount of host tissue damage as well.  Although the neutrophils themselves rarely remain alive for more than a few days, the excessive accumulation of dead neutrophils and the [[enzyme]]s they released is a major cause of tissue breakdown in the acute phases of apical [[periodontitis]].&lt;ref name="Raven, PH 1999"&gt;Raven, PH, Johnson, GB. ''Biology'', 5th Edition. Boston: McGraw-Hill Companies, 1999. page 1072.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after inflammation has been initiated, [[macrophage]]s enter the scene and, if not controlled by the initial ambush of neutrophils and their tactics, the microbial invasion is faced with a second strike consisting of these [[leukocyte]]s, along with [[lymphocyte]]s.  Together, the cells of this second strike compose the bulk of the apical periodontitis lesion and serve an important role in the subsequent chronic phase of inflammation of apical periodontitis, as they can live for many months.&lt;ref name="Raven, PH 1999"/&gt;   Some researchers posit that it must not be macrophages that are involved, as they could not appropriately discriminate between the varied array of [[opson]]ized entities as necessary, and that, in reality, the properties ascribed to the macrophage in the initiation phase of the inflammatory response actually belong to the lymphatic [[dendritic cell]].  It is unclear, however, if the latter is a distinct population of cells or if it is merely a particularly specialized strain of macrophage.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, MH, ''Histology: A Text and Atlas'', 3rd Edition. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 1995. page 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[infection]]s such as these occur elsewhere in the body, the [[immune system|host defense system]], able to travel the body via the circulatory system, is, more often than not, capable of appropriately gaining access to the site of infection in order to mount a proper and successful retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, MH, ''Histology: A Text and Atlas'', 3rd Edition. Philadelphia: Lippincott, Williams and Wilkins, 1995. page 315.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dental pulp]], which is a richly [[blood supply|vascularized]] and [[nerve|innervated]] tissue, is enclosed by tissues, such as [[dentin]], which are incapable of expanding. It has terminal blood flow and possesses only small-gauge circulatory access at the [[apical foramen]]. All of these characteristics severely constrain the defensive capacity of the pulp tissue when faced with the different aggressions to which it may be subjected.&lt;ref&gt;Lopez-Marcos, JF. Aetiology, classification and pathogenesis of pulp and periapical disease, ''Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal'' 2004, 9:Suppl, 58-62, 52-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Castellucci, A page 160"&gt;Castellucci, A, Blumenkranz, U: Periapical Disease.  In Castellucci, A, editor: ''Endodontics'', Volume 1, Las Vegas: Las Vegas Institute, page 160.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, [[necrosis|necrotic tissue]] located within the pulp chamber and canals provide nutrients for [[pathology|pathogenic]] [[bacteria]] to grow and form a periapical lesion;&lt;ref&gt;Fidel, RAS. Complicated crown fracture: a case report, ''Braz Dent J'' 2006 17:1 pages 83-86.&lt;/ref&gt;  the infected tooth serves as a biochemically and physiologically ideal location for bacterial growth and maturation, and, in essence, acts as a [[Safety|refuge]] from which bacterial reinforcements can mobilize to the periapical lesion.&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, JC 2002. page 501"&gt;Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 501.&lt;/ref&gt;   It is this concept that serves as the basis for conventional [[endodontic therapy]]; both chemical and mechanical [[debridement]] procedures are essential in effectively disrupting and removing the microbial [[ecosystem]] that is associated with the [[disease]] process.&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, JC 2002. page 501"/&gt;   Thus, whenever a pulp is removed and the canal treated and filled in a manner that is compatible with or favorable to a [[physiology|physiologic]] reaction, we may expect a satisfactory percentage of [[endodontics|endodontic]] success.&lt;ref&gt;Blayney, JR: JADA 15:1217-1221, 1928, quoted by Lovdahl, PE, Gutmann, JL: Problems in Nonsurgical Root Canal Retreatment.  In Gutmann, JL, editor: ''Problem Solving in Endodontics'', 3rd Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 1997, page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Breakthrough in [[bacteriology]]==
In 1890, W.D. Miller, considered the father of oral [[microbiology]], was the first to associate pulpal disease with the presence of [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Sgan-Cohen, H.D. Oral hygiene: past history and future recommendations. ''Int J Dent Hyg'' 2005 3:2 pages 54–58.&lt;/ref&gt;   This was confirmed by Kakehashi, who, in 1965, proved that bacteria were the cause of pulpal and periradicular disease in studies using [[animal model]]s; pulpal exposures were initiated in both normal and [[Asepsis|germ-free]] [[rat]]s, and while no pathologic changes were exhibited in the [[mouth]]s of the germ-free rats, introduction of the normal oral microbial [[flora]] produced pulpal [[necrosis]] and led to periradicular [[lesion]] formation in the normal rats.&lt;ref name="Kak"&gt;Kakehashi, S.  The effects of surgical exposures of dental pulps in germ-free and conventional laboratory rats. ''Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol'' 1965 Sep 20 pages 340-349.&lt;/ref&gt;   The germ-free rats healed regardless of the severity of pulpal exposure, demonstrating that the presence or absence of bacteria was the determinant for pulpal and periapical disease.&lt;ref name="Kak"/&gt;

Moreover, it has since been discovered that endodontic infections are polymicrobial.  In fact, the bacteria present within endodontic infections are thoroughly similar to the bacteria that are involved in [[periodontal disease]].  It has also been shown that certain [[enzyme]]s produced by bacteria are detrimental to the host, and can work in concert with the destructive capability of the enzymes released by dying neutrophils.  Recent studies have revealed that the gene for [[collagenase]]s could be detected in stains of ''[[Porphyromonas gingivalis]]'', one of the many endodontic infective agents that are also involved in periodontal disease.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it has been proven that a positive correlation exists between the number of bacteria in an infected [[root canal]] and the size of the resultant periradicular [[radiodensity|radiolucency]].&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 503.&lt;/ref&gt;

In attempting to resolve a periapical lesion of endodontic origin, it is essential to be conscious of these principles in order to effectively combat the infection.  Without proper consideration for the causes, the pulpal and periapical infection cannot be suitably treated, for effective patient management requires the correct [[diagnosis]] and removal of the cause of the infection of endodontic origin to correct the associated periapical lesion.  Because periapical disease is almost inevitably preceded by pulp disease,&lt;ref name="Lopez-Marcos, JF. Aetiology pages 58-62"/&gt; proper chemomechanical debridement of the infected root canals, together with [[incision and drainage]] of associated periradicular swellings, will usually allow for rapid improvement in patient [[signs and symptoms]].&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, JC 2002. page 511"&gt;Baumgarten, JC, Hutter, JW: Endodontic Microbiology and Treatment of Infections.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 511.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same end can be accomplished by [[dental extraction|extracting]] the involved [[tooth]].&lt;ref name="Castellucci, A page 160"/&gt;

==Source of infection==
Although periapical changes will be in response to pulpal changes the majority of the time, it is still important to determine the disease process sequence.  When the disease process is of pulpal origin, the pulpal infection and necrosis may drain not only through the apical foramen, but also through an accessory canal, which may present radiographically as a periradicular or [[Furcation defect|furcation radiolucency]].  This may further lead to furcal involvement through loss of clinical attachment and [[alveolar bone]].  A cursory clinical examination and radiographic analysis can easily lead the [[clinician]] off the right course and pulpal involvement might be overlooked when the tooth is asymptomatic.  Similarly, a [[Abscesses of the periodontium|periodontal abscess]] may very well appear to be pulpal in origin, when in fact it is not.  Notwithstanding the tissue of origin, though, when it is determined that there is a pulpal involvement to the periodontal lesion, the endodontic infection should be controlled prior to beginning definitive management of the periodontal lesion, especially when regenerative or [[bone graft|bone grafting techniques]] are planned.&lt;ref&gt;Novak, J: Classification of Diseases and Conditions Affecting the Periodontium.  In Newman, MG, editor: ''Carranza’s Clinical Periodontology'', 9th Edition. Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders Company, 2002. page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focusing on proper procedure==
To achieve [[healing]] of the periapical lesion, one must obtain and maintain a [[Sterilization (microbiology)|decontaminated]] [[root canal|root canal system]].  ''System'' is to be emphasized, because the root canal system does not merely consist of tapering cone-shaped canals from [[Body orifice|orifice]] to [[wikt:apex|apex]], but rather, can and often is an intricate [[labyrinth]] of canals that diverge and weave to form an elaborate web of anastomosing passages.&lt;ref&gt;Gutmann, JL, Witherspoon DE: Obturation of the Cleaned and Shaped Root Canal System.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. pages 296, 332 and 349.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is precisely because of this reality that “it is important to appreciate that files produce shape, but it is essential to understand that irrigants clean [the] root canal system.&lt;ref&gt;Ruddle, CJ: Cleaning and Shaping the Root Canal System.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 235.&lt;/ref&gt;  Copious amounts of [[sodium hypochlorite]] are necessary to utterly dissolve all remnants of pulp tissue as well as completely destroy all [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ruddle, CJ: Cleaning and Shaping the Root Canal System.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The tooth stability does not undergo major changes after surgery comparated with the initial value which was determined before establishing any kind of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Conventional therapy===
Many authoritative clinicians and [[research]]ers advise&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, JC 2002. page 511"/&gt; completing [[endodontic therapy]] as soon as possible, especially in situations necessitating incision and drainage, in order to remove the cause of infection without delay.  Recent studies have shown, however, that intracanal application of certain [[medicament]]s prior to the completion of endodontic therapy may produce highly favorable results when followed by conventional therapy, even when the periapical area is very large. The use of [[chlorhexidine gluconate]] and [[calcium hydroxide]] for [[infection control]] was shown to lead to substantial healing of a large periapical lesion.&lt;ref&gt;Öztan, M.D. Endodontic treatment of teeth associated with a large periapical lesion, ''Int Endo J'' Jan 2002 35:1 pages 73-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional thought that it is necessary to complete endodontic therapy as quickly as possible may be related only to the initial steps of therapy, namely, a thorough instrumentation, thus ensuring a proper biomechanical preparation.  While completion of the procedure with immediate obturation might secure the decontaminated root canal system, delaying this step in order to allow for application of medicaments has been shown to be beneficial.  Periodic application and renewal of calcium hydroxide over a year’s time (four applications over a 12-month period), has been shown to represent a nonsurgical approach to resolving even extensive inflammatory periapical lesions.&lt;ref&gt;Soares, J. Nonsurgical treatment of extensive cyst-like periapical lesion of endodontic origin, ''Int Endo J'' Jul 2006 39:7 pages 566-575.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antibiotic coverage===
The use of adjunctive [[antibiotics]] is usually uncalled for when proper debridement procedures can be executed in a conventional periapical lesion of endodontic origin; however, they can be centrally important to the treatment of a progressive or persistent infection.&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, JC 2002. page 511"/&gt;  It has been proposed, however, that disinfection of the root canal by means of an antibacterial agent, such as [[propolis]]&lt;ref&gt;Hajdaragic-Ibricevic, H. The effects of propolis on the reparative processes of the pulp and histological analysis of the pulp 28 days after artificial exposure and covering with propolis, ''Stomatol Vjesn'' 1983 12:3-4 pages 111-114.&lt;/ref&gt;  or [[otosporin]], can lead to improved healing by reducing and controlling pulpal and periapical inflammatory reactions.  This would, in turn, promote the healing process as well as provide for better control, prevention and reduction of post-treatment [[pain]] and discomfort.&lt;ref&gt;da Silva, Fabiane B. Natural medicaments in endodontics - a comparative study of the anti-inflammatory action, ''Braz Oral Res'' June 2004 18:2 pages 174-179.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biologic mediators==
There are a number of active biologic mediators that have been implicated in promoting apical resorption.  [[Matrix metalloproteinase]]s (MMPs), which are [[endogenous]] zinc-dependent [[catabolism|catabolic]] [[enzyme]]s, are primarily responsible for the degradation of much of the tissue matrices built on such architecturally important substances as [[collagen]] and [[proteoglycan]] core proteins.  Their biologic activities have been extensively researched and reviewed, and their importance in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis is obvious.  Furthermore, concentrations of IgG [[antibodies]] have been found to be nearly five times higher in lesions of apical periodontitis than in uninflamed [[oral mucosa]].&lt;ref name="Nair, PNR 2002. page 470"&gt;Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 470.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prostaglandins]], specifically PGE2 and PGI2, are important in [[inflammation]] and have been implicated in promoting apical resorption.  This is because [[neutrophil]]s, which are rich sources of PGE2, are present when the majority of rapid bone loss occurs during the initial stages of apical periodontitis.  It has been illustrated clinically that [[parenteral]] administration of [[indomethacin]], an inhibitor of [[cyclooxygenase]], can act to suppress resorption of apical hard tissue.&lt;ref name="Nair, PNR 2002. page 470"/&gt;

The predominant mechanism of bone resorption in a periapical lesion, as in the rest of the body, is the performed by [[osteoclast]]s.  In the periapical lesion, mediators that are normally produced primarily only by [[osteoblast]]s are released by many other cells as well, overstimulating proosteoclasts.  As a result, these begin to proliferate and several cells fuse to form [[multinucleated giant cell]]s capable of spreading over the infected, injured site and cause resorption of the periapical [[alveolar bone]].&lt;ref&gt;Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endodontic success and failure==
[[Image:-30partialendo.JPG|280px|thumb|right|Tooth #30, the lower right first molar, with incomplete endodontic therapy: the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|mesial]] roots were left untreated, as can be evidences by the lack of [[gutta percha]] in the canals.  This tooth requires retreatment to prevent a future infection from the non-treated canals.]]
It is possible that after conventional [[endodontic therapy]] has been completed, little to no resolution of the periapical lesion occurs over a considerable amount of time; there is a great deal of current research that discusses the possible reasons for this outcome and suggests possible treatment options.  For example, it has been demonstrated that there is an association between nonresolving apical periodontitis lesions and the presence of [[cholesterol cleft]]s within the periapical lesion; in fact, an incidence of up to 44% has been reported!  It was shown that [[macrophage]]s joined to form multinucleated giant cells and then produced a well-circumscribed area of tissue reaction, not unlike the [[granuloma|granulomatous tissue reactions]] of a typical [[Foreign body granuloma|foreign body reaction]], and persisted for up to 8 months.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 482.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, endodontic materials as well as food debris may also be the cause of persistent periapical lesions.  It was once shown that contaminated [[gutta percha]] resulted in a persistent periapical lesion for more than a [[decade]]!&lt;ref&gt;Nair, PNR: Pathobiology of the Periapex.  In Cohen, S. Burns, RC, editors: ''Pathways of the Pulp'', 8th Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 2002. page 486.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-surgical endodontic retreatment therapy==
For retreatment of a non-healing lesion, there is really no magical method that can be employed; the course of action is merely to achieve what was supposed to have been achieved the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Lovdahl, PE, Gutmann, JL: Problems in Nonsurgical Root Canal Retreatment.  In Gutmann, JL, editor: ''Problem Solving in Endodontics'', 3rd Edition. St. Louis: Mosby, Inc. 1997, page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  Keeping in mind the notion that endodontic retreatment is a problem-solving exploit will substantially increase its success.

After endodontic therapy has been executed, or re-executed, successfully, and the canals can no longer provide a nutrient-rich [[habitat]] for [[microbe]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Fidel, Rivail A.S., Complicated crown fracture: a case report, ''Braz Dent J'' 2006 17:1 pages 83-86.&lt;/ref&gt; the issue of bone healing comes into focus.  Ostensibly, then, for [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] to occur, the root canal system must have been decontaminated and further access to microbial invasion must be prohibited.   Regeneration of the bone has been demonstrated to occur, on average, at a rate of 3.2&amp;nbsp;mm² per month, and studies suggest that 71% of lesions have achieved complete resolution one year post-operatively.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, WK, Healing of periapical radiolucencies after nonsurgical endodontic therapy, ''Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol'' 1991 May;71(5):620-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Situations in which a surgical form of retreatment had been selected and in which apical resolution has still not occurred may still benefit from additional [[surgery|surgical intervention]].  A comparison of the outcome of periradicular surgery in [[teeth]] that had previously undergone surgical treatment versus teeth that were undergoing a surgical procedure for the first time showed that, after 5 years, 86% of surgically treated teeth healed with complete bone filling of the surgical cavity while only 59% of resurgically treated teeth healed with complete bone filling.  It has thus been demonstrated that surgical retreatment of teeth previously treated with surgery is a valid alternative to extraction.&lt;ref&gt;Gagliani, M. Periapical resurgery versus periapical surgery: a 5-year longitudinal comparison. ''Int Endo J'' May 2005 38:5 pages 320-327.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a combination of three antibiotics (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline) in a paste has been used successfully to treat these lesions non-surgically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US National Library of Medicine: Nonsurgical healing of large periradicular lesions using a triple antibiotic paste|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3220065/|accessdate=13 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24003">'''Health impact assessment''' ('''HIA''') is defined as "a combination of procedures, methods, and tools by
which a policy, program, or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the
[[Population health|health of a population]], and the [[statistical distribution|distribution]] of those effects within the population." {{Harv|ECHP|1999|p=4}}

==Overview==
HIA is intended to produce a set of [[evidence]]-based recommendations to inform [[decision-making]] {{Harv|Taylor|Quigley|2002|p=2}}. HIA seeks to maximise the positive [[health]] impacts and minimise the negative health impacts of proposed [[policies]], programs or [[projects]].

The procedures of HIA are similar to those used in other forms of [[impact assessment]], such as [[environmental impact assessment]] or [[social impact assessment]]. HIA is usually described as following the steps listed, though many practitioners break these into sub-steps or label them differently:

# ''Screening'' - determining if an HIA is warranted/required
# ''Scoping'' - determining which impacts will be considered and the plan for the HIA
# ''Identification and assessment of impacts'' - determining the magnitude, nature, extent and likelihood of potential health impacts, using a variety of different methods and types of information
# ''Decision-making and recommendations'' - making explicit the trade-offs to be made in decision-making and formulating evidence-informed recommendations
# ''Evaluation, monitoring and follow-up'' - process and impact [[evaluation]] of the HIA and the monitoring and management of health impacts

The main objective of HIA is to apply existing knowledge and evidence about health impacts, to specific social and community contexts, to develop evidence-based recommendations that inform decision-making in order to protect and improve [[community health]] and [[wellbeing]]. Because of financial and time constraints, HIAs do not generally involve new research or the generation of original scientific knowledge. However, the findings of HIAs, especially where these have been monitored and evaluated over time, can be used to inform other HIAs in contexts that are similar. An HIA's recommendations may focus on both [[design]] and [[operational]] aspects of a proposal.

HIA has also been identified as a mechanism by which potential [[health inequalities]] can be identified and redressed prior to the implementation of proposed policy, program or project {{Harv|Acheson|1998}}.

A number of manuals and guidelines for HIA's use have been developed (see [[#Further reading|further reading]]).

==Determinants of health==
The proposition that policies, programs and projects have the potential to change the [[determinants of health]] underpins HIA's use. Changes to health determinants then leads to changes in health outcomes or the health status of individuals and communities. The determinants of health are largely [[Social environment|environmental]] and [[social]], so that there are many overlaps with [[environmental impact assessment]] and [[social impact assessment]].

==Levels of HIA==
Three forms of HIA exist:

* Desk-based HIA, which takes 2–6 weeks for one assessor to complete and provides a broad overview of potential health impacts;
* Rapid HIA, which takes approximately 12 weeks for one assessor to complete and provides more detailed information on potential health impacts; and
* Comprehensive HIA, which takes approximately 6 months for one assessor and provides a in-depth assessment of potential health impacts. {{Harv|IMPACT|2004|p=7}}

It has been suggested that HIAs can be prospective (done before a proposal is implemented), concurrent (done while the proposal is being implemented) or retrospective (done after a proposal has been implemented) {{Harv|Taylor|Gorman|Quigley|2003|p=1}}. This remains controversial, however, with a number of HIA practitioners suggesting that concurrent HIA is better regarded as a monitoring activity and that retrospective HIA is more akin to [[evaluation]] with a health focus, rather than being assessment per se {{Harv|Kemm|2003|p=387}}. Prospective HIA is preferred as it allows the maximum practical opportunity to influence decision-making and subsequent health impacts.

==HIA practitioners==
HIA practitioners can be found in the private and public sectors, but are relatively few in number. There are no universally accepted competency frameworks or certification processes. It is suggested that a lead practitioner should have extensive education and training in a health related field, experience of participating in HIAs, and have attended an HIA training course. It has been suggested and widely accepted that merely having a medical or health degree should not be regarded as an indication of competency.

==HIA worldwide==
HIA is currently being used or developed around the world, most notably in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Africa]] and [[Thailand]].

The new safeguard policies and standards of the [[International Finance Corporation]] (IFC), part of the [[World Bank]], were established in 2006. These contain a requirement for health impact assessment in large projects. The standards have been accepted by most of the leading lending banks who are parties to the [[Equator Principles]]. Health impact assessments are becoming routine in many large development projects in both public and private sectors of developing countries. There is also a long history of health impact assessment in the water resource development sector - large dams and irrigation systems.

==HIA conferences==
The [http://www.unige.ch/medecine/eis2013/accueil_en.html 13th International HIA Conference] was held in [[Geneva]] in 2013.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20120327020826/http://www.hia2012.ca/en/home.aspx 12th International HIA Conference] was held in [[Québec City]] in 2012.

Since the early days of [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]], his physical and mental [[health]] have been a subject of public debate. Trump was seventy years old when he took office, surpassing [[Ronald Reagan]] as the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|oldest person to assume the presidency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-oldest-president-us-history-2016-11|title=Donald Trump is oldest president elected in US history|publisher=Business Insider|date=November 9, 2016|accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comments on his age, weight and lifestyle have raised questions about his physical health. In addition, numerous public figures, media sources, and mental health professionals have speculated that [[Donald Trump]] may have [[mental health]] challenges, ranging from [[narcissistic personality disorder]] to some form of [[dementia]]. Trump and his supporters have denied these allegations, and have contested the authority and motives of persons making such claims.

== Physical health ==
=== Medical reports ===
In December 2015, Trump's personal physician, [[Harold Bornstein]], released a superlative-laden letter of health praising Trump for "extraordinary physical strength and stamina".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/Health_Record.pdf |title=Statement on Donald J. Trump record of health |first=Harold |last=Bornstein |date=December 4, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204090045/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/images/uploads/Health_Record.pdf |archive-date=February 4, 2016 |access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bornstein later said that Trump himself had dictated the contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Alex |last1=Marquardt |first2=Lawrence |last2=Crook III |title=Bornstein claims Trump dictated the glowing health letter |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/politics/harold-bornstein-trump-letter/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=May 1, 2018 |access-date=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A followup medical report showed Trump's blood pressure, liver and thyroid functions to be in normal ranges, and that he takes a [[statin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sam |last=Frizell |url=https://time.com/4495117/donald-trump-doctors-letter/ |title=Donald Trump's Doctor's Letter Reveals He is Overweight, But 'In Excellent Health' |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=September 15, 2016 |access-date=April 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/us/politics/donald-trump-health.html |title=A Doctor's Assessment of Whether Donald Trump's Health Is 'Excellent' |work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Lawrence K. |last=Altman |date=September 18, 2016 |access-date=October 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Trump was examined by White House physician [[Ronny Jackson]], who stated that he was in excellent health, although his weight and cholesterol level were higher than recommended,&lt;ref name=time-20180117&gt;{{cite news| url=https://time.com/5105096/donald-trump-physical-exam-transcript/ |first=Jamie |last=Ducharme |title=The White House Doctor Called President Trump's Health 'Excellent.' Here's the Full Summary of His Physical Exam |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=January 17, 2018 |access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that his cardiac assessment revealed no medical issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump's first full presidential physical exam, explained |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/1/11/16863254/trump-physical-exam-mental-health |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |first1=Eliza |last1=Barclay |first2=Julia |last2=Belluz |date=January 16, 2018 |access-date=January 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several outside cardiologists commented that Trump's weight, lifestyle and [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL cholesterol]] ought to have raised serious concerns about his cardiac health.&lt;ref name=nyt-20180117&gt;{{cite news |first1=Michael D. |last1=Shear |first2=Gina |last2=Kolata |title=Trump's Physical Revealed Serious Heart Concerns, Outside Experts Say |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/us/politics/trump-physical-heart-health-cholesterol.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 17, 2018 |access-date=June 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alcohol abstinence ===
Trump does not drink alcohol;&lt;ref name=time-20180117 /&gt; this decision arose in part from watching his older brother [[Fred Trump Jr.|Fred Jr.]] suffer from alcoholism that contributed to his early death in 1981.&lt;ref name=nytimesalc&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/03/us/politics/for-donald-trump-lessons-from-a-brothers-suffering.html |title=For Donald Trump, Lessons From a Brother's Suffering |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |last=Horowitz |first=Jason |date=January 2, 2016 |access-date=July 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=McAfee |first=Tierney |url=https://www.people.com/article/donald-trump-brother-fred-death-alcoholism |title=Donald Trump Opens Up About His Brother's Death from Alcoholism: It Had a "Profound Impact on My Life" |magazine=[[People (magazine)|''People'']] |date=October 8, 2015 |quote=[T]here are a few hard and fast principles that he himself lives by: no drugs, no cigarettes and no alcohol. Trump's abstinence from alcohol was largely shaped by the death of his brother, Fred Jr., from alcoholism in 1981.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed drugs, including marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Part 2: Donald Trump on 'Watters' World' |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fN5OLqxNqc |access-date=September 4, 2016 |work=Watters' World |publisher=Fox News Channel |date=February 6, 2016 |quote=WATTERS: "Have you ever smoked weed?"

This is almost like, it's almost like 'Hey, it's a sign'. No, I have never. I have never smoked a cigarette, either."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Records ===
On May 1, 2018, Bornstein told [[NBC News]] that three Trump representatives had "raided" his office on February 3, 2017, taking all of Trump's medical records. He identified two of the men as Trump's longtime bodyguard [[Keith Schiller]] and the Trump Organization's chief legal officer Alan Garten.&lt;ref name="Schechter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-doc-says-trump-bodyguard-lawyer-raided-his-office-took-n870351|title=Trump doctor Harold Bornstein says bodyguard, lawyer 'raided' his office, took medical files|last=Schechter|first=Anna R.|date=May 1, 2018|work=NBC News|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days earlier, Bornstein had told a reporter that Trump took a prescription hair growth medicine, [[Propecia]], after which Trump cut ties with him.&lt;ref name="Schechter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Altman|first1=Lawrence|title=Donald Trump’s Longtime Doctor Says President Takes Hair-Growth Drug|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/us/politics/trump-prostate-drug-hair-harold-bornstein.html|accessdate=February 2, 2017|date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mental health ==
=== Allegations of mental illness ===
As early as November 2015, ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' reported the opinion of a number of mental health experts that Trump had "[t]extbook narcissistic personality disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/donald-trump-narcissism-therapists|title=Is Donald Trump Actually a Narcissist? Therapists Weigh In!|first=Henry|last=Alford|publisher=''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''|date=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bornstein's letter of December 2015, drafted in response to questions about the health of presidential candidates, did not address Trump's mental health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2015/12/14/opinions/vox-trump-medical-fitness/index.html|title=Is Trump in the most 'astonishingly excellent' health of any candidate ever?|first=Ford|last=Vox|publisher=CNN|date=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while claiming that he would be "the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/bornstein-trump-linguistics/497840/|title=The Bizarre Words of Donald Trump’s Doctor|last=Hamblin|first=James|date=August 31, 2016|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bornstein disclosed in 2018 that Trump had dictated this letter over the telephone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/01/politics/harold-bornstein-trump-letter/index.html|title=Exclusive: Bornstein claims Trump dictated the glowing health letter|date=May 1, 2018|work=CNN|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said: "Mr. Trump dictated the letter and I would tell him what he couldn't put in there."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43970908|title=Trump wrote own health letter, doctor says|date=May 2, 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=May 2, 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, Bornstein stated that Trump's "health is excellent, especially his mental health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-doctor-wrote-health-letter-just-5-minutes-limo-waited-n638526|title=Trump Doctor Wrote Health Letter in Just 5 Minutes as Limo Waited|date=August 26, 2016|work=NBC News|accessdate=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, presidential candidate [[Jeb Bush]] speculated that Trump had mental health issues, stating "I'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but the guy needs therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/02/jeb-bush-says-donald-trump-needs-therapy-new-hampshire/|title=Jeb Bush on Trump: I'm no shrink, "but he needs therapy"|publisher=''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]''|date=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/140702/medical-theory-donald-trumps-bizarre-behavior|title=A Medical Theory for Donald Trump’s Bizarre Behavior|publisher=''New Republic''|date=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2017, psychologist [[John Gartner (psychologist)|John Gartner]] collected more than 25,000 signatures of mental health professionals on a petition, directed to the national opposition leader, Democratic Senator [[Chuck Schumer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2017/02/19/psychologist-calls-on-colleagues-to-sign-petition-for-trumps-removal/#52fd90e264f3|title=The Trump Psych Debate: Is It Wrong To Say He's Mentally Ill?|first=Emily|last=Willingham|publisher=''Forbes''}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of April 2017 he was able to forward the petition with more than 41,000 signatures  of mental healthcare professionals to [[Washington D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world-0/donald-trump-dangerous-mental-illness-yale-psychiatrist-conference-us-president-unfit-james-gartner-a7694316.html|title=35 psychiatrists just met at Yale to warn Donald Trump has a 'dangerous mental illness'|publisher=''The Independent''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the petition stated: ''My professional judgement is that Donald Trump manifests a serious mental illness that renders him  psychologically incapable of competently discharging the duties of President of the United States. And I respectfully request him [sic] be removed from office, according to article 3 of the 25th Amendment, and so on''. Gartner asserted that Trump's mental handicaps are a mix of 1. [[narcissism]], 2. [[paranoia]]; 3. [[sociopathy]]; and 4. a dash of [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadism]].

On April 14, 2017, Representatives [[Jamie Raskin]] and [[Earl Blumenauer]] introduced the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|115|H.R.|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would replace the Cabinet as the body that, together with the Vice President, determines whether to invoke Section 4 of the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which permits removal of a President who is mentally incapacitated. Under the bill, an eleven-member commission, including four psychiatrists, would conduct an examination of the President when directed to do so by a [[concurrent resolution]] of the Congress.&lt;ref name=Marcos&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House Democrat introduces bill to amend presidential removal procedures|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/329206-house-democrat-introduces-bill-to-amend-presidential-removal-procedures|accessdate=July 1, 2017|publisher=The Hill|date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/opinion/trump-unfit-goldwater-rule.html|title=Who Decides Whether Trump Is Unfit to Govern?|first1=Peter D.|last1=Kramer|first2=Sally L.|last2=Satel|publisher=''The New York Times''|date=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blumenauer stated:

{{quote|It is hard to imagine a better group to work with the vice president to examine whether the president is able to discharge the duties of the office. When there are questions about the president’s ability to fulfill his or her constitutional responsibilities, it is in the country's best interest to have a mechanism in place that works effectively.&lt;ref name=Marcos/&gt;}}

In January 2018, North Korea's leader [[Kim Jong-un]] and Trump publicly exchanged claims about their respective "nuclear buttons". In reaction, [[Richard W. Painter]], a former adviser to President [[George W. Bush]], deemed Trump "psychologically unfit" and supported transferring his powers to Vice President Pence under the 25th Amendment.&lt;ref name="NYT 1-6-18"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/us/politics/trump-genius-mental-health.html |title=Trump, Defending His Mental Fitness, Says He’s a ‘Very Stable Genius’ |first1=Peter |last1=Baker |first2=Maggie |last2=Haberman |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018 ''Vanity Fair'' reported that Trump's advisers "worry about his mental health" when he is outside the controls available in the White House environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/trumps-advisers-worry-about-his-mental-health-at-mar-a-lago |title=Trump’s Advisers Worry About His Mental Health at Mar-a-Lago |first=Isobel |last=Thompson |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Jeanne Suk Gerson wrote in ''[[The New Yorker]]'': "A strange consensus does appear to be forming around Trump's mental state," including Democrats and Republicans who doubt Trump's fitness for office.&lt;ref name="New Yorker"/&gt; Journalist [[Bill Moyers]] interviewed psychiatrist [[Robert Jay Lifton]] and said that Trump "makes increasingly bizarre statements that are contradicted by irrefutable evidence to the contrary". Lifton replied, "He doesn’t have clear contact with reality, though I’m not sure it qualifies as a ''bona fide'' delusion." As an example, Lifton said, when Trump claimed that [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|former president Barack Obama was born in Kenya]], "he was manipulating that lie as well as undoubtedly believing it in part."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2017/09/19/the-dangerous-case-of-donald-trump-robert-jay-lifton-and-bill-moyers-on-a-duty-to-warn_partner/|title=The dangerous case of Donald Trump: Robert Jay Lifton and Bill Moyers on "A Duty to Warn"|first=Bill|last=Moyers|work=Salon|date=September 19, 2017|accessdate=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 forensic psychiatrist [[Bandy X.

==== I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration ====
The letter titled [[I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration]] published by the New York Times declares most if not all those working for Trump see him as mentally unfit for his job.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

=== Allegations of early stage dementia ===
It has been asserted that Trump has signs of some degree of an early stage of [[dementia]], constituting an inability to consistently remember facts, or respond appropriately to circumstances of his surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/joe-scaroborough-claims-sources-say-trump-has-early-signs-dementia-what-does-774057|title=Trump shows early signs of dementia, Joe Scarborough claimed sources say—what does that mean?|date=8 January 2018|publisher=''[[Newsweek]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On several occasions, Trump has been reported as appearing to have mental lapses. In March 2017, Trump forgot to sign two executive orders before leaving a signing ceremony for those orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/326796-trump-appears-to-forget-to-sign-executive-orders|title=Trump leaves photo op before signing executive orders|first=Brooke|last=Seipel|publisher=''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''|date=March 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 5, 2017, Trump, after deplaning from [[Air Force One]], appeared confused and wandered away from his waiting limousine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/donald-trump-gets-confused-looking-his-presidential-limousine-1629041|title=Watch a confused Donald Trump search for a limo that's right in front of his eyes|first=Jordan|last=Bhatt|date=5 July 2017|publisher=''International Business Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/trump-mocked-limo-video/|title=Trump gets a taste of his own medicine after he can’t find his limo|date=5 July 2017|publisher=''The Daily Dot''}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 12, 2017, Trump initially forgot to sign the Trumpcare executive order before leaving the signing ceremony, but was ushered back to the table by Vice President [[Mike Pence]] to complete this step.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/donald-trump-forget-sign-executive-order-healthcare-obamacare-mike-pence-a7997661.html|title=Donald Trump almost forgets to sign executive order before reminder from Mike Pence|first=Alexandra|last=Wilts|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=October 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, during a press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the [[2018 Russia–United States summit]] in [[Helsinki]], Trump made a statement interpreted by observers as indicating his inclination to accept Putin's denial of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], saying "President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44852812|title=Trump sides with Russia against FBI|date=16 July 2018|accessdate=17 July 2018|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following criticism of this remark, Trump made a statement asserting that this was the result of a mental lapse, stating "In a key sentence in my remarks, I said the word 'would' instead of 'wouldn't'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/397481-trump-says-he-accepts-us-intel-on-russia-then-adds-it-could-be-other|title=Trump says he accepts US intel on Russia — then adds it ‘could be other people also’|first=Ian|last=Swanson|date=17 July 2018|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Republican governor of New Jersey, [[Christine Todd Whitman]] wrote of this assertion that if Trump did make this error, "it demonstrates his inability to articulate accurately U.S. foreign policy at the highest level, for the highest stakes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-whitman-trump-helsinki-gop-response-20180722-story.html|title=Calling my fellow Republicans: Trump is clearly unfit to remain in office|first=Christine |last=Todd Whitman|website=latimes.com|date=July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses from Trump and supporters ===
Trump has dismissed questions regarding his mental health, stating that he is a "very stable genius".&lt;ref name="NYT 1-6-18"/&gt; As evidence of his mental capacities, he pointed to his business success, his victory over Republican competitors, and his election to the presidency against [[Hillary Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/06/politics/donald-trump-white-house-fitness-very-stable-genius/index.html |title=Trump: I'm a 'very stable genius' |first=Daniella |last=Diaz |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=January 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump and others have asserted that such questions are evidence of a problem with his critics, labeling them as suffering from a "[[Trump derangement syndrome]]" (TDS). For example, commenting on the book ''The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump'', [[RealClearPolitics]] writer Carl M. Cannon argued that the foreword by psychiatrist [[Robert Jay Lifton]] "offers the melodramatic view that clinicians who don't warn the world about Donald Trump's shortcomings are akin to Nazi doctors who worked at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]. At the risk of practicing medicine without a license, I'd suggest that this historical comparison is ''de facto'' evidence of TDS – and paranoid grandiosity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/09/17/trump_vs_psychiatrists_whos_crazier_135019.html |title=Trump vs. Psychiatrists: Who's Crazier? |work=[[RealClearPolitics]] |first=Carl M. |last=Cannon |date=September 19, 2017 |access-date=September 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive test ===
In response to speculation about his cognitive abilities, Trump was administered the [[Montreal Cognitive Assessment]] (MoCA) at his own request as part of his January 2018 health checkup. He received a score of 30/30, indicating a normal level of cognitive function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-did-exceedingly-well-on-a-cognitive-test-top-white-house-doctor-says/2018/01/16/e8af8b8a-fadb-11e7-a46b-a3614530bd87_story.html |title=Trump did exceedingly well on a cognitive test, top White House doctor says |last=Johnson |first=Jenna |date=January 16, 2018 |work=Washington Post |access-date=June 8, 2018 |last2=Bernstein |first2=Lenny |language=en-US |issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have contended that the MoCA test is too basic to diagnose the problems asserted.&lt;ref name="Kolata"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/health/trump-cognitive-screening-dementia.html|title=Trump Passed a Cognitive Exam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15920">[[Image:REH Fort McKavett.PNG|right|thumb|250px|alt=Robert E. Howard in the doorway of a ruined wall|Robert E. Howard at [[Fort McKavett]] in 1933.]]

The health of American author [[Robert E. Howard]] (1906–1936), especially his mental health, has been the focus of the biographical and critical analysis of his life. In terms of physical health, Howard had a weak heart which he treated by taking [[digitalis]].  The precise nature of Howard's mental health has been much debated, both during his life and following his suicide.  Three main points of view exists.  Some have declared that Howard suffered from an [[Oedipus complex]] or similar mental disorder.  Another viewpoint is that Howard suffered from [[major depressive disorder]].  The third view is that Howard had no disorders and his suicide was a common reaction to stress.

==Physical health==
Howard had a weak heart, which was treated by taking [[digitalis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first indication of this problem came when, while working with an oil-field surveyor in the period before he became a successful author, Howard passed out in the heat.  A later diagnosis confirmed that his heart had a mild tendency to race under stress and he was told that a heavy blow to his chest could be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (13th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 29, 1933 Howard was involved in a traffic accident.  Driving back from a football game in Brownwood with three friends in the mist and rain, he crashed into a flag pole in [[Ranger, Texas|Ranger]].  A piece of windshield cut his neck close to the [[jugular vein]] and he was forced heavily into the steering column.  This impact to his chest could have been lethal with his heart problems but he escaped with just bruised ribs.  None of the other passengers were seriously injured either and one escaped injury altogether. The town helped to pay for repairs to the car and the flag pole was eventually removed following further accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (40th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental health==
[[Image:Reh moustache.jpg|right|thumb|150px|alt=Robert E. Howard with a moustache, wearing a broad brimmed hat.|Late photograph of Robert E. Howard, with moustache.]]
In the years since his suicide, there has been a lot of speculation about Robert E. Howard's mental health.  Even during his life, others in Cross Plains thought of him as crazy or odd.  Some have suggested that he had an [[Oedipus complex]], others have found evidence for [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]], and others still have diagnosed him as being mentally healthy.  His act of suicide is often the basis of these opinions.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (55-56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;  Almost all speculation is in the form of amateur-psychoanalysis from people with no qualifications in the field.&lt;ref name="Burke 56"&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gramlich 2006 99 106" /&gt;

===Eccentric behavior===
The people of Cross Plains considered Howard to be an odd person and possibly "crazy".  Cross Plains was mainly used to blue-collar agricultural and oil field work, as well as professions such as a teacher or doctor; they were not used to some who only wrote all day.  From their perspective, Howard did not seem to be doing any work at all.  His neighbors even complained about the noise he made typing, as well as loudly reading his own narration as he did so, throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=119–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard displayed eccentric behavior, such as: having his pants hemmed short so he would not trip in a potential fight; carrying a gun in his car in case of enemies; shouting stories as he wrote them; dressing oddly for the time and place, including a large moustache and sombrero; shadow-boxing as he walked down the street.  At the time, Novalyne Price told her roommate, "He’s trying to tell people he’s a writer and writers have a right to be odd. Since they think he’s crazy, anyway, he’ll show them just how crazy he can be."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of his break-up with Novalyne Price, Howard's behavior became increasing eccentric.  On one occasion, having taken Novalyne to a drug store for a soda, he loudly and publicly re-told his story "[[Red Nails]]."  He changed his appearance and grew a large, drooping mustache.  Later he began to wear about town a black [[sombrero]] with red bandana and black [[cowboy|vaquero]] pants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Charles Gramlich's opinion on Howard's behavior is that these are either normal acts or just eccentricities, which does not extend to having a mental disorder. The carrying of gun is, in Gramlich's opinion, normal for Texas, especially in the 1930s when the Wild West was within recent, living memory. The story about needing the gun in case of "enemies," given to E. Hoffmann Price, may have just been a tall tale invented by Howard for his friend. Novalyne Price considered Howard's talk of enemies to be part of an act. Finn notes that [[Highwayman|highwaymen]] had operated in the area during the oil boom and this was the reason Howard gave to Price for the gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=101–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shadow-boxing and shouting out of stories as they were written were due to Howard being a writer and simply getting caught up in a story. Other acts were intentionally eccentric as a reaction to the criticism from other townspeople. He was expressing his anger to this criticism by acting in a contrary manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=102–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of depression===
Howard maintained in correspondence with other writers that he was a failure and a [[Hack writer|hack]].  This was despite being commercially successful, sought after by publishers and receiving fan mail for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When sending condolences to [[August Derleth]] in May 1936, the month before his suicide, Howard wrote "Death to the old is inevitable, and yet somehow I often feel that it is a greater tragedy than death to the young...I don't want to live to be old.  I want to die when my time comes, quickly and suddenly, in the full tide of my strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[E. Hoffmann Price]] visited Howard in early 1934.  His impression on leaving was "Bob lived in a dream world people by enemies, and by peers and other folks who downgraded him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=179–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard suffered from nightmares and sleep walking into his early twenties, probably as a result of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=99, 222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In spring 1926, Howard went to Brownwood to see Tevis Clyde Smith.  In the night Clyde Smith was woken by Howard's scream; he saw him wrestle with a large shape and fall through a closed window.  The family found him wandering outside in a daze.  Clyde Smith talked to him until he went back to sleep, on prior instructions, and then woke him.  Howard had apparently dreamed that he saw a newspaper with the headline "Axe Murderer Slays Three."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, Howard went to a hospital in [[Temple, Texas|Temple]] complaining of a [[varicocele]], gas in the stomach and an abnormally small penis. The working diagnosis at the time was [[Neurasthenia|sexual neurasthenia]] but the symptoms may instead point towards [[neurotic depressive disorder]]. The doctor concluded that "We do not think there is anything wrong with Robert.  We can find no varicocele of any consequence, and his organs are normally developed and he tests out good in every respect.  His trouble, in our judgment, is due to his thinking there is something wrong.  After he has dispelled this thought from his mind he will be in fine shape."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer Mark Finn suggests that Howard picked up on his mother's depression.  She was dying of tuberculosis and may have suffered a miscarriage in October 1907.  Howard's father's job as a country doctor required him to make long journeys away from home, which would often mean him spending the night elsewhere.  This frequently left Howard alone with his mother and later put him in the role of primary caregiver.  The situation may have been exacerbated by frequent moves during his youth, which prevented Howard making many friends of his own during his early years, and the gradual breakdown of his parents' marriage.  His life was not his own and he developed a hatred of authority and any control placed over him.  He rebelled by boxing and drinking but, nevertheless, he felt duty-bound to remain and look after his mother.  Even after he became a success as a writer, he continued to live with his parents; although this was not unusual at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=218–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Finn writes that "Robert was [[Major depressive disorder|clinically depressed]] by any definition applicable, and had been for many years.  Whether the cause of the depression was a chemical imbalance, an untenable situation at home, or a combination of the two is not important."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; His suicide, once his duty to his mother was done, may have been an act of finally asserting control over his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of an Oedipus complex===
[[L. Sprague de Camp]] wrote in ''The Science Fiction Handbook'' (1953) that "the neurotic Howard suffered from an Oedipean devotion to his mother and... from delusions of persecution."  Faced with refutations from Glenn Lord, de Camp eventually stopped making claims about an Oedipus Complex but maintained that Howard was insane, especially due to Howard's suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=239–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of the speculations about Howard's mental state appear to originate in the first, flawed, biography of Howard, ''[[Dark Valley Destiny]]'' by L. Sprague de Camp and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These tend to be from a Freudian perspective and suggest an Oedipal attraction between Robert and his mother Hester, based on the facts that Howard took care of his dying mother, that his bedroom had a window through to his parents' bedroom and that he killed himself on the day she was going to die herself.  Gramlich points out that Dr. Isaac Howard's job forced him to take house calls and be away on business while Robert E. Howard's job as a writer meant he was at home most of the time; so, naturally, Robert became the primary caregiver.  Howard's bedroom was a converted porch and the window was a pre-existing part of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility of no mental disorders===
Dr. Charles Gramlich, a professor of psychology and an author of fantasy fiction, believes that Howard had no mental disorders and that amateur psychoanalysis has only come to such a conclusion through cherry-picking of evidence from Howard's life.&lt;ref name="Gramlich 2006 99 106"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=99, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burke concurs that almost all speculation is in the form of amateur psychoanalysis from people like L. Sprague de Camp with no qualifications in the field.&lt;ref name="Burke 56" /&gt;

===Suicide===
Confidants such as [[Tevis Clyde Smith]] and [[Novalyne Price Ellis]] found Howard to be an agreeable companion most of the time, full of life and good humor — but always with an underlying simmering melancholy.  Smith noted that Howard first mentioned suicide in October 1923 when a classmate, Roy Guthrie, committed suicide.  It affected Howard and he increasingly defended the right to do so in later years.  Howard may have considered suicide as early as 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Howard first talked of his own death in 1928 when his dog Patch was dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|pp=215–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Novalyne Price was admitted to hospital in 1935, her doctor, a friend of Howard's father, asked her if Howard had ever talked about not wanting to live after his mother died.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Finn|2006|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Howard's suicide, Gramlich believes it was nothing to do with any long-term mental abnormality; it was a common reaction to the strain he was under at the time.  While Howard did talk of suicide during his life, statistics show that one out of three teenagers contemplate suicide and the details of Howard's are normal (white, single, from the south of the United States, with a gun).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|pp=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the moment of Howard's death, he was mentally and physically exhausted with little available support: he was caring for his dying mother as her condition got worse; he was not being paid the money owed to him by ''Weird Tales'', at a time when he needed it for his mother's healthcare bills; he was working increasingly harder to make the money through other markets; his relationship with Novalyne Price had recently broken down; Tevis Clyde Smith had recently married and moved away; he did not have a strong relationship with his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gramlich ends by saying "He wasn't crazy; he was just a very good writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Gramlich|2006|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFBurke|Burke]] (56th paragraph)&lt;/ref&gt;

David Hayles wrote in the Times: "Maybe, at the end of it all, Howard felt that he had done what he needed to do. The prolific writer, whose 160-plus published stories were full of men facing death on their own terms, wanted to do the same. In a letter to the fantasy writer August Derleth he stated: 'I don’t want to live to be old. I want to die when my time comes, quickly and suddenly, in the full tide of my strength and health.' Youthful bravado perhaps, but he was true to his word. He wrote about men who didn’t age — his heroes were immortal. In bowing out in his prime, so was Robert E. Howard."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Hayles|2009|loc=Saturday Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Hearing loss''', also known as '''hearing impairment''', is a partial or total inability to [[Hearing|hear]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year=2011 | title=Deafness | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. | location= | id= | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/154327/deafness | accessdate=2012-02-22 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625153552/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/154327/deafness | archivedate=2012-06-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''deaf''' person has little to no hearing.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Hearing loss may occur in one or both ears.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; In children, hearing problems can affect the ability to learn spoken [[language]] and in adults it can create difficulties with social interaction and at work.&lt;ref name=Las2014&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lasak|first=JM|author2=Allen, P |author3=McVay, T |author4= Lewis, D |title=Hearing loss: diagnosis and management.|journal=Primary Care|date=Mar 2014|volume=41|issue=1|pages=19–31|pmid=24439878 |doi=10.1016/j.pop.2013.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some people, particularly older people, hearing loss can result in loneliness.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent.

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Hearing loss may be caused by a number of factors, including: [[genetics]], [[ageing]], [[Noise-induced hearing loss|exposure to noise]], some [[infection]]s, birth complications, trauma to the ear, and certain medications or toxins.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; A common condition that results in hearing loss is [[chronic ear infections]].&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Certain infections during pregnancy, such as [[syphilis]] and [[rubella]], may also cause hearing loss in the child.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;  Hearing loss is diagnosed when [[hearing testing]] finds that a person is unable to hear 25 [[decibels]] in at least one ear.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Testing for poor hearing is recommended for all newborns.&lt;ref name=Las2014/&gt; Hearing loss can be categorized as mild (25 to 40 [[decibel|dB]]), moderate (41 to 55 dB), moderate-severe (56 to 70 dB), severe (71 to 90 dB), or profound (greater than 90 dB).&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; There are three main types of hearing loss: [[conductive hearing loss]], [[sensorineural hearing loss]], and mixed hearing loss.&lt;ref name=Sm2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=RJH|last2=Shearer|first2=AE|last3=Hildebrand|first3=MS|last4=Van Camp|first4=G|last5=Pagon|first5=RA|last6=Adam|first6=MP|last7=Ardinger|first7=HH|last8=Wallace|first8=SE|last9=Amemiya|first9=A|last10=Bean|first10=LJH|last11=Bird|first11=TD|last12=Fong|first12=CT|last13=Mefford|first13=HC|last14=Smith|first14=RJH|last15=Stephens|first15=K|title=Deafness and Hereditary Hearing Loss Overview|date=2014|pmid=20301607}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
About half of hearing loss globally is preventable through public health measures.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Such practices include [[immunization]], proper care around [[pregnancy]], avoiding loud noise, and avoiding certain medications.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] recommends that young people limit the use of [[personal audio player]]s to an hour a day in an effort to limit exposure to noise.&lt;ref name=WHO2015Aud&gt;{{cite web|title=1.1 billion people at risk of hearing loss WHO highlights serious threat posed by exposure to recreational noise|url=http://www.who.int/pbd/deafness/activities/IECD_2015_Press_Release_EN.pdf?ua=1|website=who.int|accessdate=2 March 2015|date=27 February 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501204444/http://www.who.int/pbd/deafness/activities/IECD_2015_Press_Release_EN.pdf?ua=1|archivedate=1 May 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early identification and support are particularly important in children.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; For many [[hearing aids]], [[sign language]], [[cochlear implants]] and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] are useful.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; [[Lip reading]] is another useful skill some develop.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt; Access to hearing aids, however, is limited in many areas of the world.&lt;ref name=WHO2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and culture--&gt;

==Definition==
*Hearing loss exists when there is diminished sensitivity to the sounds normally heard.&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt; The terms hearing impaired or hard of hearing are usually reserved for people who have relative insensitivity to sound in the speech frequencies. The severity of a hearing loss is categorized according to the increase in volume above the usual level necessary before the listener can detect it.
*Deafness is defined as a degree of loss such that a person is unable to understand speech even in the presence of amplification.&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt; In profound deafness, even the loudest sounds produced by an [[audiometer]] (an instrument used to measure hearing by producing pure tone sounds through a range of frequencies) may not be detected. In total deafness, no sounds at all, regardless of amplification or method of production, are heard.
*[[Speech perception]] – Another aspect of hearing involves the perceived clarity of a word rather than the intensity of sound made by the word. In humans, that aspect is usually measured by tests of speech perception. These tests measure one's ability to understand speech, not to merely detect sound. There are very rare types of hearing loss which affect speech perception alone.  One example is [[auditory neuropathy]], a variety of hearing loss in which the outer hair cells of the cochlea and intact and functioning, but sound information is not faithfully transmitted to the auditory nerve and brain properly.&lt;ref name="eBook1"&gt;eBook: ''Current Diagnosis &amp; Treatment in Otolaryngology: Head &amp; Neck Surgery'', Lalwani, Anil K. (Ed.) Chapter 44: Audiologic Testing by Brady M. Klaves, PhD, Jennifer McKee Bold, AuD, Access Medicine&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the terms "hearing impaired", "deaf-mute", or "deaf and dumb" to describe deaf and hard of hearing people is discouraged by advocacy organizations as they are offensive to many deaf and hard of hearing people.&lt;ref name=NAD2016&gt;{{cite web| title=Community and Culture - Frequently Asked Questions| url=http://nad.org/issues/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-faq| website=nad.org| publisher=National Association of the Deaf| accessdate=27 Jan 2016| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227171131/http://nad.org/issues/american-sign-language/community-and-culture-faq| archivedate=2015-12-27| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hearing standards ===

{{See also| Absolute threshold of hearing| Hearing range}}

{{further| Equal-loudness contour| A-weighting}}

Human hearing extends in frequency from 20–20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz, and in amplitude from 0&amp;nbsp;dB to 130&amp;nbsp;dB or more. 0&amp;nbsp;dB does not represent absence of sound, but rather the softest sound an average unimpaired human ear can hear; some people can hear down to −5 or even −10&amp;nbsp;dB. 130&amp;nbsp;dB represents the [[threshold of pain]]. But the ear does not hear all frequencies equally well; hearing sensitivity peaks around 3000&amp;nbsp;Hz.  There are many qualities of human hearing besides frequency range and intensity that can't easily be measured quantitatively. But for many practical purposes, normal hearing is defined by a frequency versus intensity graph, or audiogram, charting sensitivity thresholds of hearing at defined frequencies.  Because of the cumulative impact of age and exposure to noise and other acoustic insults, 'typical' hearing may not be normal.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI 7029:2000/BS 6951 Acoustics - Statistical distribution of hearing thresholds as a function of age&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ANSI S3.5-1997 Speech Intelligibility Index (SII)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
*difficulty using the [[telephone]]
*loss of [[Sound localization|directionality of sound]]
*difficulty [[Speech perception|understanding speech]], especially of children and women whose voices are of a [[Voice frequency#Fundamental frequency|higher frequency]]. 
*difficulty understanding speech in the presence of background noise ([[cocktail party effect]])
*sounds or speech becoming dull, muffled or attenuated
*need for increased volume on television, radio, music and other audio sources

Hearing loss is sensory, but may have accompanying symptoms:
*pain or pressure in the ears
*a blocked feeling

There may also be accompanying secondary symptoms:
*[[hyperacusis]], heightened sensitivity with accompanying auditory pain to certain intensities and frequencies of sound, sometimes defined as "auditory recruitment"
*[[tinnitus]], ringing, buzzing, hissing or other sounds in the ear when no external sound is present
*[[vertigo]] and disequilibrium
*[[Autophony|tympanophonia]], abnormal hearing of one's own voice and respiratory sounds, usually as a result of a patulous (a constantly open) eustachian tube or dehiscent superior semicircular canals
*disturbances of facial movement (indicating a possible tumour or stroke)

==Causes==
Hearing loss has multiple causes, including ageing, genetics, perinatal problems and acquired causes like noise and disease.  For some kinds of hearing loss the cause may be classified as [[idiopathic|of unknown cause]].

===Age===
There is a progressive loss of ability to hear high frequencies with aging known as [[presbycusis]]. For men, this can start as early as 25 and women at 30. Although genetically variable it is a normal concomitant of ageing and is distinct from hearing losses caused by noise exposure, toxins or disease agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Robinson| first1=DW| last2=Sutton| first2=GJ| title=Age effect in hearing – a comparative analysis of published threshold data| journal=Audiology| volume=18| issue=4| pages=320–34| year=1979| pmid=475664| doi=10.3109/00206097909072634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common conditions that can increase the risk of hearing loss in elderly people are high blood pressure, diabetes or the use of certain medications harmful to the ear.&lt;ref&gt;Worrall, L.,&amp; Hickson, L. M. (2003). "Communication activity limitations", pp. 141–142 in Linda E. Worrall &amp; Louise M. Hickson (Eds.). ''Communication disability in aging: from prevention to intervention''. Clifton Park, NY: Delmar Learning&lt;/ref&gt; While everyone loses hearing with age, the amount and type of hearing loss is variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hearing Loss and Older Adults|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing-loss-older-adults|publisher=National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders|accessdate=September 11, 2016|format=Last Updated June 3, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004200407/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/hearing-loss-older-adults|archivedate=October 4, 2016|df=|date=2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noise===
{{Main| Noise-induced hearing loss}}
{{globalize| section| date=December 2015}}
Noise exposure is the cause of approximately half of all cases of hearing loss, causing some degree of problems in 5% of the population globally.&lt;ref name=Oishi2011&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Oishi| first1=N.| last2=Schacht| first2=J.| title=Emerging treatments for noise-induced hearing loss| journal=Expert Opinion on Emerging Drugs| date=June 2011| volume=16| issue=2| pages=235–45| pmid=21247358| doi=10.1517/14728214.2011.552427| pmc=3102156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) recognizes that the majority of hearing loss is not due to age, but due to noise exposure.  By correcting for age in assessing hearing, one tends to overestimate the hearing loss due to noise for some and underestimate it for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2015/03/25/hl-impact-story/| title=CDC - NIOSH Science Blog – A Story of Impact….| work=cdc.gov| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613044654/http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2015/03/25/hl-impact-story/| archivedate=2015-06-13| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing loss due to noise may be temporary, called a 'temporary threshold shift', a reduced sensitivity to sound over a wide frequency range resulting from exposure to a brief but very loud noise like a gunshot, firecracker, jet engine, jackhammer, etc. or to exposure to loud sound over a few hours such as during a pop concert or nightclub session.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/noise/health_effects/effects.html|title=Noise and Hearing Conservation: Effects of Excessive Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration|publisher=|access-date=July 14, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629163619/https://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/noise/health_effects/effects.html|archivedate=June 29, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recovery of hearing is usually within 24 hours, but may take up to a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/handbook/Threshold_Shift.html|title=Threshold Shift (TS)|website=Simon Fraser University|access-date=2016-07-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503122331/http://www.sfu.ca/sonic-studio/handbook/Threshold_Shift.html|archivedate=2016-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both constant exposure to loud sounds (85&amp;nbsp;dB(A) or above) and one-time exposure to extremely loud sounds (120&amp;nbsp;dB(A) or above) may cause permanent hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/noise/signs.htm|title=About Hearing Loss|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720230923/http://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/noise/signs.htm|archivedate=2016-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noise-induced hearing loss]] (NIHL) typically manifests as elevated hearing thresholds (i.e. less sensitivity or muting) between 3000 and 6000&amp;nbsp; Hz, centred at 4000&amp;nbsp; Hz. As noise damage progresses, damage spreads to affect lower and higher frequencies. On an [[audiogram]], the resulting configuration has a distinctive notch, called a 'noise' notch. As ageing and other effects contribute to higher frequency loss (6–8&amp;nbsp;kHz on an audiogram), this notch may be obscured and entirely disappear.

Various governmental, industry and standards organizations set noise standards.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]], and numerous state government agencies among others, set noise standards.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has identified the level of 70&amp;nbsp;dB(A) (40% louder to twice as loud as normal conversation; typical level of TV, radio, stereo; city street noise) for 24‑hour exposure as the level necessary to protect the public from hearing loss and other disruptive effects from noise, such as sleep disturbance, stress-related problems, learning detriment, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Information on Levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety. Document ID: usepa-1974&lt;/ref&gt; Noise levels are typically in the 65 to 75&amp;nbsp;dB (A) range for those living near airports of freeways and may result in hearing damage if sufficient time is spent outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sanda.org.za/index.php/resources-links/deafness|title=Deafness|last=|first=|website=SANDRA: South African National Deaf Association|access-date=2016-07-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801152215/http://www.sanda.org.za/index.php/resources-links/deafness|archivedate=2016-08-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louder sounds cause damage in a shorter period of time. Estimation of a "safe" duration of exposure is possible using an ''exchange rate'' of 3&amp;nbsp;dB. As 3&amp;nbsp;dB represents a doubling of the intensity of sound, duration of exposure must be cut in half to maintain the same energy dose. For workplace noise regulation, the "safe" daily exposure amount at 85&amp;nbsp;dB A, known as an [[exposure action value]], is 8 hours, while the "safe" exposure at 91&amp;nbsp;dB(A) is only 2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Occupational Noise Exposure, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 98-126&lt;/ref&gt; 
Different standards use exposure action values between 80dBA and 90dBA. Note that for some people, sound may be damaging at even lower levels than 85&amp;nbsp;dB A. Exposures to other ototoxins (such as pesticides, some medications including chemotherapy agents, solvents, etc.) can lead to greater susceptibility to noise damage, as well as causing its own damage. This is called a ''synergistic'' interaction.  Since noise damage is cumulative over long periods of time, persons who are exposed to non-workplace noise, like recreational activities or environmental noise, may have compounding damage from all sources.

Some national and international organizations and agencies use an exchange rate of 4&amp;nbsp;dB or 5&amp;nbsp;dB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| title=Compliance Guide to MSHA's Occupational Noise Exposure Standard, APPENDIX B – GLOSSARY OF TERMS| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112204458/http://www.msha.gov/regs/complian/guides/noise/g3appendixb.htm| archivedate=2013-11-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these exchange rates may indicate a wider zone of comfort or safety, they can significantly underestimate the damage caused by loud noise. For example, at 100&amp;nbsp;dB (nightclub music level), a 3&amp;nbsp;dB exchange rate would limit exposure to 15 minutes; the 5&amp;nbsp;dB exchange rate allows an hour.

Many people are unaware of the presence of environmental sound at damaging levels, or of the level at which sound becomes harmful. Common sources of damaging noise levels include car stereos, children's toys, motor vehicles, crowds, lawn and maintenance equipment, power tools, gun use, musical instruments, and even hair dryers. Noise damage is cumulative; all sources of damage must be considered to assess risk. If one is exposed to loud sound (including music) at high levels or for extended durations (85&amp;nbsp;dB A or greater), then hearing loss will occur. Sound intensity (sound energy, or propensity to cause damage to the ears) increases dramatically with proximity according to an inverse square law: halving the distance to the sound quadruples the sound intensity.

In the USA, 12.5% of children aged 6–19 years have permanent hearing damage from excessive noise exposure.&lt;ref name="kid"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| title=Noise-Induced Hearing Loss: Promoting Hearing Health Among Youth| work=CDC Healthy Youth!| publisher=CDC| date=2009-07-01| accessdate=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221020243/http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/noise/| archivedate=2009-12-21| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Health Organization estimates that half of those between 12 and 35 are at risk from using [[personal audio devices]] that are too loud.&lt;ref name=WHO2015Aud/&gt;

===Genetic===
Hearing loss can be inherited. Around 75–80% of all these cases are inherited by [[recessive genes]], 20–25% are inherited by [[dominant genes]], 1–2% are inherited by [[X-linked]] patterns, and fewer than 1% are inherited by [[mitochondrial inheritance]].&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web| last=Rehm| first=Heidi| title=The Genetics of Deafness; A Guide for Patients and Families| url=http://hearing.harvard.edu/info/GeneticDeafnessBookletV2.pdf| work=Harvard Medical School Center For Hereditary Deafness| publisher=Harvard Medical School| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019153702/http://hearing.harvard.edu/info/GeneticDeafnessBookletV2.pdf| archivedate=2013-10-19| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When looking at the genetics of deafness, there are 2 different forms, syndromic and [[Nonsyndromic deafness|nonsyndromic]]. Syndromic deafness occurs when there are other signs or medical problems aside from deafness in an individual. This accounts for around 30% of deaf individuals who are deaf from a genetic standpoint.&lt;ref name=Harvard /&gt; Nonsyndromic deafness occurs when there are no other signs or medical problems associated with an individual other than deafness. From a genetic standpoint, this accounts for the other 70% of cases, and represents the majority of hereditary hearing loss.&lt;ref name=Harvard /&gt; Syndromic cases occur with diseases such as [[Usher syndrome]], [[Stickler syndrome]], [[Waardenburg syndrome]], [[Alport's syndrome]], and [[neurofibromatosis type 2]]. These are diseases that have deafness as one of the symptoms or as a common feature associated with it. Many of the genetic mutations giving rise to syndromic deafness have been identified. In nonsyndromic cases, where deafness is the only finding, it is more difficult to identify the genetic mutation although some have been discovered.

* Gene mapping has identified the genetic locations for several nonsyndromic dominant (DFNA#) and recessive (DFNB#) forms of deafness. The first gene mapped for non-syndromic deafness, DFNA1, involves a splice site mutation in the formin related homolog diaphanous 1 (DIAPH1). A single base change in a large [[Costa Rica]]n family was identified as causative in a rare form of low frequency onset progressive hearing loss with autosomal dominant inheritance exhibiting variable age of onset and complete penetrance by age 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Lynch| first1=Eric D.| last2=Lee| first2=Ming K.| last3=Morrow| first3=Jan E.| last4=Welcsh| first4=Piri L.| last5=León| first5=Pedro E.| last6=King| first6=Mary-Claire| title=Nonsyndromic deafness DFNA1 associated with mutation of a human homolog of the Drosophila gene diaphanous| journal=Science| volume=278| issue=5341| pages=1315–18| date=1997-11-14| pmid=9360932| doi=10.1126/science.278.5341.1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of congenital hearing loss in developed countries is DFNB1, also known as connexin 26 deafness or [[GJB2]]-related deafness.
* The most common dominant syndromic forms of hearing loss include [[Stickler syndrome]] and [[Waardenburg syndrome]].
* The most common recessive syndromic forms of hearing loss are [[Pendred syndrome]] and [[Usher syndrome]].
* The congenital defect [[microtia]], deformed or unformed outer ear, can be associated with partial or complete conductive deafness, depending upon the severity of the deformity and whether the middle ear is also affected. It can also be associated with abnormalities of the inner ear giving rise to an additional sensorineural component to the hearing loss (mixed deafness). 
*Dozens of additional genes for nonsyndromic deafness have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;hereditaryhearingloss.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perinatal problems===
* [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder]]s are reported to cause hearing loss in up to 64% of infants born to [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] mothers, from the ototoxic effect on the developing fetus plus malnutrition during pregnancy from the excess [[ethanol|alcohol]] intake.
* [[Premature birth]] can be associated with sensorineural hearing loss because of an increased risk of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[hyperbilirubinaemia]], ototoxic medication and infection as well as noise exposure in the neonatal units. The risk of hearing loss is greatest for those weighing less than 1500&amp;nbsp;g at birth.

===Disorders===
*[[Stroke|strokes]] – Depending on what blood vessels are affected by the stroke, one of the symptoms can be deafness &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKee|first=Michael M.|last2=Stransky|first2=Michelle L.|last3=Reichard|first3=Amanda|date=2018-1|title=Hearing loss and associated medical conditions among individuals 65 years and older|journal=Disability and Health Journal|volume=11|issue=1|pages=122–125|doi=10.1016/j.dhjo.2017.05.007|issn=1876-7583|pmid=28596096}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
*[[multiple sclerosis]] can have an effect on hearing as well. Multiple sclerosis, or MS, is an [[autoimmune disease]] where the immune system attacks the [[myelin sheath]], a covering that protects the nerves. If the auditory nerve becomes damaged, the affected person will become completely deaf in one or both ears. There is no cure for MS.
*[[perilymph fistula]] – a microtear in either the round or oval window (membranes separating the middle and inner ear) of the cochlea causing perilymph to leak into the middle ear. This usually occurs as a consequence of trauma, including barotrauma, and can give rise to vertigo as well as hearing loss.
*viral – viral infections of the ear can cause sensorineural hearing loss usually as the consequence of a labyrinthitis. The patient may be generally unwell at the time.  
** [[Measles]] may cause [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|auditory nerve]] damage but usually gives rise to a chronic middle ear problem giving rise to a mixed hearing loss.
** [[Mumps]] (Epidemic parotitis) may result in profound sensorineural hearing loss (90&amp;nbsp;dB or more), unilateral (one ear) or bilateral (both ears).
** congenital [[rubella]] (also called German measles) syndrome, can cause deafness in newborns 
** several varieties of [[Herpesviridae|herpes virus]]es that cause other diseases can also infect the ear, and can result in hearing loss: congenital infection with [[cytomegalovirus]] is responsible for deafness in newborn children and also progressive sensorineural hearing loss in childhood; [[herpes simplex]] type 1, oral herpes associated with cold sores; [[Epstein Barr]] virus that causes mononucleosis; [[varicella zoster]] oticus that causes facial paralysis ([[Ramsay Hunt syndrome]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Byl, et.al.| first1=FM| title=Auditory symptoms associated with herpes zoster or idiopathic facial paralysis| journal=Laryngoscope| date=1977| volume=87| issue=3| pages=372–9| doi=10.1288/00005537-197703000-00010| pmid=557156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** People with [[HIV/AIDS]] may develop hearing problems due to medications they take for the disease, the [[HIV virus]], or due to an increased rate of other infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Araújo Eda| first1=S| last2=Zucki| first2=F| last3=Corteletti| first3=LC| last4=Lopes| first4=AC| last5=Feniman| first5=MR| last6=Alvarenga Kde| first6=F| title=Hearing loss and acquired immune deficiency syndrome: systematic review.| journal=Jornal da Sociedade Brasileira de Fonoaudiologia| date=2012| volume=24| issue=2| pages=188–92| pmid=22832689| doi=10.1590/s2179-64912012000200017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
** [[West Nile fever|West Nile virus]], which can cause a variety of neurological disorders, can also cause hearing loss by attacking the auditory nerve
* [[Meningitis]] may damage the auditory nerve or the cochlea.
* [[Syphilis]] is commonly transmitted from pregnant women to their fetuses, and about a third of infected children will eventually become deaf.
*inherited
** People with [[Down syndrome]] are more likely to have hearing loss.&lt;ref name=Rod2012&gt;{{cite journal| last=Rodman| first=R| author2=Pine, HS| title=The otolaryngologist's approach to the patient with Down syndrome.| journal=Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America| date=Jun 2012| volume=45| issue=3| pages=599–629, vii–viii| pmid=22588039| doi=10.1016/j.otc.2012.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually due to middle ear effusions in childhood but towards the end of the second decade they may develop a high frequency sensorineural hearing loss which can get progressively worse with time. 
**[[Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease]] variant 1E (CMT1E) is noted for demyelinating in addition to deafness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKusick|first1=Victor A.|last2=Kniffen|first2=Cassandra L.|title=# 118300 CHARCOT-MARIE-TOOTH DISEASE AND DEAFNESS|url=http://omim.org/entry/118300|website=Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man|accessdate=2 March 2018|date=30 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Autoimmune disease]] is recognized as a cause for cochlear damage. Although rare, it is possible for autoimmune processes to target the cochlea specifically as a first presentation. [[Granulomatosis with polyangiitis]] is one of the autoimmune conditions that may precipitate hearing loss. [[Cogan's syndrome]] commonly presents with hearing loss. 
* [[Otosclerosis]] is a condition that can cause fixation of the stapes (or stirrup) in the middle ear preventing its movement and causing a conductive hearing loss. 
* [[Vestibular schwannoma]], erroneously known as [[Acoustic neuroma]]s, and other types of [[brain tumor]]s can cause hearing loss by infringement of the tumor on the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]]
*Congenital problems
** [[Superior semicircular canal dehiscence]], a gap in the bone cover above the inner ear, can lead to low-frequency conductive hearing loss, autophony and vertigo.
*recurring ear infections or concomitant secondary infections (such as bacterial infection subsequent to viral infection) can result in hearing loss

===Medications===
Some medications may reversibly affect hearing. These medications are considered [[Ototoxicity|ototoxic]]. This includes [[loop diuretic]]s such as furosemide and bumetanide, [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s (NSAIDs) both over-the-counter (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen) as well as prescription (celecoxib, diclofenac, etc.), paracetamol, [[quinine]], and [[macrolide antibiotics]]. The link between NSAIDs and hearing loss tends to be greater in women, especially those who take ibuprofen six or more times a week.&lt;ref name="Analgesic"&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/176/6/544.abstract?sid=750067d3-6651-49ac-b40b-82ee5a3fc27b/| title=Analgesic Use and the Risk of Hearing Loss in Women| journal=American Journal of Epidemiology| volume=176| issue=6| pages=544–554| first1=Sharon G.| last1=Curhan| first2=Josef| last2=Shargorodsky| first3=Roland| last3=Eavey| first4=Gary C.| last4=Curhan| date=2012-02-29| accessdate=| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151214195730/http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/176/6/544.abstract?sid=750067d3-6651-49ac-b40b-82ee5a3fc27b%2F| archivedate=2015-12-14| df=| doi=10.1093/aje/kws146| pmid=22933387| pmc=3530351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others may cause permanent hearing loss.&lt;ref name="asha"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Ototoxic-Medications/| title=Ototoxic Medications (Medication Effects)| first1=Barbara| last1=Cone| first2=Patricia| last2=Dorn| first3=Dawn| last3=Konrad-Martin| first4=Jennifer| last4=Lister| first5=Candice| last5=Ortiz| first6=Kim| last6=Schairer| publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association| accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important group is the [[aminoglycoside]]s (main member [[gentamicin]]) and platinum based chemotherapeutics such as [[cisplatin]] and [[carboplatin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rybak|first=Leonard P.|last2=Mukherjea|first2=Debashree|last3=Jajoo|first3=Sarvesh|last4=Ramkumar|first4=Vickram|date=November 2009|title=Cisplatin ototoxicity and protection: clinical and experimental studies |journal=The Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine|volume=219|issue=3|pages=177–186|pmc=2927105|pmid=19851045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rybak|first=L.

===Chemicals===
{{Main| Ototoxicity}}
In addition to medications, hearing loss can also result from specific chemicals in the environment: metals, such as [[lead]]; [[solvents]], such as [[toluene]] (found in [[crude oil]], [[gasoline]]&lt;ref name="tol-nih"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/text_version/chemicals.php?id=30| title=Tox Town – Toluene – Toxic chemicals and environmental health risks where you live and work – Text Version| publisher=toxtown.nlm.nih.gov| accessdate=2010-06-09| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609052911/http://toxtown.nlm.nih.gov/text_version/chemicals.php?id=30| archivedate=2010-06-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[automobile exhaust]],&lt;ref name="tol-nih" /&gt; for example); and [[asphyxiant gas|asphyxiant]]s.&lt;ref name="def9"&gt;{{cite news| title=Addressing the Risk for Hearing Loss from Industrial Chemicals| first=Thais C.| last=Morata| work=| url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/pubs/presentations/AOHC.swf| publisher=CDC| accessdate=2008-06-05| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122171205/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/pubs/presentations/AOHC.swf| archivedate=2009-01-22| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with noise, these [[ototoxic]] chemicals have an additive effect on a person’s hearing loss.&lt;ref name="def9" /&gt;

===Physical trauma===
There can be damage either to the ear itself or to the brain centers that process the aural information conveyed by the ears. People who sustain head injury are especially vulnerable to hearing loss or tinnitus, either temporary or permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oesterle|first1=EC|title=Changes in the adult vertebrate auditory sensory epithelium after trauma.|journal=Hearing Research|date=March 2013|volume=297|pages=91–8|pmid=23178236|pmc=3637947|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2012.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eggermont|first1=JJ|title=Acquired hearing loss and brain plasticity.|journal=Hearing Research|volume=343|pages=176–190|date=24 May 2016|pmid=27233916|doi=10.1016/j.heares.2016.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
Sound waves reach the outer ear and are conducted down the ear canal to the [[eardrum]], causing it to vibrate. The vibrations are transferred by the 3 tiny ear bones of the [[middle ear]] to the fluid in the inner ear. The fluid moves hair cells ([[stereocilia]]), and their movement generates nerve impulses which are then taken to the brain by the [[cochlear nerve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Hear|url=https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/how-we-hear/|website=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Hear|url=https://www.sc.edu/ehs/training/Noise/hearing.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501041002/http://www.sc.edu/ehs/training/Noise/hearing.htm|archivedate=1 May 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The auditory nerve takes the impulses to the brainstem, which sends the impulses to the midbrain. Finally, the signal goes to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe to be interpreted as sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Do We Hear?|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/how-do-we-hear|publisher=NIDCD|language=en|date=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hearing loss is most commonly caused by long-term exposure to loud noises, from recreation or from work, that damage the hair cells, which do not grow back on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is Noise-Induced Hearing Loss?|url=https://www.noisyplanet.nidcd.nih.gov/parents/what-is-noise-induced-hearing-loss|publisher=NIH - Noisy Planet|language=en|date=December 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NIOSH&gt;{{cite web|title=CDC - Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention - Preventing Hearing Loss, Risk Factors - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/preventhearingloss/riskfactors.html|publisher=NIOSH/CDC|accessdate=3 March 2018|language=en-us|date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older people may lose their hearing from long exposure to noise, changes in the inner ear, changes in the middle ear, or from changes along the nerves from the ear to the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Age-Related Hearing Loss|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/age-related-hearing-loss|publisher=NIDCD|language=en|date=18 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
{{anchor|Quantification_of_hearing_loss}}
[[File:HearingExam.jpg|thumb|An [[audiologist]] conducting an [[audiometry|audiometric]] [[hearing test]] in a [[sound-proof]] testing booth|alt=a female medical professional is seated in front of a special [[sound-proof]] booth with a glass window, controlling diagnostic test equipment. Inside the booth a middle aged man can be seen wearing headphones and is looking straight ahead of himself, not at the [[audiologist]], and appears to be concentrating on hearing something]]

Identification of a hearing loss is usually conducted by a general practitioner [[medical doctor]], [[otolaryngologist]], certified and licensed [[audiologist]], school or industrial [[audiometrist]], or other audiometric technician. Diagnosis of the cause of a hearing loss is carried out by a specialist physician (audiovestibular physician) or [[otorhinolaryngologist]].

===Case history===
A case history (usually a written form, with questionnaire) can provide valuable information about the context of the hearing loss, and indicate what kind of diagnostic procedures to employ. Case history will include such items as:
*major concern
*birth and pregnancy information
*medical history
*development history
*family history
*workplace environment
*home environment

===Examination===
*[[otoscopy]], visual examination of the outer ear, ear canal, eardrum, and middle ear (through the translucent eardrum) using an optical instrument inserted into the ear canal called an otoscope 
*[[tympanometry]]
*differential testing – the [[Weber test|Weber]], [[Rinne test|Rinne]], [[Bing test|Bing]] and [[Schwabach test|Schwabach]] tests are simple manual tests of auditory function conducted with a low frequency (usually 512&amp;nbsp;Hz) tuning fork that can provide a quick indication of type of hearing loss: unilateral/bilateral, conductive, or other

===Laboratory testing===
In case of infection or inflammation, blood or other body fluids may be submitted for laboratory analysis.

===Hearing tests===
{{See also|Audiometry|Pure tone audiometry|Auditory brainstem response|Otoacoustic emissions}}
Hearing loss is generally measured by playing generated or recorded sounds, and determining whether the person can hear them. Hearing sensitivity varies according to the [[frequency]] of sounds. To take this into account, hearing sensitivity can be measured for a range of frequencies and plotted on an [[audiogram]].

Another method for quantifying hearing loss is a speech-in-noise test. As the name implies, a speech-in-noise test gives an indication of how well one can understand speech in a noisy environment. A person with a hearing loss will often be less able to understand speech, especially in noisy conditions. This is especially true for people who have a sensorineural loss – which is by far the most common type of hearing loss. As such, speech-in-noise tests can provide valuable information about a person's hearing ability, and can be used to detect the presence of a sensorineural hearing loss. A recently developed digit-triple speech-in-noise test may be a more efficient screening test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jansen, et.al.|first1=S|title=Efficient hearing screening in noise-exposed listeners using the digit triplet test.|journal=Ear Hear|date=2013|volume=34|issue=6|pages=773–8|doi=10.1097/AUD.0b013e318297920b|pmid=23782715|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/398543/2/Jansen_Ear%26Hearing_2013.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Otoacoustic emissions test is an objective hearing test that may be administered to toddlers and children too young to cooperate in a conventional hearing test. The test is also useful in older children and adults and is an important measure in diagnosing auditory neuropathy described above.

Auditory brainstem response testing is an electrophysiological test used to test for hearing deficits caused by pathology within the ear, the cochlear nerve and also within the brainstem. This test can be used to identify delay in the conduction of neural impulses due to tumours or inflammation but can also be an objective test of hearing thresholds. Other electrophysiological tests, such as cortical evoked responses, can look at the hearing pathway up to the level of the auditory cortex.

===Scans===
MRI and CT scans can be useful to identify the pathology of many causes of hearing loss. They are only needed in selected cases.

===Classification===
Hearing loss is categorized by type, severity, and configuration. Furthermore, a hearing loss may exist in only one ear (unilateral) or in both ears (bilateral).  Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent, sudden or progressive.

====Severity====
The severity of a hearing loss is ranked according to ranges of nominal thresholds in which a sound must be so it can be detected by an individual. It is measured in [[decibel]]s of hearing loss, or dB HL. The measurement of hearing loss in an individual is conducted over several [[frequency|frequencies]], mostly 500&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz, 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz and 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz. The hearing loss of the individual is the average of the hearing loss values over the different frequencies. Hearing loss can be ranked differently according to different organisations; and so, in different countries different systems are in use.

Hearing loss may be ranked as slight, mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound as defined below:{{medical citation needed|date=December 2015}}
* Slight: between 16 and 25&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Mild:
** for adults: between 26 and 40&amp;nbsp;dB HL
** for children: between 20 and 40&amp;nbsp;dB HL&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;
* Moderate: between 41 and 54&amp;nbsp;dB HL&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;
* Moderately severe: between 55 and 70&amp;nbsp;dB HL&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;
* Severe: between 71 and 90&amp;nbsp;dB HL&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;
* Profound: 91&amp;nbsp;dB HL or greater&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;
* Totally deaf: Have no hearing at all.  This is called ''anacusis''.

The 'Audiometric Classifications of Hearing Impairment' according to the International Bureau Audiophonology (BIAP) in Belgium is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIAP Recommendation 02/1 bis - AUDIOMETRIC CLASSIFICATION OF HEARING IMPAIRMENTS|url=https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|website=biap.org|publisher=International Bureau Audiophonology|accessdate=18 June 2017|date=26 October 1996|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908010426/https://www.biap.org/en/component/content/article/65-recommendations/ct-2-classification/5-biap-recommendation-021-bis|archivedate=8 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Normal or subnormal hearing: average tone loss is equal or below 20&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Mild hearing loss: average tone loss between 21 and 40&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Moderate hearing loss
** First degree: average tone loss between 41 and 55&amp;nbsp;dB HL
** Second degree: average tone loss between 56 and 70&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Severe hearing loss
** First degree: average tone loss between 71 and 80&amp;nbsp;dB HL
** Second degree: average tone loss between 81 and 90&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Very severe hearing loss
** First degree: average tone loss between 91 and 100&amp;nbsp;dB HL
** Second degree: average tone loss between 101 and 110&amp;nbsp;dB HL
** Third degree: average tone loss between 111 and 119&amp;nbsp;dB HL
* Total hearing loss or Cophosis: average tone loss is equal or more than 120&amp;nbsp;dB HL

Hearing loss may affect one or both ears. If both ears are affected, then one ear may be more affected than the other.  Thus it is possible, for example, to have normal hearing in one ear and none at all in the other, or to have mild hearing loss in one ear and moderate hearing loss in the other.

For certain legal purposes such as insurance claims, hearing loss is described in terms of percentages. Given that hearing loss can vary by frequency and that audiograms are plotted with a logarithmic scale, the idea of a percentage of hearing loss is somewhat arbitrary, but where decibels of loss are converted via a legally recognized formula, it is possible to calculate a standardized "percentage of hearing loss", which is suitable for legal purposes only.

====Type====
There are four main types of hearing loss, [[conductive hearing loss]], [[sensorineural hearing loss]], [[central deafness]] and combinations of conductive and sensorineural hearing losses which is called mixed hearing loss.&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt; An additional problem which is increasingly recognised is [[auditory processing disorder]] which is not a hearing loss as such but a difficulty perceiving sound.

*Conductive hearing loss
Conductive hearing loss is present when the sound is not reaching the inner ear, the [[cochlea]]. This can be due to external ear canal malformation, dysfunction of the eardrum or malfunction of the bones of the middle ear. The eardrum may show defects from small to total resulting in hearing loss of different degree. [[Granulation tissue|Scar tissue]] after ear infections may also make the eardrum dysfunction as well as when it is retracted and adherent to the medial part of the middle ear.

Dysfunction of the three small bones of the [[middle ear]] – malleus, incus, and stapes – may cause conductive hearing loss. The mobility of the [[ossicles]] may be impaired for different reasons including a boney disorder of the ossicles called [[otosclerosis]] and disruption of the ossicular chain due to trauma, infection or [[ankylosis]] may also cause hearing loss.

*Sensorineural hearing loss
Sensorineural hearing loss is one caused by dysfunction of the inner ear, the cochlea or the nerve that transmits the impulses from the cochlea to the hearing centre in the brain. The most common reason for sensorineural hearing loss is damage to the [[hair cells]] in the cochlea. Depending on the definition it could be estimated that more than 50% of the population over the age of 70 has impaired hearing.&lt;ref name="RussellPineYoung2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Russell JL, Pine HS, Young DL |title=Pediatric cochlear implantation: expanding applications and outcomes. |journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=841–863 |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.pcl.2013.04.008 |pmid=23905823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Central deafness
Damage to the brain can lead to a central deafness. The peripheral ear and the auditory nerve may function well but the central connections are damaged by tumour, trauma or other disease and the patient is unable to process speech information.

*Mixed hearing loss
Mixed hearing loss is a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. Chronic ear infection (a fairly common diagnosis) can cause a defective [[ear drum]] or middle-ear ossicle damages, or both.  In addition to the conductive loss, a sensory component may be present.

*Central [[auditory processing disorder]]

This is not an actual hearing loss but gives rise to significant difficulties in hearing. One kind of auditory processing disorder is [[King-Kopetzky syndrome]], which is characterized by an inability to process out background noise in noisy environments despite normal performance on traditional hearing tests. An [[auditory processing disorder]]s is sometimes linked to language disorders in persons of all ages.

====Configuration====
The shape of an audiogram shows the relative configuration of the hearing loss, such as a [[Carhart notch]] for otosclerosis, 'noise' notch for noise-induced damage, high frequency rolloff for presbycusis, or a flat audiogram for conductive hearing loss. In conjunction with speech audiometry, it may indicate central auditory processing disorder, or the presence of a [[schwannoma]] or other tumor.
There are four general configurations of hearing loss:

1. Flat: thresholds essentially equal across test frequencies.

2. Sloping: lower (better) thresholds in low-frequency regions and higher (poorer) thresholds in high-frequency regions.

3. Rising: higher (poorer) thresholds in low-frequency regions and lower (better) thresholds in higher-frequency regions.

4. Trough-shaped ("cookie-bite" or "U" shaped): greatest hearing loss in the mid-frequency range, with lower (better) thresholds in low- and high-frequency regions.

====Unilateral and bilateral====
People with [[unilateral hearing loss]] or single-sided deafness (SSD) have difficulty in:

*hearing conversation on their impaired side
*localizing sound
*understanding speech in the presence of background noise.

In quiet conditions, speech discrimination is approximately the same for normal hearing and those with unilateral deafness; however, in noisy environments speech discrimination varies individually and ranges from mild to severe.

One reason for the hearing problems these patients often experience is due to the [[head shadow effect]]. Newborn children with no hearing on one side but one normal ear could still have problems.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu JE. Speech-language and educational consequences of unilateral hearing loss in children. Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2004: 130(5);524-30.&lt;/ref&gt; Speech development could be delayed and difficulties to concentrate in school are common. More children with unilateral hearing loss have to repeat classes than their peers. Taking part in social activities could be a problem. Early aiding is therefore of utmost importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kitterick PT, O'Donoghue GM, Edmondson-Jones M, Marshall A, Jeffs E, Craddock L, Riley A, Green K, O'Driscoll M, Jiang D, Nunn T, Saeed S, Aleksy W, Seeber BU|title=Comparison of the benefits of cochlear implantation versus contra-lateral routing of signal hearing aids in adult patients with single-sided deafness: study protocol for a prospective within-subject longitudinal trial.|journal=BMC Ear Nose Throat Disord.|volume=14|pages=7|date=Aug 11, 2014|pmid=25152694|doi=10.1186/1472-6815-14-7|issue=1|pmc=4141989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25142577"/&gt;

==Prevention==
It is estimated that half of cases of hearing loss are preventable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=edited by John M.|last2=Baguley|first2=David M.|title=Ballantyne's Deafness.|date=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-470-74441-3|page=16|edition=7th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Of4TG61a0cQC&amp;pg=PA16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908010428/https://books.google.com/books?id=Of4TG61a0cQC&amp;pg=PA16|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 60% of hearing loss in children under the age of 15 can be avoided.&lt;ref name="WHO2015" /&gt; A number of preventative strategies are effective including: immunization against [[rubella]] to prevent [[congenital rubella syndrome]], immunization against ''[[H. influenza]]'' and ''[[S. pneumoniae]]'' to reduce cases of [[meningitis]], and avoiding or protecting against excessive noise exposure.&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] also recommends immunization against [[measles]], [[mumps]], and [[meningitis]], efforts to prevent [[premature birth]], and avoidance of certain medication as prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Childhood hearing loss: act now, here's how!|url=http://www.who.int/pbd/deafness/world-hearing-day/WHD2016_Brochure_EN_2.pdf|website=WHO|accessdate=2 March 2016|page=6|date=2016|quote=Over 30% of childhood hearing loss is caused by diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, meningitis and ear infections.

===Workplace noise regulation===
Noise is widely recognized as an [[occupational hazard]]. In the United States, the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) work together to provide standards and enforcement on workplace noise levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/|title=Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709222707/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/|archivedate=July 9, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/standards.html|title=Safety and Health Topics: Occupational Noise Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506050548/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/noisehearingconservation/standards.html|archivedate=May 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hierarchy of hazard control]]s demonstrates the different levels of controls to reduce or eliminate exposure to noise and prevent hearing loss, including [[engineering controls]] and [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noisecontrol/#The%2520Hierarchy%2520of%2520Control|title=Controls for Noise Exposure|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704113757/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noisecontrol/#The%2520Hierarchy%2520of%2520Control|archivedate=July 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other programs and initiative have been created to prevent hearing loss in the workplace. For example, the [[Safe-In-Sound Award|Safe-in-Sound Award]] was created to recognize organizations that can demonstrate results of successful noise control and other interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeinsound.us/|title=Excellence in Hearing Loss Prevention Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Safe-in-Sound|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527193835/http://www.safeinsound.us/|archivedate=May 27, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Buy Quiet]] program was created to encourage employers to purchase quieter machinery and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|title=Buy Quiet|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808151558/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html|archivedate=August 8, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By purchasing less noisy power tools like those found on the [[NIOSH Power Tools Database]] and limiting exposure to ototoxic chemicals, great strides can be made in preventing hearing loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wwwn.cdc.gov/niosh-sound-vibration/|title=PowerTools Database|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|publisher=|access-date=July 15, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630135841/http://wwwn.cdc.gov/niosh-sound-vibration/|archivedate=June 30, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies can also provide personal hearing protector devices tailored to both the worker and type of employment. Some hearing protectors universally block out all noise, and some allow for certain noises to be heard. Workers are more likely to wear hearing protector devices when they are properly fitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2010-136/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - Occupationally-Induced Hearing Loss (2010-136)|work=cdc.gov|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512031928/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2010-136/|archivedate=2016-05-12|df=|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2010136|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often interventions to prevent noise-induced hearing loss have many components. A 2017 Cochrane review found that stricter legislation might reduce noise levels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume = 7|pages = CD006396|last=Tikka|first=Christina|last2=Verbeek|first2=Jos H|last3=Kateman|first3=Erik|last4=Morata|first4=Thais C|last5=Dreschler|first5=Wouter A|last6=Ferrite|first6=Silvia|date=2017-07-07|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd006396.pub4|pmid = 28685503|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Providing workers with information on their noise exposure levels was not shown to decrease exposure to noise. Ear protection, if used correctly, can reduce noise to safer levels, but often, providing them is not sufficient to prevent hearing loss. Engineering noise out and other solutions such as proper maintenance of equipment can lead to noise reduction, but further field studies on resulting noise exposures following such interventions are needed. Other possible solutions include improved enforcement of existing legislation and better implementation of well-designed prevention programmes, which have not yet been proven conclusively to be effective. The conclusion of the Cochrane Review was that further research could modify what is now regarding the effectiveness of the evaluated interventions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Screening===
The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] recommends screening for all newborns.&lt;ref name=Las2014/&gt;

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] advises that children should have their hearing tested several times throughout their schooling:&lt;ref name="kid" /&gt;
*When they enter [[preschool|school]]
*At ages 6, 8, and 10
*At least once during [[middle school]]
*At least once during [[High school (North America)|high school]]
While the American College of Physicians indicated that there is not enough evidence to determine the utility of screening in adults over 50 years old who do not have any symptoms,&lt;ref name="annals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1309706 | title=Screening for Hearing Loss in Older Adults: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement | publisher=The American College of Physicians | work=Annals of Internal Medicine | first=Virginia A. | last=Moyer | date=2012-11-06 | volume=157 | issue=9 | pages=655–661 | accessdate=2012-11-06 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121027083232/http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1309706 | archivedate=2012-10-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Speech–Language–Hearing Association|American Language, Speech Pathology and Hearing Association]] recommends that adults should be screened at least every decade through age 50 and at 3-year intervals thereafter, to minimize the detrimental effects of the untreated condition on quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/public/hearing/Who-Should-be-Screened/|title=Who Should be Screened for Hearing Loss|website=www.asha.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, the US Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion included as one of [[Healthy People program|Healthy People 2020]] objectives: to increase the proportion of persons who have had a hearing examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/hearing-and-other-sensory-or-communication-disorders/objectives|title=Hearing and Other Sensory or Communication Disorders {{!}} Healthy People 2020|website=www.healthypeople.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318002053/https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/hearing-and-other-sensory-or-communication-disorders/objectives|archivedate=2017-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

Treatment depends on the specific cause if known as well as the extent, type and configuration of the hearing loss. Most hearing loss, that resulting from age and noise, is progressive and irreversible, and there are currently no approved or recommended treatments; management is by hearing aid. A few specific kinds of hearing loss are amenable to surgical treatment.  In other cases, treatment is addressed to underlying pathologies, but any hearing loss incurred may be  permanent.

There are a number of devices that can improve hearing in those who are deaf or hard of hearing or allow people with these conditions to manage better in their lives.

===Hearing aids===
[[Hearing aid]]s are devices that work to improve the hearing and speech comprehension of those with hearing loss.&lt;ref name="NIDCD"&gt;National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders(NIDCD)(2013).

Conversely, there are many people who choose not to wear their hearing aids for a multitude of reasons. Up to 40% of adults with hearing aids for hearing loss fail to use them, or do not use them to their full effect.&lt;ref name=Bark2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Fiona|last2=Mackenzie|first2=Emma|last3=Elliott|first3=Lynette|last4=Jones|first4=Simon|last5=de Lusignan|first5=Simon|date=2016-08-18|title=Interventions to improve hearing aid use in adult auditory rehabilitation|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD010342/ENT_interventions-improve-hearing-aid-use-adult-auditory-rehabilitation|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=8|pages=CD010342|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010342.pub3|pmid=27537242|issn=1465-1858}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of reasons for this, stemming from factors such as: the aid amplifying background noises instead of the sounds they intended to hear; issues with comfort, care, or maintenance of the device; aesthetic factors; financial factors; and personal preference for quietness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.evidentlycochrane.net/learning-love-hearing-aids/|title=Learning to love our hearing aids.

There is little evidence that interventions to encourage the regular use of hearing aids, (e.g. improving the information given to people about how to use hearing aids), increase daily hours of hearing aid use, and there is currently no agreed set of outcome measures for assessing this type of intervention.&lt;ref name=Bark2016/&gt;

===Assistive devices===
Many deaf and hard of hearing individuals use assistive devices in their daily lives:
* Individuals can communicate by telephone using [[Teleprinter|telephone typewriters]] (TTY). Other common names are textphone, minicom and telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD). These devices look like typewriters or word processors and transmit typed text over regular telephone lines. This allows communication through visual messaging. TTYs can transmit messages to individuals who don’t have TTY by using the National Relay service which is an operator that acts as a messenger to each caller.&lt;ref name="Working With Hearing Loss"&gt;Working with Hearing Loss. (2008). Retrieved October 31, 2014, from {{cite web |url=http://www.chha.ca/documents/Working_With_Hearing_Loss.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113030625/http://www.chha.ca/documents/Working_With_Hearing_Loss.pdf |archivedate=2014-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[mobile phones]], software apps are available to provide TDD/textphone functionality on some carriers/models to provide 2-way communications.
* There are several new [[telecommunications relay service]] technologies including [[IP Relay]] and [[captioned telephone]] technologies. A deaf or hard of hearing person can communicate over the phone with a hearing person via a human translator. Phone captioning is a service in which a hearing person's speech is captioned by a third party, enabling a deaf or hard of hearing person to conduct a conversation with a hearing person over the phone.&lt;ref name="phcapt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phonecaption.com/ | title=Free Phone Caption Service for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; | publisher=Phone Caption | accessdate=2010-12-10 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202061809/http://www.phonecaption.com/ | archivedate=2010-02-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wireless]], [[Internet]] and [[mobile phone]]/[[short message service|SMS]] [[text messaging]] are beginning to take over the role of the TDD. 
* [[Real-time text]] technologies, involving streaming text that is continuously transmitted as it is typed or otherwise composed. This allows conversational use of text. Software programs are now available that automatically generate a closed-captioning of conversations. Examples include discussions in conference rooms, teleconference calls, classroom lectures, and/or religious services.&lt;ref name="Interact-AS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.auditorysciences.com/ | title=Auditory Sciences | publisher=Auditory Sciences | accessdate= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513105437/http://auditorysciences.com/ | archivedate=2013-05-13 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[Instant messaging]] software. 
* [[Videophone]]s and similar video technologies can be used for distance communication using sign language. [[Video conferencing]] technologies permit signed conversations as well as permitting a [[Sign language#Telecommunications facilitated signing|sign language]]–English interpreter to voice and sign conversations between a deaf or hard of hearing person and that person's hearing party, negating the use of a [[teletypewriter|TTY device]] or [[computer keyboard]].
* [[Video relay service]] and [[video remote interpreting]] (VRI) services also use a third-party telecommunication service to allow a deaf or hard-of-hearing person to communicate quickly and conveniently with a hearing person, through a sign language interpreter.
* [[Hearing dog]]s are a specific type of [[assistance dog]] specifically selected and trained to assist the deaf and hard of hearing by alerting their handler to important sounds, such as [[doorbell]]s, [[smoke alarm]]s, ringing [[telephone]]s, or [[alarm clock]]s.
* The advent of the Internet's [[World Wide Web]] and [[closed captioning]] has given the deaf and hard of hearing unprecedented access to information. Electronic mail and online chat have reduced the need for deaf and hard-of-hearing people to use a third-party Telecommunications Relay Service to communicate with the hearing and other deaf people.
* A person with hearing loss cannot always hear the phone or distinguish their own ringtone from another. A signaling transmitter can be attached to a phone that will cause a light or a vibration device to activate. Transmitters can also be used to activate visual cues to represent fire alarms.&lt;ref name="Working With Hearing Loss" /&gt;
* Individuals with hearing loss require phones with [[amplifier]]s that have a higher power of amplification when compared to a regular phone. The Hearing Aid Telephone Interconnect System is a hands free amplification system which allows people to amplify sound when using telephones, cell phones, computer and pay phones by way of the attachment of a portable unit.&lt;ref name="Working With Hearing Loss" /&gt;

===Wireless hearing aids===
A wireless device has two main components: a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter broadcasts the captured sound, and the receiver detects the broadcast audio and enables the incoming audio stream to be connected to accommodations such as hearing aids or captioning systems.

Three types of wireless systems are commonly used: [[Frequency modulation|FM]], [[audio induction loop]], and InfraRed. Each system has advantages and benefits for particular uses. FM systems can be battery operated or plugged into an electrical outlet. FM system produce an analog audio signal, meaning they have extremely high fidelity. Many FM systems are very small in size, allowing them to be used in mobile situations. The audio induction loop permits the listener with hearing loss to be free of wearing a receiver provided that the listener has a hearing aid or cochlear implant processor with an accessory called a "[[telecoil]]". If the listener does not have a telecoil, then he or she must carry a receiver with an earpiece. As with FM systems, the [[infrared]] (IR) system also requires a receiver to be worn or carried by the listener. An advantage of IR wireless systems is that people in adjoining rooms cannot listen in on conversations, making it useful for situations where privacy and confidentiality are required. Another way to achieve confidentiality is to use a hardwired amplifier, which contains or is connected to a microphone and transmits no signal beyond the earpiece plugged directly into it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meyers|first1=Carol, Dr.|title=Infrared, Frequency/Digital Modulation, and Induction Hearing Loops : A comparison of assisted listening system technologies|url=http://tfwm.com/infrared-frequencydigital-modulation-and-induction-loops/|website=Technology for Worship|publisher=INSPIRATION Technology Conferences, Inc.|accessdate=30 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204103117/http://tfwm.com/infrared-frequencydigital-modulation-and-induction-loops/|archivedate=4 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgical===
[[File:Cochlear implant.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a [[cochlear implant]]]]
There is no treatment, surgical or otherwise, for hearing loss due to the most common causes (age, noise, and genetic defects).  For a few specific conditions, surgical intervention can provide a remedy:
 
*surgical correction of [[superior canal dehiscence]]
*[[myringotomy]], surgical insertion of drainage ventilation tubes in the tympanic membrane.  Such placement is usually temporary until the underlying pathology (infection or other inflammation) can be resolved.
*radiotherapy or surgical excision of [[vestibular schwannoma]] or acoustic neuroma, though, in most cases, it is unlikely that hearing will be preserved
*[[Stapedectomy]] and [[stapedotomy]] for otosclerosis - replacement or reshaping of the stapes bone of the middle ear can restore hearing in cases of conductive hearing loss

Surgical and implantable hearing aids are an alternative to conventional external hearing aids. 
If the ear is dry and not infected, an air conduction aid could be tried; if the ear is draining, a direct bone condition hearing aid is often the best solution. If the conductive part of the hearing loss is more than 30–35 [[Decibel|dB]], an air conduction device could have problems overcoming this gap. A [[bone-anchored hearing aid]] could, in this situation, be a good option.
The active bone conduction hearing implant Bonebridge is also an option. This implant is invisible under the intact skin and therefore minimises the risk of skin irritations.&lt;ref name="pmid25142577"/&gt;

[[Cochlear implants]] improve outcomes in people with hearing loss in either one or both ears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cochlear Implantation in Adults A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal=JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg | year=2013 | doi=10.1001/jamaoto.2013.1744 | pmid=23429927 | volume=139 | issue=3 | pages=265–72 | author=Gaylor James M., Raman Gowri, Chung Mei, Lee Jounghee, Rao Madhumathi, Lau Joseph, Poe Dennis S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They work by artificial stimulation of the [[cochlear nerve]] by providing an electric impulse substitution for the firing of hair cells. They are expensive, and require programming along with extensive training for effectiveness.

Cochlear implants as well as bone conduction implants can help with single sided deafness.
Middle ear implants or bone conduction implants can help with conductive hearing loss.&lt;ref name="pmid25142577"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors = Riss D, Arnoldner C, Baumgartner WD, Blineder M, Flak S, Bachner A, Gstoettner W, Hamzavi JS |title=Indication criteria and outcomes with the Bonebridge transcutaneous bone-conduction implant.|journal=Laryngoscope|volume= 124| issue = 12|pages=2802–2806|year=2014|pmid=25142577|doi=10.1002/lary.24832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with cochlear implants are at a higher risk for bacterial [[meningitis]]. Thus, meningitis vaccination is recommended.&lt;ref name="fda"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/safety/cochlear.html | title=FDA Public Health Notification: Risk of Bacterial Meningitis in Children with Cochlear Implants | publisher=FDA | date=2002-07-24 | accessdate=2008-11-09 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925005206/http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/safety/cochlear.html | archivedate=2008-09-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have hearing loss, especially those who develop a hearing problem in childhood or old age, may need support and technical adaptations as part of the rehabilitation process. Recent research shows variations in efficacy but some studies&lt;ref name="CI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cochlearimplant.net/page5/page5.html | title=Elliot &amp; Oliver's Story – Research | publisher=cochlearimplant.net | year=2006 | accessdate= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302225726/http://www.cochlearimplant.net/page5/page5.html | archivedate=2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that if implanted at a very young age, some profoundly impaired children can acquire effective hearing and speech, particularly if supported by appropriate rehabilitation.

===Classroom===
For a classroom setting, children with hearing loss often benefit from direct instruction and communication. One option for students is to attend a school for the Deaf, where they will have access to the language, communication, and education. Another option is to have the child attend a mainstream program, with special accommodation such as providing favorable seating for the child. Having the student sit as close to the teacher as possible improves the student's ability to hear the teacher's voice and to more easily read the teacher's lips. When lecturing, teachers can help the student by facing them and by limiting unnecessary noise in the classroom. In particular, the teacher can avoid talking when their back is turned to the classroom, such as while writing on a whiteboard.

Some other approaches for classroom accommodations include pairing deaf or hard of hearing students with hearing students. This allows the deaf or hard of hearing student to ask the hearing student questions about concepts that they have not understood. The use of CART (Communication Access Real Time) systems, where an individual types a captioning of what the teacher is saying, is also beneficial.&lt;ref name="CART Systems"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://deafness.about.com/cs/cart/a/cart.htm | title=CART Systems | publisher= | accessdate= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412011910/http://deafness.about.com/cs/cart/a/cart.htm | archivedate=2014-04-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The student views this captioning on their computer. Automated captioning systems are also becoming a popular option.&lt;ref name="Interact-AS"/&gt; In an automated system, software, instead of a person, is used to generate the captioning. Unlike CART systems, automated systems generally do not require an Internet connection and thus they can be used anywhere and anytime. Another advantage of automated systems over CART is that they are much lower in cost. However, automated systems are generally designed to only transcribe what the teacher is saying and to not transcribe what other students say. An automated system works best for situations where just the teacher is speaking, whereas a CART system will be preferred for situations where there is a lot of classroom discussion.

For those students who are completely deaf, one of the most common interventions is having the child communicate with others through an interpreter using sign language.&lt;ref name="GuideFacts"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/wp/access/hearing.html | title=An Educators Guide to Hearing Disability Issues.

Globally, hearing loss affects about 10% of the population to some degree.&lt;ref name=Oishi2011/&gt; It caused moderate to severe disability in 124.2&amp;nbsp;million people as of 2004 (107.9&amp;nbsp;million of whom are in low and middle income countries).&lt;ref name=WHO2008/&gt; Of these 65&amp;nbsp;million acquired the condition during childhood.&lt;ref name="Peads2011"/&gt; At birth ~3 per 1000 in [[developed countries]] and more than 6 per 1000 in [[developing countries]] have hearing problems.&lt;ref name="Peads2011" /&gt;

Hearing loss increases with age. In those between 20 and 35 rates of hearing loss are 3% while in those 44 to 55 it is 11% and in those 65 to 85 it is 43%.&lt;ref name=Las2014/&gt;

A 2017 report by the World Health Organization estimated the costs of unaddressed hearing loss and the cost-effectiveness of interventions, for the health-care sector, for the education sector and as broad societal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Global costs of unaddressed hearing loss and cost-effectiveness of interventions: a WHO report|last=World Health Organization|first=WHO|publisher=World Health Organization|year=2017|isbn=978-92-4-151204-6|location=Geneva|pages=5–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Globally, the annual cost of unaddressed hearing loss was estimated to be in the range of $750–790 billion [[International Dollars|international dollars]].

===United States===
Data from the United States in 2011-2012 found that rates of hearing loss has declined among adults aged 20 to 69 years, when compared with the results from an earlier time period (1999-2004). It also found that adult hearing loss is associated with increasing age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational level, and noise exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Howard J.|last2=Dobie|first2=Robert A.|last3=Losonczy|first3=Katalin G.|last4=Themann|first4=Christa L.|last5=Flamme|first5=Gregory A.|title=Declining Prevalence of Hearing Loss in US Adults Aged 20 to 69 Years|journal=JAMA Otolaryngology–Head &amp; Neck Surgery|language=en|doi=10.1001/jamaoto.2016.3527|pmid=27978564|pmc=5576493|volume=143|issue=3|pages=274–285|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly one in four adults had audiometric results suggesting noise-induced hearing loss. Almost one in four adults who reported excellent or good hearing had a similar pattern (5.5% on both sides and 18% on one side). Among people who reported exposure to loud noise at work, almost one third had such changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Yulia I|last2=Eichwald|first2=John|last3=Scinicariello|first3=Franco|last4=Hoffman|first4=Howard J.|last5=Deitchman|first5=Scott|last6=Radke|first6=Marilyn S.|last7=Themann|first7=Christa L.|last8=Breysse|first8=Patrick|date=2017-01-01|title=Vital Signs: Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Among Adults — United States 2011–2012|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6605e3.htm|journal=MMWR.

==History==
{{see also|History of deaf education in the United States}}
Abbé [[Charles-Michel de l'Épée]] opened the first school for the deaf in Paris at the [[Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris|deaf school]]. The American [[Thomas Gallaudet]] witnessed a demonstration of deaf teaching skills from Épée's successor [[Abbé Sicard]] and two of the school's deaf faculty members, [[Laurent Clerc]] and [[Jean Massieu]]; accompanied by Clerc, he returned to the United States, where in 1817 they founded [[American School for the Deaf]] in Hartford, Connecticut. [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) started to evolve from primarily [[French Sign Language]] (LSF), and other outside influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frishberg | first=Nancy | title=Arbitrariness and Iconicity: Historical Change in American Sign Language | journal=Language |date=September 1975 | volume=51 | issue=3 | pages=696–719 | doi=10.2307/412894| jstor=412894 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After language acquisition===
{{Main|Post-lingual deafness}}
''Post-lingual deafness'' is hearing loss that is sustained after the [[language acquisition|acquisition of language]], which can occur due to [[disease]], [[Physical trauma|trauma]], or as a side-effect of a medicine. Typically, hearing loss is gradual and often detected by family and friends of affected individuals long before the patients themselves will acknowledge the disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Carly|last2=Scarinci|first2=Nerina|last3=Ryan|first3=Brooke|last4=Hickson|first4=Louise|date=2015-12-01|title="This Is a Partnership Between All of Us": Audiologists' Perceptions of Family Member Involvement in Hearing Rehabilitation|url=https://aja.pubs.asha.org/article.aspx?articleid=2466851|journal=American Journal of Audiology|language=en|volume=24|issue=4|pages=536–548|doi=10.1044/2015_AJA-15-0026|pmid=26649683|issn=1059-0889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-lingual deafness is far more common than pre-lingual deafness. Those who lose their hearing later in life, such as in late adolescence or adulthood, face their own challenges, living with the adaptations that allow them to live independently.

===Before language acquisition===
{{Main|Prelingual deafness}}
''Prelingual deafness'' is hearing loss that is sustained before the [[language acquisition|acquisition of language]], which can occur due to a [[congenital]] condition or through hearing loss in early infancy. It is believed that prelingual deafness impairs an individual's ability to acquire a ''spoken'' language, but some deaf children can acquire spoken language through speech immersion along with support from sign language and hearing aids or cochlear implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davidson|first=Kathryn|last2=Lillo-Martin|first2=Diane|last3=Chen Pichler|first3=Deborah|date=2014-04-01|title=Spoken English Language Development Among Native Signing Children With Cochlear Implants|url=https://academic.oup.com/jdsde/article/19/2/238/377174|journal=The Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=238–250|doi=10.1093/deafed/ent045|pmid=24150489|issn=1081-4159|pmc=3952677}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-signing parents of deaf babies usually go with oral approach without the support of sign language because prelingual hearing loss is acquired via either disease or trauma rather than genetically inherited, so families with deaf children nearly always lack previous experience with [[sign language]]. Unfortunately, this brings on the risk of language deprivation for the deaf baby&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wyatte C.|date=2017-05-01|title=What You Don't Know Can Hurt You: The Risk of Language Deprivation by Impairing Sign Language Development in Deaf Children|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=21|issue=5|pages=961–965|doi=10.1007/s10995-017-2287-y|pmid=28185206|pmc=5392137|issn=1092-7875}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the deaf baby wouldn't have a language if the child is unable to acquire spoken language successfully. Deaf babies born into signing families rarely have delays in language development since they do meet language milestones, but in sign language in lieu of spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayberry|first=Rachel|date=2007|title=When timing is everything: Age of first-language acquisition effects on second-language learning|journal=Applied Psycholinguistics|volume=28|issue=3|pages=537–549|doi=10.1017/s0142716407070294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views of treatments===
There has been considerable controversy within the culturally deaf community over [[cochlear implant]]s. For the most part, there is little objection to those who lost their hearing later in life, or culturally deaf adults choosing to be fitted with a cochlear implant.&lt;ref name=Spa2005/&gt;

Many in the deaf community strongly object to a deaf child being fitted with a cochlear implant (often on the advice of an audiologist); new parents may not have sufficient information on raising deaf children and placed in an oral-only program that emphasizes the ability to speak and listen over other forms of communication such as [[sign language]] or [[total communication]]. Many Deaf people view cochlear implants and other hearing devices as confusing to one's identity. A Deaf person will never be a hearing person and therefore would be trying to fit into a way of living that is not their own. Other concerns include loss of [[Deaf culture]] and identity and limitations on hearing restoration.&lt;ref name=Spa2005/&gt;

Jack Gannon, a professor at [[Gallaudet University]], said this about [[Deaf culture]]: "Deaf culture is a set of learned behaviors and perceptions that shape the values and norms of deaf people based on their shared or common experiences." Some doctors believe that being deaf makes a person more social. Bill Vicar, from ASL University, shared his experiences as a deaf person, "[deaf people] tend to congregate around the kitchen table rather than the living room sofa… our good-byes take nearly forever, and our hellos often consist of serious hugs. When two of us meet for the first time we tend to exchange detailed biographies."&lt;ref&gt;Deaf Heritage: A Narrative History of Deaf America by Jack Gannon (National Association of the Deaf, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Deaf culture is not about contemplating what deaf people cannot do and how to fix their problems, an approach known as the "pathological view of the deaf."&lt;ref name=pathological&gt;{{cite web|title=American Deaf Culture|url=http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|work=Sign Media, Incorporated|publisher=Sign Media, Inc|accessdate=14 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522030209/http://www.signmedia.com/info/adc.htm|archivedate=22 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead deaf people celebrate what they can do. There is a strong sense of unity between deaf people as they share their experiences of suffering through a similar struggle. This celebration creates a unity between even deaf strangers. Bill Vicars expresses the power of this bond when stating, "if given the chance to become hearing most [deaf people] would choose to remain deaf."&lt;ref name="deafcultureonline"&gt;{{cite web | last=Drolsbaugh | first=Mark | title=Everything You've Wanted to Know About Deaf Culture (And Then Some) | url=http://www.deaf-culture-online.com/ | publisher=Deaf Culture Online | accessdate=2011-11-28 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213211737/http://www.deaf-culture-online.com/ | archivedate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States-based [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)|National Association of the Deaf]] has a statement on its website regarding cochlear implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=NAD Cochlear Implant Committee|title=NAD Position Statement on Cochlear Implants (2000)|url=http://nad.org/issues/technology/assistive-listening/cochlear-implants|website=Cochlear Implants %7c National Association of the Deaf|publisher=National Association of the Deaf|accessdate=30 November 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205174005/http://nad.org/issues/technology/assistive-listening/cochlear-implants|archivedate=5 December 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NAD asserts that the choice to implant is up to the individual (or the parents), yet strongly advocates a fully informed decision in all aspects of a cochlear implant. Much of the negative reaction to cochlear implants stems from the medical viewpoint that deafness is a condition that needs to be "cured," while the Deaf community instead regards deafness a defining cultural characteristic.

Many other assistive devices are more acceptable to the Deaf community, including but not limited to, hearing aids, [[closed captioning]], email and the Internet, text telephones, and video relay services.

===Sign language===
{{Main|Sign language}}
Sign languages convey meaning through manual communication and body language instead of acoustically conveyed sound patterns. This involves the simultaneous combination of hand shapes, orientation and movement of the hands, arms or body, and facial expressions to express a speaker's thoughts. "Sign languages are based on the idea that vision is the most useful tool a deaf person has to communicate and receive information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Sign Language|url=https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language#1|website=NIDCD|accessdate=17 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161115163913/https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language#1|archivedate=15 November 2016|df=|date=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Government policies====

[[File:Texas School for the Deaf main gate.jpg|thumb|[[Texas School for the Deaf]]]]
Those who are deaf (by either state or federal standards) have access to a free and appropriate public education. If a child does qualify as being deaf or hard of hearing and receives an individualized education plan, the [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]] team must consider, "the child's language and communication needs. The IEP must include opportunities for direct communication with peers and professionals. It must also include the student’s academic level, and finally must include the students full range of needs"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/hq9806.html |title=Deaf Students Education Services |accessdate=2016-01-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116005121/http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/hq9806.html |archivedate=2016-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmithDD2010"&gt;Smith, D. D., &amp; Tyler, N. C. (2010). Introduction to Special Education. Columbus: Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part, the Department of Education defines deafness as "… a hearing impairment that is so severe that the child is impaired in processing linguistic information through hearing, with or without amplification …." Hearing impairment is defined as "… an impairment in hearing, whether permanent or fluctuating, that adversely affects a child's educational performance but that is not included under the definition of deafness …."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulations: Part 300 / A / 300.8 / c|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/%2Croot%2Cregs%2C300%2CA%2C300%252E8%2Cc%2C|website=U.

====Inclusion versus pullout====
{{globalize|date=November 2014}}
[[File:Alexander Graham Bell and his Scott Circle School.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Graham Bell]] with teachers and students of the Scott Circle School for deaf children, Washington, D.C., 1883]]

In a residential school where all the children use the same communication system (whether it is a school using ASL, Total Communication or Oralism), students will be able to interact normally with other students, without having to worry about being criticized. An argument supporting inclusion, on the other hand, exposes the student to people who are not just like them, preparing them for adult life. Through interacting, children with hearing disabilities can expose themselves to other cultures which in the future may be beneficial for them when it comes to finding jobs and living on their own in a society where their disability may put them in the minority. These are some reasons why a person may or may not want to put their child in an inclusion classroom.&lt;ref name="SmithDD2010" /&gt;

====Family====
The communication limitations between people who are deaf and their hearing family members can often cause difficulties in family relationships, and affect the strength of relationships among individual family members. It was found that most people who are deaf have hearing parents, which means that the channel that the child and parents communicate through can be very different, often affecting their relationship in a negative way. If a parent communicates best verbally, and their child communicates best using sign language, this could result in ineffective communication between parents and children. Ineffective communication can potentially lead to fights caused by misunderstanding, less willingness to talk about life events and issues, and an overall weaker relationship. Even if individuals in the family made an effort to learn deaf communication techniques such as sign language, a deaf family member often will feel excluded from casual banter; such as the exchange of daily events and news at the dinner table. It is often difficult for people who are deaf to follow these conversations due to the fast-paced and overlapping nature of these exchanges. This can cause a deaf individual to become frustrated and take part in less family conversations. This can potentially result in weaker relationships between the hearing individual and their immediate family members. This communication barrier can have a particularly negative effect on relationships with extended family members as well. Communication between a deaf individual and their extended family members can be very difficult due to the gap in verbal and non-verbal communication. This can cause the individuals to feel frustrated and unwilling to put effort into communicating effectively. The lack of effort put into communicating can result in anger, miscommunication, and unwillingness to build a strong relationship.&lt;ref name="FOSTER"&gt;Foster, S. (1996). Communication experiences of deaf people: An ethnographic account. In I. Parasnis (Ed.), Cultural and language diversity of the deaf experience (pp. 117-136). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Community====
People who have hearing loss can often experience many difficulties as a result of communication barriers among them and other hearing individuals in the community. Some major areas that can be impacted by this are involvement in extracurricular activities and social relationships. For young people, extracurricular activities are vehicles for physical, emotional, social, and intellectual development. However, it is often the case that communication barriers between people who are deaf and their hearing peers and coaches/club advisors limit them from getting involved. These communication barriers make it difficult for someone with a hearing loss to understand directions, take advice, collaborate, and form bonding relationships with other team or club members. As a result, extracurricular activities such as sports teams, clubs, and volunteering are often not as enjoyable and beneficial for individuals who have hearing loss, and they may engage in them less often. A lack of community involvement through extracurricular activities may also limit the individual’s social network. In general, it can be difficult for someone who is deaf to develop and maintain friendships with their hearing peers due to the communication gap that they experience. They can often miss the jokes, informal banter, and "messing around" that is associated with the formation of many friendships among young people. Conversations between people who are deaf and their hearing peers can often be limited and short due to their differences in communication methods and lack of knowledge on how to overcome these differences. Deaf individuals can often experience rejection by hearing peers who are not willing to make an effort to find their way around communication difficulties. Patience and motivation to overcome such communication barriers is required by both the deaf or hard of hearing and hearing individuals in order to establish and maintain good friendships.&lt;ref name="FOSTER" /&gt;

Many people tend to forget about the difficulties that deaf children encounter, as they view the deaf child differently from a deaf adult. Deaf children grow up being unable to fully communicate with their parents, siblings and other family members. Examples include being unable to tell their family what they have learned, what they did, asking for help, or even simply being unable to interact in daily conversation. Deaf children have to learn sign language and to read lips at a young age, however they cannot communicate with others using it unless the others are educated in sign language as well. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing are faced with many complications while growing up, for example some children have to wear hearing aids and others require assistance from sign language (ASL) interpreters. The interpreters help them to communicate with other individuals until they develop the skills they need to efficiently communicate on their own. Although growing up for deaf children may entitle more difficulties than for other children, there are many support groups that allow deaf children to interact with other children. This is where they develop friendships. There are also classes for young children to learn sign language in an environment that has other children in their same situation and around their same age. These groups and classes can be very beneficial in providing the child with the proper knowledge and not to mention the societal interactions that they need in order to live a healthy, young, playful and carefree life that any child deserves.

There are three typical adjustment patterns adopted by adults with hearing loss. The first one is to remain withdrawn into your own self. This provides a sense of safety and familiarity which can be a comforting way to lead your life. The second is to act "as if" one does not even have hearing loss. A positive attitude will help people to live a life with no barriers and thus, engage in optimal interaction. The final and third pattern is for the person to accept their hearing loss as a part of them without undervaluing oneself. This means understanding that one is forced to live life with this disability, however it is not the only thing that constitutes life’s meaning. Furthermore, many feel as if their inability to hear others during conversation is their fault. It's important that these individuals learn how to become more assertive individuals who do not lack fear when it comes to asking someone to repeat something or to speak a little louder. Although there is much fatigue and frustration that is produced from one’s inability to hear, it is important to learn from personal experiences in order to improve on one’s communication skills. In essence, these patterns will help adults with hearing loss deal with the communication barriers that are present.&lt;ref name="SCHERER"&gt;Scherer, M. J. (2004). The Personal Meaning of Hearing or Vision Loss. ''Connecting To Learn Educational and Assistive Technology for People With Disabilities.'' (pp. 41-55). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Workplace====
In most instances, people who are deaf find themselves working with hearing colleagues, where they can often be cut off from the communication going on around them. Interpreters can be provided for meetings and workshops, however are seldom provided for everyday work interactions. Communication of important information needed for jobs typically comes in the form of written or verbal summaries, which do not convey subtle meanings such as tone of voice, side conversations during group discussions, and body language. This can result in confusion and misunderstanding for the worker who is deaf, therefore making it harder to do their job effectively. Additionally, deaf workers can be unintentionally left out of professional networks, informal gatherings, and casual conversations among their collogues. Information about informal rules and organizational culture in the workplace is often communicated though these types of interactions, which puts the worker who is deaf at a professional and personal disadvantage. This could sever their [[job performance]] due to lack of access to information and therefore, reduce their opportunity to form relationships with their co-workers. Additionally, these communication barriers can all affect a deaf person’s career development. Since being able to effectively communicate with one's co-workers and other people relevant to one's job is essential to managerial positions, people with hearing loss can often be denied such opportunities.&lt;ref name="FOSTER" /&gt;

To avoid these situations in the workplace, individuals can take full-time or part-time sign language courses. In this way, they can become better able to communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing. Such courses teach the American Sign Language (ASL) language as most North Americans use this particular language to communicate. It is a visual language made up of specific gestures (signs), hand shapes, and facial expressions that contain their own unique grammatical rules and sentence structures &lt;ref&gt;Sign Language Classes for Individuals. (2013, January 1). Retrieved November 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By completing sign language courses, it ensures that deaf individuals feel a part of the workplace and have the ability to communicate with their co-workers and employer in the manner as other hearing employees do.

====Health care====
Not only can communication barriers between deaf and hearing people affect family relationships, work, and school, but they can also have a very significant effect on a deaf individual’s physical and [[Deaf mental health care|mental health care]]. As a result of poor communication between the health care professional and the deaf or hard of hearing patient, many patients report that they are not properly informed about their disease and prognosis. 
&lt;ref name="Medicina"&gt;Medicina Oral, Patología Oral y Cirugía Bucal. (2007, January 1). Retrieved October 31, 2014, from {{Cite journal |url=http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?pid=S1698-69462007000800007&amp;script=sci_arttext |title=How to improve communication with deaf children in the dental clinic |journal=Medicina Oral, Patología Oral y Cirugía Bucal (Internet) |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=576–581 |accessdate=2014-11-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105235645/http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?pid=S1698-69462007000800007&amp;script=sci_arttext |archivedate=2014-11-05 |df= |date=12/2007 |last1=López |first1=Gallardo |last2=Esther |first2=Nuria |last3=Martínez |first3=Mourelle |last4=Rosa |first4=María |last5=García |first5=Nova |last6=De |first6=Joaquín |last7=San Bernardino Alsmark |first7=Silvia }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This lack of or poor communication could also lead to other issues such as misdiagnosis, poor assessments, mistreatment, and even possibly harm to patients. Poor communication in this setting is often the result of health care providers having the misconception that all people who are deaf or hard of hearing have the same type of hearing loss, and require the same type of communication methods. In reality, there are many different types and range of hearing loss, and in order to communicate effectively a health care provider needs to understand that each individual with hearing loss has unique needs. This affects how individuals have been educated to communicate, as some communication methods work better depending on an individual’s severity of hearing loss. For example, assuming every deaf or hard of hearing patient knows American Sign Language would be incorrect because there are different types of sign language, each varying in signs and meanings. A patient could have been educated to use cued speech which is entirely different from ASL.&lt;ref name="Medicina" /&gt; Therefore, in order to communicate effectively, a health care provider needs to understand that each individual has unique needs when communicating.

Although there are specific laws and rules to govern communication between health care professionals and people who are deaf, they are not always followed due to the health care professional’s insufficient knowledge of communication techniques. This lack of knowledge can lead them to make assumptions about communicating with someone who is deaf, which can in turn cause them to use an unsuitable form of communication. 
Acts in countries such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) state that all health care providers are required to provide reasonable communication accommodations when caring for patients who are deaf. These accommodations could include qualified sign language interpreters, CDIs, and technology such as Internet interpretation services. A qualified sign language interpreter will enhance communication between a deaf individual and a health care professional by interpreting not only a health professional’s verbal communication, but also their non-verbal such as expressions, perceptions, and body language. A Certified Deaf Interpreter (CDI) is a sign language interpreter who is also a member of the Deaf community.&lt;ref&gt;Ramstead, A. (2014, January 15). The Role of the Certified Deaf Interpreter. Retrieved November 2, 2014, from {{cite web |url=http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |title=The Role of the Deaf Interpreter |accessdate=2014-11-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141105190523/http://www.indemandinterpreting.com/role-certified-deaf-interpreter/ |archivedate=2014-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They accompany a sign language interpreter and are useful for communication with deaf individuals who also have language or cognitive deficits. A CDI will transform what the health care professional communicates into basic, simple language. This method takes much longer, however it can also be more effective than other techniques. Internet interpretation services are convenient and less costly, but can potentially pose significant risks. They involve the use of a sign language interpreter over a video device rather than directly in the room. This can often be an inaccurate form of communication because the interpreter may not be licensed, is often unfamiliar with the patient and their signs, and can lack knowledge of medical terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, G., Mistler, L., Torrey, K., &amp; Depukat, R. (2013). Bridging Communication Gaps with the Deaf. Nursing, 43(11), 24-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from utilizing interpreters, healthcare professionals can improve their communication with deaf or hard of hearing patients by educating themselves on common misconceptions and proper practices depending on the patient’s needs. For example, a common misconception is that exaggerating words and speaking loudly will help the patient understand more clearly. However, many individuals with hearing loss depend on lip-reading to identify words. Exaggerated pronunciation and a raised voice can distort the lips, making it even more difficult to understand. Another common mistake health care professionals make are the use of single words rather than full sentences. Although language should be kept simple and short, keeping context is important because certain homophonous words are difficult to distinguish by lip-reading. Health care professionals can further improve their own communication with their patients by eliminating any background noise and positioning themselves in a way where their face is clearly visible to the patient, and suitably lit. The healthcare professional should know how to use body language and facial expressions to properly communicate different feelings.&lt;ref name="Medicina" /&gt;

===Stem cell transplant and gene therapy===
A 2005 study achieved successful [[regrowth of cochlea cells]] in guinea pigs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | title=Gene therapy is first deafness 'cure' | work=NewScientist.com News Service | first=Andy | last=Coghlan | date=2005-02-14 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914114532/http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7003 | archivedate=2008-09-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the regrowth of cochlear hair cells does not imply the restoration of hearing sensitivity, as the sensory cells may or may not make connections with neurons that carry the signals from hair cells to the brain.

===Audition===
Besides research studies seeking to improve hearing, such as the ones listed above, research studies on the deaf have also been carried out in order to understand more about audition. Pijil and Shwarz (2005) conducted their study on the deaf who lost their hearing later in life and, hence, used cochlear implants to hear. They discovered further evidence for rate coding of pitch, a system that codes for information for frequencies by the rate that neurons fire in the auditory system, especially for lower frequencies as they are coded by the frequencies that neurons fire from the basilar membrane in a synchronous manner. Their results showed that the subjects could identify different pitches that were proportional to the frequency stimulated by a single electrode. The lower frequencies were detected when the basilar membrane was stimulated, providing even further evidence for rate coding.&lt;ref name="Carlson, N. R. 2010"&gt;Carlson, N. R. (2010).

'''Human nutrition''' deals with the provision of [[essential nutrient]]s in food that are necessary to support human [[life]] and [[health]]. Poor nutrition is a chronic problem often linked to poverty, [[food security]] or a poor understanding of nutrition and dietary practices.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children"&gt;Progress for Children: A Report Card on Nutrition (No. 4), UNICEF, May 2006, {{ISBN|978-92-806-3988-9}}. http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_33685.html&lt;/ref&gt; Malnutrition and its consequences are large contributors to deaths and [[Disability|disabilities]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions"&gt;World Health Organization.

== Overview ==
The human body contains chemical compounds, such as water, carbohydrates, [[amino acids]] (in [[proteins]]), [[fatty acids]] (in [[lipids]]), and [[nucleic acids]] ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]]). These compounds are composed of [[chemical element|elements]] such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus. Any study done to determine nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments, as well as the chemical composition of the whole diet and of all the materials [[excreted]] and eliminated from the body (including [[urine]] and feces). Comparing food to waste material can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized by the body.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} The effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period of time, during which all food and waste must be analyzed. The number of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] involved in such [[experiment]]s is high, making nutritional studies time-consuming and expensive, which explains why the science of human nutrition is still slowly evolving.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Nutrients==
{{Main article|Nutrient}}

The seven major classes of nutrients are [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s, [[dietary fiber|fiber]], [[dietary minerals|minerals]], [[protein]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[water]]. These nutrient classes are categorized as either [[macronutrients]] or [[micronutrients]] (needed in small quantities). The macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, fiber, proteins, and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.medicinejournal.co.uk/|title = Principles of Human Nutrition|last = Lean|first = Michael E.J.|date = 2015|journal = Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.mpmed.2014.11.009|pmid = |access-date = March 31, 2015|issue = 2|pages = 61–65|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The micronutrients are minerals and vitamins.&lt;ref name=WHO2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=World Health Organization, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|title=Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition|date=2004|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva [u.a.]|isbn=978-9241546126|edition=2.|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/9241546123/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built), and [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can also be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in [[Joule]]s or [[calorie|kilocalories]] (often called "Calories" and written with a capital 'C' to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17&amp;nbsp;kJ approximately (4&amp;nbsp;kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37&amp;nbsp;kJ (9&amp;nbsp;kcal) per gram,&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7167-4684-3 |page= 603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance.

Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class of dietary material, fiber (i.e., nondigestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear. For all age groups, males need to consume higher amounts of macronutrients than females. In general, intakes increase with age until the second or third decade of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/95E87FE64B144FA3CA2568A9001393C0|title = National Nutrition Survey: Nutrient Intakes and Physical Measurements|date = 1995|accessdate = |website = Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharides]] (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex [[polysaccharides]] (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomers]] bound to a [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Nelson2005&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Nelson DL, Cox MM |year=2005 |title=Lehninger's Principles of Biochemistry |edition=4th |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental  components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acids]], some of which are [[essential amino acids|essential]] in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs naturally when [[atrophy]] takes place, or during periods of starvation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Carbohydrates===
{{Main article|Carbohydrate}}

[[Image:Wheat products.jpg|thumb|upright|[[cereal|Grain]] products: rich sources of complex and simple carbohydrates]]

Carbohydrates may be classified as [[monosaccharide]]s, [[disaccharide]]s or [[polysaccharide]]s depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They are a diverse group of substances, with a range of chemical, physical and physiological properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/ejcn/journal/v61/n1s/pdf/1602936a.pdf|title = Carbohydrate terminology and classification|date = 2007|journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|doi = 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602936|pmid = 17992187|access-date = |volume=61 |pages=S5–S18|last1 = Cummings|first1 = J H|last2 = Stephen|first2 = A M}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make up a large part of foods such as [[rice]], [[noodles]], [[bread]], and other [[grain]]-based products,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carb-counter.net/breads/2320|title=Grams of Carbohydrates in White Bread - Carb Counter|website=www.carb-counter.net|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amrice.com/6-4.cfm|title=American Rice, Inc.|website=www.amrice.com|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not an essential nutrient, meaning a human does not need to eat carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westman|first=EC|date=May 2002|title=Is dietary carbohydrate essential for human nutrition?|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=75|issue=5|pages=951–3|pmid=11976176|doi=10.1093/ajcn/75.5.951a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more. Monosaccharides  include [[glucose]], [[fructose]] and [[galactose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/carbohydrates-contain-monosaccharides-1181.html|title = Carbohydrates That Contain Monosaccharides|date = |accessdate = |website = Healthy eating|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disaccharides include [[sucrose]], [[lactose]], and [[maltose]]; purified [[sucrose]], for instance, is used as table sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303914003338#|title = Principles of human nutrition|date = 2015|journal = Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.mpmed.2014.11.009|pmid = |access-date =|volume=43|issue = 2|pages=61–65|last1 = Lean|first1 = Michael E.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polysaccharides, which include [[starch]] and [[glycogen]], are often referred to as 'complex' carbohydrates because they are typically long multiple-branched chains of sugar units. The difference is that complex carbohydrates take longer to digest and absorb since their sugar units must be separated from the chain before absorption. The spike in [[blood glucose]] levels after ingestion of simple sugars is thought to be related to some of the heart and vascular diseases, which have become more common in recent times. Simple sugars form a greater part of modern diets than in the past, perhaps leading to more cardiovascular disease. The degree of causation is still not clear.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Simple carbohydrates are absorbed quickly, and therefore raise blood-sugar levels more rapidly than other nutrients. However, the most important plant carbohydrate nutrient, starch, varies in its absorption. Gelatinized starch (starch heated for a few minutes in the presence of water) is far more digestible than plain starch, and starch which has been divided into fine particles is also more absorbable during digestion. The increased effort and decreased availability reduces the available energy from starchy foods substantially and can be seen experimentally in rats and anecdotally in humans. Additionally, up to a third of dietary starch may be unavailable due to mechanical or chemical difficulty.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Fat===
{{Main article|Fat|Nutrition#Fat}}

A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several [[fatty acid]]s (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a [[glycerol]]. They are typically found as [[triglyceride]]s (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as [[saturated fat|saturated]] or [[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]] depending on the chemical structure of the fatty acids involved.{{mcn|date=December 2018}}  Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms [[Double bond|double-bonded]], so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as [[omega-3]] or [[omega-6]] fatty acids. [[Trans fats]] are a type of unsaturated fat with ''trans''-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) [[hydrogenation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Many studies have shown that consumption of unsaturated fats, particularly monounsaturated fats, is associated with better health in humans. Saturated fats, typically from animal sources, are next in order of preference, while trans fats are associated with a variety of disease and should be avoided.  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as [[butter]] or [[lard]]), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as [[olive oil]] or [[flaxseed oil]]). Trans fats are very rare in nature, but have properties useful in the [[food processing]] industry, such as rancidity resistance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Most fatty acids are not essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids – [[omega-3]] and [[omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids – seems also important for health, though definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these "omega" long-chain [[unsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] are [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for a class of [[eicosanoids]] known as [[prostaglandins]], which have roles throughout the human body. They are [[hormone]]s, in some respects. The omega-3 [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (LNA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g. weakly [[inflammation|inflammatory]] PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g., pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 [[linoleic acid]] (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins: one reason a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Fiber===
{{Main article|Dietary fiber}}

Dietary fiber is a [[carbohydrate]], specifically a polysaccharide, which is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized, it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram, but in most circumstances, it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. The two subcategories are insoluble and soluble fiber. Insoluble dietary fiber consists mainly of [[cellulose]], a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible by humans, because humans do not have the required enzymes to break it down, and the human digestive system does not harbor enough of the types of microbes that can do so.  Soluble dietary fiber comprises a variety of [[oligosaccharides]], [[waxes]], [[esters]], resistant starches, and other carbohydrates that dissolve or gelatinize in water. Many of these soluble fibers can be fermented or partially fermented by microbes in the human digestive system to produce short-chain fatty acids which are absorbed and therefore introduce some caloric content.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Whole grains, beans and other [[legumes]], fruits (especially [[plum]]s, [[prune]]s, and [[ficus|figs]]), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. Fiber is important to digestive health and is thought to reduce the risk of colon cancer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} For mechanical  reasons, fiber can help in alleviating both [[constipation]] and [[diarrhea]]. Fiber provides bulk to the intestinal contents, and insoluble fiber especially stimulates [[peristalsis]] – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move digesta along the digestive tract. Some soluble fibers produce a solution of high [[viscosity]]; this is essentially a gel, which slows the movement of food through the intestines. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, may help lessen insulin spikes and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Protein===
{{Main article|Protein (nutrient)}}

Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair) and form the [[enzyme]]s which catalyse chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of [[amino acids]] which contain nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance).  Amino acids are soluble in the digestive juices within the small intestine, where they are absorbed into the blood. Once absorbed, they cannot be stored in the body, so they are either metabolized as required or excreted in the urine.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Proteins consist of amino acids in different proportions. The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its [[amino acid]] composition.&lt;ref name="DRI"&gt;Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements, published by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board, currently available online at {{cite web|url=http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705140516/http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |archivedate=2014-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amino acids which an animal cannot synthesize on its own from smaller molecules are deemed essential.

===Minerals===
{{Main article|Mineral (nutrient)}}

Dietary minerals are the [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms, other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned – including several [[metals]], which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as [[calcium carbonate]] from ground [[oyster]] shells). Some are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most well-known is likely iodine in [[iodized salt]] which prevents [[goiter]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

====Essential dietary minerals====
include the following:{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Chlorine]] as [[chloride]] ions; very common electrolyte; see sodium, below.
* [[Magnesium]], required for processing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis, increases flexibility, increases alkalinity). Approximately 50% is in bone, the remaining 50% is almost all inside body cells, with only about 1% located in extracellular fluid. Food sources include oats, buckwheat, tofu, nuts, caviar, green leafy vegetables, legumes, and chocolate.&lt;ref name="mahan"&gt;{{cite book | title= Krausw's Food and the Nutrition Care Process |edition=13th  |publisher=Elsevier |location=St. Louis | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4377-2233-8 |author1=L. Kathleen Mahan |author2=Janice L. Raymond |author3=Sylvia Escott-Stump }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USDA DB"&gt;[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, SR26, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phosphorus]], required component of bones; essential for energy processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=D. E. C. Corbridge | title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology | edition=5th | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-444-89307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 80% is found in inorganic portion of bones and teeth. Phosphorus is a component of every cell, as well as important metabolites, including DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids. Also important in pH regulation. Food sources include cheese, egg yolk, milk, meat, fish, poultry, whole-grain cereals, and many others.&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt;
* [[Potassium]], a very common electrolyte (heart and nerve health). With sodium, potassium is involved in maintaining normal water balance, osmotic equilibrium, and acid-base balance. In addition to calcium, it is important in the regulation of neuromuscular activity. Food sources include bananas, avocados, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, fish, and mushrooms.&lt;ref name="USDA DB" /&gt;
* [[Sodium]], a very common electrolyte; not generally found in dietary supplements, despite being needed in large quantities, because the ion is very common in food: typically as [[sodium chloride]], or common salt.

====Trace minerals====
Many elements are required in smaller amounts (microgram quantities), usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=lipp&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lippard, S. J.  |author2=Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994 | isbn=978-0-935702-73-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trace mineral elements (RDA &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Cobalt]] as a component of the [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] family of [[coenzyme]]s
* [[Copper]] required component of many redox enzymes, including [[cytochrome c oxidase]]
* [[Chromium]] required for sugar metabolism
* [[Iodine]] required not only for the biosynthesis of [[thyroxin]], but probably, for other important organs as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus etc. (see [[Iodine deficiency]]); for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list, and sometimes classified with the macrominerals;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kapil|first=Umesh|date=2016-11-22|title=Health Consequences of Iodine Deficiency|journal=Sultan Qaboos University Medical Journal|volume=7|issue=3|pages=267–272|issn=2075-051X|pmc=3074887|pmid=21748117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found in iodized salt
* [[Iron]] required for many enzymes,  and for [[hemoglobin]] and some other proteins
* [[Manganese]] (processing of oxygen)
* [[Molybdenum]] required for [[xanthine oxidase]] and related oxidases
* [[Selenium]] required for [[peroxidase]] (antioxidant proteins)
* [[Zinc]] required for several enzymes such as [[carboxypeptidase]], [[Alcohol dehydrogenase#In humans|liver alcohol dehydrogenase]], [[carbonic anhydrase]]

===Vitamins===
{{Main article|Vitamin}}

As with the minerals discussed above, some vitamins are recognized as essential nutrients, necessary in the diet for good health. ([[Vitamin D]] is the exception: it can alternatively be synthesized in the skin, in the presence of [[UVB radiation]].) Certain vitamin-like compounds that are recommended in the diet, such as [[carnitine]], are thought useful for survival and health, but these are not "essential" dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds. Moreover, thousands of different [[phytochemicals]] have recently been discovered in food (particularly in fresh vegetables), which may have desirable properties including [[antioxidant]] activity (see below); experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive. Other essential nutrients not classed as vitamins include [[essential amino acid]]s (see [[#Protein|above]]), [[essential fatty acid]]s (see [[#Essential fatty acids|above]]), and the minerals discussed in the preceding section.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions: [[goiter]], [[scurvy]], [[osteoporosis]], impaired [[immune system]], disorders of cell [[metabolism]], certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature [[aging]], and poor [[psychology|psychological health]] (including [[eating disorders]]), among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2005 | title=Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | isbn=978-0-7817-4133-0| author=Shils | displayauthors=etal   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malnutrition==
{{Main article|Malnutrition}}

Malnutrition refers to insufficient, excessive, or imbalanced consumption of nutrients. In developed countries, the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption.
Although there are more people in the world who are malnourished due to excessive consumption, according to the United Nations [[World Health Organization]], the greatest challenge in developing nations today is not starvation, but insufficient nutrition – the lack of nutrients necessary for the growth and maintenance of vital functions. The causes of malnutrition are directly linked to inadequate macronutrient consumption and disease, and are indirectly linked to factors like “household food security, maternal and child care, health services, and the environment.” &lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt;

===Mental disorders===

Nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for major [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], the four most common mental disorders in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lakhan SE, Vieira KF |title= Nutritional therapies for mental disorders |journal= Nutr J |volume=7 |page=2 |year=2008 |pmid=18208598 |pmc= 2248201 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-7-2 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/7/1/2 |issue=1|last2= Vieira }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because Lakhan and Vieira mentioned that the supplements possess amino acids that may change into neurotransmitters and improve mental disorders. Supplements that have been studied most for mood elevation and stabilization include [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (each of which are an [[omega-3 fatty acid]] contained in [[fish oil]], but not in [[flaxseed oil]]), [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[folic acid]], and [[inositol]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Cancer===

Cancer has become common in developing countries. According to a study by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], "In the developing world, cancers of the liver, stomach and esophagus were more common, often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods, such as smoked or salted food, and parasitic infections that attack organs." Lung cancer rates are rising rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco. Developed countries "tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a 'Western lifestyle' – cancers of the colon, rectum, breast and prostate – that can be caused by obesity, lack of exercise, diet and age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Coren| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/03/09/cancer.study/index.html | title=Study: Cancer no longer rare in poorer countries | publisher= CNN | date=2005-03-10 | accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive worldwide report, "[[Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective]]", compiled by the [[World Cancer Research Fund]] and the [[American Institute for Cancer Research]], reports that there is a significant relation between lifestyle (including food consumption) and [[cancer prevention]]. The same report recommends eating mostly foods of plant origin and aiming to meet [[nutritional needs]] through diet alone, while limiting consumption of [[energy]]-dense foods, [[red meat]], [[alcoholic drink]]s and [[salt]] and avoiding [[sugary drink]]s, [[processed meat]] and moldy [[cereals]] (grains) or [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] (legumes). Protein consumption leads to an increase in [[IGF-1]], which plays a role in cancer development.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Metabolic syndrome and obesity===

Several lines of evidence indicate lifestyle-induced [[hyperinsulinemia]] and reduced insulin function (i.e. [[insulin resistance]]) as decisive factors in many disease states. For example, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are strongly linked to chronic inflammation, which in turn is strongly linked to a variety of adverse developments such as arterial microinjuries and [[clot]] formation (i.e. heart disease) and exaggerated cell division (i.e. cancer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fernández-García JC |title=Inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome: dietary modulation |url= |journal=Curr Vasc Pharmacol |year=2013 |volume= 11|issue=October |pages=1570–1611 |doi= |pmc= |pmid=24168441  |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (the so-called [[metabolic syndrome]]) are characterized by a combination of abdominal [[obesity]], elevated [[blood sugar]], elevated [[blood pressure]], elevated blood [[triglycerides]], and reduced HDL [[cholesterol]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Obesity can unfavourably alter hormonal and metabolic status via resistance to the hormone [[leptin]], and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin/[[leptin]] resistance and obesity aggravate one another. The vicious cycle is putatively fuelled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, as a result of high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the [[hypothalamus]] in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

There is a debate about how and to what extent different dietary factors – such as intake of processed carbohydrates, total protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake, intake of saturated and trans fatty acids, and low intake of vitamins/minerals – contribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance. Evidence indicates that diets possibly protective against metabolic syndrome include low saturated and [[trans fat]] intake and foods rich in [[dietary fiber]], such as high consumption of fruits and vegetables and moderate intake of low-fat dairy products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Feldeisen SE, Tucker KL |year= 2007|title=Nutritional strategies in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome |url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/h06-101?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&amp;#.UnaZ2FPDIwA |journal=Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism|volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=46–60 |doi=10.1139/h06-101 |pmc= |pmid=17332784 |accessdate=November 3, 2013|last2= Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global nutrition challenges==
The challenges facing global nutrition are disease, child malnutrition, obesity, and vitamin deficiency.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Disease===
The most common non-infectious diseases worldwide, that contribute most to the global mortality rate, are cardiovascular diseases, various cancers, diabetes, and chronic respiratory problems, all of which are linked to poor nutrition. Nutrition and diet are closely associated with the leading causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Obesity and high sodium intake can contribute to ischemic heart disease, while consumption of fruits and vegetables can decrease the risk of developing cancer.&lt;ref name=" GNP " /&gt;

Foodborne and infectious diseases can result in malnutrition, and malnutrition exacerbates infectious disease. Poor nutrition leaves children and adults more susceptible to contracting life-threatening diseases such as diarrheal infections and respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; According to the WHO, in 2011, 6.9 million children died of infectious diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, and neonatal conditions, of which at least one third were associated with undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNICEF 2012 Progress Report: Rapid progress in child survival|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2012/20120913_unicef_childsurvivalreport/en/|accessdate=28 May 2016|publisher=World Health Organization|date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ENA4"&gt;WHO.

Childhood [[malnutrition]] is common and contributes to the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Murray C, Lopez A | title = Global mortality, disability, and the contribution of risk factors: Global Burden of Disease Study | journal = Lancet | volume = 349 | issue = 9063 | pages = 1436–42 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9164317 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)07495-8| last2 = Lopez }}&lt;/ref&gt; Childhood is a particularly important time to achieve good nutrition status, because poor nutrition has the capability to lock a child in a vicious cycle of disease susceptibility and recurring sickness, which threatens cognitive and social development.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Undernutrition and bias in access to food and health services leaves children less likely to attend or perform well in school.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Undernutrition===
{{Main article|Undernutrition}}
UNICEF defines undernutrition “as the outcome of insufficient food intake (hunger) and repeated infectious diseases. Under nutrition includes being underweight for one’s age, too short for one’s age (stunted), dangerously thin (wasted), and deficient in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient malnutrient).&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Under nutrition causes 53% of deaths of children under five across the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; It has been estimated that undernutrition is the underlying cause for 35% of child deaths.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Black RE | year = 2008 | title = Maternal and child undernutrition: global and regional exposures and health consequences | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 371 | issue = 9608| pages = 243–260 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61690-0| pmid = 18207566 | author2 = and others | displayauthors = 1 | last3 = Bhutta | last4 = Caulfield | last5 = De Onis | last6 = Ezzati | last7 = Mathers | last8 = Rivera }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Maternal and Child Nutrition Study Group estimate that under nutrition, “including fetal growth restriction, stunting, wasting, deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc along with suboptimum breastfeeding- is a cause of 3.1 million child deaths and infant mortality, or 45% of all child deaths in 2011”.&lt;ref name="Maternal undernutrition" /&gt;

When humans are undernourished, they no longer maintain normal bodily functions, such as growth, resistance to infection, or have satisfactory performance in school or work.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Major causes of under nutrition in young children include lack of proper breast feeding for infants and illnesses such as diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; According to UNICEF 146 million children across the globe, that one out of four under the age of five, are underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The amount of underweight children has decreased since 1990, from 33 percent to 28 percent between 1990 and 2004.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Underweight and stunted children are more susceptible to infection, more likely to fall behind in school, more likely to become overweight and develop non-infectious diseases, and ultimately earn less than their non-stunted coworkers.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION"&gt;IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION &gt; UNICEF. (April 2013). IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION: The achievable imperative for global progress. http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_68661.html&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, undernutrition can accumulate deficiencies in health which results in less productive individuals and societies &lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Many children are born with the inherent disadvantage of low birth weight, often caused by intrauterine growth restriction and poor maternal nutrition, which results in worse growth, development, and health throughout the course of their lifetime.&lt;ref name="GNP" /&gt; Children born at low birthweight (less than 5.5 pounds or 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg), are less likely to be healthy and are more susceptible to disease and early death.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Those born at low birthweight also are likely to have a depressed immune system, which can increase their chances of heart disease and diabetes later on in life.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Because 96% of low birthweight occurs in the developing world, low birthweight is associated with being born to a mother in poverty with poor nutritional status that has had to perform demanding labor.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Stunting and other forms of undernutrition reduces a child’s chance of survival and hinders their optimal growth and health.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Stunting has demonstrated association with poor brain development, which reduces cognitive ability, academic performance, and eventually earning potential.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt;  Important determinants of stunting include the quality and frequency of infant and child feeding, infectious disease susceptibility, and the mother’s nutrition and health status.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Undernourished mothers are more likely to birth stunted children, perpetuating a cycle of undernutrition and poverty.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Stunted children are more likely to develop obesity and chronic diseases upon reaching adulthood.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Therefore, malnutrition resulting in stunting can further worsen the obesity epidemic, especially in low and middle income countries.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; This creates even new economic and social challenges for vulnerable impoverished groups.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt;

Data on global and regional food supply shows that consumption rose from 2011-2012 in all regions. Diets became more diverse, with a decrease in consumption of cereals and roots and an increase in fruits, vegetables, and meat products.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;FAO (2012). The state of food insecurity in the world 2012: Economic growth is necessary but not sufficient to accelerate reduction of hunger and malnutrition. Rome, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/ (Accessed 7 December 2012.).&lt;/ref&gt; However, this increase masks the discrepancies between nations, where Africa, in particular, saw a decrease in food consumption over the same years.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; This information is derived from food balance sheets that reflect national food supplies, however, this does not necessarily reflect the distribution of micro and macronutrients.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; Often inequality in food access leaves distribution which uneven, resulting in undernourishment for some and obesity for others.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;

Undernourishment, or hunger, according to the FAO, is dietary intake below the minimum daily energy requirement.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; The amount of undernourishment is calculated utilizing the average amount of food available for consumption, the size of the population, the relative disparities in access to the food, and the minimum calories required for each individual.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; According to FAO, 868 million people (12% of the global population) were undernourished in 2012.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; This has decreased across the world since 1990, in all regions except for Africa, where undernourishment has steadily increased.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;  However, the rates of decrease are not sufficient to meet the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger between 1990 and 2015.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; The global financial, economic, and food price crisis in 2008 drove many people to hunger, especially women and children. The spike in food prices prevented many people from escaping poverty, because the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on food and farmers are net consumers of food.&lt;ref name="UNSCN09"&gt;UNSCN (2009).

United Nations Standing Committee on Nutrition. http://www.unscn.org/en/publications/nutrition_briefs/#Nutrition_impacts_of_global_food_and_financial_crises.&lt;/ref&gt; High food prices cause consumers to have less purchasing power and to substitute more-nutritious foods with low-cost alternatives.&lt;ref name="IBRD"&gt;IBRD, World Bank (2012).

===Adult overweight and obesity===
{{main|Overnutrition|Obesity|Overweight}}
Malnutrition in industrialized nations is primarily due to excess calories and non-nutritious carbohydrates, which has contributed to the obesity epidemic affecting both developed and some developing nations.&lt;ref name=P4C48&gt;Darnton-Hill, Ian, C.

[[Vitamin A]] plays an essential role in developing the immune system in children, therefore, it is considered an essential micronutrient that can greatly affect health.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, because of the expense of testing for deficiencies, many developing nations have not been able to fully detect and address vitamin A deficiency, leaving vitamin A deficiency considered a silent hunger.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; According to estimates, subclinical vitamin A deficiency, characterized by low retinol levels, affects 190 million pre-school children and 19 million mothers worldwide.&lt;ref name="VitAWHO"&gt;WHO (2009).

===Infant and young child feeding===
Improvement of breast feeding practices, like early initiation and exclusive breast feeding for the first two years of life, could save the lives of 1.5 million children annually.&lt;ref name=ENA7&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13811-1 |title=How many child deaths can we prevent this year? |year=2003 |last1=Jones |first1=Gareth |last2=Steketee |first2=Richard W |last3=Black |first3=Robert E |last4=Bhutta |first4=Zulfiqar A |last5=Morris |first5=Saul S |journal=The Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9377 |pages=65–71 |pmid=12853204 |author6=Bellagio Child Survival Study Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition interventions targeted at infants aged 0–5 months first encourages early initiation of breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Though the relationship between early initiation of breast feeding and improved health outcomes has not been formally established, a recent study in [[Ghana]] suggests a causal relationship between early initiation and reduced infection-caused neo-natal deaths.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Also, experts promote exclusive breastfeeding, rather than using formula, which has shown to promote optimal growth, development, and health of infants.&lt;ref name=ENA2P7&gt;WHO.

==International food insecurity and malnutrition==
{{further information|Underweight|Food security|Epidemiology of malnutrition}}
According to UNICEF, South Asia has the highest levels of underweight children under five, followed by sub-Saharan Africans nations, with Industrialized countries and Latin nations having the lowest rates.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

=== United States===
In the United States, 2% of children are underweight, with under 1% [[stunted growth|stunted]] and 6% are [[wasting]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

In the US, [[dietitian]]s are registered (RD) or licensed (LD) with the Commission for Dietetic Registration and the American Dietetic Association, and are only able to use the title "dietitian," as described by the business and professions codes of each respective state, when they have met specific educational and experiential prerequisites and passed a national registration or licensure examination, respectively. In California, registered dietitians must abide by the {{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2585-2586.8|title=Business and Professions Code of Section 2585-2586.8|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111115758/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2585-2586.8|archivedate=2010-01-11|df=}}Anyone may call themselves a nutritionist, including unqualified dietitians, as this term is unregulated. Some states, such as the State of Florida, have begun to include the title "nutritionist" in state licensure requirements. Most governments provide guidance on nutrition, and some also impose [[mandatory labeling|mandatory disclosure/labeling]] requirements for processed food manufacturers and restaurants to assist consumers in complying with such guidance..{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In the US, nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the [[USDA|US Department of Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]]. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of a [[MyPlate|plate of food]] which in 2011 superseded the [[MyPyramid|MyPyramid food pyramid]] that had replaced the [[Four Food Groups]]. The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the ''Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee''. Committee hearings are often televised on [[C-SPAN]]. The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] provides a sample week-long menu which fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308032337/http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Canada's Food Guide]] is another governmental recommendation..{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

[[South Asia]] has the highest percentage and number of underweight children under five in the world, at approximately 78 million children.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Patterns of stunting and wasting are similar, where 44% have not reached optimal height and 15% are wasted, rates much higher than any other regions.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region of the world has extremely high rates of child underweight- 46% of its child population under five is underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan alone account for half the globe’s underweight child population.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; South Asian nations have made progress towards the [[MDGs]], considering the rate has decreased from 53% since 1990, however, a 1.7% decrease of underweight prevalence per year will not be sufficient to meet the 2015 goal.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Some nations, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Sri Lanka]], on the other hand, have made significant improvements, all decreasing their prevalence by half in ten years.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; While [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have made modest improvements, [[Nepal]] has made no significant improvement in underweight child prevalence.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Other forms of undernutrition have continued to persist with high resistance to improvement, such as the prevalence of stunting and wasting, which has not changed significantly in the past 10 years.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Causes of this poor nutrition include energy-insufficient diets, poor sanitation conditions, and the gender disparities in educational and social status.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Girls and women face discrimination especially in nutrition status, where South Asia is the only region in the world where girls are more likely to be underweight than boys.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In South Asia, 60% of children in the lowest quintile are underweight, compared to only 26% in the highest quintile, and the rate of reduction of underweight is slower amongst the poorest.&lt;ref name="UNMDG2011"&gt;UN (2011b). The Millennium Development Goals report 2011. New York, United Nations. http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/statistics/mdg-report-2011.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern/South Africa===

The Eastern and Southern African nations have shown no improvement since 1990 in the rate of underweight children under five.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; They have also made no progress in halving hunger by 2015, the most prevalent [[Millennium Development Goal]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This is due primarily to the prevalence of famine, declined agricultural productivity, food emergencies, drought, conflict, and increased poverty.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This, along with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], has inhibited the nutrition development of nations such as [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Swaziland]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Botswana]] has made remarkable achievements in reducing underweight prevalence, dropping 4% in 4 years, despite its place as the second leader in HIV prevalence amongst adults in the globe.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[South Africa]], the wealthiest nation in this region, has the second lowest proportion of underweight children at 12%, but has been steadily increasing in underweight prevalence since 1995.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Almost half of [[Ethiopian]] children are underweight, and along with [[Nigeria]], they account for almost one-third of the underweight under five in all of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===West/Central Africa===
West/[[Central Africa]] has the highest rate of children under five underweight in the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Of the countries in this region, the Congo has the lowest rate at 14%, while the nations of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]] are improving slowly.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In [[Gambia]], rates decreased from 26% to 17% in four years, and their coverage of vitamin A supplementation reaches 91% of vulnerable populations.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region has the next highest proportion of wasted children, with 10% of the population under five not at optimal weight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Little improvement has been made between the years of 1990 and 2004 in reducing the rates of underweight children under five, whose rate stayed approximately the same.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Sierra Leone]] has the highest child under five mortality rate in the world, due predominantly to its extreme infant mortality rate, at 238 deaths per 1000 live births.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Other contributing factors include the high rate of low birthweight children  (23%) and low levels of exclusive breast feeding  (4%).&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Anemia is prevalent in these nations, with unacceptable rates of iron deficient anemia.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The nutritional status of children is further indicated by its high rate of child wasting - 10%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  Wasting is a significant problem in Sahelian countries – [[Burkina Faso]], [[Chad]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Niger]] – where rates fall between 11% and 19% of under fives, affecting more than 1 million children.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Middle East/North Africa===

Six countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] region are on target to meet goals for reducing underweight children by 2015, and 12 countries have prevalence rates below 10%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, the nutrition of children in the region as a whole has degraded for the past ten years due to the increasing portion of underweight children in three populous nations – [[Iraq]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Forty six percent of all children in [[Yemen]] are underweight, a percentage that has worsened by 4% since 1990.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In Yemen, 53% of children under five are stunted and 32% are born at low birth weight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Sudan has an underweight prevalence of 41%, and the highest proportion of wasted children in the region at 16%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; One percent of households in Sudan consume iodized salt.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Iraq has also seen an increase in child underweight since 1990.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Djibouti]], [[Jordan]], the [[Occupied Palestinian Territory]] (OPT), [[Oman]], the [[Syrian Arab Republic]] and [[Tunisia]] are all projected to meet minimum nutrition goals, with OPT, Syrian AR, and Tunisia the fastest improving regions.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region demonstrates that undernutrition does not always improve with economic prosperity, where the [[United Arab Emirates]], for example, despite being a wealthy nation, has similar child death rates due to malnutrition to those seen in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

=== East Asia/Pacific===

The [[East Asia]]/Pacific region has reached its goals on nutrition, in part due to the improvements contributed by [[China]], the region’s most populous country.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; China has reduced its underweight prevalence from 19 percent to 8 percent between 1990 and 2002.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; China played the largest role in the world in decreasing the rate of children under five underweight between 1990 and 2004, halving the prevalence.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This reduction of underweight prevalence has aided in the lowering of the under 5 mortality rate from 49 to 31 of 1000. They also have a low birthweight rate at 4%, a rate comparable to industrialized countries, and over 90% of households receive adequate iodized salts.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, large disparities exist between children in rural and urban areas, where 5 provinces in China leave 1.5 million children iodine deficient and susceptible to diseases.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]] are all projected to reach nutrition MDGs.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Singapore]] has the lowest under five mortality rate of any nation, besides [[Iceland]], in the world, at 3%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Cambodia]] has the highest rate of child mortality in the region (141 per 1,000 live births), while still its proportion of underweight children increased by 5 percent to 45% in 2000. Further nutrient indicators show that only 12 per cent of Cambodian babies are exclusively breastfed and only 14 per cent of households consume [[iodized salt]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Latin America/Caribbean===

This region has undergone the fastest progress in decreasing poor nutrition status of children in the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  The [[Latin American]] region has reduced underweight children prevalence by 3.8% every year between 1990 and 2004, with a current rate of 7% underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; They also have the lowest rate of child mortality in the developing world, with only 31 per 1000 deaths, and the highest [[iodine]] consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Cuba]] has seen improvement from 9 to 4 percent underweight under 5 between 1996 and 2004.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The prevalence has also decreased in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Chile has a rate of underweight under 5, at merely 1%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The most populous nations, [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]], mostly have relatively low rates of underweight under 5, with only 6% and 8%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Guatemala]] has the highest percentage of underweight and stunted children in the region, with rates above 45%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; There are disparities amongst different populations in this region. For example, children in rural areas have twice the prevalence of underweight at 13%, compared to urban areas at 5%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

==Nutrition access disparities==

Occurring throughout the world, lack of proper nutrition is both a consequence and cause of poverty.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Impoverished individuals are less likely to have access to nutritious food and to escape from poverty than those who have healthy diets.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Disparities in [[socioeconomic]] status, both between and within nations, provide the largest threat to child nutrition in industrialized nations, where social inequality is on the rise.&lt;ref name=P4C43&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Organization, European Health Report 2005: Public health action for healthier children and populations|publisher=WHO Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen|date=2005|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/82435/E87325.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNICEF, children living in the poorest households are twice as likely to be [[underweight]] as those in the richest.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Those in the lowest wealth [[Household income in the United States#Quintiles|quintile]] and whose mothers have the least education demonstrate the highest rates of child mortality and [[stunted growth|stunting]].&lt;ref name="WHOstats"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO (2013b)|publisher=World health statistics. Geneva, World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/81965/1/9789241564588_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the developing world, socioeconomic inequality in childhood malnutrition is more severe than in upper income brackets, regardless of the general rate of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="VanP"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Van de Poel E|year=2008|title=Socioeconomic inequality in malnutrition in developing countries|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=86|issue=4|pages=241–320|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the greatest increase in [[childhood obesity]] has been seen in the lower middle income bracket.&lt;ref name="WHOglobe"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO (2011a). Global status report on noncommunicable diseases 2010|publisher=Geneva, World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/nmh/publications/ncd_report2010/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UNICEF, children in rural locations are more than twice as likely to be underweight as compared to children under five in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In Latin American/Caribbean nations, “Children living in rural areas in Bolivia, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua are more than twice as likely to be underweight as children living in urban areas. That likelihood doubles to four times in Peru.” &lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

In the United States, the incidence of low birthweight is on the rise among all populations, but particularly among [[minorities]].&lt;ref name=P4C45&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Polhamus B, etal |title=Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance 2003 Report, Table 18D|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta|date=2004|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pednss/pednss_tables/pdf/national_table18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UNICEF, boys and girls have almost identical rates as underweight children under age 5 across the world, except in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

==Nutrition policy==

===Nutrition interventions===
Nutrition directly influences progress towards meeting the Millennium Goals of eradicating hunger and poverty through health and education.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, nutrition interventions take a multi-faceted approach to improve the nutrition status of various populations. Policy and programming must target both individual behavioral changes and policy approaches to public health. While most nutrition interventions focus on delivery through the health-sector, non-health sector interventions targeting agriculture, water and sanitation, and education are important as well.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Global nutrition micro-nutrient deficiencies often receive large-scale solution approaches by deploying large governmental and non-governmental organizations. For example, in 1990, iodine deficiency was particularly prevalent, with one in five households, or 1.7 billion people, not consuming adequate iodine, leaving them at risk to develop associated diseases.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, a global campaign to iodize salt to eliminate iodine deficiency successfully boosted the rate to 69% of households in the world consuming adequate amounts of iodine.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Emergencies and crises often exacerbate undernutrition, due to the aftermath of crises that include food insecurity, poor health resources, unhealthy environments, and poor healthcare practices.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, the repercussions of natural disasters and other emergencies can exponentially increase the rates of macro and micronutrient deficiencies in populations.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Disaster relief interventions often take a multi-faceted public health approach. UNICEF’s programming targeting nutrition services amongst disaster settings include nutrition assessments, measles immunization, vitamin A supplementation, provision of fortified foods and micronutrient supplements, support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding for infants and young children, and therapeutic and supplementary feeding.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; For example, during Nigeria’s food crisis of 2005, 300,000 children received therapeutic nutrition feeding programs through the collaboration of UNICEF, the Niger government, the World Food Programme, and 24 NGOs utilizing community and facility based feeding schemes.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Interventions aimed at pregnant women, infants, and children take a behavioral and program-based approach. Behavioral intervention objectives include promoting proper breast-feeding, the immediate initiation of breastfeeding, and its continuation through 2 years and beyond.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; UNICEF recognizes that to promote these behaviors, healthful environments must be established conducive to promoting these behaviors, like healthy hospital environments, skilled health workers, support in the public and workplace, and removing negative influences.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Finally, other interventions include provisions of adequate micro and macro nutrients such as iron, anemia, and vitamin A supplements and vitamin-fortified foods and ready-to-use products.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Programs addressing micro-nutrient deficiencies, such as those aimed at anemia, have attempted to provide iron supplementation to pregnant and lactating women. However, because supplementation often occurs too late, these programs have had little effect.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Interventions such as women’s nutrition, early and exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate complementary food and micronutrient supplementation have proven to reduce stunting and other manifestations of undernutrition.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; A Cochrane review of community-based maternal health packages showed that this community-based approach improved the initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lassi|first=Zohra S.|last2=Bhutta|first2=Zulfiqar A.|date=2015-03-23|title=Community-based intervention packages for reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and improving neonatal outcomes|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=3|pages=CD007754|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007754.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25803792|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs have had adverse effects. One example is the “Formula for Oil” relief program in Iraq, which resulted in the replacement of breastfeeding for formula, which has negatively affected infant nutrition.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Implementation and delivery platforms===
In April 2010, the World Bank and the IMF released a policy briefing entitled “Scaling up Nutrition (SUN): A Framework for action” that represented a partnered effort to address the Lancet’s Series on under nutrition, and the goals it set out for improving under nutrition.&lt;ref name="SUN"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61086-7 |title=Global child and maternal nutrition—the SUN rises |year=2013 |last1=Nabarro |first1=David |journal=The Lancet |volume=382 |issue=9893 |pages=666–7 |pmid=23746773}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasized the 1000 days after birth as the prime window for effective nutrition intervention, encouraging programming that was cost-effective and showed significant cognitive improvement in populations, as well as enhanced productivity and economic growth.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; This document was labeled the SUN framework, and was launched by the [[UN General Assembly]] in 2010 as a road map encouraging the coherence of stakeholders like governments, [[academia]], UN system organizations and foundations in working towards reducing under nutrition.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; The SUN framework has initiated a transformation in global nutrition- calling for country-based nutrition programs, increasing evidence based and cost–effective interventions, and “integrating nutrition within national strategies for [[gender equality]], agriculture, [[food security]], [[social protection]], education, water supply, sanitation, and health care”.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; Government often plays a role in implementing nutrition programs through policy. For instance, several East Asian nations have enacted legislation to increase iodization of salt to increase household consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Political commitment in the form of evidence-based effective national policies and programs, trained skilled community nutrition workers, and effective communication and advocacy can all work to decrease malnutrition.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Market and industrial production can play a role as well. For example, in the [[Philippines]], improved production and market availability of iodized salt increased household consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; While most nutrition interventions are delivered directly through governments and health services, other sectors, such as agriculture, water and sanitation, and education, are vital for nutrition promotion as well.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt;

====Nutrition Education====
{{Main article|Nutrition Education}}
{{Main article|Food_studies#Food_and_Education}}

Nutrition is [[Teaching|taught]] in schools in many countries. In [[England and Wales]] the [[Personal and Social Education]] and Food Technology curricula include nutrition, stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging.  In many schools a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments.  In some American schools, students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes.  Nutrition is offered at many schools, and if it is not a class of its own, nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills, Independent Living, Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc.  In many Nutrition classes, students learn about the food groups, the food pyramid, Daily Recommended Allowances, calories, vitamins, minerals, malnutrition, physical activity, healthy food choices and how to live a healthy life.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A 1985 US [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report entitled ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'' concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Life Sciences. (1985). ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'', [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=597&amp;page=4  p. 4]. National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 20% of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate, required course. A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adams KM, Lindell KC, Kohlmeier M, Zeisel SH |title=Status of nutrition education in medical schools, |journal=Am.

====Protein====
The protein requirement for each individual differs, as do opinions about whether and to what extent physically active people require more protein. The 2005 [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDA), aimed at the general healthy adult population, provide for an intake of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt; A review panel stating that "no additional dietary protein is suggested for healthy adults undertaking resistance or endurance exercise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Pasquale|first=Mauro G.|title=Sports Nutrition: Energy metabolism and exercise|editor=Ira Wolinsky, Judy A.

====Carbohydrates====
The main fuel used by the body during exercise is carbohydrates, which is stored in muscle as glycogen – a form of sugar. During exercise, muscle glycogen reserves can be used up, especially when activities last longer than 90&amp;nbsp;min.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.extension.iastate.edu/humansciences/content/carbohydrate|title = Iowa State University: Extension and outreach|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the amount of glycogen stored in the body is limited, it is important for athletes participating in endurance sports such as marathons to consume carbohydrates during their events.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==History==
Humans have evolved as [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s over the past 250,000 years. The diet of early modern humans varied significantly depending on location and climate. The diet in the tropics tended to depend more heavily on plant foods, while the diet at higher latitudes tended more towards animal products. Analyses of postcranial and cranial remains of humans and animals from the Neolithic, along with detailed bone-modification studies, have shown that [[cannibalism]] also occurred among prehistoric humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.233.4762.431 |title=Cannibalism in the Neolithic |year=1986 |last1=Villa |first1=P. |last2=Bouville |first2=C. |last3=Courtin |first3=J. |last4=Helmer |first4=D. |last5=Mahieu |first5=E. |last6=Shipman |first6=P. |last7=Belluomini |first7=G. |last8= Branca |first8= M. |journal= Science |volume=233 |issue=4762 |pages=431–7 |pmid= 17794567|bibcode=1986Sci...233..431V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From antiquity to 1900===
[[Image:Anaxagoras.png|thumb|right|Anaxagoras]]
Around 3000 BC the [[Vedic texts]] made mention of scientific research on nutrition. The Bible's [[Book of Daniel]] recounts first recorded nutritional experiment.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} During an invasion of Judah, King [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] of [[Babylon]] captured Daniel and his friends. Selected as court servants, they were to share in the king's fine foods and wine. But they objected, preferring vegetables ([[Pulse (legume)|pulses]]) and water in accordance with their [[Jewish]] dietary restrictions. The king's chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Daniel and his friends received their diet for 10 days. On comparison with the king's men, they appeared healthier, and were allowed to continue with their diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=dan#en-NIV-21743 Daniel 1:5-16] ([http://www.lolcatbible.com/index.php?title=Daniel_1#5 alternative translation])&lt;/ref&gt; Around 475 BC, [[Anaxagoras]] stated that food is absorbed by the human body and therefore contained "homeomerics" (generative components), suggesting the existence of nutrients.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;  Around 400 BC, [[Hippocrates]] said: "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7433.0-g |title='Let food be thy medicine…' |year=2004 |last1=Smith |first1=R. |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7433 |pages=0–g |pmc=318470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th-century scientist and artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) compared [[metabolism]] to a burning candle.  In 1747 Dr. [[James Lind]], a physician in the British navy, performed the first attested [[science|scientific]] nutrition experiment, discovering that [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice saved sailors who had been at sea for years from [[scurvy]], a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. The discovery was ignored{{by whom|date=November 2014}} for forty years, but after about 1850 British sailors became known as "[[limey]]s". (Scientists would not identify the essential [[vitamin C]] within lime juice until the 1930s.){{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Around 1770 [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the "Father of Nutrition and Chemistry", discovered the details of metabolism, demonstrating that the [[oxidation]] of food is the source of body heat.  In 1790 [[George Fordyce]] recognized [[calcium]] as necessary for fowl survival.  In the early 19th century, the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] were recognized{{by whom|date=November 2014}} as the primary components of food, and methods to measure their proportions were developed.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1816 [[François Magendie]] discovered that dogs fed only [[carbohydrates]] and [[fat]] lost their body [[protein]] and died in a few weeks, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein as an essential dietary component.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In 1840, [[Justus Liebig]] discovered the chemical makeup of carbohydrates ([[sugar]]s), fats ([[fatty acid]]s) and proteins ([[amino acid]]s).  In the 1860s [[Claude Bernard]] discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood [[glucose]] can be stored as fat or as [[glycogen]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} In the early 1880s [[Kanehiro Takaki]] observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed [[beriberi]] (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1896 [[Eugen Baumann]] observed [[iodine]] in thyroid glands.  In 1897, [[Christiaan Eijkman]] worked with natives of [[Java (island)|Java]], who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi, but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, demonstrating that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===From 1900 to the present===
In the early 20th century [[Carl von Voit]] and [[Max Rubner]] independently measured [[calorie|caloric]] energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition. In 1906, Wilcock and [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Hopkins]] showed that the amino acid [[tryptophan]] was necessary for the survival of rats. He{{who|date=November 2014}} fed them a special mixture of food containing all the nutrients he believed were essential for survival, but the rats died. A second group of rats to which he also fed an amount of milk containing [[vitamins]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinemann 2e Biology Activity Manual by Judith Brotherton and Kate Mundie{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gowland Hopkins]] recognized "accessory food factors" other than calories, protein and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], as [[Organic compound|organic]] materials essential to health but which the body cannot synthesize. In 1907 [[Stephen M. Babcock]] and [[Edwin B. Hart]] conducted the [[single-grain experiment]]. This experiment ran through 1911.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1912 [[Casimir Funk]] coined the term [[vitamin]] to label a vital factor in the diet: from the words "vital" and "amine," because these unknown substances preventing scurvy, beriberi, and [[pellagra]], were thought then to derive from ammonia. The vitamins were studied{{by whom|date=November 2014}} in the first half of the 20th century. In 1913 [[Elmer McCollum]] discovered the first vitamins, fat-soluble [[vitamin A]] and water-soluble [[vitamin B]] (in 1915; later identified as a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named [[vitamin C]] as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy. [[Lafayette Mendel]] (1872-1935) and [[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Osborne]] (1859–1929) also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919 Sir [[Edward Mellanby]] incorrectly identified [[rickets]] as a vitamin A deficiency, because he could cure it in dogs with [[cod-liver oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 |title=Unraveling the Enigma of Vitamin D |publisher=United States National Academy of Sciences |date=April 29, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204111737/http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 |archivedate=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil but found it still cured rickets, thus identifying [[vitamin D]]. Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discovered [[Tocopherol|vitamin E]] as essential for rat pregnancy, and originally called it "food factor X" until 1925.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1925 Hart discovered that [[iron]] absorption requires trace amounts of [[copper]]. In 1927 [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus]] synthesized vitamin D, for which he won the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1928. In 1928 [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] isolated [[ascorbic acid]], and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy. In 1935 he synthesized it, and in 1937 won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. Szent-Györgyi concurrently elucidated much of the [[citric acid cycle]]. In the 1930s [[William Cumming Rose]] identified [[essential amino acid]]s, necessary protein components which the body cannot synthesize. In 1935 [[Eric Underwood]] and [[Hedley Marston]] independently discovered the necessity of [[cobalt]]. In 1936 [[Eugene Floyd Dubois]] showed that work and school performance relate to caloric intake. In 1938 [[Erhard Fernholz]] discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E. It was synthesised by [[Paul Karrer]] (1889–1971).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

From 1940 [[rationing in the United Kingdom]] – during and after World War II – took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by [[Elsie Widdowson]] and others. In 1941 the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] established the first [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDAs). In 1992 the U.S. Department of Agriculture introduced the [[Food Guide Pyramid]]. In 2002 a [[Natural Justice]] study showed a relation between nutrition and violent behavior. In 2005 a study found that in addition to bad nutrition, [[adenovirus]] may cause obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00479.2005 |laysummary=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-01/aps-coi012506.php |laysource= The American Physiological Society |laydate= January 30, 2006 |title= Adipogenic potential of multiple human adenoviruses in vivo and in vitro in animals |year= 2006 |last1=Whigham |first1=Leah D. |last2 = Israel |first2= Barbara A. |last3=Atkinson |first3=Richard L. |journal= American Journal of Physiology |volume=290 |pages=R190–4 |pmid=16166204 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[healthcare industry]], '''information continuity''' is the process by which information relevant to a patient's care is made available to both the patient and the provider at the right place and the right time, to facilitate ongoing health care management and [[continuity of care]].

This is an extension of the concept of "Continuity of Care," which is defined by the [http://www.aafp.org American Academy of Family Physicians] in their [http://www.aafp.org/x6694.xml Continuity of Care definition] as "the process by which the patient and the physician are cooperatively involved in ongoing health care management toward the goal of high quality, cost-effective medical care."

There is a non-Information Technology  reference to "Informational continuity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haggerty JL, Reid RJ, Freeman GK, Starfield BH, Adair CE, McKendry R |title=Continuity of care: a multidisciplinary review |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7425 |pages=1219–21 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14630762 |pmc=274066 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7425.1219 |url=http://bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14630762}}&lt;/ref&gt; — the use of information on past events and personal circumstances to make current care appropriate for each individual. This exists with "Management continuity" and "Relational continuity."

Information continuity in the information technology sense may exist alongside physical care continuity, such as when a medical chart arrives with a patient to the hospital. Information continuity may also be separate, such as when a patient's electronic records are sent to a treating physician before the patient arrives at a care site.

Creating information continuity in health care typically involves the use of health information technology to link systems using standards. Information continuity will become more and more important as patients in health care systems expect that their treating physicians have all of their medical information across the health care spectrum.

This use of this term in health information technology initiated at [[Seattle, Washington]], at the [[Group Health Cooperative]] non-profit care system to describe activities including data sharing, allergy and medication reconciliation, and interfacing of data between health care institutions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4564">[[File:JamesLind.jpg|thumb|James Lind 1716–1794]]
The '''James Lind Alliance''' is a British non-profit making initiative, established in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(04)17494-1/fulltext The Lancet, Volume 364, Issue 9449, Pages 1923 - 1924, 27 November 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; It was established to bring [[patients]], carers and clinicians together, in Priority Setting Partnerships, to identify and prioritise the unanswered questions about treatments that they agree are most important. The intention is to ensure that those who fund health research are aware of what matters to  patients, carers and clinicians.

From 1 April 2013, the secretariat of the James Lind Alliance has been hosted by the National Institute for Health Research Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre (NETSCC). Its work includes recruiting and training JLA Advisers, coordinating Priority Setting Partnerships, communications and liaising with other parts of the [[National Institute for Health Research]] (NIHR). In 2016 the James Lind Alliance was granted with the Societal Award of the Foundation Federation of Dutch Medical Scientific Societies (Federa) for their initiative to bring patients into partnerships for research priorities &lt;ref&gt;https://federa.org/Participation%20by%20patients%20in%20science&lt;/ref&gt;
  
== Background ==

Research on the effects of treatments often overlooks the shared interests of patients and clinicians. As a result, questions they both consider important are not addressed. The pharmaceutical and medical technology industries and academia play essential roles in developing new treatments, but their priorities are not necessarily the same as those of patients and clinicians. For this reason many areas of potentially valuable research are neglected. Bringing patients and clinicians together to prioritise questions in treatment uncertainty is thought to be rare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/extract/336/7650/903 British Medical Journal 2008;336:903-904 (26 April), ] {{doi|10.1136/bmj.39547.586100.80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method of operation ==

The James Lind Alliance brings together patients and patient representatives, carers and clinicians, as individuals or represented by groups, to form Priority Setting Partnerships, focusing on specific health conditions. For example, the Asthma Priority Setting Partnership was led by [[Asthma UK]] and the [[British Thoracic Society]], while the Urinary Incontinence Priority Setting Partnership was led by the Bladder &amp; Bowel Foundation [http://www.bladderandbowelfoundation.org] and the Cochrane Incontinence Group [http://www.incontinence.cochrane.org], part of the [[Cochrane Collaboration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nursingtimes.net/ntclinical/2008/05/identifying_uncertainties_to_prioritise_research.html Nursing Times (2008);  104: 18, 38–39]&lt;/ref&gt;

Priority Setting Partnerships work together to gather uncertainties about the effects of treatments. The uncertainties are all checked to ensure they cannot be answered by existing knowledge, research or sources of information.

The uncertainties then go through a process of prioritisation, which aims to culminate in a top ten list of priorities for research, shared by patients, [[carers]] and clinicians. To date, the process has been completed for over 40 health areas including Asthma, Urinary Incontinence, Anaesthetics and Perioperative Care, Vitiligo, Intensive Care, Prostate Cancer, Cystic Fibrosis and Surgery for Common Shoulder Problems.

== James Lind ==

The Alliance is named after a pioneer of [[clinical trials]], [[James Lind]] (1716–1794). Two hundred and fifty years ago, there were many conflicting ideas and unanswered questions about how to treat the deadly disease [[scurvy]]. Lind, a Scottish naval surgeon, decided to confront this uncertainty by treating his patients within a clinical trial comparing six of the proposed remedies. His trial showed that oranges and lemons were dramatically better than the other supposed treatments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/articles/who-was-james-lind-and-what-exactly-did-he-achieve/ James Lind Library, biography of James Lind]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3586">[[File:Breastfeeding-icon-med.svg|thumb|200px|The International Breastfeeding Symbol]]

'''Lactivism''' (a [[portmanteau]] of "[[lactation]]" and "[[activism]]") is the doctrine or practice of vigorous action or involvement as a means of achieving a breastfeeding culture, sometimes by demonstrations, protests, etc. of [[breastfeeding]].&lt;ref name="Harmon" /&gt; Supporters, referred to as "'''lactivists'''", seek to protest the violation of International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes by formula companies and industry. 

One form that lactivism takes is the staging of a "nurse-in" (a play on "[[sit-in]]"), which involves women gathering in public to nurse their children, usually to protest incidents in which a nursing mother was asked to cover up or leave a location because she was nursing.&lt;ref name="MSNBC November 16, 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS News September 8, 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USA Today November 20, 2006" /&gt;

During nurse-ins, nursing mothers often wear clothing with the [[International Breastfeeding Symbol]] on it, to show their solidarity.&lt;ref name="mothering" /&gt;

Another form of lactivism is acting as support for mothers that wish to nurse. Lactivists provide information and share resources on successful nursing.

Many lactivists choose to breastfeed their children over bottle feeding, seeing this as the natural way to provide nutrition. It is claimed that breastfeeding provides a bonding experience superior to that or bottle feeding. Lactivists may also argue that bottle feeding is costlier than breastfeeding as it requires a multitude of items, and the money saved from breastfeeding can be spent on other useful items for the child. Multiple health organizations recommend breast milk as the primary source of nutrition for babies, including the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], the [[American Medical Association]], and the [[World Health Organization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3473">'''Mandated choice''' or '''mandatory choice''' is an approach to public policy questions in which people are required by law to state in advance whether or not they are willing to engage in a particular action.  The approach contrasts with "opt-in" and "opt-out" ("presumed consent") models of policy formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health-news/2008/10/27/remedying-donor-organ-complications-91466-22122353/ Remedying donor organ complications]&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach has most frequently been applied to cadaveric organ donation,&lt;ref&gt;Herz, Susan.  Two Steps to Three Choices: A New Approach to Mandated Choice, ''Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics'' (1999), 8 : 340-347 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; but has increasingly been considered for [[advance directives]] as well.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;Appel, Jacob M.  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/the-ultimate-prescription_b_247558.html The Ultimate Prescription: Make Us Decide How We Want To Die], July 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  One bioethicist, in advocating for a mandatory choice model for [[living wills]], argues that "while all Americans should have a right to decide how they want their lives to end, it does not follow that they should be able to avoid confronting such a choice."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

==History==

One of the first considerations of mandated choice appeared in [[Great Britain]]'s Gore Report, a 1989-1990 study funded by the British Department of Health. From 2011 all those applying for or renewing driving licences online in the UK are required to state whether they wished to donate their organs.&lt;ref&gt;Organ donated 'nudge' for drivers in new DVLA process, BBC, July 31, 2011 [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14341553, accessed July 31, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Medical Association]] endorsed a mandated choice model for organ donation in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Taking organs without asking, Chicago Tribune, July 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practicalities==
It has been suggested that individuals could be compelled to choose as part of tax returns, driver's licence applications, and/or state benefits claims.&lt;ref&gt;Chouhan P and H Draper.  Modified Mandated Choice for Organ Procurement  ''J Med Ethics''. 2003;29(3):157-162, at p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public attitudes==

A 1992 survey found that 90% of American college students favored a mandated choice model for organ donation, compared with only 60% who favored presumed consent.&lt;ref&gt;Spital, Aaron.  Mandated Choice:  The Preferred Solution to the Organ Shortage?  ''Arch Intern Med''. 1992;152(12):2421-2424.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Texas implemented such a program, requiring drivers to make a choice on organ donation when obtaining licenses, and found that 80% of drivers declined to donate.&lt;ref&gt;Kolata, Gina.  Families Are Barriers to Many Organ Donations, Study Finds.  ''The New York Times'', July 7, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic debate==
Chouhan and Draper propose a modified scheme of mandated choice, in which though all patients are given a choice whether to donate they are actively encouraged to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Chouhan P and H Draper.  Modified Mandated Choice for Organ Procurement  ''J Med Ethics''. 2003;29(3):157-162, at p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13964">[[Mental illnesses]], also known as [[psychiatric disorders]], can be poorly portrayed in terms of factual accuracy. In different forms of entertainment, such as movies, television shows, books, magazines, and news, those living with mental illness are sometimes shown to be stereotypically violent and unpredictable, unlike how many of those with mental illnesses truly are. Due to the potential for inaccurate portrayals of people with mental illnesses, some people believe that those with mental illnesses should be shunned away from society, locked away in [[mental institutions]], heavily medicated, or a combination of the three. However, not only are those with these disorders able to function normally in society, but they can also lead highly successful jobs and careers, as well as make important contributions to society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsappweb.rutgers.edu/centers/stigma/people.php |title=Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology |publisher=Gsappweb.rutgers.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217222151/http://gsappweb.rutgers.edu/centers/stigma/people.php |archivedate=2014-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

 Public (or social) stigma is the awareness of stereotypes that the public and society holds about people who are living with mental illnesses.&lt;ref name="paradox"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corrigan |first1=PW |last2=Watson |first2=AC |title=The paradox of self-stigma and mental illness |journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |issue=9 |pages=35–53 |year=2002 |doi=10.1093/clipsy.9.1.35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In movies this often means portraying characters as physically violent and unpredictable, like in the 1978 movie Halloween, in which the villain is a patient that escaped from a mental institution. Public stigma also involves prejudice, or ascribing to stereotypes with negative emotional reactions like fear and avoidance.&lt;ref name="paradox"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corrigan |first1=PW |last2=Watson |first2=AC |title=Understanding the Impact of Stigma on People with Mental Illness |journal=World Psychiatry |year=2002 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=16–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corrigan |first1=PW |title=Target Specific Stigma Change: A Strategy for Impacting Mental Illness Stigma |journal=Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal |year=2004 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=113–120 |doi=10.2975/28.2004.113.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this would be avoiding someone who has been hospitalized for treatment for a mental illness after viewing the movie Halloween.

==News==
In 2012, [[India Knight]] wrote a column in London's ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' about depression. Fellow columnist, [[Alastair Campbell]] of [[The Huffington Post]] was ashamed to read her article mentioning how "'everybody gets depressed'" and also saying "there is no [[social stigma|stigma]] in depression".

In his article, Campbell discusses the wrongfulness in her word choice. By saying everyone gets depressed is showing that she is a part of that world that either does not accept depression is a disease or they do not believe it is a disease.

Campbell claims that Knight's article reinforces the reality that there is still stigma and taboo surrounding depression. He goes on to explain how even in the medical profession, people are afraid to mention to their employers that they have it simply because they would not fully understand like they would understand a physical illness such as the flu.

Ending his article, Campbell mentions the fight to bring awareness and understanding to mental illness and describing Knight's article as, "unhelpful, potentially damaging and certainly showed we still have quite a way to go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/alastair-campbell/india-knight-depression-campbell-time-to-change_b_1950371.html |title=Media Portrayal of Depression: We've Still Got a Long Way to Go &amp;#124; Alastair Campbell |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schizophrenics are often portrayed as dangerous, violent, and as criminals despite the fact that the large majority of them are not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hand|first1=Lindsey Jo|title=The portrayal of schizophrenia in television: An experiment assessing how viewers attitudes are affected.|url=http://digitalscholarship.unlv.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1247&amp;context=thesesdissertations|publisher=University of Nevada, Las Vegas|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Sideways]]'' gives an accurate depiction of [[depression (mood)|depression]]. One of the movie's main characters, Miles Raymond, is shown to exhibit several signs of depression, some of which include using substances ([[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]) in an attempt to cope with the failures and losses in his life, not having hope for his future, and having a consistently depressed mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/depression/index.shtml |title=NIMH · Depression |publisher=Nimh.nih.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Julien Donkey Boy]]'' gives an accurate depiction of [[schizophrenia]]. The movie features a man named Julien who exhibits several signs of schizophrenia. One of said signs includes having conversations with people who, in reality, are not actually there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml |title=NIMH · Schizophrenia |publisher=Nimh.nih.gov |date=2013-08-06 |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
Throughout the world of television mental illnesses have been showcased throughout the years within many programs; for example, the hit television show on the A&amp;E network ''[[Hoarders]]'', starts off with showcasing one or two individuals on their Obsessive compulsive disorder. Each individual would work with a psychologist or psychiatrist, professional organizer, or an “extreme cleaning specialist” which are individuals who specialize in treatment for this exact compulsive disorder.  Mental illness and treatments using the media as a platform stated in “Issues of Mental Health (p.593) “The role of documentary shows like Hoarders in the change of classification is unclear. However, some believe the rise in awareness caused by them was a significant contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;Marchland, Shoshana; Phillips McEnany, Geoffry (September 2012). "Hoarding's place in the DSM-5: Another symptom, or a newly listed disorder?". Issues in Mental Health Nursing 33: 593–597&lt;/ref&gt; The article also stated that with the rise of “Hoarder” becoming a “buzzword” it began to command significant amount of professional attention.

''[[Intervention (TV series)|Intervention]]'', another program on the A&amp;E network, also focuses on mental illness but, in this program it introduces the aspect of substance abuse. This program, like Hoarders follows the story on either one or two individuals who suffer from substance dependence and we are then taken into their day-to-day lives living with this dependence. Later the individual with the addiction is then given an ultimatum in which they decide the future of their well-being. For example, they would either go to rehabilitation or risk losing family, friends, shelter and in most cases financial assistance. The documentary style television program also brought in celebrity subjects to draw more attention to how important and powerful an intervention can effect anyone. What this show educates the viewers about was the intervention process. Being introduced to the intervention process and the way to properly handle an individual with addiction. This television program also eased the stigma on therapy; but more specifically the stigma on the effectiveness of interventions.

===Children's Television===
Children's television programs contain references to mental illnesses. A study conducted on a variety of New Zealand Children's television shows showed that a mental illness reference appeared in 59 out of 128 episodes studied. 159 mental illness references where contained in the 59 episodes.The 159 references consisted of vocabulary and character descriptions. The terms "mad", "crazy', and "losing your mind" were above the three most common vocabulary references. Character descriptions consisted of disfigured facial features (teeth, noses, etc.) as well as disfigured extremities (feet, fingers, etc.). &lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Claire, et al. “How Mental Illness Is Portrayed in Children's Television: A Prospective Study.” British Journal of Psychiatry, vol. 176, no. 5, 2000, pp. 440–443., doi:10.1192/bjp.176.5.440.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Media ==
Studies have shown that social media can have an impact on how mental illness is portrayed and also can be linked to its development, according to Patrick Robinson&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://link-springer-com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00127-018-1571-5.pdf|title=Measuring attitudes towards mental health using social media|last=Robinson|first=Patrick|date=24 July 2018|website=EBSCOhost|archive-url=https://link-springer-com.libezp.lib.lsu.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00127-018-1571-5.pdf|archive-date=24 July 2018|dead-url=|access-date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Social media has been known to create stigmas towards mental health that are not being made towards physical health. He conducts a study on Twitter and discovers that things such as [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]], anxiety, or depression are used in a way that takes away the seriousness from the mental illness. One example of how social media can have an effect on mental health is how people use Instagram and other forms of media to compare themselves to others' posts. "Facebook depression" leads to problems such as reclusiveness which can negatively damage one's health by creating feelings of loneliness and [[Self-esteem|low self-esteem]] among young people" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stefanone|first=Michael A.|last2=Lackaff|first2=Derek|last3=Rosen|first3=Devan|date=January 2011|title=Contingencies of Self-Worth and Social-Networking-Site Behavior|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2010.0049|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=14|issue=1-2|pages=41–49|doi=10.1089/cyber.2010.0049|issn=2152-2715|access-date=2018-10-18|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Traditional mainstream media portrays unrealistic, idealized, and sexualized body types for women and also men. Ladies having a heavier body type are less likely to be portrayed in a romantic situation. This depiction can lead to the [[body shaming]] of females who do not have the 'ideal' body type. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Body Image in Children|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781412952606.n54|work=Encyclopedia of Children, Adolescents, and the Media|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=9781412905305|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
The following list of statistics was obtained from studies done in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;YoungMindsUk. “Mental Health Stats.” YoungMinds, youngminds.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/mental-health-stats/.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Between 1 in 12 and 1 in 15  children are estimated to purposely [[self-harm]].
*Over the past decade the number of young persons hospitalized due to self-inflicted injuries has risen 68%.
*Over 50% of adults with some form of mental illness were diagnosed as a child, and less than half of these people were treated properly at the time.
*Nearly 80,000 minors suffer from severe depression; over 8,000 of them are under the age of 10.
*72% of kids have some type of emotional or behavioral problem.
*95% of minors who are [[imprisoned]] have at least one mental disorder; many of them are suffering from more than one.
*The number of people between the ages of 15 and 16 with depression nearly doubled between the 1980s and 2000s.
*The proportion of minors with conduct disorder who were between the ages of 15 and 16 more than doubled between the years of 1974 and 1999.

*5.8% of those between 5 and 16&amp;nbsp;years have some form of [[conduct disorder]].
*3.3% of those between the ages of 5 and 16 have some type of [[anxiety]] disorder.
*1.5% of those aged between 5 and 16&amp;nbsp;years have a severe form of [[ADHD]].
*0.9% of all people aged between 5 and 16&amp;nbsp;years have a form of severe depression.

A professional in midwifery is known as a [[midwife]].

A 2013 [[Cochrane review]] concluded that "most women should be offered midwifery-led continuity models of care and women should be encouraged to ask for this option although caution should be exercised in applying this advice to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications."&lt;ref name="Sandall2013"/&gt;  The review found that midwifery-led care was associated with a reduction in the use of [[epidurals]], with fewer [[episiotomies]] or instrumental births, and a decreased risk of losing the baby before 24 weeks' gestation. However, midwifery-led care was also associated with a longer mean length of labor as measured in hours.&lt;ref name="Sandall2013"/&gt;

==Main areas of midwifery==
=== Pregnancy ===
{{Main article|Pregnancy|Prenatal care}}

==== First trimester ====
Trimester means "3 months." A normal pregnancy lasts about 9 months and has 3 trimesters.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus" /&gt;

First trimester screening varies by country. Women are typically offered a [[Pap smear]] and [[urine analysis]] (UA), and blood tests including a [[complete blood count]] (CBC), [[blood group|blood typing]] (including Rh screen), [[syphilis]], [[hepatitis]], [[HIV]], and [[rubella]] testing.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus" /&gt; Additionally, women may have [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] testing via a urine sample, and women considered at high risk are screened for [[Sickle Cell disease]] and [[Thalassemia]].&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus" /&gt; Women must consent to all tests before they are carried out. The woman's [[blood pressure]], height and weight are measured.  Her past pregnancies and family, social, and medical history are discussed.  Women may have an [[ultrasound]] scan during the first trimester which may be used to help find the [[Estimated date of confinement|estimated due date]].  Some women may have genetic testing, such as screening for [[Down's Syndrome]].  Diet, exercise, and discomforts such as [[morning sickness]] are discussed.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000544.htm | title=Prenatal care in your first trimester | publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | date=1 July 1015 | accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second trimester====
The mother visits the [[midwife]] monthly or more often during the second trimester.  The mother's partner and/or the labor coach may accompany her.  The [[midwife]] will discuss pregnancy issues such as fatigue, heartburn, varicose veins, and other common problems such as back pain.
Blood pressure and weight are monitored and the [[midwife]] measures the mother's abdomen to see if the baby is growing as expected.  Lab tests such as a UA, CBC, and [[glucose tolerance test]] are done if the [[midwife]] feels they are necessary.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus2"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000557.htm | title=Prenatal care in your second trimester | publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | date=1 July 2015 | accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third trimester====
In the third trimester the [[midwife]] will see the mother every two weeks until week 36 and every week after that.  Weight, blood pressure, and abdominal measurements will continue to be done.  Lab tests such as a CDC and UA may be done with additional testing done for at-risk pregnancies.  The [[midwife]] palpates the woman's abdomen to establish the lie, presentation and position of the fetus and later, the engagement. A pelvic exam may be done to see if the mother's cervix is dilating.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus3"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000558.htm | title=Prenatal care in your third trimester | publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | date=6 November 2014 | accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[midwife]] and the mother discuss birthing options and write a birth care plan.

=== Childbirth ===
==== Labor and delivery ====

{{Main article|Childbirth}}

Midwives are qualified to assist with a normal vaginal delivery while more complicated deliveries are handled by a health care provider who has had further training.  Childbirth is divided into four stages. 
 
:'''First stage of labor''' The first stage of labour involves the opening of the cervix.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewomens.org.au/health-information/pregnancy-and-birth/labour-birth/stages-of-labour/|title=Stages of Labour|last=|first=|date=|website=The women's: The Royal Women's Hospital|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early parts of this stage the cervix will become soft and thin thus preparing for the delivery of the baby.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first stage of labour is complete when the cervix has dilated the full 10cm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the first stage of labor the mother begins to feel strong and regular contractions that come every 5 to 20 minutes and last 30 to 60 seconds.  Contractions gradually become stronger, more frequent, and longer lasting.

:'''Second stage of labor''' During the second stage the baby begins to move down the birth canal.  As the baby moves to the opening of the vagina it "crowns", meaning the top of the head can be seen at the vaginal entrance. At one time an "episiotomy", (an incision in the tissue at the opening of the vagina) was done routinely because it was believed that it prevented excessive tearing and healed more readily than a natural tear.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic" /&gt;   However, more recent research shows that a surgical incision may be more extensive than a natural tear, and is more likely to contribute to later incontinence and pain during sex than a natural tear would have.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/episiotomy/ART-20047282?p=1 | title=Labor and delivery, postpartum care | publisher=Mayo Clinic | date=30 July 2015 | accessdate=15 August 2015 | author=Mayo Clinic staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The [[midwife]] assists the baby as needed and when fully emerged, cuts the umbilical cord.  If desired, the baby's father may cut the cord.  In the past the cord was cut shortly after birth, but there is growing evidence that delayed cord-cutting may benefit the infant.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus4"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://consumer.healthday.com/women-s-health-information-34/birth-health-news-61/delaying-umbilical-cord-clamping-might-boost-child-development-699710.html | title=Delaying Umbilical Cord Clamping Might Boost Child Development | last=Mozes | first= Alan | date=26 May 2015 | accessdate=18 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Third stage of labor'''   The third stage of labour is where the mother must deliver the [[placenta]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order for the mother to do this they may need to push. Just like the contractions in the first stage of labour they may experience one or two of these.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The midwife may assist the mother in delivering the placenta by gently pulling on the umbilical cord.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

:'''Fourth stage of labor'''  The fourth stage of labor is the period beginning immediately after the birth and extending for about six weeks.  The [[World Health Organization]] describes this period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/documents/postnatal-care-recommendations/en/ | title=WHO recommendations on postnatal care of the mother and newborn | publisher=WHO | accessdate=22 December 2014 | author=WHO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until recently babies were routinely removed from their mothers following birth, however beginning around 2000, some authorities began to suggest that early skin-to-skin contact (placing the naked baby on the mother's chest) is of benefit to both mother and infant. As of 2014, early skin-to-skin contact is endorsed by all major organizations that are responsible for the well-being of infants.&lt;ref name="Medscape"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/806325_9 | title=Uninterrupted Skin-to-Skin Contact Immediately After Birth | publisher=Medscape | accessdate=21 December 2014 | author=Phillips, Raylene}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, to help establish bonding and successful breastfeeding, the midwife carries out immediate mother and infant assessments as the infant lies on the mother's chest and removes the infant for further observations only after they have had their first breastfeed.

Following the birth, if the mother had an [[episiotomy]] or a tearing of the [[perineum]], it is stitched. The [[midwife]] does regular assessments for uterine contraction, [[fundal height]],&lt;ref name="Maternal-Newborn Care"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.atitesting.com/ati_next_gen/skillsmodules/content/maternal-newborn/equipment/postpart_assessment.html | title=Postpartum Assessment | publisher=ATI Nursing Education | accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vaginal bleeding.&lt;ref name="Labor and Delivery:  Postpartum Care"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/labor-and-delivery/in-depth/postpartum-care/art-20047233 | title=Postpartum care: What to expect after a vaginal delivery | publisher=Mayo Clinic | accessdate=23 December 2014 | author=Mayo clinic staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout labor and delivery the mother's [[vital signs]] (temperature, blood pressure, and pulse) are closely monitored and her fluid intake and output are measured. The [[midwife]] also monitors the baby's pulse rate, palpates the mother's abdomen to monitor the baby's position, and does vaginal checks as needed.  If the birth deviates from the norm at any stage, the [[midwife]] requests assist from a more highly trained health care provider.

==== Birthing positions ====
{{Main article|Childbirth positions}}

Until the last century most women have used both the upright position and alternative positions to give birth.  The [[lithotomy position]] was not used until the advent of forceps in the seventeenth century and since then childbirth has progressively moved from a woman supported experience in the home to a medical intervention within the hospital.
There are significant advantages to assuming an upright position in labor and birth, such as stronger and more efficient uterine contractions aiding cervical dilatation, increased pelvic inlet and outlet diameters and improved uterine contractility.&lt;ref name="Factors influencing maternal positions during labor"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.instituteofmidwifery.org/MSFinalProj.nsf/a9ee58d7a82396768525684f0056be8d/45f9de25c6ca395e85257715003dad3f?OpenDocument | title=Factors influencing maternal positions during labor | date=April 2010 | accessdate=10 August 2015 | author=Searle, Lorraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upright positions in the second stage include sitting, squatting, kneeling, and being on hands and knees.&lt;ref name="Gelis122-134"&gt;Gelis, Jacues. History of Childbirth. Boston: Northern University Press, 1991: 122-134&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postpartum period===
{{Main article|Postpartum period}}

For women who have a hospital birth, the minimum hospital stay is six hours. Women who leave before this do so against medical advice. Women may choose when to leave the hospital. Full postnatal assessments are conducted daily whilst inpatient, or more frequently if needed. A postnatal assessment includes the woman's observations, general well being, breasts (either a discussion and assistance with breastfeeding or a discussion about lactation suppression), abdominal palpation (if she has not had a caesarean section) to check for involution of the uterus, or a check of her caesarean wound (the dressing doesn't need to be removed for this), a check of her perineum, particularly if she tore or had stitches, reviewing her lochia, ensuring she has passed urine and had her bowels open and checking for signs and symptoms of a DVT. The baby is also checked for jaundice, signs of adequate feeding, or other concerns. The baby has a nursery exam between six and seventy two hours of birth to check for conditions such as heart defects, hip problems, or eye problems.

In the community, the community midwife sees the woman at least until day ten. This does not mean she sees the woman and baby daily, but she cannot discharge them from her care until day ten at the earliest. Postnatal checks include neonatal screening test (NST, or heel prick test) around day five. The baby is weighed and the [[midwife]] plans visits according to the health and needs of mother and baby. They are discharged to the care of the health visitor.

===Care of the newborn===
{{Further information|Newborn}}

At birth, the baby receives an [[Apgar score]] at, at the least, one minute and five minutes of age. This is a score out of 10 that assesses the baby on five different areas—each worth between 0 and 2 points. These areas are: colour, respiratory effort, tone, heart rate, and response to stimuli. The [[midwife]] checks the baby for any obvious problems, weighs the baby, and measure head circumference. The [[midwife]] ensures the cord has been clamped securely and the baby has the appropriate name tags on (if in hospital). Babies lengths are not routinely measured. The [[midwife]] performs these checks as close to the mother as possible and returns the baby to the mother quickly. Skin-to-skin is encouraged, as this regulates the baby's heart rate, breathing, oxygen saturation, and temperature—and promotes bonding and breastfeeding.

In some countries, such as Chile, the midwife is the professional who can direct neonatal intensive care units. This is an advantage for these professionals, because this professionals can use the knowledge in perinatology to bring a high quality care of the newborn, with medical or surgical conditions.

==Midwifery-led continuity of care==

Midwifery-led continuity of care is where one or more midwives have the primary responsibility for the [[continuity of care]] for childbearing women, with a multidisciplinary network of consultation and referral with other health care providers. This is different from "medical-led care" where an obstetrician or family physician is primarily responsible. In "shared-care" models, responsibility may be shared between a [[midwife]], an obstetrician and/or a family physician.&lt;ref name=Sandall2013&gt;Sandall J et al.  Midwife-led continuity models versus other models of care for childbearing women. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2013 Aug 21;8:CD004667. {{doi|10.1002/14651858.CD004667.pub3}}. {{PMID|23963739}}&lt;/ref&gt; The midwife plays a very unique role is part of very intimate situations with the mother. For this reason, many say that the most important thing to look for in a midwife is comfortability with them, as one will go to them with every question or problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20101005/30273|title=The midwife: Your best friend in natal care|date=2010-10-05|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Cochrane review]] of public health systems in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, "most women should be offered midwifery-led continuity models of care and women should be encouraged to ask for this option although caution should be exercised in applying this advice to women with substantial medical or obstetric complications."  Midwifery-led care has effects including the following:&lt;ref name=Sandall2013/&gt;
*a reduction in the use of epidurals, with fewer episiotomies or instrumental births. 
*a longer mean length of labour as measured in hours
*increased chances of being cared for in labour by a [[midwife]] known by the childbearing woman
*increased chances of having a spontaneous vaginal birth 
*decreased risk of preterm birth
*decreased risk of losing the baby before 24 weeks' gestation, although there appears to be no differences in the risk of losing the baby after 24 weeks or overall
There was no difference in the number of [[Caesarean section]]s. All trials in the Cochrane review included licensed midwives, and none included lay or traditional midwives. Also, no trial included out of hospital birth.&lt;ref name=Sandall2013/&gt;

==History==
===Ancient history===
[[File:Eucharius Rößlin Rosgarten Childbirth.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A woman giving birth on a birth chair, from a work by German physician [[Eucharius Rößlin]]]]
[[File:Рождество-Богородицы-Ростов-XVII crop.jpg|thumbnail|Icon Birth of Mary (detail). Russia, 17th century]]

In [[ancient Egypt]], midwifery was a recognized female occupation, as attested by the [[Ebers Papyrus]] which dates from 1900 to 1550 BCE. Five columns of this papyrus deal with [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|obstetrics and gynecology]], especially concerning the acceleration of parturition (the action or process of giving birth to offspring) and the birth prognosis of the newborn. The [[Westcar Papyrus|Westcar papyrus]], dated to 1700 BCE, includes instructions for calculating the expected date of confinement and describes different styles of birth chairs. Bas reliefs in the royal birth rooms at Luxor and other temples also attest to the heavy presence of midwifery in this culture.&lt;ref name="TowlerBramall-9"&gt;Jean Towler and Joan Bramall, ''Midwives in History and Society'' (London: Croom Helm, 1986), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwifery in [[Greco-Roman]] antiquity covered a wide range of women, including old women who continued folk medical traditions in the villages of the [[Roman Empire]], trained midwives who garnered their knowledge from a variety of sources, and highly trained women who were considered physicians.&lt;ref name="Flemming-359"&gt;Rebecca Flemming, ''Medicine and the Making of Roman Women'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2000), p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were certain characteristics desired in a “good” [[midwife]], as described by the physician [[Soranus of Ephesus]] in the 2nd century. He states in his work, ''Gynecology'', that “a suitable person will be literate, with her wits about her, possessed of a good memory, loving work, respectable and generally not unduly handicapped as regards her senses [i.e., sight, smell, hearing], sound of limb, robust, and, according to some people, endowed with long slim fingers and short nails at her fingertips.” Soranus also recommends that the [[midwife]] be of sympathetic disposition (although she need not have borne a child herself) and that she keep her hands soft for the comfort of both mother and child.&lt;ref name="French-69-84"&gt;Valerie French, “Midwives and Maternity Care in the Roman World” (Helios, New Series 12(2), 1986), pp. 69-84&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], another physician from this time, valued nobility and a quiet and inconspicuous disposition in a [[midwife]].&lt;ref name="Jackson-97"&gt;Ralph Jackson, ''Doctors and Diseases in the Roman Empire'' (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1988), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;  There appears to have been three “grades” of midwives present:   The first was technically proficient; the second may have read some of the texts on obstetrics and gynecology; but the third was highly trained and reasonably considered a [[medical specialist]] with a concentration in midwifery.&lt;ref name="Jackson-97" /&gt;

[[Agnodice]] or Agnodike (Gr. Ἀγνοδίκη) was the earliest historical, and likely apocryphal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/historical/artifacts/antiqua/women.cfm |title=Women in Medicine |publisher=www.hsl.virginia.edu |accessdate=2012-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[midwife]] mentioned among the ancient Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Greenhill  | first = William Alexander  | author-link =   | contribution = Agnodice  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | page = 74  | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0083.html  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Midwives were known by many different titles in antiquity, ranging from ''iatrinē'' (Gr. [[nurse]]), ''maia'' (Gr., midwife), ''obstetrix'' (Lat., [[obstetrician]]), and ''medica'' (Lat., [[physician|doctor]]).&lt;ref name="Flemming-421-424"&gt;Rebecca Flemming, Medicine and the Making of Roman Women (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 421-424&lt;/ref&gt; It appears as though midwifery was treated differently in the Eastern end of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean basin]] as opposed to the West. In the East, some women advanced beyond the profession of [[midwife]] (''maia'') to that of gynaecologist (''iatros gynaikeios'', translated as ''women's doctor''), for which formal training was required. Also, there were some gynecological tracts circulating in the medical and educated circles of the East that were written by women with Greek names, although these women were few in number. Based on these facts, it would appear that midwifery in the East was a respectable profession in which respectable women could earn their livelihoods and enough esteem to publish works read and cited by male physicians. In fact, a number of Roman legal provisions strongly suggest that midwives enjoyed status and remuneration comparable to that of male doctors.&lt;ref name="French-69-84" /&gt; One example of such a [[midwife]] is [[Salpe|Salpe of Lemnos]], who wrote on women’s diseases and was mentioned several times in the works of Pliny.&lt;ref name="Jackson-97" /&gt;

[[File:Ancient Roman relief carving of a midwife Wellcome M0003964.jpg|thumb|Ancient Roman relief carving of a [[midwife]]]]

However, in the Roman West, information about practicing midwives comes mainly from funerary epitaphs. Two hypotheses are suggested by looking at a small sample of these epitaphs. The first is the midwifery was not a profession to which freeborn women of families that had enjoyed free status of several generations were attracted; therefore it seems that most midwives were of servile origin. Second, since most of these funeral epitaphs describe the women as freed, it can be proposed that midwives were generally valued enough, and earned enough income, to be able to gain their freedom. It is not known from these epitaphs how certain slave women were selected for training as midwives. [[Slave]] girls may have been apprenticed, and it is most likely that mothers taught their daughters.&lt;ref name="French-69-84" /&gt;

The actual duties of the [[midwife]] in antiquity consisted mainly of assisting in the birthing process, although they may also have helped with other medical problems relating to women when needed. Often, the [[midwife]] would call for the assistance of a [[physician]] when a more difficult birth was anticipated. In many cases the [[midwife]] brought along two or three assistants.&lt;ref name="Towler-Bramall-12"&gt;Towler and Bramall, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; In antiquity, it was believed by both midwives and physicians that a normal delivery was made easier when a woman sat upright. Therefore, during parturition, midwives brought a stool to the home where the delivery was to take place. In the seat of the birthstool was a crescent-shaped hole through which the baby would be delivered. The birthstool or chair often had armrests for the mother to grasp during the delivery. Most birthstools or chairs had backs which the patient could press against, but Soranus suggests that in some cases the chairs were backless and an assistant would stand behind the mother to support her.&lt;ref name="French-69-84" /&gt; The [[midwife]] sat facing the mother, encouraging and supporting her through the birth, perhaps offering instruction on breathing and pushing, sometimes massaging her vaginal opening, and supporting her perineum during the delivery of the baby. The assistants may have helped by pushing downwards on the top of the mother's abdomen.

Finally, the [[midwife]] received the infant, placed it in pieces of cloth, cut the [[umbilical cord]], and cleansed the baby.&lt;ref name="Jackson-97" /&gt; The child was sprinkled with “fine and powdery salt, or natron or aphronitre” to soak up the birth residue, rinsed, and then powdered and rinsed again. Next, the midwives cleared away any and all mucus present from the nose, mouth, ears, or anus. Midwives were encouraged by Soranus to put [[olive oil]] in the baby’s eyes to cleanse away any birth residue, and to place a piece of wool soaked in olive oil over the umbilical cord. After the delivery, the [[midwife]] made the initial call on whether or not an infant was healthy and fit to rear. She inspected the newborn for [[Congenital disorder|congenital deformities]] and testing its cry to hear whether or not it was robust and hearty. Ultimately, midwives made a determination about the chances for an infant’s survival and likely recommended that a newborn with any severe deformities be exposed.&lt;ref name="French-69-84" /&gt;

A 2nd-century terracotta relief from the Ostian tomb of Scribonia Attice, wife of physician-surgeon M. Ulpius Amerimnus, details a childbirth scene. Scribonia was a [[midwife]] and the relief shows her in the midst of a delivery. A patient sits in the birth chair, gripping the handles and the [[midwife]]’s assistant stands behind her providing support. Scribonia sits on a low stool in front of the woman, modestly looking away while also assisting the delivery by dilating and massaging the vagina, as encouraged by Soranus.&lt;ref name="Jackson-97" /&gt;

The services of a [[midwife]] were not inexpensive; this fact that suggests poorer women who could not afford the services of a professional [[midwife]] often had to make do with female relatives. Many wealthier families had their own midwives. However, the vast majority of women in the Greco-Roman world very likely received their maternity care from hired midwives. They may have been highly trained or possessed only a rudimentary knowledge of obstetrics. Also, many families had a choice of whether or not they wanted to employ a [[midwife]] who practiced the [[traditional medicine|traditional folk medicine]] or the newer methods of professional parturition.&lt;ref name="French-69-84" /&gt; Like a lot of other factors in antiquity, quality gynecological care often depended heavily on the socioeconomic status of the patient.

&lt;ref&gt;Medical practitioners were subjected to more regulation in the Middle Ages, especially women that had not received proper schooling in their desired medical fields. Although the medical field was becoming a male monopoly with these regulations, midwifery was still dominated by women, as men had not had schooling or education in obstetrics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minkowski"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Minkowski|first1=W L|title=Women healers of the middle ages: selected aspects of their history|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=February 1992|volume=82|issue=2|pages=292–293|doi=10.2105/ajph.82.2.288|pmc=1694293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
From the 18th century, a conflict between [[surgeon]]s and midwives arose, as medical men began to assert that their modern scientific techniques were better for mothers and infants than the [[folk medicine]] practiced by midwives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Van Teijlingen | first1 = Edwin R. | last2 = Lowis | first2 = George W. |last3 = McCaffery |first3 = Peter G. | title = Midwifery and the Medicalization of Childbirth: Comparative Perspectives | location = | publisher = Nova Publishers | pages = | date = 2004 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2DHrH08bl5YC | isbn = 9781594540318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Borst | first1 = Charlotte G. | title = Catching Babies: The Professionalization of Childbirth, 1870-1920 | location = | publisher = Harvard University Press | pages = | date = 1995 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=35q762L0IzMC | isbn = 9780674102620}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern Europe and Russia the situation was a little easier - in Imperial Russia at the Duchy of Estonia, Professor Christian Friedrich Deutsch established a midwifery school for women at the [[University of Dorpat]] in 1811, which existed until World War I.

====Contemporary====
At late 20th century, midwives were already recognized as highly trained and specialized professionals in obstetrics. However, at the beginning of the 21st century, the medical perception of pregnancy and childbirth as potentially pathological and dangerous still dominates Western culture. Midwives who work in hospital settings also have been influenced by this view, although by and large they are trained to view birth as a normal and healthy process. While midwives play a much larger role in the care of pregnant mothers in Europe than in America, the medicalized model of birth still has influence in those countries, even though the World Health Organization recommends a natural, normal and humanized birth.&lt;ref name="Fortaleza declaration"&gt;{{cite web|title= Fortaleza Declaration: Appropriate Use of Technology for Birth |url=http://www.weikert.de/alexandra/who1.html |publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The midwifery model of pregnancy and childbirth as a normal and healthy process plays a much larger role in Sweden and the Netherlands than the rest of Europe, however. Swedish midwives stand out, since they administer 80 percent of prenatal care and more than 80 percent of family planning services in Sweden. Midwives in Sweden attend all normal births in public hospitals and Swedish women tend to have fewer interventions in hospitals than American women. The Dutch infant mortality rate in 1992 was the tenth-lowest rate in the world, at 6.3 deaths per thousand births, while the United States ranked twenty-second. Midwives in the Netherlands and Sweden owe a great deal of their success to supportive government policies.&lt;ref name="Lingo 2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3402800303.html	|last= Lingo |first=Alison Klairmont |authorlink=Alison Klairmont	|title=Obstetrics and Midwifery § Midwifery from 1900 to the Present	|work=Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society	|date=2004	|publisher=Gale	|place=Farmington Hills, MI	|accessdate=June 28, 2015|postscript=none}}, from ''Encyclopedia.com''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''monthly nurse''' is a woman who looks after a mother and her baby during the [[postpartum period|postpartum or postnatal period]].

Historically, women were confined to their beds or their homes for extensive periods after [[childbirth|giving birth]]; care was provided either by her female relatives (mother or mother-in-law), or, for those who could afford it, by the monthly nurse. These weeks were called confinement or [[lying-in]], and ended with the re-introduction of the mother to the community in the Christian ceremony of the [[churching of women]]. The term "monthly nurse" was most common in 18th and 19th century England.

The job still exists, although it now might be described as "postnatal [[doula]]" or "maternity nurse" or "newborn care specialist" - all [[Nanny#maternity_nurse.2FNewborn_Care_Specialists.2FConfinement_Nanny|specialist sorts of nannies]]. A modern version of this rest period has evolved, to give maximum support to the new mother, especially if she is recovering from a difficult labour and delivery. It is especially popular in China and its diaspora, where [[postpartum confinement]] is known as "sitting the month".

==History==
{{See also|Midwifery#History of midwifery|History of midwifery}}
From long ago, the delivery of children and care of the mothers was a profession often handed down from mother to daughter, with the daughter spending many years as the pupil or apprentice. The Church supported that by a system of licensing, which required midwives to swear to certain rules relating to contraception, abortion and concealment of births and also to deliver the [[infant baptism|newborn infants for baptism]] or, in extreme cases, to perform the ceremony themselves.

In the mid-18th century the legal status of midwives was withdrawn and the responsibility for delivery was vested in the surgeon. The work of the nurse element had to be covered, as "who was to look after the baby?" Clearly, the first thought that would naturally occur to a mother was that the best person to look after her baby was a woman who had had one herself. Often, the task was allotted to motherly or grandmotherly hands and, from that requirement for postnatal care, the monthly nurse originated. [[The British Journal of Nursing|''The Nursing Record'']] reported that "there was little or no attempt at knowledge or instruction, and we know as a fact that ignorance, prejudice and neglect resulted in a goodly crop of errors, wrongs, and woes as regards the hapless infant".

The term "monthly nurse" is one that is frequently used to describe the nurse who cares for lying-in cases, certainly because such a nurse frequently remains with the patient for four weeks. The term "monthly" is somewhat inaccurate, as there is no reason for the nurse's services to be dispensed with after ten days or retained for much longer, but it is entirely a matter of arrangement.

''The Nursing Record'' reported that "nurses who attend the 'artisan' classes in their confinements as a rule pay a visit daily for ten days and then give up the case, as few working class mothers can afford to lie up for longer".

A monthly nurse could earn more than a midwife, as the monthly nurse was employed for periods between 10 days and often much longer and might attend several women on a part time basis. She often "lived in". The midwife's only duty was perceived as "being trained to assist the parturient woman while nature does her own work and able to call upon a surgeon who could step in where nature fails and skill and science are required". Many certified midwives transferred to the ranks of monthly nurses to benefit from an increased income.

==Certification==
Although 'registration' was not available for women to act as midwives or monthly nurses a system of 'certification' was in being in the late 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. To qualify, a candidate monthly nurse would attend a course in a lying-in hospital for four or five weeks and a midwife for up to three months. The prospective midwives and monthly nurses, as a rule, paid their own charges in respect of hospital expenses and then entered practice on their own responsibility. In 1893, a Miss Gosling reported that "although the certificated monthly nurse could be relied upon as being trustworthy and efficient, there were a number of women who attend lectures for a short time and through one cause or another fail to pass their examination and obtain a certificate nevertheless enter a 'Nurses Home' or open one for themselves".

As might be expected rogue institutions issued certificates and diplomas “for a price”. Another that reporting on a lying in hospital and signed herself a ‘victim of the system’ said that she “witnessed the first phase of the system which turns out yearly hundreds of midwives and monthly nurses on an unsuspecting public. These would be nurses represented almost every grade of the lower classes and every degree of lack of education, and one woman, I remember could not write.  Personally I found many to be dishonest, untruthful, indescribably dirty in their habits and persons, utterly unprincipled, shockingly coarse and deficient intelligence, and with not the faintest idea of discipline”’

==Reform and the 1902 Act==
In the late 19th century, reformers were calling not only for registration and recognition of the profession of midwife but also for the two functions of midwife and monthly nurse to be amalgamated: "The work of midwives lies, for the most part, amongst the poor and the poor lying-in woman needs not only to be delivered, but to be visited for some ten days subsequent to her confinement". The registration of midwives was opposed by members of the House of Lords and Parliament for many years, who argued that the delivery of infants was the responsibility of trained doctors and to allow women to do the job, even in straightforward cases, would take away doctors' income. It was not until the [[Midwives Act 1902]], following 12 years of representation by women, that midwives were "registered", but it would still take several years for it to be accepted. The professional training and formal qualification of midwives, and eventually, the postnatal care offered by the [[National Health Service]], saw the end of the monthly nurse.

People living with '''HIV'''/'''AIDS''' face increased challenges in maintaining proper [[nutrition]]. Despite developments in medical treatment, nutrition remains a key component in managing this condition. The challenges that those living with [[HIV/AIDS]] face can be the result of the [[virus|viral]] infection itself or from the effects of anti-HIV therapy ([[HAART]]).&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, Diana. (2007). [http://www.catie.ca/ng_e.nsf/TOC/393B5A1F07881968852573750070AD0F?OpenDocument "Practical Guide to Nutrition for People Living with HIV"], ''Canadian Aids Treatment Information Exchange''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the side effects from HAART that may affect how the body absorbs and utilizes nutrients include [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], and poor appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riddler | first1 = Sharon A | year = 2003 | title = Impact of HIV Infection and HAART on Serum Lipids in Men | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/22/2978 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 289 | issue = 22| pages = 4–16 | doi = 10.1001/jama.289.22.2978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As well, the nutritional needs of people with HIV/AIDS are greater due to their [[immune system]] fighting off [[opportunistic infections]] that do not normally cause disease in people with healthy immune systems.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Caspar (2010) retrieved from: [http://www.aidsmap.com/Opportunistic-infections/cat/1495/ "AIDS map"].&lt;/ref&gt; Medication along with proper nutrition is a major component of maintaining good health and quality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS.

==HIV/AIDS and nutritional needs==

===Energy requirements===
Monitoring caloric intake is important in ensuring that energy needs are met. For people with HIV/AIDS, energy requirements often increase in order to maintain their regular body weight.&lt;ref&gt;Parento, Joy. USDA(2009). Diet and Disease. Retrieved from http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=4&amp;tax_level=2&amp;tax_subject=278&amp;topic_id=1380&lt;/ref&gt; A classification system revised by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), categorizes HIV-infection into 3 clinical stages and addresses the suggested caloric requirements for each stage.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, E., Glynn H., House, A., et al. Association of Nutrition Service Agencies. (2002). Nutrition Guidelines For Agencies Providing Food to People with HIV. Retrieved from http://www.ansanutrition.org/uploads/documents/ansanutritionguides.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. Clinical Category A: Asymptomatic HIV
:This stage is characterized by Acute HIV. People in this category have estimated needs of 30-35 [[Kilocalorie|kcal]]s/[[kg]].
:2. Clinical Category B: Symptomatic HIV
:This stage is characterized by complications that arise from HIV symptoms. People in this category have estimated needs of 35-40 kcals/kg.
:3. Clinical Category C: Presence of AIDS condition
:This stage is characterized by having a [[T-cell]] count under 200, signaling the presence of an AIDS defining condition and/or an opportunistic infection. People in this category have estimated needs of 40–50 kcals/kg and are at an increased risk of malnourishment.

==Micronutrient requirements==

===Multivitamins and supplementation===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) issued consultative recommendations regarding nutrient requirements in HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name='WHO_nutrients'&gt;{{Cite book| last = [[World Health Organization]] | title = Nutrient requirements for people living with HIV/AIDS: Report of a technical consultation | date = May 2003 | location = Geneva | url = http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/Content_nutrient_requirements.pdf | isbn = | accessdate =March 31, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325030154/http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/Content_nutrient_requirements.pdf|archivedate=March 25, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generally healthy diet was promoted. For HIV-infected adults, the WHO recommended micronutrient intake comes from a good diet at [[Reference Daily Intake|RDA]] levels; higher intake of vitamin A, [[zinc]], and iron can produce adverse effects in HIV positive adults, and these were not recommended unless there is documented deficiency.&lt;ref name='WHO_nutrients'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forrester|first=JE|author2=Sztam, KA|title=Micronutrients in HIV/AIDS: is there evidence to change the WHO 2003 recommendations?|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=December 2011|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1683S–1689S|pmid=22089440|doi=10.3945/ajcn.111.011999|pmc=3226021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nunnari"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Nunnari G, Coco C, Pinzone MR, Pavone P, Berretta M, Di Rosa M, Schnell M, Calabrese G, Cacopardo B |title=The role of micronutrients in the diet of HIV-1-infected individuals |journal=Front Biosci |volume=4 |issue= |pages=2442–56 |year=2012 |pmid=22652651 |doi= |url=https://www.bioscience.org/2012/v4e/af/556/fulltext.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeng"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Zeng L, Zhang L |title=Efficacy and safety of zinc supplementation for adults, children and pregnant women with HIV infection: systematic review |journal=Trop.

Despite the WHO recommendations, recent reviews have highlighted the absence of a simple consensus regarding the effects of [[multivitamins]] or [[micronutrient]] and nutrient supplementation on [[HIV-positive|HIV positive]] individuals. This is partly due to a lack of strong scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="Nunnari"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeng"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Visser|first=Marianne E.|last2=Durao|first2=Solange|last3=Sinclair|first3=David|last4=Irlam|first4=James H.|last5=Siegfried|first5=Nandi|date=2017|title=Micronutrient supplementation in adults with HIV infection|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|pages=CD003650|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003650.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmc=5458097|pmid=28518221|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have looked into the use of implementing daily multivitamins into the diet regimens of HIV/AIDS patients. One study done in [[Tanzania]] involved a trial group with one thousand HIV positive pregnant women. Findings showed that daily multivitamins benefited both the mothers and their babies. After four years, the multivitamins were found to reduce the women’s risk of AIDS and death by approximately 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Fawzi WW et al., for the Tanzania Vitamin and HIV Infection Trial Team.

''Lancet'' 1998; 351:1477-1482.&lt;/ref&gt; Another trial in [[Thailand]] revealed that the use of multivitamins led to fewer deaths, but only among people in advanced stages of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Friis H | year = 2006 | title = Micronutrient interventions and HIV infection: a review of current evidence | url = | journal = Tropical medicine &amp; international health | volume = 11 | issue = 12| pages = 1849–57 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01740.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all studies have provided a positive correlation. A small trial done in [[Zambia]] found no benefits from multivitamins after one month of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Megazzini KM, Sinkala M, Vermund SH, Redden DT, Krebs DW, Acosta EP, Mwanza J, Goldenberg RL, Chintu N, Bulterys M, Stringer JS | year = 2010 | title = A cluster-randomized trial of enhanced labor ward-based PMTCT services to increase nevirapine coverage in Lusaka, Zambia | url = | journal = AIDS | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 447–455 | doi=10.1097/qad.0b013e328334b285 | pmid=19926959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding individual vitamin and mineral [[Dietary supplement|supplementation]], research shows mixed results. Vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity rates among African children suffering from HIV. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends vitamin A supplements for all young children 6 to 59 months old that are at high risk of vitamin A [[Deficiency (medicine)|deficiency]] every 4 to 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (WHO). (1998) [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1998/WHO_EPI_GEN_98.07.pdf "Integration of Vitamin A Supplementation with Immunization: Policy and Program Implications"].&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a trial from Tanzania found that the use of vitamin A supplements increased the risk of mother-to-child transmission by 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Coutsoudis A | title = The effects of vitamin A supplementation on the morbidity of children born to HIV-infected women | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | year = 1995 | volume = 85| issue = 8_Pt_1 | pages = 1076–1081 |display-authors=etal|doi=10.2105/ajph.85.8_pt_1.1076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semba RD et al. Maternal vitamin A deficiency and mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1.
Lancet, 1994, 343:1593-1597.&lt;/ref&gt; With the inconsistency of these results, scientists have not reached a consensus regarding Vitamin A supplementation and its possible benefits for HIV/AIDS patients. Other vitamins to be taken by HIV-infected adults are [[vitamin C|vitamins C]] and [[vitamin E|E]].

Evidence for supplementation with [[selenium]] is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=CA|author2=Kawai, K|author3=Kupka, R|author4=Fawzi, WW|title=Role of selenium in HIV infection|journal=Nutrition Reviews|date=November 2010|volume=68|issue=11|pages=671–81|pmid=20961297|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2010.00337.x|pmc=3066516}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that [[vitamin A]] supplementation in children reduces mortality and improves growth.&lt;ref name="Irlam"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irlam|first=JH|author2=Visser, MM|author3=Rollins, NN|author4=Siegfried, N|date=2010-12-08|editor1-last=Irlam|editor1-first=James H|title=Micronutrient supplementation in children and adults with HIV infection|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=12|pages=CD003650|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003650.pub3|pmid=21154354}}&lt;/ref&gt; For nutritionally compromised pregnant and lactating women, a [[multivitamin]] supplementation has improved outcomes for both mothers and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegfried|first=Nandi|last2=Irlam|first2=James H.|last3=Visser|first3=Marianne E.|last4=Rollins|first4=Nigel N.|date=2012-03-14|title=Micronutrient supplementation in pregnant women with HIV infection|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=3|pages=CD009755|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009755|issn=1469-493X|pmid=22419344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, further research is required to determine the relationship between supplements and HIV/AIDS in order to develop effective nutritional interventions.

==Effects of HIV/AIDS on nutrition==
Statistics show that [[HIV/AIDS]] is most prevalent in the [[Sub-Saharan African]] region.&lt;ref name="avert.org"&gt;Regional statistics for HIV &amp; AIDS, end of 2008. (2008). Worldwide HIV and AIDS Statistics. Retrieved from http://www.avert.org/worldstats.htm&lt;/ref&gt; And according to the hunger map of 2010,&lt;ref&gt;FAO Hunger Map 2010. (2010). Food and Agricultural Organization. Retrieved from http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/es/Hunger_Portal/Hunger_Map_2010b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; undernourishment is most prevalent in [[Asia-Pacific]] and, once again, in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Some of the reasons as to why there is a correlation between malnutrition and the presence of HIV/AIDS are listed below.

===Food security===
[[Food security]] is present "when all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life", as defined by the World Food Summit of 1996. It is set on the basis of food availability, food access, and proper food use.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2010). Food Security. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story028/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty for some people suffering from HIV and AIDS involves how they must obtain food security because the virus increases fatigue, compromising their ability to work in order to provide food and food preparation. This impact is even greater on those living in poverty in rural areas, where providing food is largely based on farming and other household chores.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. (2006). HIV/AIDS and Food Security. Retrieved from http://www.fao.org/hivaids/impacts/food_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case study in Malawi====

In [[Malawi]], the AIDS epidemic and its effect on food security for 65 rural households was studied. Findings revealed that illness and death as a result of AIDS compromised household food security. 24 out of 65 households had negative food security indexes, meaning that they did not have enough flour and/or corn to meet their daily caloric requirements. Sharing of food and resources was substantially decreased to those families that were affected with HIV/AIDS, which proved especially detrimental in families that no longer had a prime adult. With the removal of a prime adult, these families were deprived of productive labor resulting in serious production deficiencies. The study concludes that family members victimized by AIDS led to fracturing of interpersonal ties with other families which created [[food insecurity]] in a community based on a rural [[subsistence]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;Mtika, MIke [http://www.malawi.pop.upenn.edu/Level%203/Papers/PDF-files/mtika-2001.pdf "The AIDS Epidemic in Malawi and It's Threat to Household Food Security"], ''Society for Applied Anthropology'', (60):2-2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malnutrition===
[[File:Malnourished child.jpg|thumb|Child suffering from malnutrition&lt;ref&gt;Image uploaded to Wikimedia Commons by: Malnourishedtwat / Graeme Dott. Retrieved from: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Malnourished_child.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Malnutrition]] can be used as a measure of food insecurity and it has the most impact on those living in Sub-Saharan Africa and [[Asia-Pacific]], where [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]] is most prevalent in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Undernourishment Around the World. (2009). The State of Food Insecurity in the World. Retrieved from ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/i0876e/i0876e02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is also in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] where the cases of HIV/AIDS is most prevalent.&lt;ref name="avert.org"/&gt; An individual whose body is already compromised with HIV has an immune system even less effective at defending against infections when the body is malnourished. Anti-retroviral drugs are now being distributed to people in these areas but when given to those who are undernourished, the medicine’s effectiveness is decreased and toxicity is increased. Malnutrition accelerates the onset of the disease and give rise to repeated illnesses because of their weakened immune systems. Consequently, HIV and malnutrition provide a cyclic form of feedback for each other, with worsening conditions of malnutrition being linked to a more rapid onset of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, C. (2006). HIV/AIDS and Malnutrition Locked in "Vicious Cycle":International community working to address hunger among people with HIV/AIDS. America.gov. Retrieved from http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/October/20061016151256cmretrop0.9265253.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food safety==
''For other uses, see [[food safety]]''

People living with AIDS have impaired immune systems and therefore are more susceptible to infections and diseases due to foodborne pathogens. Food safety includes food handling, food preparation and food storage, all to be dealt with carefully to ensure safety from food-borne bacteria. Those that are more prevalent in people with AIDS include [[Salmonella]], which is the most common cause of illness, being 100 times more prevalent in AIDS patients than healthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;At-Risk Populations: Food Safety for Persons with AIDS. (2006). United States Department of Agriculture: Food Safety and Inspection Service. Retrieved from http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Food_Safety_for_Persons_with_AIDS/&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Listeriosis]] caused by ''[[listeria monocytogenes]]'', with severe and often fatal consequences when encountered by a persons with AIDS. Simple measures can be used to increase food safety and prevent food-borne illnesses for those with affected with HIV/AIDS. Washing your hands, the food about to be prepared, kitchen utensils and kitchen surfaces is effective against bacterial growth. Keeping raw meat and cooked meat separate and cooking foods thoroughly, using a food thermometer to be sure. And lastly, storing leftover foods in the refrigerator within two hours to ensure minimal risk of [[food-borne]] illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Cichocki, Mark R.N. (2009). Food Safety Basics: Food Safety is the Key to Healthy Eating. About.com: AIDS/HIV. Retrieved from http://aids.about.com/od/nutrition/a/foodbasics.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
There are some areas of research that have either not been explored or researched in-depth that are related to the area of HIV/AIDS treatment.

===Food sustainability and agriculture===
With food security also having an impact in rural areas affected by HIV/AIDS, another area of research involves agriculture in subsistence economies. More specifically, in these areas where households affected by HIV/AIDS may suffer from food insecurity, focuses for future research may include looking into ways to improve agricultural practices in order to enhance the household [[food production]] of families where one or more adults suffer from HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization.

'''Obstetrics''' is the field of study concentrated on [[pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], and the [[postpartum period]]. As a [[medical specialty]], obstetrics is combined with [[gynecology]] under the discipline known as [[obstetrics and gynecology]] (OB/GYN) which is a surgical field. 

== Main areas ==

=== Prenatal care ===
Prenatal care is important in screening for various complications of pregnancy. This includes routine office visits with physical exams and routine lab tests:

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
Image:Ultrasound_image_of_a_fetus.jpg|[[3D ultrasound]] of {{convert|3|in|mm|adj=on}} fetus (about 14 weeks [[gestational age]])
Image:Sucking his thumb and waving.jpg|Fetus at 17 weeks
Image:3dultrasound 20 weeks.jpg|Fetus at 20 weeks
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==== First trimester ====
* [[Complete blood count]] (CBC)
* [[Blood type]]
* General [[antibody]] screen ([[Coombs test#Indirect Coombs test|indirect Coombs test]]) for [[Hemolytic disease of the newborn|HDN]]
** Rh D negative antenatal patients should receive RhoGam at 28 weeks to prevent [[Rh disease]].
* [[Rapid plasma reagin]] (RPR) to screen for [[syphilis]]
* [[Rubella]] antibody screen
* [[Hepatitis B]] surface antigen
* [[Gonorrhea]] and [[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]] culture
* [[Mantoux test|PPD]] for [[tuberculosis]]
* [[Pap smear]]
* [[Urinalysis]] and culture
* [[HIV]] screen

Genetic screening for Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and trisomy 18, the national standard in the United States, is rapidly evolving away from the AFP-Quad screen for Down syndrome, done typically in the second trimester at 16–18 weeks. The newer integrated screen (formerly called F.A.S.T.E.R for First And Second Trimester Early Results) can be done at 10 plus weeks to 13 plus weeks with an ultrasound of the fetal neck (thicker nuchal skin correlates with higher risk of Down syndrome being present) and two chemicals (analytes) [[Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A|PAPP-A]] and [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|βHCG]] (pregnancy hormone level itself). It gives an accurate risk profile very early. A second blood screen at 15 to 20 weeks refines the risk more accurately. The cost is higher than an "AFP-quad" screen due to the ultrasound and second blood test, but it is quoted to have a 93% pick up rate as opposed to 88% for the standard AFP/QS. This is an evolving standard of care in the United States.

==== Second trimester ====
* MSAFP/quad. screen (four simultaneous blood tests) (maternal serum [[alpha-fetoprotein|AFP]], [[inhibin A]], [[estriol]], &amp; [[Human chorionic gonadotropin|βHCG]]) – elevations, low numbers or odd patterns correlate with neural tube defect risk and increased risks of trisomy 18 or trisomy 21
* Ultrasound either abdominal or transvaginal to assess cervix, placenta, fluid and baby
* Amniocentesis is the national standard (in what country) for women over 35 or who reach 35 by mid pregnancy or who are at increased risk by family history or prior birth history.

==== Third trimester ====
* [Hematocrit] (if low, the mother receives iron supplements)
* [[Group B Streptococcus]] screen. If positive, the woman receives IV penicillin or ampicillin while in labor—or, if she is allergic to penicillin, an alternative therapy, such as IV clindamycin or IV vancomycin.
* Glucose loading test (GLT) – screens for gestational diabetes; if &gt; 140&amp;nbsp;mg/dL, a [[glucose tolerance test]] (GTT) is administered; a fasting glucose &gt; 105&amp;nbsp;mg/dL suggests gestational diabetes.
Most doctors do a sugar load in a drink form of 50&amp;nbsp;grams of glucose in cola, lime or orange and draw blood an hour later (plus or minus 5 minutes) ; the standard modified criteria have been lowered to 135 since the late 1980s

==== Fetal assessments ====
[[Image:Scan12weeks.jpg|thumb|A dating [[Obstetric ultrasonography|scan]] at 12 weeks.]]
[[Obstetric ultrasonography]] is routinely used for dating the gestational age of a pregnancy from the size of the fetus, determine the number of fetuses and [[placenta]]e, evaluate for an [[ectopic pregnancy]] and first trimester bleeding, the most accurate dating being in first trimester before the growth of the foetus has been significantly influenced by other factors. Ultrasound is also used for detecting congenital anomalies (or other foetal anomalies) and determining the [[biophysical profile]]s (BPP), which are generally easier to detect in the second trimester when the foetal structures are larger and more developed. Specialised ultrasound equipment can also evaluate the blood flow velocity in the [[umbilical cord]], looking to detect a decrease/absence/reversal or diastolic blood flow in the umbilical artery.

[[X-ray]]s and [[computerized tomography]] (CT) are not used, especially in the first trimester, due to the [[ionizing radiation]], which has [[teratogen]]ic effects on the foetus. No effects of [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) on the foetus have been demonstrated,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
  |author1=Ibrahim A. Alorainy |author2=Fahad B. Albadr |author3=Abdullah H. Abujamea |title=Attitude towards MRI safety during pregnancy

  |volume=26 |issue=4
  |pages=306–9

  |pmid=16885635
  |format=}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but this technique is too expensive for routine observation. Instead, [[obstetric ultrasonography]] is the imaging method of choice in the first trimester and throughout the pregnancy, because it emits no [[radiation]], is portable, and allows for realtime imaging.

The safety of frequent ultrasound scanning has not be confirmed. Despite this, increasing numbers of women are choosing to have additional scans for no medical purpose, such as gender scans, 3D and 4D scans. A normal gestation would reveal a [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]], and [[fetal pole]]. The [[gestational age]] can be assessed by evaluating the [[mean gestational sac diameter]] (MGD) before week 6, and the crown-rump length after week 6. [[Multiple gestation]] is evaluated by the number of [[placenta]]e and [[amniotic sac]]s present.

Other tools used for assessment include:
*Fetal screening is used to help assess the viability of the fetus, as well as congenital abnormalities.
*Fetal [[karyotype]] can be used for the screening of genetic diseases. This can be obtained via [[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]] (CVS)
* Foetal [[haematocrit]] for the assessment of foetal [[anemia]], Rh isoimmunization, or [[hydrops fetalis|hydrops]] can be determined by [[percutaneous umbilical blood sampling]] (PUBS), which is done by placing a needle through the abdomen into the [[uterus]] and taking a portion of the [[umbilical cord]].
* Fetal lung maturity is associated with how much [[surfactant]] the fetus is producing. Reduced production of surfactant indicates decreased lung maturity and is a high risk factor for [[infant respiratory distress syndrome]]. Typically a [[lecithin]]:[[sphingomyelin]] ratio greater than 1.5 is associated with increased lung maturity.
* [[Nonstress test]] (NST) for fetal heart rate
* [[Oxytocin challenge test]]

==== Intercurrent diseases ====
{{Main|Intercurrent disease in pregnancy}}
A pregnant woman may have [[Intercurrent diseases in pregnancy|intercurrent diseases]], that is, other diseases or conditions (not directly caused by the pregnancy) that may become worse or be a potential risk to the pregnancy.

*[[Diabetes mellitus and pregnancy]] deals with the interactions of [[diabetes mellitus]] (not restricted to [[gestational diabetes]]) and pregnancy. Risks for the child include miscarriage, growth restriction, growth acceleration, feotal obesity (macrosomia), polyhydramnios and birth defects.
*[[Systemic lupus erythematosus and pregnancy]] confers an increased rate of foetal death ''in utero'' and [[spontaneous abortion]] (miscarriage), as well as of [[neonatal lupus]].
*[[Thyroid disease in pregnancy]] can, if uncorrected, cause adverse effects on foetal and maternal well-being. The deleterious effects of thyroid dysfunction can also extend beyond pregnancy and delivery to affect neurointellectual development in the early life of the child. Demand for thyroid hormones is increased during pregnancy, and may cause a previously unnoticed thyroid disorder to worsen.
*[[Hypercoagulability in pregnancy]] is the propensity of pregnant women to develop [[thrombosis]] (blood clots). Pregnancy itself is a factor of [[hypercoagulability]] (pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability), as a physiologically adaptive mechanism to prevent [[postpartum hemorrhage|''post partum'' bleeding]].&lt;ref name=gresele/&gt; However, when combined with an additional underlying hypercoagulable states, the risk of thrombosis or embolism may become substantial.&lt;ref name=gresele&gt;Page 264 in: {{cite book |author=Gresele, Paolo |title=Platelets in haematologic and cardiovascular disorders: a clinical handbook |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-521-88115-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Induction and labour ====
{{Main|Induction (birth)|Childbirth}}
{{See|Pain management during childbirth}}
Induction is a method of artificially or prematurely stimulating labour in a woman. Reasons to induce can include [[pre-eclampsia]], foetal distress, placental malfunction, intrauterine growth retardation and failure to progress through labour increasing the risk of infection and foetal distresses.

Induction may be achieved via several methods:
* Disturbance of cervical memebranes
* [[Pessary]] of ''Prostin'' cream, [[prostaglandin]] E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
* Intravaginal or oral administration of [[misoprostol]]
* Cervical insertion of a 30-mL [[Foley catheter]]
* Rupturing the amniotic membranes
* Intravenous infusion of synthetic [[oxytocin]] (Pitocin or Syntocinon)

During labour, the obstetrician carries out the following tasks:
* Monitor the progress of labour, by reviewing the nursing chart, performing vaginal examination, and assessing the trace produced by a foetal monitoring device (the [[cardiotocograph]])
* Provide pain relief, either by [[nitrous oxide]], [[opiates]], or by [[local anaesthesia|epidural anaesthesia]] done by [[anaesthesiology|anaesthestists]], an anaesthesiologist, or a [[nurse anaesthetist]].
* [[Caesarean section]], if there is an associated risk with vaginal delivery, as such feotal or maternal compromise.

==== Complications and emergencies ====
{{Main|Complications of pregnancy}}

The main emergencies include:

* [[Ectopic pregnancy]] is when an embryo implants in the uterine (Fallopian) tube or (rarely) on the ovary or inside the peritoneal cavity. This may cause massive internal bleeding.
* [[Pre-eclampsia]] is a disease defined by a combination of signs and symptoms that are related to maternal hypertension. The cause is unknown, and markers are being sought to predict its development from the earliest stages of pregnancy. Some unknown factors cause vascular damage in the [[endothelium]], causing [[hypertension]]. If severe, it progresses to [[eclampsia]], where [[seizures]] occur, which can be fatal. Preeclamptic patients with the [[HELLP syndrome]] show liver failure and [[Disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC). The only treatment is to deliver the foetus. Women may still develop pre-eclampsia following delivery.
* [[Placental abruption]] is where the placenta detaches from the uterus and the woman and foetus can bleed to death if not managed appropriately.
* [[Foetal distress]] where the [[foetus]] is getting compromised in the uterine environment.
* [[Shoulder dystocia]] where one of the foetus' shoulders becomes stuck during vaginal birth. There are many risk factors, including macrosmic (large) feotus, but many are also unexplained.
* [[Uterine rupture]] can occur during obstructed labour and endanger foetal and maternal life.
* [[Prolapsed cord]] can only happen after the membranes have ruptured. The umbilical cord delivers before the presenting part of the foetus. If the foetus is not delivered within minutes, or the pressure taken off the cord, the foetus dies.
* [[Obstetrical hemorrhage]] may be due to a number of factors such as [[placenta previa]], uterine rupture or tears, [[uterine atony]], [[retained placenta]] or placental fragments, or bleeding disorders.
* [[Puerperal sepsis]] is an ascending infection of the genital tract. It may happen during or after labour. Signs to look out for include signs of infection (pyrexia or hypothermia, raised heart rate and respiratory rate, reduced blood pressure), and abdominal pain, offensive [[lochia]] (blood loss) increased lochia, clots, diarrhea and vomiting.

=== Postnatal care ===
{{Further|Postpartum period}}
[[Postnatal]] care is care provided to the mother following parturition.

A woman in the Western world who is delivering in a [[hospital]] may leave the hospital as soon as she is medically stable and chooses to leave, which can be as early as a few hours postpartum, though the average for [[spontaneous vaginal delivery]] (SVD) is 1–2 days, and the average [[caesarean section]] postnatal stay is 3–4 days.

During this time the mother is monitored for [[bleeding]], [[bowel]] and [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] function, and baby care. The [[infant]]'s health is also monitored.

Certain things must be kept in mind as the physician proceeds with the post-natal care.
# General condition of the patient.
# Check for vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, (pain) at times)
# Palour?
# Oedema?
# Dehydration?
# Fundus (height following parturition, and the feel of the fundus) (Per abdominal examination)
# If an episiotomy or a C-section was performed, check for the dressing. Intact, pus, oozing, haematomas?
# Lochia (colour, amount, odour)?
# Bladder (keep the patient catheterized for 12 hours following local anaesthesia and 24–48 hours after general anaesthesia) ? (check for bladder function)
# Bowel movements?
# More bowel movements?
# Follow up with the neonate to check if they are healthy.

== History ==

[[File:Eucharius Rößlin Rosgarten Childbirth.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[midwives]] assisting a woman in labour on a [[birthing chair]] in the 16th century, from a work by [[Eucharius Rößlin]].]]

Prior to the 18th century, caring for pregnant women in Europe was [[Occupational segregation|confined exclusively to women]], and rigorously excluded men. The expectant mother would invite close female friends and family members to her home to keep her company during [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name="Gelis"&gt;Gelis, Jacques. History of Childbirth. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1991: 96–98&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled [[midwives]] managed all aspects of the labour and delivery. The presence of physicians and surgeons was very rare and only occurred if a serious complication had taken place and the midwife had exhausted all measures at her disposal. Calling a surgeon was very much a last resort and having men deliver women in this era was seen as offending female modesty.&lt;ref name="BynumPorter"&gt;Bynum, W.F., &amp; Porter, Roy, eds. Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine. London and New York: Routledge, 1993: 1050–1051.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Ian., “University of Manitoba: Women’s Health.” May 2000, accessed May 20, 2012, http://www.neonatology.org/pdf/dyingtohaveababy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Before the 18th century ===
{{See also|Women's medicine in antiquity}}
Prior to the 18th and 19th centuries, [[midwifery]] was well established but obstetrics was not recognized as a specific medical specialty. However, the subject matter and interest in the [[female reproductive system]] and sexual practice can be traced back to Ancient Egypt&lt;ref name="McGrew"&gt;McGrew, Roderick E. Encyclopedia of Medical History. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1985. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;  and Ancient Greece.&lt;ref name="Hufnagel"&gt;Hufnagel, Glenda Lewin. A History of Women's Menstruation from Ancient Greece to the Twenty-First Century: Psychological, Social, Medical, Religious, and Educational Issues. Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press, 2012. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soranus of Ephesus]] sometimes is called the most important figure in ancient gynecology. Living in the late first century A.D. and early second century, he studied anatomy and had opinions and techniques on abortion, contraception&amp;nbsp;–most notably ''[[coitus interruptus]]''– and birth complications. After his death, techniques and works of gynecology declined; very little of his works were recorded and survived to the late 18th century when gynecology and obstetrics reemerged as a medical specialism.&lt;ref&gt;McGrew, Roderick E. Encyclopedia of Medical History. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1985. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 18th century ===
The 18th century marked the beginning of many advances in European [[midwifery]], based on better knowledge of the physiology of pregnancy and labour. By the end of the century, medical professionals began to understand the anatomy of the uterus and the physiological changes that take place during labour. The introduction of  [[forceps in childbirth]] also took place at this time. All these medical advances in obstetrics were a lever for the introduction of men into an arena previously managed and run by women—midwifery.&lt;ref&gt;Bynum, W.F., &amp; Porter, Roy, eds. Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine. London and New York: Routledge, 1993: 1051–1052.&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of the male-midwife (or man-midwife) is historically a significant change to the profession of obstetrics. In the 18th century medical men began to train in area of childbirth and believed with their advanced knowledge in anatomy that childbirth could be improved. In France these male-midwives were referred to as ''accoucheurs'', a title later used all over Europe. The founding of [[lying-in]] hospitals also contributed to the medicalization and male-dominance of obstetrics. These early [[maternity hospital]]s were establishments where women would come to have their babies delivered, as opposed to the practice since time immemorial of the midwife attending the home of the woman in labour. This institution provided male-midwives with endless patients to practice their techniques on and was a way for these men to demonstrate their knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society, “Obstetrics and Midwifery.”   accessed May 21, 2012, http://www.faqs.org/childhood/Me-Pa/Obstetrics-and- Midwifery.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Many midwives of the time bitterly opposed the involvement of men in childbirth. Some male practitioners also opposed the involvement of medical men like themselves in midwifery and even went as far as to say that male-midwives only undertook midwifery solely for perverse erotic satisfaction. The accoucheurs argued that their involvement in midwifery was to improve the process of childbirth. These men also believed that obstetrics would forge ahead and continue to strengthen.&lt;ref name="BynumPorter"/&gt;

=== 19th century ===
18th century physicians expected that obstetrics would continue to grow, but the opposite happened. Obstetrics entered a stage of stagnation in the 19th century, which lasted until about the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Gelis"/&gt; The central explanation for the lack of advancement during this time was the rejection of obstetrics by the medical community. The 19th century marked an era of medical reform in Europe and increased regulation over the profession. Major European institutions such as The College of Physicians and Surgeons{{where|date=May 2018}} considered delivering babies ungentlemanly work and refused to have anything to do with childbirth as a whole. Even when [[Medical Act 1858]] was introduced, which stated that medical students could qualify as doctors, [[midwifery]] was entirely ignored. This made it nearly impossible to pursue an education in midwifery and also have the recognition of being a doctor or surgeon. Obstetrics was pushed to the side.&lt;ref&gt;Bynum, W.F., &amp; Porter, Roy, eds. Companion Encyclopedia of the History of Medicine. London and New York: Routledge, 1993: 1053–1055.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, the foundation of modern-day obstetrics and midwifery began developing. Delivery of babies by doctors became popular and readily accepted, but midwives continued to play a role in childbirth. Midwifery also changed during this era due to increased regulation and the eventual need for midwives to become certified. Many European countries by the late 19th century were monitoring the training of midwives and issued certification based on competency. Midwives were no longer uneducated in the formal sense.&lt;ref name="Drife"&gt;Drife, James, “The start of life: a history of obstetrics,” Postgraduate Medical Journal 78 (2002):  311–315, accessed May 21, 2012. {{doi|10.1136/pmj.78.919.311}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As midwifery began to develop, so did the profession of obstetrics near the end of the century. Childbirth was no longer unjustifiably despised by the medical community as it once had been at the beginning of the century. But obstetrics was underdeveloped compared to other medical specialites. Many male physicians would deliver children but very few would have referred to themselves as obstetricians. The end of the 19th century did mark a significant accomplishment in the profession with the advancements in [[asepsis]] and [[anaesthesia]], which paved the way for the mainstream introduction and later success of the [[Caesarean Section]].&lt;ref name="Drife"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Low, James.,  “Caesarean section-past and present,” Journal of obstetrics and gynecology Canada 31, no. 12 (2009): 1131–1136, accessed May 20, 2012. http://www.sogc.org/jogc/abstracts/full/200912_Obstetrics_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1880s mortality rates in lying-hospitals would reach unacceptably high levels and became an area of public concern. Much of these maternal deaths were due to [[puerperal fever]], then known as childbed fever. In the 1800s Dr. [[Ignaz Semmelweis]] noticed that women giving birth at home had a much lower incidence of childbed fever than those giving birth by physicians in lying-hospitals. His investigation discovered that washing hands with an [[antiseptic]] solution before a delivery reduced childbed fever fatalities by 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.med.mcgill.ca/mjm/issues/v01n01/fever.html | title=The Childbed Fever Mystery and the Meaning of Medical Journalism | last=Caplan | first=Caralee E. | journal=McGill Journal of Medicine | year=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707205101/http://www.med.mcgill.ca/mjm/issues/v01n01/fever.html | archivedate=2012-07-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; So it was concluded that it was physicians who had been spreading disease from one labouring mother to the next. Despite the publication of this information, doctors still would not wash. It was not until the 20th century when advancements in aseptic technique and the understanding of disease would play a significant role in the decrease of [[maternal mortality]] rates among many populations.

=== History of obstetrics in America ===
The development of obstetrics as a practice for accredited doctors happened at the turn of the 18th century and thus was very differently developed in Europe and in the Americas due to the independence of many countries in the Americas from European powers. “Unlike in Europe and the British Isles, where [[midwifery]] laws were national, in America, midwifery laws were local and varied widely”.&lt;ref name="Roth"&gt;Roth, Judith. “Pregnancy &amp; Birth: The History of Childbearing Choices in the United States.”Human Service Solutions. Accessed February 14th, 2014. http://www.ourbodiesourselves.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Gynaecology and Obstetrics gained attention in the American medical field at the end of the nineteenth century through the development of such procedures as the ovariotomy. These procedures then were shared with European surgeons who replicated the surgeries. This was a period when antiseptic, aseptic or anaesthetic measures were just being introduced to surgical and observational procedures and without these procedures surgeries were dangerous and often fatal. Following are two surgeons noted for their contributions to these fields include [[Ephraim McDowell]] and [[James Marion Sims]].

Ephraim McDowell developed a surgical practice in 1795 and performed the first ovariotomy in 1809 on a 47-year-old widow who then lived on for thirty-one more years. He had attempted to share this with John Bell whom he had practiced under who had retired to Italy. Bell was said to have died without seeing the document but it was published by an associate in ''Extractions of Diseased Ovaria'' in 1825. By the mid-century the surgery was both successfully and unsuccessfully being performed. Pennsylvanian surgeons the Attlee brothers made this procedure very routine for a total of 465 surgeries–John Attlee performed 64 successfully of 78 while his brother William reported 387– between the years of 1843 and 1883. By the middle of the nineteenth century this procedure was successfully performed in Europe by English surgeons Sir [[Thomas Spencer Wells|Spencer Wells]] and [[Charles Clay (surgeon)|Charles Clay]] as well as French surgeons [[Eugène Koeberlé]], [[Auguste Nélaton]] and [[Jules-Émile Péan|Jules Péan]].&lt;ref name="McGrew125"&gt;McGrew, Roderick E. Encyclopedia of Medical History. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1985. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. Marion Sims]] was the surgeon responsible for being the first treating a [[vesicovaginal fistula]] &lt;ref name="McGrew125"/&gt;–a condition linked to many caused mainly by prolonged pressing of the feotus against the pelvis or other causes such as rape, hysterectomy, or other operations– and also having been doctor to many European royals and the 20th President of the United States James A. Garfield after he had been shot. Sims does have a controversial medical past. Under the beliefs at the time about pain and the prejudice towards African people, he had practiced his surgical skills and developed skills on slaves.&lt;ref&gt;International Wellness Foundation.” Dr. J Marion Sims: The Father of Modern Gynecology.” February 12th, 2014. www.mnwelldir.org/docs/history/biographies/marion_sims.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These women were the first patients of modern gynecology. One of the women he operated on was named [[Anarcha Westcott]], the woman he first treated for a fistula.&lt;ref&gt;International Wellness Foundation. “Anarcha The Mother of Gynaecology.” March 28th, 2014. www.mnwelldir.org/docs/history/biographies/marion_sims.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical role of gender ===
Women and men inhabited very different roles in natal care up to the 18th century. The role of a physician was exclusively held by men who went to university, an overly male institution, who would theorize anatomy and the process of reproduction based on theological teaching and philosophy. Many beliefs about the female body and menstruation in the 17th and 18th centuries were inaccurate; clearly resulting from the lack of literature about the practice.&lt;ref name="McGrew123-125"&gt;McGrew, Roderick E. Encyclopedia of Medical History. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1985. 123–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the theories of what caused menstruation prevailed from Hippocratic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Hufnagel, Glenda Lewin. A History of Women's Menstruation from Ancient Greece to the Twenty-First Century: Psychological, Social, Medical, Religious, and Educational Issues. Lewiston: Edwin Mellen Press, 2012. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Midwives]] of this time were those assisted in the birth and care of both born and unborn children, and as the name suggests, this position was held mainly by women.

During the birth of a child, men were rarely present. Women from the neighbourhood or family would join in on the process of birth and assist in many different ways. The one position where men would help with the birth of a child would be in the sitting position, usually when performed on the side of a bed to support the mother.&lt;ref name="Gelis130"&gt;Gelis, Jacques. History of Childbirth. Boston: Northeastern University Press, 1991: 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Men were introduced into the field of obstetrics in the nineteenth century and resulted in a change of the focus of this profession. Gynaecology directly resulted as a new and separate field of study from obstetrics and focused on the curing of illness and indispositions of female sexual organs. This had some relevance to some conditions as menopause, uterine and cervical problems, and childbirth could leave the mother in need of extensive surgery to repair tissue. But, there was also a large blame of the uterus for completely unrelated conditions. This led to many social consequences of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="McGrew123-125"/&gt;

'''Occupational epidemiology''' is a subdiscipline of [[epidemiology]] that focuses on investigations of workers and the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/occupationalepidemiology/index.html|title=Occupational Epidemiology|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Research Methods in Occupational Epidemiology|last=Checkoway|first=Harvey|last2=Pearce|first2=Neil|last3=Kriebel|first3=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-19-509242-2|location=New York, NY|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational epidemiologic studies examine health outcomes among workers, and their potential association with conditions in the workplace including noise, chemicals, heat, or radiation, or work organization such as schedules.

The need for evidence to inform occupational safety regulations, [[workers' compensation]] programs, and safety legislation motivated the development of public health policy, occupational epidemiology methods, and surveillance mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halperin|first=William|last2=Howard|first2=John|date=2011-10-07|title=Occupational Epidemiology and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6004a15.htm|journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]|publisher=U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|volume=60|pages=97–103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occupational epidemiological research can inform [[risk assessment]]s; development of standards and other risk management activities; and estimates of the co-benefits and co-harms of policies designed to reduce risk factors or conditions that can affect human health. Occupational epidemiology methods are common to methods used in [[environmental epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pell|first=S.|date=May 1993|title=Epidemiologists in industry. Past achievements, unexplored opportunities, and future needs|journal=Journal of Occupational Medicine|volume=35|issue=5|pages=485–492|issn=0096-1736|pmid=8515320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Occupational hazard]]s have long been recognized. For example, [[Hippocrates]] recommended other physicians consider patients' vocational backgrounds when diagnosing and treating disease, and [[Bernardino Ramazzini]] in 1700 outlined many occupational diseases in his book ''De Morbis Artificum''.  There are several examples from the 19th century onwards of hazard recognition proceeding to systematic epidemiology studies.  In one example, premature mortality was reported among gold and silver miners in the [[Ore Mountains|Erz Mountains]] in Germany as early as the 16th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  It was initially though to be the result of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]], but it was subsequently determined to be [[silicosis]], and studies from 1879 through the 1930s uncovered the association of miners' deaths with [[lung cancer]] and nonmalignant [[respiratory disease]]s.  Other examples include cancer among chimney sweeps, [[asbestos]]-related diseases, and the variety of occupational diseases found among factory workers in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Occupational health risks were initially observed by [[case series]] reports of apparent disease excesses or [[Disease cluster|clusters]].  Although the [[case series]] approach provided a good indicator of [[occupational hazard]]s, they are not adequate on their own to assess a wide spectrum of health outcomes that may not be closely related to workplace exposure. The development of retrospective, [[Cohort study|cohort design]] allowed for a more comprehensive study of the cases. Desire to improve the cost-efficiency of studies led to the use of [[Case-control study|case-control studies]]. Other methods later used in occupational epidemiology include [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]] and [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/610965808|title=Research methods in occupational epidemiology|last=Checkoway|first=Harvey|last2=Pearce|first2=Neil|last3=Crawford-Brown|first3=Douglas J.|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=|year=1989|isbn=9780195092424|location=New York|pages=5–8, 59, 61, 66, 72, 331|oclc=610965808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of studies ==

=== Case series ===
Typically occupational epidemiological investigations begin with the observation of an unusual number of cases of disease among a group of workers. When the investigation does not go further than what is referred to as identifying a [[disease cluster]], the study is referred to as a [[case series]] report.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Cohort studies ===
In a [[Cohort study|cohort design study]], a [[Population (statistics)|population]], or cohort, of workers is compared to a [[Treatment and control groups|control group]] that was not exposed to the [[Occupational hazard|workplace hazards]] being investigated. This type of study is the most accepted in the [[scientific community]] because it most closely follows experimental strategy and observes the entire population rather than a sample. In a prospective cohort study, the group examined at the time of the study is compared to a follow up with the same group in the future. The historical cohort study design begins with defining a cohort at a time in the past and following the cohort over historical time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agius.com/hew/resource/occepi.htm|title=Occupational Epidemiology|last=Agius|first=Raymond|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Case-control studies ===
Case-control studies compare the past exposure of cases with the disease to the past exposure of cases that did not have the disease. Because [[Cohort study|cohort studies]] require the entire [[Population (statistics)|population]], [[Case-control study|case-control studies]] are a more cost-effective approach, using only the sample of workers with the disease to compare to a control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Cross-sectional studies ===
A typical [[cross-sectional study]] involves the comparison of varying degrees of exposure and the prevalence of disease, symptoms, or physiological status. The main advantage of cross-sectional studies is that they allow collection of data on conditions which would not be recorded normally because other study designs focus on severe states of disease. This is also the biggest shortcoming of this study type because by using prevalence rather than incidence it cannot be used to make a causal inference.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Application ==
By contributing to reduction in exposure, occupational epidemiology helps reduce health risks among workers. Using occupational epidemiological methods can also have benefits for society at large. For example, recommendations for [[Occupational exposure limit|exposure limits]] to [[benzene]] developed by the [[Expert Panel on Air Quality Standards]] were based on occupational epidemiology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Using [[meta-analysis]], many occupational epidemiology studies can be synthesized in order to help set [[occupational exposure limit]]s and make other kinds of policy decisions. This can also can be applied in health [[risk assessment]]s, which is a method of predicting health risk based on hypothetical exposure conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Emergence as a discipline===
Established in 1987, ''[[Work &amp; Stress]]'' is the first and "longest established journal in the fast developing discipline that is occupational health psychology" (p.&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name = "Cox &amp; Tisserand"&gt;Cox, T., &amp; Tisserand, M. (2006). Editorial: Work &amp; Stress comes of age: Twenty years of occupational health psychology. ''Work &amp; Stress, 20'', 1–5. doi:10.1080/02678370600739795&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) and NIOSH jointly organized the first international Work, Stress, and Health conference in Washington, DC. The conference has since become a biannual OHP meeting.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"&gt;Barling, J., &amp; Griffiths, A. (2011). A history of occupational health psychology. In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 21–34). Washington, D.C., American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the first issue of the ''[[Journal of Occupational Health Psychology]]'' was published by APA. That same year, the [[International Commission on Occupational Health]] created the Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors (ICOH-WOPS) scientific committee,&lt;ref&gt;International Commission on Occupational Health-Work Organisation and Psychosocial Factors [http://www.icohweb.org/site/scientific-committee-detail.asp?sc=33]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icohweb.org/site_new/ico_scientific_committees.asp International Commission on Occupational Health]&lt;/ref&gt; which focused primarily on OHP.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"/&gt; In 1999, the [[European Academy of Occupational Health Psychology]] (EA-OHP) was established at the first European Workshop on Occupational Health Psychology in Lund, Sweden.&lt;ref name="Houdmont2"&gt;Houdmont, J.

In 2000 the informal International Coordinating Group for Occupational Health Psychology (ICGOHP) was founded for the purpose of facilitating OHP-related research, education, and practice as well as coordinating international conference scheduling.&lt;ref name = "B &amp; G"/&gt; Also in 2000, ''[[Work &amp; Stress]]'' became associated with the EA-OHP.&lt;ref name = "Cox &amp; Tisserand"/&gt; In 2005, the [[Society for Occupational Health Psychology]] (SOHP) was established in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, L.B., &amp; Schonfeld, I.S.

== Research topics ==

===Important theoretical models in OHP research===

Three influential theoretical models in OHP research are the demand-control-support, demand-resources, and effort-reward imbalance models.

==== Demand-control-support model ====
The most influential model in OHP research has been the original demand-control model.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; According to the model, the combination of low levels of work-related decision latitude (i.e., [[job control (workplace)|autonomy and control over the job]]) combined with high workloads (high levels of work demands) can be particularly harmful to workers (they can lead to "job strain," a term representing the combination of low decision latitude and high workload leading to poorer mental or physical health).&lt;ref name = "karasek 1979"&gt;Karasek, R.A. (1979). Job demands, job decision latitude, and mental strain: Implications for job redesign. ''Administrative Science Quarterly, 24''(2), 285–307.&lt;/ref&gt; The model suggests not only that these two job factors are related to poorer health but that high levels of decision latitude on the job will buffer or reduce the adverse health impact of high levels of demands. Research has clearly supported the idea that decision latitude and demands relate to strains, but research findings about buffering have been mixed with only some studies providing support.&lt;ref&gt;de Lange, A.H., Taris, T.W., Kompier, M.A., Houtman, I.L., &amp; Bongers, P.M. (2003). "The very best of the millennium": Longitudinal research and the demand-control-(support) model. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 8'', 282–305. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.8.4.282&lt;/ref&gt; The demand-control model asserts that job control can come in two broad forms: ‘skill discretion’ and ‘decision authority’.&lt;ref name = "bean 2015"&gt;Bean, C.G., Winefield, H.R., Sargent, C., &amp; Hutchinson, A.D. (2015). Differential associations of job control components with both waist circumference and body mass index. ''Social Science &amp; Medicine, 143'', 1–8. doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2015.08.034&lt;/ref&gt; Skill discretion refers to the level of skill and creativity required on the job and the flexibility an employee is permitted in deciding what skills to use (e.g. opportunity to use skills, similar to job variety).&lt;ref name = "karasek 2008"&gt;de Araújo, T.M., Karasek. R. (2008) Validity and reliability of the job content questionnaire in formal and informal jobs in Brazil. ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health, 6'', Suppl. 52–59&lt;/ref&gt; Decision authority refers to employees being able to make decisions about their work (e.g., having autonomy).&lt;ref name = "karasek 2008"/&gt; These two forms of job control are traditionally assessed together in a composite measure of decision latitude; there is, however, some evidence that the two types of job control may not be similarly related to health outcomes.&lt;ref name = "bean 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joensuu, M. et al. et al. (2012). Differential associations of job control components with mortality: A cohort study, 1986–2005. ''American Journal of Epidemiology, 175'', 609–619. doi:10.1093/aje/kws028&lt;/ref&gt;

About a decade after Karasek first introduced the demand-control model, Johnson, Hall, and Theorell (1989),&lt;ref name="Johnson, 1989"&gt;Johnson, J. V., Hall, E. M., &amp; Theorell, T. (1989). Combined effects of job strain and social isolation on cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in a random sample of the Swedish male working population. ''Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment &amp; Health, 15'', 271–279. doi:10.5271/sjweh.1852&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of research on heart disease, extended the model to include social isolation. Johnson et al. labeled the combination of high levels of demands, low levels of control, and low levels of coworker support “iso-strain.” The resulting expanded model has been labeled the demand–control–support (DCS) model. Research that followed the development of this model has suggested that one or more of the components of the DCS model (high psychological workload, low control, and lack of social support), if not the exact combination represented by iso-strain, have adverse effects of physical and mental health.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

==== Job demands-resources model ====

An alternative model, the [[job demands-resources model|job demands-resources (JD-R) model]],&lt;ref&gt;Demerouti, E., Bakker, A.B., Nachreiner, F., &amp; Schaufeli, W.B. (2001). The job demands-resources model of burnout. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 86'', 499–512. doi:10.1037//0021-9010.86.3.499&lt;/ref&gt; grew out of the DCS model. In the JD-R model, the category of demands (workload) remains more or less the same as in the DCS model although the JD-R model more specifically includes physical demands. Resources, however, are defined as job-relevant features that help workers achieve work-related goals, lessen job demands, or stimulate personal growth. Control and support as per the DCS model are subsumed under resources. Resources can be external (provided by the organization) or internal (part of a worker's personal make-up). In addition to control and support, resources encompassed by the model can also include physical equipment, software, performance feedback from supervisors, the worker's own coping strategies, etc. There has not, however, been as much research on the JD-R model as there has been on the constituents of the DC or DCS model.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

==== Effort-reward imbalance model====
After the DCS model, the, perhaps, second most influential model in OHP research has been the effort-reward imbalance (ERI) model. It links job demands to the rewards employees receive for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, J., &amp; Peter, R. (1994). Job stressors and coping characteristics in work-related disease: Issues of validity. ''Work &amp; Stress, 8'', 130–140. doi: 10.1080/02678379408259985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegrist, J. (1996). Adverse health effects of high-effort/low-reward conditions. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 27–41. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.1.1.27&lt;/ref&gt; That model holds that high work-related effort coupled with low control over job-related intrinsic (e.g., recognition) and extrinsic (e.g., pay) rewards triggers high levels of activation in neurohormonal pathways that, cumulatively, are thought to exert adverse effects on mental and physical health.

=== Occupational stress and physical health ===
A number of work-related, psychosocial factors have been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD).

====Cardiovascular disease====
{{Main|Occupational stress|Cardiovascular disease}}
Research has identified health-behavioral and biological factors that are related to increased risk for CVD. These risk factors include smoking, obesity, low density lipoprotein (the "bad" cholesterol), lack of exercise, and blood pressure. Psychosocial working conditions are also risk factors for CVD.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt; In a case-control study involving two large U.S. data sets, Murphy (1991) found that hazardous work situations, jobs that required vigilance and responsibility for others, and work that required  attention to devices were related to increased risk for cardiovascular disability.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, L.R. (1991). Job dimensions associated with severe disability due to cardiovascular disease. ''Journal of Clinical Epidemiology, 44''(2), 155–166.&lt;/ref&gt; These included jobs in transportation (e.g., air traffic controllers, airline pilots, bus drivers, locomotive engineers, truck drivers), preschool teachers, and craftsmen.

=== Workplace mistreatment ===
{{Main|Workplace aggression|Workplace violence}}

There are many forms of workplace mistreatment ranging from relatively minor discourtesies to serious cases of bullying and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, L., Caughlin, D.E., Gazica, M.W., Truxillo, D.M., &amp; Spector, P.E.

====Workplace incivility====
{{Main|Incivility}}
[[Workplace incivility]] has been defined as "low-intensity deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm the target....Uncivil behaviors are characteristically rude and discourteous, displaying a lack of regard for others" (p.&amp;nbsp;457).&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, L. M., &amp; Pearson, C. M. (1999). Tit for tat? The spiraling effect of incivility in the workplace. ''Academy of Management Review, 24'', 452–471. doi:10.5465/AMR.1999.2202131&lt;/ref&gt;  Incivility is distinct from violence. Examples of workplace incivility include insulting comments, denigration of the target's work, spreading false rumors, social isolation, etc. A summary of research conducted in Europe suggests that workplace incivility is common there.&lt;ref name="cortina magley"&gt;Cortina, L.M., Magley, V., Williams, J.H., &amp; Langhout, R.D.  (2001). Incivility in the workplace: Incidence and impact. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 6'', 64–80. doi:10.1037//1076-8998.6.1.64&lt;/ref&gt; In research on more than 1000 U.S. civil service workers, more than 70% of the sample experienced workplace incivility in the past five years. Compared to men, women were more exposed to incivility; incivility was associated with psychological distress and reduced job satisfaction.&lt;ref name="cortina magley" /&gt;

====Workplace bullying====
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Although definitions of [[workplace bullying]] vary, it involves a repeated pattern of harmful behaviors directed towards an individual by one or more others who have more power than the target.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Keashly, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P.E. Spector (Eds.), ''Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets'' (pp. 271–296).

==== Workplace violence ====
{{Main|Workplace violence}}
Workplace violence is a significant health hazard for employees, both physically and psychologically.&lt;ref name = "Schonfeld"/&gt;

::-Nonfatal assault-
Most workplace assaults are nonfatal, with an annual physical assault rate of 6% in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Schat, A.C.H., Frone, M.R., &amp; Kelloway, E.K. (2006). Prevalence of workplace aggression in the U.S. workforce. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J.  Hurrell, Jr. (Eds.), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 47–89). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Assaultive behavior in the workplace often produces injury, psychological distress, and economic loss. One study of California workers found a rate of 72.9 non-fatal, officially documented [[assault]]s per 100,000 workers per year, with workers in the education, retail, and health care sectors subject to excess risk.&lt;ref&gt;Peek Asa, C., Howard, J., Vargas, L., Kraus, J.F. (1997). Incidence of non-fatal workplace assault injuries determined from employer's reports in California. ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 39''(1), 44–50.&lt;/ref&gt;  A Minnesota workers' compensation study found that women workers had a twofold higher risk of being injured in an assault than men, and health and social service workers, transit workers, and members of the education sector were at high risk for injury compared to workers in other economic sectors.&lt;ref name="LaMar, 1998"/&gt; A West Virginia workers' compensation study found that workers in the [[health care]] sector and, to a lesser extent, the education sector were at elevated risk for assault-related injury.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, S.S., Edla, S.R., Mujuru, P., Doyle, E.J., &amp; Ducatman, A.M. (2003). Risk factors for physical assault. State managed workers' compensation experience. ''American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 25''(1), 31–37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another workers' compensation study found that excessively high rates of assault-related injury in schools, healthcare, and, to a lesser extent, banking.&lt;ref&gt;Hashemi, L., &amp; Webster, B.S. (1998). Non-fatal workplace violence workers' compensation claims (1993 1996). ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 40'', 561–567. doi:10.1016/S0749-3797(03)00095-3&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to the physical injury that results from being a victim of workplace violence, individuals who witness such violence without being directly [[victimized]] are at increased risk for experiencing adverse psychological effects, including high levels of distress and arousal, as found in a study of Los Angeles teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch, A.M. (1978). Combat neurosis in inner-city schools. ''American Journal of Psychiatry, 135''(10), 1189–1192.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mental disorder ===
{{Main|Mental disorder}}
Research has found that psychosocial workplace factors are among the risk factors for a number of categories of mental disorder.

==== Alcohol abuse ====
{{Main|Alcohol abuse}}
Workplace factors can contribute to alcohol abuse and dependence of employees. Rates of abuse can vary by occupation, with high rates in the construction and transportation industries as well as among waiters and waitresses.&lt;ref&gt;Mandell W., Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., &amp; Garrison, R. (1992). Alcoholism and occupations: A review and analysis of 104 occupations.  ''Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 16'', 734–746. doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.1992.tb00670.x&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the transportation sector, heavy truck drivers and material movers were shown to be at especially high risk.  A prospective study of ECA subjects who were followed one year after the initial interviews provided data on newly [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incident]] cases of alcohol abuse and dependence.&lt;ref&gt;Crum, R.M., Muntaner. C., Eaton. W.W., &amp; Anthony. J.C. (1995). Occupational stress and the risk of alcohol abuse and dependence. ''Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research, 19'', 647–655. doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.1995.tb01562.x&lt;/ref&gt;  The study found that workers in jobs that combined low control with high physical demands were at increased risk of developing alcohol problems although the findings were confined to men.

==== Depression ====
{{Main|Major depressive disorder}}
Using data from the ECA study, Eaton, Anthony, Mandel, and Garrison (1990) found that members of three occupational groups, lawyers, secretaries, and special education teachers (but not other types of teachers) showed elevated rates of [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|''DSM-III'']] major depression, adjusting for social demographic factors.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, W.W., Anthony, J.C., Mandel, W., &amp; Garrison, R. (1990). Occupations and the prevalence of major depressive disorder. ''Journal of Occupational Medicine, 32''(11), 1079–1087.&lt;/ref&gt; The ECA study involved representative samples of American adults from five geographical areas, providing relatively unbiased estimates of the risk of mental disorder by occupation; however, because the data were [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]], no conclusions bearing on cause-and-effect relations are warranted.   Evidence from a Canadian prospective study indicated that individuals in the highest quartile of occupational stress (high-strain jobs as per the demand-control model) are at increased risk of experiencing an episode of major depression.&lt;ref&gt;Wang J. (2005). Work stress as a risk factor for major depressive episode(s). ''Psychological Medicine, 35'', 865–871. doi:10.1017/S0033291704003241&lt;/ref&gt; A literature review and [[meta-analysis]] links high demands, low control, and low support to clinical depression.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen, I.H., Nyberg, S.T.,  Magnusson Hanson, L.L., et al. (2017). Job strain as a risk factor for clinical depression: Systematic review and meta-analysis with additional individual participant data. ''Psychological Medicine, 47'', 1342–135. doi:10.1017/S003329171600355X&lt;/ref&gt;  A meta-analysis that pooled the results of 11 well-designed longitudinal studies indicated that a number of facets of the psychosocial work environment (e.g., low decision latitude, high psychological workload, lack of social support at work, effort-reward imbalance, and job insecurity) increase the risk of common mental disorders such as depression.&lt;ref name="Stansfeld 2006"/&gt;

==== Personality disorders ====
{{Main|Personality disorder}}
Depending on the diagnosis, severity and individual, and the job itself, personality disorders can be associated with difficulty coping with work or the workplace, potentially leading to problems with others by interfering with [[interpersonal relationships]]. Indirect effects also play a role; for example, impaired educational progress or complications outside of work, such as [[substance abuse]] and co-morbid mental disorders, can plague sufferers. However, personality disorders can also bring about above-average work abilities by increasing competitive drive or causing the sufferer to exploit his or her co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Ettner, S.L. (2011). Personality disorders and Work. In Schultz &amp; Rogers (Eds.), ''Work accommodation and retention in mental health'' (pp. 163–188). New York: Springer. doi:10.1007978-1-4419-0428-9_9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ettner, S.L., Maclean, J.C., &amp; French, M.T. (2011). Does having a dysfunctional personality hurt your career? Axis II personality disorders and labor market outcomes. ''Industrial Relations, 50'', 149–173. doi:10.1111/j.1468-232X.2010.00629.x&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Schizophrenia ====
{{Main|Schizophrenia}}
In a case-control study, Link, Dohrenwend, and Skodol found that, compared to depressed and well control subjects, schizophrenic patients were more likely to have had jobs, prior to their first episode of the disorder, that exposed them to “noisesome” work characteristics (e.g., noise, humidity, heat, cold, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Link, B.G., Dohrenwend, B.P., &amp; Skodol, A.E. (1986). Socio-economic status and schizophrenia: Noisome occupational characteristics as a risk factor. ''American Sociological Review, 51'', 242–258. doi:10.2307/2095519&lt;/ref&gt; The jobs tended to be of higher status than other blue collar jobs, suggesting that downward drift in already-affected individuals does not account for the finding. One explanation involving a [[diathesis-stress model]] suggests that the job-related stressors helped precipitate the first episode in already-vulnerable individuals. There is some supporting evidence from the [[Psychiatric epidemiology#Example: The Epidemiological Catchment Area Project|Epidemiologic Catchment Area]] (ECA) study.&lt;ref&gt;Muntaner, C., Tien, A.Y., Eaton, W.W., &amp; Garrison R. (1991). Occupational characteristics and the occurrence of psychotic disorders. ''Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology, 26'', 273–280. doi:10.1007/BF00789219&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological distress ===
{{Main|Psychological distress}}
[[longitudinal study|Longitudinal studies]] have suggested adverse working conditions can contribute to the development of psychological distress.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, M.T., Matthews, R.A., Wooldridge, J.D., Mishra, V., Kakar, U.M., &amp; Strahan, S.R.

Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological distress is often expressed in affective (depressive), psychophysical or psychosomatic (e.g., headaches, stomach aches, etc.), and [[anxiety]] symptoms. The relation of adverse working conditions to psychological distress is thus an important avenue of research.

==== Psychosocial working conditions====
Parkes (1982)&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, K.R. (1982). Occupational stress among student nurses: A natural experiment. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 67'', 784–796. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.67.6.784&lt;/ref&gt; studied the relation of working conditions to psychological distress in British student nurses. She found that in this "[[natural experiment]]," student nurses experienced higher levels of distress and lower levels of job satisfaction in medical wards than in surgical wards; compared to surgical wards, medical wards make greater affective demands on the nurses. In another study, Frese (1985)&lt;ref&gt;Frese, M. (1985). Stress at work and psychosomatic complaints: A causal interpretation. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 70'', 314–328. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.70.2.314&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that objective working conditions (e.g., noise, ambiguities, conflicts) give rise to subjective stress and psychosomatic symptoms in blue collar German workers. In addition to the above studies, a number of other well-controlled longitudinal studies have implicated work stressors in the development of psychological distress and reduced job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Carayon, P. (1992).  A longitudinal study of job design and worker strain: Preliminary results. In J.C. Quick, L.R. Murphy, &amp; J.J.

''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 75'', 33–58. doi:10.1348/096317902167630&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Unemployment ====
A comprehensive meta-analysis involving 86 studies indicated that involuntary job loss is linked to increased psychological distress.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;Paul, K. I., &amp; Moser, K. (2009). Unemployment impairs mental health: Meta-analyses. ''Journal of Vocational Behavior, 74'', 264–282. doi:10.1016/j.jvb.2009.01.001&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of involuntary unemployment was comparatively weaker in countries that had greater income equality and better social safety nets.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt; The research evidence also indicates that poorer mental health slightly, but significantly, increases the risk of later job loss.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;

==== Economic insecurity ====
Some OHP research is concerned with (a) understanding the impact of economic crises on individuals' physical and mental health and well-being and (b) calling attention to personal and organizational means for ameliorating the impact of the crisis.&lt;ref name="probst sears"&gt;Probst, T.M., &amp; Sears, L.E.

==== Work-family balance ====
{{Main|Work–family conflict|Double burden|Work–life balance}}

Employees must balance their working lives with their home lives. Work–family conflict is a situation in which the demands of work conflict with the demands of family or vice versa, making it difficult to adequately do both, giving rise to distress.&lt;ref name="Sinclair, Probst"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Greenhaus"&gt;Greenhaus, J.G., &amp; Allen, T. (2011). Work-family balance: A review and extension. In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 165–183). Washington DC, American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Although more research has been conducted on work-family conflict, there is also the phenomenon of work-family enhancement, which occurs when positive effects carry over from one domain into the other.&lt;ref name = "Greenhaus"/&gt;

=== Workplace interventions ===
A number of stress management interventions have emerged that have shown demonstrable effects in reducing job stress.&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;Richardson, K. M., &amp; Rothstein, H. R. (2008). Effects of occupational stress management intervention programs: A meta-analysis. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 13'', 69–93. doi:10.1037/1076-8998.13.1.69&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive behavioral interventions have tended to have greatest impact on stress reduction.&lt;ref name="Richardson"/&gt;

====Industrial organizations====
OHP interventions often concern both the health of the individual and the health of the organization. Adkins (1999) described the development of one such intervention,  an organizational health center (OHC) at a California industrial complex.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, J.A. (1999). Promoting organizational health: The evolving practice of occupational health psychology. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice, 30''(2), 129 137. doi:10.1037/0735-7028.30.2.129&lt;/ref&gt; The OHC helped to improve both organizational and individual health as well as help workers manage job stress. Innovations included labor-management partnerships, suicide risk reduction, conflict mediation, and occupational mental health support. OHC practitioners also coordinated their services with previously underutilized local community services in the same city, thus reducing redundancy in service delivery.

Hugentobler, Israel, and Schurman (1992) detailed a different, multi-layered intervention in a mid-sized Michigan manufacturing plant.&lt;ref&gt;Hugentobler, M.K., Israel, B.A., &amp; Schurman, S.J. (1992). An action research approach to workplace health: Integrating methods. ''Health Education Quarterly, 19''(1), 55–76. doi:10.1177/109019819201900105&lt;/ref&gt; The hub of the intervention was the Stress and Wellness Committee (SWC) which solicited ideas from workers on ways to improve both their well-being and [[productivity]]. Innovations the SWC developed included improvements that ensured two-way communication between workers and management and reduction in stress resulting from diminished conflict over issues of quantity versus quality. Both the interventions described by Adkins and Hugentobler et al. had a positive impact on productivity.

==== OHP research at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ====
{{Main|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health}}
Currently there are efforts under way at NIOSH to help reduce the incidence of preventable disorders (e.g., [[sleep apnea]]) among heavy-truck and tractor-trailer drivers and, concomitantly, the life-threatening accidents to which the disorders lead,&lt;ref&gt;Hitchcock, E. (2008). NIOSH OHP activities. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 3'', 10. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV3May2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; improve the health and safety of workers who are assigned to shift work or who work long hours,&lt;ref&gt;Caruso, C. (2009). NIOSH OHP activities: Training products for workers who are assigned to shift work or work long work hours. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 5'', 16–17. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV5January2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; and reduce the incidence of falls among iron workers.&lt;ref&gt;Scharf, T., Hunt, J., III, McCann, M., Pierson, R., Migliaccio, F., Limanowski, J., et al. (2010). Hazard recognition for ironworkers: Preventing falls and close calls. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 9'', 8–9. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV9October2010.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Military and first responders====
The Mental Health Advisory Teams of the United States Army employ OHP-related interventions with combat troops.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J.L. (2008). OHP Research and Practice in the US Army: Mental Health Advisory Teams. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 4'', 4–5. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV4October2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genderson, M.R., Schonfeld, I.S., Kaplan, M.S., &amp; Lyons, M.J. (2009).Suicide associated with military service. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 6'', 5–7. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV6May2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; OHP also has a role to play in interventions aimed at helping first responders.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, C. (2008). Mental health of 9/11 responders. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 4'', 2–3. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV4October2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnetz, B. (2009). Low-intensity stress in high-stress professionals. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 7'', 6–7.[http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV7October2009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modestly scaled interventions====
Schmitt (2007) described three different modestly scaled OHP-related interventions that helped workers abstain from smoking, exercise more frequently, and shed weight.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt1"&gt;Schmitt, L. (2007). OHP interventions: Wellness programs. ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 1'', 4–5. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV1.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Other OHP interventions include a campaign to improve the rates of hand washing, an effort to get workers to walk more often, and a drive to get employees to be more compliant with regard to taking prescribed medicines.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt2"&gt;Schmitt, L. (2008). OHP interventions: Wellness programs (Part 2). ''Newsletter of the Society for Occupational Health Psychology, 2'', 6–7. [http://www.sohp-online.org/NewsletterDownloads/SOHPNewsletterV2January2008.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The interventions tended reduce organization health-care costs.&lt;ref name = "Schmitt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Schmitt2"/&gt;

==== Health promotion ====

Organizations can play a role in the health behavior of employees by providing resources to encourage healthy behavior in areas of exercise, nutrition, and smoking cessation.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, J.B., Cook, R.F., &amp; Pelletier, K.R. (2011). An integral framework for organizational wellness: Core technology, practice models, and case studies In J.C. Quick &amp; L.E. Tetrick (Eds.), ''Handbook of occupational health psychology'' (2nd ed., pp. 95–118). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prevention ====
Although the dimensions of the problem of workplace violence vary by economic sector, one sector, [[school violence#Prevention and intervention|education]], has had some limited success in introducing programmatic, psychologically-based efforts to reduce the level of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Schonfeld, I.S. (2006). School violence. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 169–229). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications. [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED494566.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that there continue to be difficulties in successfully "screening out applicants [for jobs] who may be prone to engaging in aggressive behavior,"&lt;ref&gt;Day, A.L, &amp; Catano, V.M. (2006) Screening and selecting out violent employees. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 549–577). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that aggression-prevention training of existing employees may be an alternative to screening. Only a small number of studies evaluating the effectiveness of training programs to reduce workplace violence currently exist.&lt;ref&gt;Schat, A.C.H., &amp; Kelloway, E.K. (2006). Training as a workplace aggression intervention strategy. In E.K. Kelloway, J. Barling, &amp; J.J. Hurrell, Jr. (Eds), ''Handbook of workplace violence'' (pp. 579–605). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Total Worker Health™====
{{Main|Total Worker Health}}

Because many companies have implemented worker safety and health measures in a fragmented way,&lt;ref name = "Schill"&gt;Schill, A. L., &amp; Chosewood, L. C. (2013). The NIOSH Total Worker Health™ program: An overview. ''Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 55''(12 Suppl.), S8–S11. doi:10.1097/JOM.0000000000000037&lt;/ref&gt; a new approach to worker safety and health has emerged in response, driven by efforts advanced by [[NIOSH]]. NIOSH trademarked that approach, naming it Total Worker Health. Total Worker Health involves the coordination of evidence-based (a) health promotion practices at the level of the individual worker and (b) umbrella-like health and safety practices at the level of the organizational unit.&lt;ref name = "Schill"/&gt; Research findings indicate that this two-pronged approach is effective in preventing work-related illness and injury.&lt;ref&gt;Anger, W. K., Elliot, D. L., Bodner, T., Olson, R., Rohlman, D. S., Truxillo, D. M., &amp; ... Montgomery, D. (2015). Effectiveness of Total Worker Health interventions. ''Journal of Occupational Health Psychology, 20'', 226–247. doi:10.1037/a0038340&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents and safety===
{{Main|Work accident}}

Psychological factors are an important factor in [[occupational accident]]s that can lead to injury and death of employees. An important influence on the incidence of accidents is the organization's [[safety climate]] that is employees' shared beliefs about how supervisors reward and support safety behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, D. (2010). Thirty years of safety climate research: Reflections and future directions. ''Accident Analysis and Prevention, 42'', 1517–1522. doi: 10.1016/j.aap.2009.12.019.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oligosaccharides can have many functions including cell recognition and cell binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell. 4th edition.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26878/|access-date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[glycolipid]]s have an important role in the immune response.

They are normally present as [[glycan]]s: oligosaccharide chains linked to [[lipid]]s or to compatible [[amino acid]] side chains in [[protein]]s, by ''N''- or ''O''-[[glycoside|glygosidic bonds]]. N-linked oligosaccharides are always pentasaccharides attached to [[asparagine]] via a beta linkage to the amine nitrogen of the side chain.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Voet | first1 = Donald | last2 = Voet | first2 = Judith | last3 = Pratt | first3 = Charlotte | name-list-format = vanc | year = 2013 | title = Fundamentals of Biochemistry: Life at the Molecular Level | edition = 4th | location = Hoboken, NJ | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | isbn = 978-0470-54784-7 | page = }}.{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, [[O-linked glycosylation|O-linked]] oligosaccharides are generally attached to threonine or serine on the alcohol group of the side chain. Not all natural oligosaccharides occur as components of glycoproteins or glycolipids.  Some, such as the [[raffinose]] series, occur as storage or transport [[carbohydrates]] in plants.  Others, such as [[maltodextrin]]s or [[cellodextrins]], result from the microbial breakdown of larger [[polysaccharides]] such as [[starch]] or [[cellulose]].

==Glycosylation==
In biology, [[glycosylation]] is the process by which a carbohydrate is covalently attached to an organic molecule, creating structures such as glycoproteins and glycolipids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Essentials of Glycobiology | editor-first = Ajit | editor-last = Varki | name-list-format = vanc | edition = 2nd | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press | isbn = 978-0-87969-770-9 | page = }}.{{pn|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===N-linked Oligosaccharides===
[[File:N Linked Oligosh.png|thumb|An example of N-linked oligosaccharide, shown here with GlcNAc. X is any amino acid except proline.]]
N-linked glycosylation involves oligosaccharide attachment to [[asparagine]] via a beta linkage to the amine nitrogen of the side chain.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; The process of N-linked glycosylation occurs cotranslationally, or concurrently while the proteins is being translated. Since it is added cotranslationally, it is believed that N-linked glycosylation helps determine the folding of polypeptides due to the hydrophilic nature of sugars. All N-linked Oligosaccharides are pentasaccharides: five monosaccharides long.

In [[N-linked glycosylation|N-glycosylation]] for eukaryotes, the oligosaccharide substrate is assembled right at the membrane of the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|endoplasmatic reticulum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwarz F, Aebi M | title = Mechanisms and principles of N-linked protein glycosylation | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 576–82 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21978957 | doi = 10.1016/j.sbi.2011.08.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[prokaryote]]s, this process occurs at the [[Cell membrane|plasma membrane]]. In both cases, the acceptor substrate is an [[asparagine]] residue. The asparagine residue linked to an N-linked oligosaccharide usually occurs in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr,&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; where X can be any amino acid except for [[proline]], although it is rare to see Asp, Glu, Leu, or Trp in this position.

===O-linked Oligosaccharides===
[[File:Oolinked Oligosaccharide.png|thumb|An example of O-Linked oligosaccharide with β-Galactosyl-(1n3)-α-N-acetylgalactosaminyl-Ser/ Thr.]]
Oligosaccharides that participate in O-linked glycosylation are attached to [[threonine]] or [[serine]] on the [[Hydroxy group|hydroxyl group]] of the side chain.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; O-linked glycosylation occurs in the [[golgi apparatus]], where monosaccharide units are added to a complete polypeptide chain. Cell surface proteins and extracellular proteins are O-glycosylated.&lt;ref name="Peter-Katalinić_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Peter-Katalinić J | title = Methods in enzymology: O-glycosylation of proteins | journal = Methods in Enzymology | volume = 405 | issue = | pages = 139–71 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16413314 | doi = 10.1016/S0076-6879(05)05007-X | isbn = 978-0-12-182810-3  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glycosylation sites in O-linked oligosaccharides are determined by the [[Protein secondary structure|secondary]] and [[Protein tertiary structure|tertiary structures]] of the polypeptide, which dictate where [[Glycosyltransferase|glycosyltransferases]] will add sugars.

==Glycosylated biomolecules==
Glycoproteins and glycolipids are by definition [[Covalent bond|covalently bonded]] to carbohydrates. They are very abundant on the surface of the cell, and their interactions contribute to the overall stability of the cell.

===Glycoproteins===
[[Glycoprotein]]s have distinct Oligosaccharide structures which have significant effects on many of their properties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goochee CF | title = Bioprocess factors affecting glycoprotein oligosaccharide structure | journal = Developments in Biological Standardization | volume = 76 | pages = 95–104 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1478360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; affecting critical functions such as [[antigenicity]], [[solubility]], and resistance to [[protease]]s. Glycoproteins are relevant as [[Cell surface receptor|cell-surface receptors]], cell-adhesion molecules, [[immunoglobulins]], and tumor antigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elbein AD | title = The role of N-linked oligosaccharides in glycoprotein function | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 9 | issue = 10 | pages = 346–52 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 1367760 | doi = 10.1016/0167-7799(91)90117-Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glycolipids===
[[Glycolipid]]s are important for cell recognition, and are important for modulating the function of membrane proteins that act as receptors.&lt;ref name="Manna_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manna M, Róg T, Vattulainen I | title = The challenges of understanding glycolipid functions: An open outlook based on molecular simulations | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1841 | issue = 8 | pages = 1130–45 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24406903 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbalip.2013.12.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glycolipids are lipid molecules bound to oligosaccharides, generally present in the [[lipid bilayer]]. Additionally, they can serve as receptors for cellular recognition and cell signaling.&lt;ref name="Manna_2014" /&gt; The head of the oligosaccharide serves as a binding partner in [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] activity. The binding mechanisms of receptors to the oligosaccharides depends on the composition of the oligosaccharides that are exposed or presented above the surface of the membrane. There is great diversity in the binding mechanisms of glycolipids, which is what makes them such an important target for pathogens as a site for interaction and entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fantini J | title = Interaction of proteins with lipid rafts through glycolipid-binding domains: biochemical background and potential therapeutic applications | journal = Current Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 14 | issue = 27 | pages = 2911–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18045136 | doi = 10.2174/092986707782360033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[chaperone (protein)|chaperone]] activity of glycolipids has been studied for its relevance to HIV infection.

==Functions==
===Cell Recognition===
All cells are coated in either glycoproteins or glycolipids, both of which help determine cell types.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; [[Lectin]]s, or proteins that bind carbohydrates, can recognize specific oligosaccharides and provide useful information for cell recognition based on oligosaccharide binding.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

An important example of oligosaccharide cell recognition is the role of glycolipids in determining [[blood type]]s. The various blood types are distinguished by the glycan modification present on the surface of blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kailemia MJ, Ruhaak LR, Lebrilla CB, Amster IJ | title = Oligosaccharide analysis by mass spectrometry: a review of recent developments | journal = Analytical Chemistry | volume = 86 | issue = 1 | pages = 196–212 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24313268 | pmc = 3924431 | doi = 10.1021/ac403969n }}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be visualized using mass spectrometry. The oligosaccharides found on the A, B, and H [[antigen]] occur on the [[Non-reducing sugar|non-reducing]] ends of the oligosaccharide. The H antigen (which indicates an O blood type) serves as a precursor for the A and B antigen.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; Therefore, a person with A blood type will have the A antigen and H antigen present on the glycolipids of the red blood cell plasma membrane. A person with B blood type will have the B and H antigen present. A person with AB blood type will have A, B, and H antigens present. And finally, a person with O blood type will only have the H antigen present. This means all blood types have the H antigen, which explains why the O blood type is known as the "universal donor".{{fact|date=January 2018}}

===Cell Adhesion===
Many cells produce specific carbohydrate-binding proteins known as lectins, which mediate cell adhesion with oligosaccharides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0959-440X(93)90053-N |title=Oligosaccharides that mediate mammalian cell-cell adhesion |journal=Current Opinion in Structural Biology |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=701–10 |year=1993 |last1=Feizi |first1=Ten | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Selectin]]s - a family of lectins - mediate certain cell-cell adhesion processes, including those of leukocytes to endothelial cells.&lt;ref name="Voet_2013" /&gt; In an immune response, endothelial cells can express certain selectins transiently in response to damage or injury to the cells. In response, a reciprocal selectin-oligosaccharide interaction will occur between the two molecules which allows the white blood cell to help eliminate the infection or damage. Protein-Carbohydrate bonding is often mediated by [[Hydrogen bond|hydrogen bonding]] and [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals forces]].{{fact|date=January 2018}}

==Dietary oligosaccharides==
[[Fructooligosaccharide|Fructo-oligosaccharides]] (FOS), which are found in many vegetables, are short chains of [[fructose]] molecules. They differ from [[inulin]], which has a much higher [[degree of polymerization]] than FOS and is therefore a polysaccharide, but like inulin, they are considered soluble dietary fibre. [[Galactooligosaccharides]] (GOS), which also occur naturally, consist of short chains of [[galactose]] molecules. These compounds cannot be digested in the human small intestine, and instead pass through to the large intestine, where they promote the growth of ''[[Bifidobacterium|Bifidobacteria]]'', which are beneficial to gut health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.de/books?id=0oE5DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58| title = The Gut Microbiome: Exploring the Connection between Microbes, Diet, and Health | last = Moise | first = Ana Maria R. | name-list-format = vanc | date=2017-10-31 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year=|isbn=978-1-4408-4265-8|location=|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mannan Oligosaccharide based nutritional supplements (MOS)|Mannan oligosaccharides]] (MOS) are widely used in [[compound feed|animal feed]] to improve gastrointestinal health. They are normally obtained from the yeast cell walls of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''. Mannan oligosaccharides differ from other oligosaccharides in that they are not fermentable and their primary mode of actions include agglutination of type-1 fimbria pathogens and immunomodulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smiricky-Tjardes MR, Flickinger EA, Grieshop CM, Bauer LL, Murphy MR, Fahey GC | title = In vitro fermentation characteristics of selected oligosaccharides by swine fecal microflora | journal = Journal of Animal Science | volume = 81 | issue = 10 | pages = 2505–14 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14552378 | doi = 10.2527/2003.81102505x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources===
Oligosaccharides are a component of [[Dietary fiber|fibre]] from plant tissue. FOS and inulin are present in [[Jerusalem artichoke]], [[burdock]], [[chicory]], [[Leek (vegetable)|leek]]s, [[onion]]s, and [[asparagus]]. Inulin is a significant part of the daily diet of most of the world’s population. FOS can also be synthesized by enzymes of the fungus ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'' acting on [[sucrose]]. GOS is naturally found in [[soybeans]] and can be synthesized from [[lactose]]. FOS, GOS, and inulin are also sold as nutritional supplements.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

The key to the grids is the use of frequently asked questions (FAQs) that relate to the most common or most important concerns of patients. It is important to choose these FAQs carefully and to limit them to those that can be considered briefly. These FAQs are based on evidence where possible, and final versions are developed by teams of patients, clinicians, and editors. All Grids are written at a reading level of 10–12 years, in accordance with the [[plain English campaign]] guides. The evidence summaries upon which Option Grids are based are available for public review at the official Option Grid website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5658">'''Person-centred thinking''' is a set of values, skills and tools used in [[Person Centred Planning]] and in the personalisation of services used by people who need supports provided by social or health care.

Person-centred thinking is described by the UK Department of Health as "the foundation for person centred planning"&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health (2010) Personalisation through Person Centred Planning: http://www.thinklocalactpersonal.org.uk/_library/Resources/Personalisation/EastMidlands/Workstreams/PCP/Personalisation_through_Person_Centred_Planning.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The British Institute of Learning Disabilities advocates Person centred thinking suggesting that such tools "can be really helpful in assisting the process of getting to know a person really well".&lt;ref&gt;British Institute of Learning Disabilities: Hearing from the Seldom Heard: Good Practice Suggestion 1; Getting to know people well: http://www.bild.org.uk/humanrights/docs/seldom_heard/section_3/3_1/Gettingtoknowpeoplewell.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major piece of research into the impact of person centred planning found that the prevalence of person-centred thinking in services was an important condition for services having the capacity and systems for delivering person centred results.&lt;ref&gt;The Impact of Person Centred Planning (2005), Robertson, Emerson et al: http://www.lincs.cswebsites.org/Libraries/Local/825/Docs/Planning/PCP/pcpimpactresearch%5B1%5D.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Person-centred thinking tools in common use include one-page profiles, 'working/not working', 'important to/important for', 'good day/bad day', communication charts, 'doughnut' of staff roles and responsibilities, relationship circles, learning logs and person-centred reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Think and Plan: http://www.thinkandplan.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 

These tools provide an agenda which a person and the people who know that person best can think together, focussing on what is important to that person, how they wish to live, and then introduce changes that will move towards those aspirations. 
 
Practitioners of person centred thinking suggest that it's possible to build up from one or two pieces of person centred thinking, piece by piece based on the area of the person's life that they feel is most important to consider next, this process of building gradually creates a collection of person centred information, equivalent to a 'full' person centred plan, and more importantly a range of co-produced actions.  Where a person has a specific budget allocated to pay for their social care, this portfolio of person centred thinking tools (a 'person centred description') can also be extremely useful as a basis to write a support plan, which explains how they will use this budget to meet what is important to and for them.&lt;ref&gt;Max Neill, Helen Sanderson and Gill Bailey: One page profile to person centred plan or support plan {{cite web |url=http://www.helensandersonassociates.co.uk/media/13258/one%20page%20profile%20to%20person%20centred%20or%20support%20plan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402185540/http://www.helensandersonassociates.co.uk/media/13258/one%20page%20profile%20to%20person%20centred%20or%20support%20plan.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence of person-centred thinking==
Person centred thinking was first developed by a group of people practicing [[Essential Lifestyle Planning]] in the US (now known as 'The Learning Community for Person Centred Practices). These planners realised that while many plans were being written, many of these were not leading to real change in peoples lives. This group decided that person centred planning was something a small group of people needed to know, but that for planning to work, a much wider group of people need skills around listening for what's important to people and how to best support people. [[Michael Smull]] who is a leading figure in this group describes Person centred thinking as "something that virtually everyone who touches a person needs to know"&lt;ref&gt;Michael Smull,  in "Conversations on Citizenship and Person Centred Work (Eds John O'Brien and Carol Blessing) 2011, Inclusion Press, Vol III pp45-55"&lt;/ref&gt; because change was most powerful when all staff were using person centred thinking tools in their roles, rather than relying solely on person centred planning facilitators to create plans. To enable these tools to be shared at scale, Essential Lifestyle Planning was 'deconstructed' into a range of person centred thinking tools, that enable staff to participate with the person in a cycle of listening, learning and action by building up a set of tools recording this process to form a person centred description of the person.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson H. Lewis J. (2012) A Practical Guide to Delivering Personalisation; Person-Centred Practice in Health and Social Care. London; Jessica Kingsley Publishers p22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Values underpinning person centred thinking==
Person Centred Thinking, like other person centred approaches is based in the values of independence and rights, coproduction, choice and control and inclusive and competent communities.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson H. Lewis J. (2012) A Practical Guide to Delivering Personalisation; Person-Centred Practice in Health and Social Care. London; Jessica Kingsley Publishers p24&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3769">'''Preherpetic neuralgia''' is a form of nerve pain ([[neuralgia]]) specifically associated with a [[Shingles]] (herpes zoster) viral infection. This nerve pain often precedes visible indications of a Shingles infection and consequently can be a key early indicator of a need to begin preventative anti-viral drug therapy. Pain associated with Shingles can be extremely difficult to treat whereas the source is related to the virus attacking the nervous system itself. Pain symptoms can last months or years beyond any outward sign of viral infection and can be quite severe. The combination of extreme pain severity and longevity can contribute to chronic depression and even suicide.&lt;ref name=pmid1866008&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1212/WNL.41.8.1215 |pmid=1866008 |title=Preherpetic neuralgia |journal=Neurology |volume=41 |issue=8 |pages=1215–8 |year=1991 |last1=Gilden |first1=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16293">'''Protein quality''' is the [[Digestion#Protein digestion|digestibility]] and quantity of [[essential amino acid]]s for providing the proteins in correct ratios for human consumption. There are various methods that rank the quality of different types of [[protein]], some of which are outdated and no longer in use, or not considered as useful as they once were thought to be. The [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score]] (PDCAAS), which was recommended by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), became the industry standard in 1993. FAO has recently recommended the newer [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]] (DIAAS) to supersede PDCAAS. The dairy industry is in favor of this, because while PDCAAS truncates all protein types that exceed the [[essential amino acid]] (EAA) requirements to 1.0, DIAAS allows a higher than 1.0 ranking: while for example both soy protein isolate and whey isolate are ranked 1.0 according to PDCAAS, in the DIAAS system, whey has a higher score than soy.

==PDCAAS versus DIAAS==
The main limitations of PDCAAS is that it doesn't take into account [[Antinutrient|anti-nutrient]] factors like [[phytic acid]] and [[trypsin inhibitor]]s, which limit the absorption of protein among other nutrients. For this reason, DIAAS is promoted as the superior method and preferable over the PDCAAS. Other older methods like BV, PER, NPU and [[nitrogen balance]] may not reveal much about the amino acid profile and digestibility of the protein source in question, but can still be considered useful in that they determine other aspects of protein quality not taken into account by PDCAAS and DIAAS.

==Protein ranking==
Below follows a table that compares various proteins based on their rankings. Some of these results may differ and vary significantly depending on if it is soybeans or soy protein isolate, and so on. For example, while soybeans have a PDCAAS score of 0.91, many soy protein isolates (though not all) typically get a PDCAAS score of 1.0. Likewise, the amino acid profile may differ from crop to crop depending on the soil, and between different breeds of soy. Generally speaking, however, soybeans rarely outperform whey protein isolate in PDCAAS rankings.

==Amino acid profile==
Below follows a table that compares the complete amino acid profiles of various proteins. The amino acid score is based on the prevalence of the essential amino acids and depends on if they reach sufficient quantity. PDCAAS scores do not take into account the quantity of the non-essential amino acids.

'''Proteinogenic amino acids''' are [[amino acid]]s that are incorporated biosynthetically into [[protein]]s during [[translation (biology)|translation]]. The word "proteinogenic" means "protein creating". Throughout known [[life]], there are 22 genetically encoded (proteinogenic) amino acids, 20 in the standard [[genetic code]] and an additional 2 that can be incorporated by special translation mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ambrogelly A, Palioura S, Söll D | title = Natural expansion of the genetic code | journal = Nature Chemical Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–35 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17173027 | doi = 10.1038/nchembio847 | url = http://www.nature.com/nchembio/journal/v3/n1/abs/nchembio847.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[non-proteinogenic amino acids]] are amino acids that are either not incorporated into proteins (like [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]], [[L-DOPA|&lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-DOPA]], or [[triiodothyronine]]), misincorporated in place of a genetically encoded amino acid, or not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (like [[hydroxyproline]]). The latter often results from [[post-translational modification]] of proteins. Some non-proteinogenic amino acids are incorporated into [[nonribosomal peptide]]s which are synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.

Both [[eukaryote]]s and [[prokaryote]]s can incorporate [[selenocysteine]] into their proteins via a nucleotide sequence known as a [[SECIS element]], which directs the cell to translate a nearby UGA [[codon]] as [[selenocysteine]] (UGA is normally a [[stop codon]]).  In some [[methanogenic]] prokaryotes, the UAG codon (normally a stop codon) can also be translated to [[pyrrolysine]].&lt;ref name="LobanovTuranov2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lobanov AV, Turanov AA, Hatfield DL, Gladyshev VN | title = Dual functions of codons in the genetic code | journal = Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 45 | issue = 4 | pages = 257–65 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20446809 | pmc = 3311535 | doi = 10.3109/10409231003786094 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eukaryotes, there are only 21 proteinogenic amino acids, the 20 of the standard genetic code, plus selenocysteine. Humans can synthesize 12 of these from each other or from other molecules of intermediary metabolism. The other nine must be consumed (usually as their protein derivatives), and so they are called [[essential amino acid]]s.  The essential amino acids are [[histidine]], [[isoleucine]], [[leucine]], [[lysine]], [[methionine]], [[phenylalanine]], [[threonine]], [[tryptophan]], and [[valine]] (i.e. H, I, L, K, M, F, T, W, V).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Young VR | title = Adult amino acid requirements: the case for a major revision in current recommendations | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 124 | issue = 8 Suppl | pages = 1517S-1523S | date = August 1994 | pmid = 8064412 | doi = 10.1093/jn/124.suppl_8.1517S | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/reprint/124/8_Suppl/1517S.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proteinogenic amino acids have been found to be related to the set of [[amino acid]]s that can be recognized by [[ribozyme]] autoaminoacylation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Erives A | title = A model of proto-anti-codon RNA enzymes requiring L-amino acid homochirality | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 73 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 10–22 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21779963 | pmc = 3223571 | doi = 10.1007/s00239-011-9453-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, non-proteinogenic amino acids would have been excluded by the contingent evolutionary success of nucleotide-based life forms. Other reasons have been offered to explain why certain specific non-proteinogenic amino acids are not generally incorporated into proteins; for example, [[ornithine]] and [[homoserine]] cyclize against the peptide backbone and fragment the protein with relatively short [[Biological half-life|half-lives]], while others are toxic because they can be mistakenly incorporated into proteins, such as the arginine analog [[canavanine]].

== Structures ==

The following illustrates the structures and abbreviations of the 21 amino acids that are directly encoded for protein synthesis by the genetic code of eukaryotes.  The structures given below are standard chemical structures, not the typical [[zwitterion]] forms that exist in aqueous solutions.

== Chemical properties ==

Following is a table listing the one-letter symbols, the three-letter symbols, and the chemical properties of the side chains of the standard amino acids. The masses listed are based on weighted averages of the elemental [[isotope]]s at their [[natural abundance]]s. Forming a [[peptide bond]] results in elimination of a molecule of [[water (molecule)|water]], so the mass of an amino acid unit within a protein chain is reduced by 18.01524 Da.

N.D.: The pKa value of Pyrrolysine has not been reported.

Note: The pKa value of an amino-acid residue in a small peptide is typically slightly different when it is inside a protein. [[Protein pKa calculations]] are sometimes used to calculate the change in the pKa value of an amino-acid residue in this situation.

===Mass spectrometry===
In [[mass spectrometry]] of peptides and proteins, knowledge of the masses of the residues is useful. The mass of the peptide or protein is the sum of the residue masses plus the mass of [[Water (molecule)|water]] ([[Monoisotopic mass]] = 18.01056 Da; average mass = 18.0153 Da). The residue masses are calculated from the tabulated chemical formulas and atomic weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/Compositions/stand_alone.pl |title=Atomic Weights and Isotopic Compositions for All Elements |access-date=2016-12-12 |publisher=NIST }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mass spectrometry]], ions may also include one or more [[protons]] ([[Monoisotopic mass]] = 1.00728 Da; average mass = 1.0074 Da).

! scope="col" | Remarks
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Alanine]]
| A
| Ala
| Very abundant and very versatile, it is more stiff than glycine, but small enough to pose only small steric limits for the protein conformation. It behaves fairly neutrally, and can be located in both hydrophilic regions on the protein outside and the hydrophobic areas inside.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Asparagine]] or [[aspartic acid]]
| B
| Asx
| A placeholder when either amino acid may occupy a position
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Cysteine]]
| C
| Cys
| The sulfur atom bonds readily to [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] ions. Under oxidizing conditions, two cysteines can join together in a [[disulfide bond]] to form the amino acid [[cystine]]. When cystines are part of a protein, [[insulin]] for example, the [[tertiary structure]] is stabilized, which makes the protein more resistant to [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]]; therefore, disulfide bonds are common in proteins that have to function in harsh environments including digestive enzymes (e.g., [[pepsin]] and [[chymotrypsin]]) and structural proteins (e.g., [[keratin]]). Disulfides are also found in peptides too small to hold a stable shape on their own (e.g. [[insulin]]).
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Aspartic acid]]
| D
| Asp
| Asp behaves similarly to glutamic acid, and carries a hydrophilic acidic group with strong negative charge. Usually, it is located on the outer surface of the protein, making it water-soluble. It binds to positively charged molecules and ions, and is often used in enzymes to fix the metal ion. When located inside of the protein, aspartate and glutamate are usually paired with arginine and lysine.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Glutamic acid]]
| E
| Glu
| Glu behaves similarly to aspartic acid, and has a longer, slightly more flexible side chain.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Phenylalanine]]
| F
| Phe
| Essential for humans, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan contain a large, rigid [[aromaticity|aromatic]] group on the side chain. These are the biggest amino acids. Like isoleucine, leucine, and valine, these are hydrophobic and tend to orient towards the interior of the folded protein molecule. Phenylalanine can be converted into tyrosine.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Glycine]]
| G
| Gly
| Because of the two hydrogen atoms at the α carbon, glycine is not [[optical isomerism|optically active]]. It is the smallest amino acid, rotates easily, and adds flexibility to the protein chain. It is able to fit into the tightest spaces, e.g., the triple helix of [[collagen]]. As too much flexibility is usually not desired, as a structural component, it is less common than alanine.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Histidine]]
| H
| His
| His is essential for humans. In even slightly acidic conditions, [[protonation]] of the nitrogen occurs, changing the properties of histidine and the polypeptide as a whole.  It is used by many proteins as a regulatory mechanism, changing the conformation and behavior of the polypeptide in acidic regions such as the late [[endosome]] or [[lysosome]], enforcing conformation change in enzymes. However, only a few histidines are needed for this, so it is comparatively scarce.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Isoleucine]]
| I
| Ile
| Ile is essential for humans. Isoleucine, leucine, and valine have large aliphatic hydrophobic side chains. Their molecules are rigid, and their mutual hydrophobic interactions are important for the correct folding of proteins, as these chains tend to be located inside of the protein molecule.

|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Lysine]]
| K
| Lys
| Lys is essential for humans, and behaves similarly to arginine. It contains a long, flexible side chain with a positively charged end. The flexibility of the chain makes lysine and arginine suitable for binding to molecules with many negative charges on their surfaces. E.g., [[deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]]-binding proteins have their active regions rich with arginine and lysine. The strong charge makes these two amino acids prone to be located on the outer hydrophilic surfaces of the proteins; when they are found inside, they are usually paired with a corresponding negatively charged amino acid, e.g., aspartate or glutamate.
|-

| Leu
| Leu is essential for humans, and behaves similarly to isoleucine and valine.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Methionine]]
| M
| Met
| Met is essential for humans. Always the first amino acid to be incorporated into a protein, it is sometimes removed after translation. Like cysteine, it contains sulfur, but with a [[methyl]] group instead of hydrogen. This methyl group can be activated, and is used in many reactions where a new carbon atom is being added to another molecule.
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Asparagine]]

| Pyl
| Similar to [[lysine]], but it has a [[pyrroline]] ring attached.  
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Proline]]
| P
| Pro
| Pro contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO-NH amide sequence into a fixed conformation. It can disrupt protein folding structures like [[alpha helix|α helix]] or [[beta sheet|β sheet]], forcing the desired kink in the protein chain. Common in [[collagen]], it often undergoes a [[post-translational modification]] to [[hydroxyproline]].
|-
! scope="row" {{rh2|align=right}} | [[Glutamine]]

==Life based on alternative proteinogenic sets ==
The proteinogenic set used by known life on Earth appears to be arbitrarily selected by evolution, according to current knowledge, from many hundreds of possible alpha-type amino acids.  [[Xenobiology]] studies hypothetical life forms that could be constructed using alternative sets using [[expanded genetic code]]s.   [[Stanley Miller|Miller]]-type experiments on artificial [[abiogenesis]] show that alpha-type amino acids predominate in water-based 'primordial soups', but beta-type amino acids dominate when less water is present.  Both alpha- and beta-based sets could form the basis for alternative protein constructions and life forms.

'''Public health''' is "the science and art of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting human [[health]] through organized efforts and informed choices of society, organizations, public and private, communities and individuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Charles-Edward Amory Winslow|Winslow, Charles-Edward Amory]]|title=The Untilled Field of Public Health |journal=Modern Medicine |date=1920 |volume=2 |pages=183–191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Analyzing the health of a population and the threats is the basis for public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdcfoundation.org/content/what-public-health|title=What is Public Health|last=|first=|date=|website=Centers for Disease Control Foundation|publisher=Atlanta, GA: Centers for Disease Control|access-date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "public" in question can be as small as a handful of people, an entire village or it can be as large as several continents, in the case of a [[pandemic]]. "Health" takes into account physical, mental and social well-being. It is not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/suggestions/faq/en/ Frequently asked questions]
from the "Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization" as adopted by the [[International Health Conference]], 1946&lt;/ref&gt; Public health is [[interdisciplinary]]. For example, [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]] and [[health services]] are all relevant. [[Environmental health]], [[community health]], [[behavioral health]], [[health economics]], [[public policy]], [[mental health]] and [[occupational safety and health|occupational safety]], gender issues in health, sexual and reproductive health are other important subfields.

Public health aims to improve the quality of life through prevention and treatment of [[disease]], including mental health. This is done through the [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] of cases and [[health indicators]], and through the promotion of healthy behaviors. Common public health initiatives include promoting [[hand washing|handwashing]] and [[breastfeeding]], delivery of [[vaccination]]s, [[suicide prevention]] and distribution of [[condom]]s to control the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.

Modern public health practice requires [[multidisciplinarity|multidisciplinary teams]] of public health workers and professionals. Teams might include [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]], [[biostatistics|biostatisticians]], [[medical assistant]]s, [[public health nursing|public health nurses]], [[midwives]], [[microbiologist|medical microbiologists, economists, sociologists, geneticists and data managers.]]  Depending on the need [[environmental health officer]]s or [[public health inspector]]s, [[Bioethics|bioethicists]], and even [[veterinarian]]s, gender experts, sexual and reproductive health specialists might be called on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Joint Task Group on Public Health Human Resources |author2=Advisory Committee on Health Delivery &amp; Human Resources |author3=Advisory Committee on Population Health &amp; Health Security |publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada |title=Building the public health workforce for the 21st century |location=Ottawa |year=2005 |oclc=144167975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives are difficult challenges in [[developing nations|developing countries]]. Public health infrastructures are still forming in those countries.

==Background==
The focus of a [[public health intervention]] is to prevent and manage diseases, injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the [[health promotion|promotion of healthy behaviors]], [[healthy community design|communities]] and [[environmental protection|environments]]. Many diseases are preventable through simple, nonmedical methods. For example, research has shown that the simple act of [[hand washing|handwashing]] with soap can prevent the spread of many contagious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Global Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. [http://www.globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources ''Handwashing research''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216125536/http://globalhandwashing.org/handwashing-resources |date=16 December 2010 }}, accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, treating a disease or controlling a [[pathogen]] can be vital to preventing its spread to others, either during an outbreak of [[infectious disease]] or through [[food contamination|contamination of food]] or [[water contamination|water]] supplies. [[Behavior change (public health)|Public health communications programs]], [[vaccination]] programs and distribution of [[condom]]s are examples of common preventive public health measures. Measures such as these have contributed greatly to the health of populations and increases in life expectancy.

Public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries through local health systems and [[non-governmental organization]]s. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) is the international agency that coordinates and acts on [[global health|global public health]] issues. Most countries have their own government public health agencies, sometimes known as ministries of health, to respond to domestic health issues. For example, in the [[United States]], the front line of public health initiatives are state and local [[health department]]s. The [[United States Public Health Service]] (PHS), led by the [[Surgeon General of the United States]], and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], headquartered in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], are involved with several international health activities, in addition to their national duties. In Canada, the [[Public Health Agency of Canada]] is the national agency responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and [[chronic disease]] control and prevention. The [[Public health system in India]] is managed by the Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare of the government of India with state-owned health care facilities.

Most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions. However, public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. "Public health principles and neurological disorders. In: ''Neurological Disorders: Public Health Challenges.'' Geneva; 2006 - http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/neurodiso/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Public health programs providing [[vaccination]]s have made strides in promoting health, including the eradication of [[smallpox]], a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years.
[[File:Directors of Global Smallpox Eradication Program.jpg|thumb|Three former directors of the [[Smallpox#Eradication|Global Smallpox Eradication Programme]] read the news that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980]]

The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies core functions of public [[health]] programs including:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/about/role/en/ ''The role of WHO in public health''], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* providing leadership on matters critical to health and engaging in partnerships where joint action is needed;
* shaping a [[research]] agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and [[dissemination]] of valuable knowledge;
* setting norms and standards and promoting and monitoring their implementation;
* articulating ethical and [[evidence-based policy]] options;
* monitoring the health situation and assessing health trends.

In particular, public health surveillance programs can:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/topics/public_health_surveillance/en/ ''Public health surveillance''], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* serve as an [[early warning system]] for impending public health emergencies;
* document the impact of an intervention, or track progress towards specified goals; and
* monitor and clarify the epidemiology of health problems, allow priorities to be set, and inform [[public health policy|health policy]] and strategies.
* diagnose, investigate, and monitor health problems and health hazards of the community

Public health surveillance has led to the identification and prioritization of many public health issues facing the world today, including [[HIV/AIDS]], [[diabetes]], [[waterborne diseases]], [[zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]], and [[antibiotic resistance]] leading to the reemergence of infectious diseases such as [[tuberculosis]]. Antibiotic resistance, also known as drug resistance, was the theme of [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2011]]. Although the prioritization of pressing public health issues is important, Laurie Garrett argues that there are following consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Garrett Laurie | year = 2007 | title = The Challenge of Global Health | url = | journal = Foreign Affairs | volume = 86 | issue = 1| pages = 14–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When foreign aid is funnelled into disease-specific programs, the importance of public health in general is disregarded. This public health problem of [[stovepiping]] is thought to create a lack of funds to combat other existing diseases in a given country.

For example, the WHO reports that at least 220 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is projected that the number of diabetes deaths will double by the year 2030.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/ ''Diabetes Fact Sheet N°312'', January 2011]. Accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 2010 editorial in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'', the authors opined that "The fact that [[type 2 diabetes]], a largely preventable disorder, has reached epidemic proportion is a public health humiliation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | title = Type 2 diabetes—time to change our approach | journal = The Lancet | volume = 375 | issue = 9733 | pages = 2193 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20609952 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(10)61011-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with the growing problem of [[obesity]]. The WHO’s latest estimates as of June 2016 highlighted that globally approximately 1.9 billion adults were overweight in 2014, and 41 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/ ''Obesity and overweight Fact sheet N°311'', Updated June 2016.] Accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is the leading country with 30.6% of its population being obese. Mexico follows behind with 24.2% and the United Kingdom with 23%. Once considered a problem in high-income countries, it is now on the rise in low-income countries, especially in urban settings. Many public health programs are increasingly dedicating attention and resources to the issue of obesity, with objectives to address the underlying causes including [[healthy diet]] and [[physical exercise]].

Some programs and policies associated with public health promotion and prevention can be controversial. One such example is programs focusing on the prevention of [[HIV]] transmission through [[safe sex]] campaigns and [[needle-exchange programme]]s. Another is the control of [[tobacco smoking]]. Changing smoking behavior requires long-term strategies, unlike the fight against [[communicable diseases]], which usually takes a shorter period for effects to be observed. Many nations have implemented [[tobacco smoking#Public policy|major initiatives]] to cut smoking, such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places. Proponents{{Who|date=May 2014}} argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers, and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate, both through limiting [[Passive smoking|passive (second-hand) smoking]] and by providing fewer opportunities for people to smoke. Opponents{{Who|date=May 2014}} say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility, and worry that the state may be emboldened to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall.

Simultaneously, while communicable diseases have historically ranged uppermost as a [[global health]] priority, [[non-communicable disease]]s and the underlying behavior-related risk factors have been at the bottom. This is changing, however, as illustrated by the [[United Nations]] hosting its first General Assembly Special Summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. [https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs//2010/100513_Diseases.doc.htm ''Press Conference on General Assembly Decision to Convene Summit in September 2011 on Non-Communicable Diseases''.] New York, 13 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many health problems are due to maladaptive personal behaviors. From an [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective, over consumption of novel substances that are harmful is due to the activation of an evolved [[reward system]] for substances such as drugs, tobacco, alcohol, refined salt, fat, and carbohydrates. New technologies such as modern transportation also cause reduced physical activity. Research has found that behavior is more effectively changed by taking evolutionary motivations into consideration instead of only presenting information about health effects. The marketing industry has long known the importance of associating products with high status and attractiveness to others. Films are increasingly being recognized as a public health tool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Uy Hoang, Stella B, May CI van S|title=What’s in the ‘Public Health Toolbox’|journal=JOJ Pub Health|year=2018|volume=3|issue=2|page=555607|url=https://juniperpublishers.com/jojph/pdf/JOJPH.MS.ID.555607.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In fact, [[Public Health Film Festival|film festivals]] and [[International Public Health Film Competition|competitions]] have been established to specifically promote films about health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1757913915619120|pmid=26702114|title=Reflections on the United Kingdom's first public health film festival|journal=Perspectives in Public Health|volume=136|issue=1|pages=23–24|year=2016|last1=Botchway|first1=Stella|last2=Hoang|first2=Uy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, it has been argued that emphasizing the harmful and undesirable effects of tobacco smoking on other persons and imposing smoking bans in public places have been particularly effective in reducing tobacco smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Curtis and Robert Aunger. "Motivational mismatch: evolved motives as the source of—and solution to—global public health problems". In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S.

===Applications in health care===
As well as seeking to improve population health through the implementation of specific population-level interventions, public health contributes to medical care by identifying and assessing population needs for [[health care]] services, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gillam Stephen|author2=Yates, Jan|author3=Badrinath, Padmanabhan |title=Essential Public Health : theory and practice |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |oclc=144228591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Pencheon, David |author1=Pencheon, David |author2=Guest, Charles |author3=Melzer, David |author4=Gray, JA Muir |title=Oxford Handbook of Public Health Practice |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |oclc=663666786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Smith, Sarah |author2=Sinclair, Don |author3=Raine, Rosalind |author4=Reeves, Barnarby |title=Health Care Evaluation |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2005|oclc=228171855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sanderson, Colin J. |author2=Gruen, Reinhold |title=Analytical Models for Decision Making |series=Understanding Public Health |publisher=Open University Press |year=2006 |oclc=182531015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assessing current services and evaluating whether they are meeting the objectives of the [[health care system]]
* Ascertaining requirements as expressed by [[health care provider|health professionals]], the public and other stakeholders
* Identifying the most appropriate interventions
* Considering the effect on resources for proposed interventions and assessing their cost-effectiveness
* Supporting decision making in health care and planning health services including any necessary changes.
* Informing, educating, and empowering people about health issues

===Implementing effective improvement strategies===
To improve public health, one important strategy is to promote modern medicine and scientific neutrality to drive the public health policy and campaign, which is recommended by Armanda Solorzana, through a case study of the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.  Soloranza argues that public health policy can't concern only politics or economics.  Political concerns can lead government officials to hide the real numbers of people affected by disease in their regions, such as upcoming elections. Therefore, scientific neutrality in making public health policy is critical; it can ensure treatment needs are met regardless of political and economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Birn | first1 = A. E. | last2 = Solórzano | first2 = A. | title = Public health policy paradoxes: Science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 9 | pages = 1197–1213 | year = 1999 | pmid =  10501641| pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00160-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of public health care clearly shows the global effort to improve health care for all.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} However, in modern-day medicine, real, measurable change has not been clearly seen, and critics argue that this lack of improvement is due to ineffective methods that are being implemented. As argued by Paul E. Farmer, structural interventions could possibly have a large impact, and yet there are numerous problems as to why this strategy has yet to be incorporated into the health system. One of the main reasons that he suggests could be the fact that physicians are not properly trained to carry out structural interventions, meaning that the ground level health care professionals cannot implement these improvements. While structural interventions can not be the only area for improvement, the lack of coordination between socioeconomic factors and health care for the poor could be counterproductive, and end up causing greater inequity between the health care services received by the rich and by the poor. Unless health care is no longer treated as a commodity, global public health will ultimately not be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} This being the case, without changing the way in which health care is delivered to those who have less access to it, the universal goal of public health care cannot be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farmer | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Nizeye | first2 = B. | last3 = Stulac | first3 = S. | last4 = Keshavjee | first4 = S. | title = Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = e449 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17076568 | pmc = 1621099 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason why measurable changes may not be noticed in public health is because agencies themselves may not be measuring their programs' efficacy. Perrault et al.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Inderstrodt-Stephens|first2=Jill|last3=Hintz|first3=Elizabeth A.|date=7 December 2017|title=Tracking Success: Outputs Versus Outcomes—A Comparison of Accredited and Non-Accredited Public Health Agencies' Community Health Improvement Plan objectives|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=43|issue=3|language=en|pages=1–8|doi=10.1007/s10900-017-0454-0|pmid=29218542|issn=0094-5145}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed over 4,000 published objectives from Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIPs) of 280 local accredited and non-accredited public health agencies in the U.S., and found that the majority of objectives - around two-thirds - were focused on achieving agency outputs (e.g., developing communication plans, installing sidewalks, disseminating data to the community).  Only about one-third focused on seeking measurable changes in the populations they serve (i.e., changing people's knowledge, attitudes, behaviors). What this research showcases is that if agencies are only focused on accomplishing tasks (i.e., outputs) and do not have a focus on measuring actual changes in their populations with the activities they perform, it should not be surprising when measurable changes are not reported. Perrault et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; advocate for public health agencies to work with those in the discipline of [[Health communication|Health Communication]] to craft objectives that are measurable outcomes, and to assist agencies in developing tools and methods to be able to track more proximal changes in their target populations (e.g., knowledge and attitude shifts) that may be influenced by the activities the agencies are performing.

=== Public Health 2.0 ===
''Public Health 2.0'' is a movement within public health that aims to make the field more accessible to the general public and more user-driven. The term is used in three senses.  In the first sense, "Public Health 2.0" is similar to "[[Health 2.0]]" and describes the ways in which traditional public health practitioners and institutions are reaching out (or could reach out) to the public through social media and [[health blog]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Wilson, Kumanan |author2=Keelan, Jennifer  |date=May 2009 | title = Coping with public health 2.0 | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 180 | issue = 10 | pages = 1080 | doi = 10.1503/cmaj.090696 | pmid = 19433834 | pmc = 2679846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Vance, K. |author2=Howe, W. |author3=Dellavalle, R.P. |date=April 2009 | title = Social internet sites as a source of public health information | journal = Dermatologic Clinics | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 133–136 | doi = 10.1016/j.det.2008.11.010 | pmid = 19254656}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense, "Public Health 2.0" describes public health research that uses data gathered from social networking sites, search engine queries, cell phones, or other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://governmentfutures.com/images/stories/documents/PublicHealth2-0NotesPRINT.pdf |title=Public Health 2.0: Spreading like a virus |accessdate=13 June 2011 |date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent example is the proposal of statistical framework that utilizes online user-generated content (from social media or search engine queries) to estimate the impact of an influenza vaccination campaign in the UK.&lt;ref name=DMKD&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lampos |first=Vasileios |last2=Yom-Tov |first2=Elad |last3=Pebody |first3=Richard| last4=Cox |first4=Ingemar J. |date=2 July 2015 |title=Assessing the impact of a health intervention via user-generated Internet content |journal=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery | doi=10.1007/s10618-015-0427-9 |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=1434–1457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third sense, "Public Health 2.0" is used to describe public health activities that are completely user-driven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.publichealth2point0.ca |title=Public Health 2.0 FAQs |accessdate=13 June 2011 |author=DLSPH Conference Planning Committee | publisher=Public Health 2.0 Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the collection and sharing of information about [[environmental radiation]] levels after the March 2011 tsunami in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2011/04/201142317359479927.html |title=Crowdsourcing Japan's radiation levels |accessdate= 13 June 2011 |author = D. Parvaz |date=26 April 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all cases, Public Health 2.0 draws on ideas from [[Web 2.0]], such as [[crowdsourcing]], [[information sharing]], and [[user-centred design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Hardey, Michael |date=July 2008 | title = Public health and Web 2.0 | journal = Perspectives in Public Health | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 181–189 | doi=10.1177/1466424008092228}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many individual healthcare providers have started making their own personal contributions to "Public Health 2.0" through personal blogs, social profiles, and websites, other larger organizations, such as the [[American Heart Association]] (AHA) and United Medical Education (UME), have a larger team of employees centered around online driven health education, research, and training. These private organizations recognize the need for free and easy to access health materials often building libraries of educational articles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Developing countries==
[[File:MRT Myanmar.jpg|thumb|Emergency Response Team in [[Burma]] after [[Cyclone Nargis]] in 2008]]
There is a great disparity in access to [[health care]] and public health initiatives between [[developed nations]] and [[developing nations]]. In the developing world, public health infrastructures are still forming. There may not be enough trained [[health workforce|health workers,]] monetary resources or, in some cases, sufficient knowledge to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lincoln C Chen |author2=David Evans |author3=Tim Evans |author4=Ritu Sadana |author5=Barbara Stilwell |author6=Phylida Travis |author7=Wim Van Lerberghe |author8=Pascal Zurn |title=World Health Report 2006: working together for health |location=Geneva |publisher=WHO |year=2006 |oclc=71199185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jamison 15–22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jamison|first=D T|last2=Mosley|first2=W H|date=January 1991|title=Disease control priorities in developing countries: health policy responses to epidemiological change.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=81|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.2105/ajph.81.1.15|pmid=1983911|issn=0090-0036|pmc=1404931}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a large majority of disease and mortality in the developing world results from and contributes to extreme poverty. For example, many African governments spend less than [[United States dollar|US$]]10 per person per year on health care, while, in the United States, the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] spent approximately US$4,500 per capita in 2000. However, expenditures on health care should not be confused with spending on public health. Public health measures may not generally be considered "health care" in the strictest sense. For example, mandating the use of seat belts in cars can save countless lives and contribute to the health of a population, but typically money spent enforcing this rule would not count as money spent on health care.

Large parts of the developing world remained plagued by largely preventable or treatable infectious diseases.  In addition to this however, many [[developing countries]] are also experiencing an epidemiological shift and polarization in which populations are now experiencing more of the effects of chronic diseases as life expectancy increases with, the poorer communities being heavily affected by both chronic and infectious diseases.&lt;ref name="Jamison 15–22"/&gt; Another major public health concern in the developing world is poor [[Maternal health|maternal]] and child health, exacerbated by [[malnutrition]] and poverty.  The [[WHO]] reports that a lack of [[Breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|exclusive breastfeeding]] during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=World Health Organization |url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/en/index.html |title=10 facts on breastfeeding |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intermittent preventive therapy]] aimed at treating and preventing [[malaria]] episodes among pregnant women and young children is one public health measure in [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] countries.

Each day brings new front-page headlines about public health: emerging infectious diseases such as [[SARS]], rapidly making its way from China (see [[Public health in China]]) to Canada, the United States and other geographically distant countries; reducing [[health equity|inequities in health care access]] through publicly funded health insurance programs; the [[HIV/AIDS pandemic]] and its spread from certain high-risk groups to the general population in many countries, such as in [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|South Africa]]; the increase of [[childhood obesity]] and the concomitant increase in type II diabetes among children; the social, economic and health effects of [[adolescent pregnancy]]; and the public health challenges related to [[natural disaster]]s such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]], [[Hurricane Katrina|2005's Hurricane Katrina]] in the United States and the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].

Since the 1980s, the growing field of [[population health]] has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and [[risk factor]]s to population-level issues such as [[health equity|inequality]], poverty, and education. Modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population. There is a recognition that our health is affected by many factors including where we live, genetics, our income, our educational status and our social relationships; these are known as "[[social determinants of health]]". The upstream drivers such as environment, education, employment, income, food security, housing, social inclusion and many others effect the distribution of health between and within populations and are often shaped by policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7JxutqCmctUC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=health+policy+interventions+-+the+United+Nations#v=onepage&amp;q=health%20policy%20interventions%20-%20the%20United%20Nations&amp;f=false|title=Equity, Social Determinants and Public Health Programmes|last=Organization|first=World Health|date=2010|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=9789241563970|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A social gradient in health runs through society. The poorest generally suffer the worst health, but even the middle classes will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social stratum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Solid Facts: Social Determinants of Health |editor=Richard G. Wilkinson |editor2=Michael G. Marmot |publisher=WHO |year=2003 |oclc=54966941 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new public health advocates for population-based policies that improve health in an equitable manner.

=== Health aid in developing countries ===
{{Main|Aid}}Health aid to developing countries is an important source of public health funding for many developing countries.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendavid|first=Eran|last2=Bhattacharya|first2=Jay|year=2014|title=The Relationship of Health Aid to Population Health Improvements |journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=174|issue=6|pages=881–887|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.292 |pmc=4777302|pmid=24756557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health aid to developing countries has shown a significant increase after World War II as concerns over the spread of disease as a result of globalization increased and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa surfaced.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Twumasi|first=Patrick|date=1 April 1981|title=Colonialism and international health: A study in social change in Ghana|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0160798781900375|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine.

==== International health aid debates ====
Debates exist questioning the efficacy of international health aid. Proponents of aid claim that health aid from wealthy countries is necessary in order for developing countries to escape the [[poverty trap]]. Opponents of health aid claim that international health aid actually disrupts developing countries' course of development, causes dependence on aid, and in many cases the aid fails to reach its recipients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; For example, recently, health aid was funneled towards initiatives such as financing new technologies like antiretroviral medication, insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and new vaccines. The positive impacts of these initiatives can be seen in the eradication of smallpox and polio; however, critics claim that misuse or misplacement of funds may cause many of these efforts to never come into fruition.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Economic modeling based on the [[Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation]] and the [[World Health Organization]] has shown a link between international health aid in developing countries and a reduction in adult mortality rates.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, a 2014-2016 study suggests that a potential confounding variable for this outcome is the possibility that aid was directed at countries once they were already on track for improvement.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; That same study, however, also suggests that 1 billion dollars in health aid was associated with 364,000 fewer deaths occurring between ages 0 and 5 in 2011.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Sustainable development goals ===
{{Further|Sustainable Development Goals}}
To address current and future challenges in addressing health issues in the world, the [[United Nations]] have developed the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] building off of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of 2000 to be completed by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2015 - United Nations sustainable development agenda|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/development-agenda/#|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These goals in their entirety encompass the entire spectrum of development across nations, however Goals 1-6 directly address health disparities, primarily in developing countries.&lt;ref name=UN2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sustainable development goals - United Nations|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These six goals address key issues in [[Global health|global public health]]: [[Poverty]], Hunger and [[food security]], Health, Education, [[Gender equality]] and women's empowerment, and water and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name=UN2015/&gt; Public health officials can use these goals to set their own agenda and plan for smaller scale initiatives for their organizations. These goals hope to lessen the burden of disease and inequality faced by developing countries and lead to a healthier future.

The links between the various sustainable development goals and public health are numerous and well established:
* Living below the poverty line is attributed to poorer health outcomes and can be even worse for persons living in developing countries where [[extreme poverty]] is more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NCCP {{!}} Child Poverty|url = http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html|website = www.nccp.org|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A child born into poverty is twice as likely to die before the age of five compared to a child from a wealthier family.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Health - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/health/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The detrimental effects of hunger and [[malnutrition]] that can arise from systemic challenges with food security are enormous. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that 12.9 percent of the population in developing countries is undernourished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hunger and food security - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Health challenges in the developing world are enormous, with "only half of the women in developing nations receiving the recommended amount of healthcare they need.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015/&gt; 
* [[Educational equity]] has yet to be reached in the world. Public health efforts are impeded by this, as a lack of education can lead to poorer health outcomes. This is shown by children of mothers who have no education having a lower survival rate compared to children born to mothers with primary or greater levels of education.&lt;ref name=UNhealth2015/&gt; Cultural differences in the role of women vary by country, many gender inequalities are found in developing nations. Combating these inequalities has shown to also lead to better public health outcome. 
* In studies done by the [[World Bank]] on populations in developing countries, it was found that when women had more control over household resources, the children benefit through better access to food, healthcare, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Development Report|url = https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/2124|website = openknowledge.worldbank.org|accessdate = 25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Basic [[sanitation]] resources and access to clean sources of water are a basic [[Right to water|human right]]. However, 1.8 billion people globally use a source of drinking water that is fecally contaminated, and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation facilities like [[toilet]]s or [[pit latrine]]s.&lt;ref name=UNwater2015&gt;{{Cite web|title = Water and Sanitation - United Nations Sustainable Development|url = https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/|website = United Nations Sustainable Development|accessdate = 25 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lack of these resources is what causes approximately 1000 children a day to die from [[Diarrhea|diarrhoel diseases]] that could have been prevented from better water and [[sanitation]] infrastructure.&lt;ref name=UNwater2015/&gt;

=== U.S. initiatives ===
{{Main|Global Health Initiatives}}The U.S. Global Health Initiative was created in 2009 by President Obama in an attempt to have a more holistic, comprehensive approach to improving global health as opposed to previous, disease-specific interventions.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8116.pdf|title=The U.S. Global Health Initiative|last=|first=|date=February 2011|website=Kaiser Family Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Health Initiative is a six-year plan, "to develop a comprehensive U.S. government strategy for global health, building on the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) to combat HIV as well as U.S. efforts to address tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, and augmenting the focus on other global health priorities, including neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH), nutrition, and health systems strengthening (HSS)".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The GHI programs are being implemented in more than 80 countries around the world and works closely with the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are seven core principles:

#Women, girls, and gender equality
#Strategic coordination and integration
#Strengthen and leverage key multilaterals and other partners
#Country-ownership
#Sustainability through Health Systems
#Improve metrics, monitoring, and evaluation
#Promote research and innovation&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The aid effectiveness agenda is a useful tool for measuring the impact of these large scale programs such as [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] and the [[Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation|Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]]  (GAVI) which have been successful in achieving rapid and visible results.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Global Fund claims that its efforts have provided antiretroviral treatment for over three million people worldwide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; GAVI claims that its vaccination programs have prevented over 5 million deaths since it began in 2000.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Education and training==
Education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in Schools of Public Health, Medical Schools, Veterinary Schools, Schools of Nursing, and Schools of Public Affairs. The training typically requires a [[university degree]] with a focus on core disciplines of [[biostatistics]], [[epidemiology]], [[Health administration|health services administration]], [[health policy]], [[health education]], [[behavioral science]], gender issues, sexual and reproductive health, public health nutrition and [[environmental and occupational health]].&lt;ref name=mmwr4850&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. (1999). ''Achievements in Public Health, 1900–1999'' - https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm4850.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Health Agency of Canada. [http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/php-psp/mphpg-mhplg/mphp-mhpp04-eng.php Canadian Public Health Workforce Core Competencies], accessed 19 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the global context, the field of public health education has evolved enormously in recent decades, supported by institutions such as the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[World Bank]], among others. Operational structures are formulated by strategic principles, with educational and career pathways guided by competency frameworks, all requiring modulation according to local, national and global realities. It is critically important for the health of populations that nations assess their public health human resource needs and develop their ability to deliver this capacity, and not depend on other countries to supply it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1159/000354198| pmid=23969636| pmc=5586806|title = The Imperative of Public Health Education: A Global Perspective| journal=Medical Principles and Practice| volume=22| issue=6| pages=515–529|year = 2013|last1 = White|first1 = Franklin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools of public health: a US perspective===
In the [[United States]], the Welch-Rose Report of 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Welch|first1=William H.|last2=Rose|first2=Wickliffe|year=1915|title=Institute of Hygiene: Being a report by Dr. William H.

Even though schools of public health had already been established in [[Canada]], [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]], the United States had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions.  A $25,000 donation from businessman [[Samuel Zemurray]] instituted the [[Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine|School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Tulane University]] in 1912 conferring its first doctor of public health degree in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darnell|first=Regna|title=Histories of anthropology annual|year=2008|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|pages=36|isbn=978-0-8032-6664-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=John Percy|title=Tulane: the biography of a university, 1834-1965|year=1966|publisher=Harper &amp; Row|pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Yale School of Public Health]] was founded by [[Charles-Edward Avory Winslow]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/182530966|title=A history of Yale's School of Medicine : passing torches to others|last=1933-2013,|first=Burrow, Gerard N.,|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300132885|location=New Haven|oclc=182530966}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]] became an independent, degree-granting institution for research and training in public health, and the largest public health training facility in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;The World Book Encyclopedia, 1994, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Education of the Physician: International Dimensions.

By 1922, schools of public health were established at [[Columbia university|Columbia]] and [[Harvard]] on the Hopkins model. By 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the US, enrolling around fifteen thousand students.&lt;ref name=mmwr4850/&gt;&lt;ref name=PHP/&gt;

Over the years, the types of students and training provided have also changed. In the beginning, students who enrolled in public health schools typically had already obtained a medical degree; public health school training was largely a second degree for [[physician|medical professionals]]. However, in 1978, 69% of American students enrolled in public health schools had only a [[bachelor's degree]].&lt;ref name=mmwr4850/&gt;

===Degrees in public health===
{{Main|Professional degrees of public health}}

Schools of public health offer a variety of degrees which generally fall into two categories: professional or academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceph.org/pdf/Master_List.pdf|title=Schools of Public Health and Public Health Programs|date=11 March 2011|publisher=[[Council on Education for Public Health]]|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major postgraduate degrees are the [[Master of Public Health]] (MPH) or the [[Master of Science]] in Public Health (MSPH). Doctoral studies in this field include [[Doctor of Public Health]] (DrPH) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (PhD) in a subspeciality of greater Public Health disciplines. DrPH is regarded as a professional degree and PhD as more of an academic degree.

Professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings. The [[Master of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Public Health]], [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc) and the [[Master of Health Administration|Master of Health Care Administration]] are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments, managed care and community-based organizations, hospitals and consulting firms, among others. [[Master of Public Health]] degrees broadly fall into two categories, those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more eclectic range of methodologies.  A Master of Science of Public Health is similar to an MPH but is considered an academic degree (as opposed to a professional degree) and places more emphasis on scientific methods and research.  The same distinction can be made between the DrPH and the DHSc. The DrPH is considered a professional degree and the DHSc is an academic degree.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and [[preventive medicine]] who wish to pursue careers in research, university teaching in graduate programs, policy analysis and development, and other high-level public health positions. Examples of academic degrees are the [[Master of Science]], [[Doctor of Philosophy]], [[Doctor of Science]] (ScD), and [[Doctor of Health Science]] (DHSc). The doctoral programs are distinct from the MPH and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a [[dissertation]] research project.

In the United States, the Association of Schools of Public Health&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asph.org/ Association of Schools of Public Health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911051643/http://www.asph.org/ |date=11 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; represents [[Council on Education for Public Health]] (CEPH) accredited schools of public health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceph.org Council on Education for Public Health]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delta Omega]] is the [[honor society]] for graduate studies in public health. The society was founded in 1924 at the [[Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health]]. Currently, there are approximately 68 chapters throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deltaomega.org/ Delta Omega website] (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Doutielt3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The primitive nature of [[Middle Ages|medieval]] medicine rendered Europe helpless to the onslaught of the [[Black Death]] in the 14th century. Miniature from "The Chronicles of Gilles Li Muisis" (1272-1352). Bibliothèque royale de Belgique, MS 13076-77, f. 24v.]]
Public health has early roots in antiquity. From the beginnings of [[human civilization]], it was recognized that polluted [[water]] and lack of proper [[waste disposal]] spread communicable diseases (theory of [[miasma theory of disease|miasma]]). Early [[religion]]s attempted to regulate behavior that specifically related to health, from types of [[food]] eaten, to regulating certain indulgent behaviors, such as drinking [[alcohol]] or [[human sexual behaviour|sexual relations]]. [[leadership|Leaders]] were responsible for the health of their subjects to ensure social stability, [[wealth|prosperity]], and maintain order.

By [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times, it was well understood that proper [[waste management|diversion of human waste]] was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas. The [[History of China|ancient Chinese]] [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|medical doctors]] developed the practice of [[variolation]] following a [[smallpox]] epidemic around 1000 BC. An individual without the disease could gain some measure of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals. Also, children were protected by [[inoculation|inoculating]] a scratch on their forearms with the pus from a lesion.

In 1485 the [[Republic of Venice]] established a permanent [[Venetian Magistrate for Health]] comprising supervisors of health with special attention to the prevention of the spread of epidemics in the territory from abroad. The three supervisors were initially appointed by the Venetian Senate. In 1537 it was assumed by the Grand Council, and in 1556 added two judges, with the task of control, on behalf of the Republic, the efforts of the supervisors.

However, according to [[Michel Foucault]], the plague model of [[governmentality]] was later controverted by the [[cholera]] model. A Cholera pandemic devastated Europe between 1829 and 1851, and was first fought by the use of what Foucault called "social medicine", which focused on flux, circulation of air, location of [[cemeteries]], etc. All those concerns, born of the [[miasma theory of disease]], were mixed with [[urbanism|urbanistic]] concerns for the management of populations, which Foucault designated as the concept of "[[biopower]]". The German conceptualized this in the ''[[Polizeiwissenschaft]]'' ("[[Police science]]").

===Modern public health===
The 18th century saw rapid growth in voluntary hospitals in [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/History-Britains-Hospitals-Barry-Carruthers/dp/1857769058/ Carruthers, G. Barry. ''History of Britain's Hospitals'' (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the century brought the establishment of the basic pattern of improvements in public health over the next two centuries: a social evil was identified, private philanthropists brought attention to it, and changing public opinion led to government action.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482384/public-health/35547/National-developments-in-the-18th-and-19th-centuries|title=public health|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The cow pock.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|1802 caricature of [[Edward Jenner]] vaccinating patients who feared it would make them sprout cowlike appendages.]]
The practice of [[vaccination]] became prevalent in the 1800s, following the pioneering work of [[Edward Jenner]] in treating [[smallpox]]. [[James Lind]]'s discovery of the causes of [[scurvy]] amongst sailors and its mitigation via the introduction of [[fruit]] on lengthy voyages was published in 1754 and led to the adoption of this idea by the [[Royal Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Vale, Brian. "The Conquest of Scurvy in the Royal Navy 1793–1800: A Challenge to Current Orthodoxy". ''[[The Mariners' Mirror]]'', volume 94, number 2, May 2008, pp. 160–175.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were also made to promulgate health matters to the broader public; in 1752 the British physician Sir [[John Pringle (physician)|John Pringle]] published ''Observations on the Diseases of the Army in Camp and Garrison'', in which he advocated for the importance of adequate ventilation in the [[military]] [[barracks]] and the provision of [[latrine]]s for the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | pmid=5330009 | last=Selwyn | first=S | publication-date=July 1966| year=1966 | title=Sir John Pringle: hospital reformer, moral philosopher and pioneer of antiseptics | volume=10 | issue=3 | periodical=Medical History | pages=266–74 | pmc=1033606 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300011133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], living standards amongst the working population began to worsen, with cramped and unsanitary urban conditions. In the first four decades of the 19th century alone, [[London]]'s population doubled and even greater growth rates were recorded in the new industrial towns, such as [[Leeds]] and [[Manchester]]. This rapid [[urbanisation]] exacerbated the spread of disease in the large [[conurbation]]s that built up around the [[workhouse]]s and [[factory|factories]]. These settlements were cramped and primitive with no organized [[sanitation]]. Disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants. Unavailable housing led to the rapid growth of [[slum]]s and the [[per capita]] [[death rate]] began to rise alarmingly, almost doubling in [[Birmingham]] and [[Liverpool]]. [[Thomas Malthus]] warned of the dangers of overpopulation in 1798. His ideas, as well as those of [[Jeremy Bentham]], became very influential in government circles in the early years of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

====Public health legislation====
[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]] was a pivotal influence on the early public health campaign.]]
The first attempts at sanitary reform and the establishment of public health institutions were made in the 1840s. [[Thomas Southwood Smith]], physician at the [[London Fever Hospital]], began to write papers on the importance of public health, and was one of the first physicians brought in to give evidence before the [[Poor Law Commission]] in the 1830s, along with [[Neil Arnott]] and [[James Phillips Kay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Amanda J. Thomas|title=The Lambeth cholera outbreak of 1848-1849: the setting, causes, course and aftermath of an epidemic in London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XGLd5hQ1-8UC&amp;pg=PA56|accessdate=5 April 2012|year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-3989-8|pages=55–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith advised the government on the importance of [[quarantine]] and sanitary improvement for limiting the spread of infectious diseases such as [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret Stacey|title=The Sociology of Health and Healing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5IAUjCaEtCoC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=5 April 2012|date=1 June 2004|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=978-0-203-38004-8|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Samuel Edward Finer]]|title=The Life and Times of Sir Edwin Chadwick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JycOAAAAQAAJ|year=1952|publisher=Methuen|isbn=978-0-416-17350-5|pages=424–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poor Law Commission]] reported in 1838 that "the expenditures necessary to the adoption and maintenance of measures of prevention would ultimately amount to less than the cost of the disease now constantly engendered". It recommended the implementation of large scale government [[engineering]] projects to alleviate the conditions that allowed for the propagation of disease.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The [[Health of Towns Association]] was formed in [[Exeter]] on 11 December 1844, and vigorously campaigned for the development of public health in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=Ashton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the Health of Towns Commission, chaired by Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]], which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in British cities.&lt;ref name=Ashton/&gt;

These national and local movements led to the [[Public Health Act 1848|Public Health Act]], finally passed in 1848. It aimed to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in England and Wales by placing the supply of water, sewerage, drainage, cleansing and paving under a single local body with the General Board of Health as a central authority. The Act was passed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[First Russell ministry|government]] of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], in response to the urging of [[Edwin Chadwick]]. Chadwick's seminal report on ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was published in 1842&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=excerpt from ''Report...from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain'' (pp.369-372) (online source)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html|last=Chadwick|first=Edwin|chapter=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions | year=1842| publisher=to The Victorian Web|location=added by Laura Del Col|accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed up with a supplementary report a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population of Great Britain.

[[Vaccination]] for various diseases was made compulsory in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1851, and by 1871 legislation required a comprehensive system of registration run by appointed vaccination officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue?sn=4127 |title=Decline of Infant Mortality in England and Wales, 1871-1948 : a Medical Conundrum|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further interventions were made by a series of subsequent [[Public Health Acts]], notably the [[Public Health Act 1875|1875 Act]]. Reforms included latrinization, the building of [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s, the regular [[waste disposal|collection of garbage]] followed by [[incineration]] or disposal in a [[landfill]], the [[History of water supply|provision of clean water]] and the draining of standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes.

The [[Infectious Disease (Notification) Act 1889]] mandated the reporting of infectious diseases to the local sanitary authority, which could then pursue measures such as the removal of the patient to hospital and the disinfection of homes and properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Intrusive Interventions: Public Health, Domestic Space, and Infectious Disease Surveillance in England, 1840-1914|last = Mooney|first = Graham|publisher = University of Rochester Press|year = 2015|isbn = 9781580465274|location = Rochester, NY|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the first public health organization based on a state health department and local boards of health was founded in [[New York City]] in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;United States Public Health Service, ''Municipal Health Department Practice for the Year 1923'' (Public Health Bulletin # 164, July 1926), pp.  348, 357, 364&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epidemiology====
[[File:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s dot map, showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854.]]
The science of [[epidemiology]] was founded by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]]'s identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 [[cholera]] outbreak in London. Dr. Snow believed in the [[germ theory]] of disease as opposed to the prevailing [[Miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. He first publicized his theory in an essay, ''On the Mode of Communication of Cholera'', in 1849, followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the [[Soho]] epidemic of 1854.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t1exE1cfKXIC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+%22john+snow%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=4Kx7TNabHdOeOM_xgdQG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22institut%20de%20france%22%20and%20%22john%20snow%22&amp;f=false ''Concepts and practice of humanitarian medicine'' (2008) Par S.

Masellis] {{ISBN|0-387-72263-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NSHXLkgFBBQC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=%22institut+de+france%22+and+snow&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=0Kd7TLfkGMSOOIrs2a4P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA]&lt;/ref&gt;

By talking to local residents (with the help of [[Reverend Henry Whitehead]]), he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on Broad Street (now [[Broadwick Street]]).  Although Snow's chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the [[Broad Street pump]] did not conclusively prove its danger, his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle.&lt;ref&gt;Vinten-Johansen, Peter,  ''et al.'' (2003). ''Cholera, Chloroform, and the Science of Medicine: A Life of John Snow''. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-513544-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow later used a [[dot distribution map|dot map]] to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump.  He also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases.  He showed that the [[Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company]] was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the [[Thames]] and delivering the water to homes, leading to an increased incidence of cholera. Snow's study was a major event in the history of public health and geography.  It is regarded as the founding event of the science of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Berlin Johnson|Johnson, Steven]] (2006).

====Disease control====
[[File:Paul-Louis Simond injecting plague vaccine June 4th 1898 Karachi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Paul-Louis Simond]] injecting a plague vaccine in Karachi, 1898.]]
With the pioneering work in [[bacteriology]] of French chemist [[Louis Pasteur]] and German scientist [[Robert Koch]], methods for isolating the [[bacteria]] responsible for a given disease and vaccines for remedy were developed at the turn of the 20th century. British physician [[Ronald Ross]] identified the [[mosquito]] as the carrier of [[malaria]] and laid the foundations for combating the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1123&amp;Itemid=10|title=:: Laboc Hospital - A Noble Prize Winner's Workplace|publisher=easternpanorama.in|accessdate=11 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105175214/http://easternpanorama.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1123&amp;Itemid=10|archivedate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] revolutionized [[surgery]] by the introduction of [[antiseptic]] [[surgery]] to eliminate [[infection]].

With onset of the [[epidemiological transition]] and as the prevalence of [[Infectious disease in the 20th century|infectious diseases decreased through the 20th century]], public health began to put more focus on [[chronic diseases]] such as [[cancer]] and [[heart disease]]. Previous efforts in many developed countries had already led to dramatic reductions in the [[infant mortality rate]] using preventative methods. In Britain, the infant mortality rate fell from over 15% in 1870 to 7% by 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sussex.ac.uk/webteam/gateway/file.php?name=wps-48-2012.pdf&amp;site=24|title=The declines in infant mortality and fertility: Evidence from British cities in demographic transition |accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Country examples ===
====France====
[[French Third Republic|France 1871-1914]]  followed well behind Bismarckian Germany, as well as Great Britain, in developing the welfare state including public health.  Tuberculosis was the most dreaded disease of the day, especially striking young people in their 20s.  Germany set up vigorous measures of public hygiene and public sanatoria, but France let private physicians handle the problem, which left it with a much higher death rate.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mitchell, ''The Divided Path: The German Influence on Social Reform in France After 1870'' (1991) pp 252-75 [https://www.amazon.com/Divided-Path-German-Influence-Social/dp/0807857432 excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;  The French medical profession jealously guarded its prerogatives, and public health activists were not as well organized or as influential as in Germany, Britain or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Martha L. Hildreth, ''Doctors, Bureaucrats &amp; Public Health in France, 1888-1902'' (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alisa Klaus, ''Every Child a Lion: The Origins of Maternal &amp; Infant Health Policy in the United States &amp; France, 1890-1920'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, there was a long battle over a [[public health law]] which began in the 1880s as a campaign to reorganize the nation's health services, to require the registration of infectious diseases, to mandate quarantines, and to improve the deficient health and housing legislation of 1850. However the reformers met opposition from bureaucrats, politicians, and physicians. Because it was so threatening to so many interests, the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902. Success finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits, and keeping the population growth rate well below Germany's.&lt;ref&gt;Ann-Louise Shapiro, "Private Rights, Public Interest, and Professional Jurisdiction: The French Public Health Law of 1902."

====United States====

{{see also|United States Public Health Service}}

Modern public health began developing in the 19th century, as a response to advances in science that led to the understanding of, the source and spread of disease. As the knowledge of contagious diseases increased, means to control them and prevent infection were soon developed. Once it became understood that these strategies would require community-wide participation, disease control began being viewed as a public responsibility. Various organizations and agencies were then created to implement these disease preventing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK218224/|title=A History of the Public Health System|last=Health|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for the Study of the Future of Public|date=1988|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Public health activity in the United States took place at the municipal level before the mid-20th century. There was some activity at the national and state level as well.&lt;ref&gt;John Duffy, ''The sanitarians: a history of American public health'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the administration of the second president of the United States [[John Adams]], the Congress authorized the creation of hospitals for mariners.  As the U.S. expanded, the scope of the governmental health agency expanded.

In the United States, public health worker [[Sara Josephine Baker]], M.D. established many programs to help the poor in New York City keep their infants healthy, leading teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] and teaching mothers how to dress, feed, and bathe their babies.

Another key pioneer of public health in the U.S. was [[Lillian Wald]], who founded the [[Henry Street Settlement]] house in New York.  The [[Visiting Nurse Service of New York]] was a significant organization for bringing health care to the urban poor.

Dramatic increases in average life span in the late 19th century and 20th century, is widely credited to public health achievements, such as [[vaccination]] programs and control of many infectious diseases including [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], [[diphtheria]], [[yellow fever]] and [[smallpox]]; effective health and safety policies such as [[road traffic safety]] and [[Occupational safety and health|occupational safety]]; improved [[family planning]]; [[tobacco control]] measures; and programs designed to decrease [[non-communicable disease]]s by acting on known risk factors such as a person's background, lifestyle and environment.

Another major public health improvement was the decline in the "urban penalty" brought about by improvements in [[sanitation]]. These improvements included [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of drinking water, filtration and [[sewage treatment]] which led to the decline in deaths caused by infectious [[waterborne diseases]] such as [[cholera]] and intestinal diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutler|first=David|author2=Grant Miller |title=The Role of Public Health Improvements in Health Advances: The Twentieth Century United States |journal=[[Demography (journal)|Demography]] |date=February 2004 |volume=42 |issue=1 |oclc=703811616 |doi=10.1353/dem.2005.0002|pages=1–22|pmid=15782893 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public health issues were important for the [[Spanish empire]] during the colonial era.  Epidemic disease was the main factor in the decline of indigenous populations in the era immediately following the sixteenth-century conquest era and was a problem during the colonial era. The Spanish crown took steps in eighteenth-century Mexico to bring in regulations to make populations healthier.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Cooper, ''Epidemic Disease in Mexico City, 1761-1813: An Administrative, Social, and Medical History''.

====Cuba====
{{see also|Timeline of healthcare in Cuba}}
Since the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]] the [[Cuban government]] has devoted extensive resources to the improvement of [[Healthcare in Cuba|health conditions]] for its entire population via universal access to health care. Infant mortality has plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;Pineo, “Public Health”, p. 483.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cuban medical internationalism]] as a policy has seen the Cuban government sent doctors as a form of aid and export to countries in need in Latin America, especially [[Mission Barrio Adentro|Venezuela]], as well as Oceania and Africa countries.

====Colombia and Bolivia====
Public health was important elsewhere in Latin America in consolidating state power and integrating marginalized populations into the nation-state.  In Colombia, public health was a means for creating and implementing ideas of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Hanni Jalil, "Curing a Sick Nation: Public Health and Citizenship in Colombia, 1930-1940." PhD dissertation, University of California, Santa Barbara 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bolivia, a similar push came after their 1952 revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Pacino, "Prescription for a Nation: Public Health in Post-Revolutionary Bolivia, 1952-1964."

'''Relapsing–remitting''' is a medical term referring to a presentation of disease [[symptom]]s that become worse over time ([[Relapse|relapsing]]), followed by periods of less severe symptoms that do not completely cease ([[Remittance|remitting]]).  The term is sometimes applied to groupings of presentations of particular diseases that display this pattern, such as:

Initially, it was primarily intended a substitution for conventional, face-to-face therapy in which a client or patient is required to visit a psychotherapists office. Increasingly, however, academics are studying the use of electronic media in treatment to explore the possibility of providing novel and potentially more effective therapies.

After reviewing thirteen relevant studies, the authors of a meta-analytic review of psychotherapy mediated by remote communications technology concluded that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Remote therapy has the potential to overcome some of the barriers to conventional psychological therapy services. Telephone-based interventions are a particularly popular research focus and as a means of therapeutic communication may confer specific advantages in terms of their widespread availability and ease of operation. However, the available evidence is limited in quantity and quality. More rigorous trials are required to confirm these preliminary estimates of effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Biomed Central"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1471-244X-8-60 |title=Psychotherapy mediated by remote communication technologies: A meta-analytic review |year=2008 |last1=Bee |first1=Penny E |last2=Bower |first2=Peter |last3=Lovell |first3=Karina |last4=Gilbody |first4=Simon |last5=Richards |first5=David |last6=Gask |first6=Linda |last7=Roach |first7=Pamela |journal=BMC Psychiatry |volume=8 |pages=60 |pmid=18647396 |pmc=2496903}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Examples ==
Despite the absence of complete study, remote therapy has enjoyed growing popularity as a replacement for traditional therapy and innovative practice made possible by electronic medium. Examples include:
*The US Army has initiated a program in which soldiers in combat participate in video-based [[Couples counseling|relationship counseling]]  with their partners at home.&lt;ref name="Adam Shaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/-news/2009/06/15/22707-q-west-chaplains-introduce-video-teleconference-counseling-for-couples/|title=Q-West Chaplains Introduce Video Teleconference Counseling for Couples|publisher=WWW.ARMY.MIL (The Official Homepage of The United States Army)|accessdate=June 15, 2009|author=Sgt. 1st Class Adam Shaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-healing''' refers to the process of recovery (generally from [[Psychology|psychological]] disturbances, [[Psychological trauma|trauma]], etc.), motivated by and directed by the patient, guided often only by [[instinct]]. Such a process encounters mixed fortunes due to its amateur nature, although self-motivation is a major asset. The value of self-healing lies in its ability to be tailored to the unique experience and requirements of the individual. The process can be helped and accelerated with introspection techniques such as [[Meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://nccih.nih.gov/health/meditation/overview.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Self Healing as a Way to Overcome Racial Trauma ==


Historically, communities of Color in the United States and around the World have attempted to use different modes (i.e. scholarship, art, and community gathering) to create self-healing as a way to combat the daily trauma of living in a racialized society.

[[Frantz Fanon]] wrote about the subjectivity and objectivity paradox inherent in [[Race (human categorization)|Blackness]] in his book [[Black Skin, White Masks|&lt;u&gt;Black Skin, White Masks&lt;/u&gt;.]] He describes feeling "infinite" but being subjected to the standards reserved for someone who is crippled. At the end of the fifth chapter, he writes that he weeps at the "crossroads between Nothingness and Infinity." His scholarship is meant to provide a lesson to White readers: Black people are also human beings. However, his intention in writing the fifth chapter was no doubt a hope to heal himself in offering up his struggle so that those who mistreated him and his people could reach a place of understanding. In sharing his personal trauma, he offered a way for Black people to connect over shared struggle and commiserate, but also brought his plight to the attentions of a White audience, who, if they could empathize, could lighten the racial load of the Black people around them and could hopefully, someday, ease Fanon's own mental load.

[[Langston Hughes]] is an example of how Black people have used art to self-heal from racial trauma. His poem, [https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47880/theme-for-english-b "Theme for English B"] details his struggle with completing a writing assignment about truth for a class. He is only able to complete the assignment when he acknowledges the stratified differences between him, his other classmates, and his professor. As he writes, "I am the only colored student in my class." His poem is a way to package his trauma so that he can use it for something constructive in the hopes that it will ultimately heal some of his pain.

[http://www.harrietsapothecary.com/ Harriet's Apothecary] is a NYC-based organization that seeks to create self-healing for communities of color through different healing based events. Their work takes place across the US. They host vendors, and offer reiki-healing, massages, food, and yoga among many other different "stations" as a way to combat racial trauma. They do community building work to address poverty (because [[racism in the United States]] has left communities of color in disproportionate levels of poverty compared to their White counterparts). To gain entrance to most, if not all of their events, their policy is pay-what-you-can.{{Citation needed|reason=Self Healing as a Way to Overcome Racial Trauma section has no ref|date=December 2017}}

== The Different Meanings of Self-Healing ==


Self-healing is the ultimate phase of [[Gestalt Therapy]].

Self-healing may refer to automatic, [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] processes of the body that are controlled by physiological mechanisms inherent in the organism. Disorders of the [[Gifts of healing|spirit]] and the absence of faith can be self-healed.

In a figurative sense, self-healing properties can be ascribed to systems or processes, which by nature or design tend to correct any disturbances brought into them. Such as the regeneration of the skin after a cut or scrape, or of an entire limb. The injured party (the living body) repairs the damaged part by itself.

Beyond the innate restorative capacities of the physical body, there are many factors of psychological nature that can influence self-healing. [[Hippocrates]], considered by many to be the father of medical treatment, observed: "The physician must be ready, not only to do his duty himself, but also to secure the co-operation of the patient, of the attendants and of externals."
— Hippocrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hippocrates|title=Aphorisms|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Hippocrates/aphorisms.1.i.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-healing may also be achieved through deliberately applied psychological mechanisms. These approaches may improve the psychological and physical conditions of a person. Research confirms that this can be achieved through numerous mechanisms, including relaxation, breathing exercises, fitness exercises, imagery, [[Meditation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murphy|first1=Michael|last2=Donovan|first2=Steven|last3=Taylor|first3=Eugene|title=The Physical and Psychological Effects of Meditation: A Review of Contemporary Research With a Comprehensive Bibliography|date=1997|publisher=Inst of Noetic Sciences|isbn=9780943951362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Searchable meditation bibliography: http://biblio.noetic.org/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoga]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthandyoga.com/html/research_papers/yt.asp&lt;/ref&gt; [[qigong]], t'ai chi, [[biofeedback]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cliving.org/biblobiof.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and various forms of [[psychotherapy]], among other approaches.

Varieties of mechanisms for self-healing have been proposed, including:

# Decreases in stress hormones that may impair physiological functions when there is [[Psychological stress|chronic stress]].&lt;ref name="General Adaptive Syndrome"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitterer|first1=Jon|last2=Coon|first2=Dennis|title=Introduction to Psychology|date=2013|publisher=Jon-David Hague|pages=446–447}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Decreases in muscle tension, which can worsen or produce pains in muscles, tendons and joints when there is chronic muscle tension due to stress.
# Improved sleep that can be achieved through relaxation, which improves physiological functions.
# Improvements in emotional tensions, depression, anger and other emotions that can otherwise impair social relationships and functioning in the workplace, leading to vicious circles of increased psychological symptoms.

Another phrase that often includes self-healing is [[self-help]]. In 2013 [[Kathryn Schulz]] examined it as "an $11 billion industry".&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire''' (SDQ) is a [[self-report inventory]] behavioral screening [[questionnaire]] for children and adolescents ages 2 through 17 years old, developed by [[United Kingdom]] child psychiatrist [[Robert N Goodman|Robert N. Goodman]]. The SDQ is available online &lt;ref&gt;http://sdqscore.org&lt;/ref&gt; and has been translated into more than 80 languages, including [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name="SDQ website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire|url=http://sdqinfo.org/py/sdqinfo/b0.py|website=Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the SDQ has been proven to have satisfactory [[Construct validity|construct]] and [[concurrent validity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Lisanne L.|last2=Otten|first2=Roy|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger C.

There are three versions of the SDQ: a ''short form'', a ''longer form'' with impact supplement, and a ''follow-up form'' designed for use after a behavioral intervention. The questionnaire takes 3–10 minutes to complete.

==Scoring==
The SDQ scoring site allows one to score paper copies of a parent, teacher and/or self-report and generates a brief report. Each of the five scales of the SDQ are scored from 0-10, and one can add up four of these (emotional, conduct, hyperactivity and peer problems) to create a '''total difficulty score''' (range 0-40).&lt;ref name="Goodman, R. 1997. p. 581-6"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goodman |first=R. |title=The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire: a research note |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines |date=July 1997 |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=581-6 |pmid=9255702 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1997.tb01545.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One can also add the emotional and peer items together to get an internalising problems score (range 0-20) and add the conduct and hyperactivity questions together to get an externalising score (range 0-20).

===Total difficulty score===
; Dimensional measure
: The total difficulty score of the SDQ (range 0-40) is a fully dimensional measure, with each one-point increase in the total difficulty score corresponding to an increase in the risk of mental health disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Anna |first2=Robert |last2=Goodman |title=Strengths and difficulties questionnaire as a dimensional measure of child mental health |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry |date=April 2009 |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=400-3 |pmid=19242383 |doi=10.1097/CHI.0b013e3181985068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   As such, one can use the total difficulty score as a dimensional measure in research, e.g. comparing mean scores between groups or as a continuous outcome in linear regression analysis.
; Categories based on single-informant symptoms scores
: Alternatively, particularly when using the SDQ for screening purposes, it may be useful to turn symptom scores into categories.  An initial three-category solution was proposed by Youth in Mind, the owner of the SDQ ('normal'/'borderline'/'abnormal') with the cut-offs chosen using normative data from large population-based UK studies.  More recently, an alternative four-category solution has been adopted by Youth in Mind, with cut-offs chosen such that 80% of children score 'close to average', 10% are 'slightly raised', 5% 'high' and 5% 'very high'.  
; Categories based on multi-informant symptom + impact scores
: The SDQ scoring website also allows one to categorise children according to their risk of [[ICD-10]] or [[DSM-IV]] disorder based on triangulating information across all available informants (parent, teacher, self-report) and using the impact supplement as well as the symptom score.  This is done for the disorder groupings 'any disorder', 'emotional disorder', conduct disorder' and 'hyperactivity disorder'.  For each diagnostic grouping, there are three possible predictions: low risk, medium risk and high risk.  In general, empirical studies show that for children defined as being at 'low risk' on the SDQ, around 1-4% turn out to have a disorder when assessed by experts.  For children at 'medium risk' the proportion is 10-15%, and for children at 'high risk' the proportion is 25-60%.
; Prevalence estimates for UK research
: UK researchers can use validated SDQ algorithms to convert a given SDQ mean score into a predicted prevalence of disorder in a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Anna |first2=Robert |last2=Goodman |title=Population mean scores predict child mental disorder rates: validating SDQ prevalence estimators in Britain |journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines |date=January 2011 |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=100-8 |pmid=20722879 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02278.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may be useful in translating research findings for policymakers or practitioners, or in assessing likely levels of need for child mental health services.

===Scales===
One can also use the 5 scales of the SDQ either as dimensions (range 0-10) or else categorised into three- or four-categories in a similar was as is done for the total difficulty score.  Alternatively, one can combine scales such that emotional+peer problems scales form a larger internalising scale (range 0-20) and the conduct + hyperactivity scales form a larger externalising scale (range 0=20).  Research suggests that in low-risk groups (e.g. a general population sample) the latter approach may be preferable, as there is less discrimination between the finer scales for lower scores (e.g. a child with a score of 2 on the hyperactivity scale is at increased risk of hyperactivity and behavioural disorder to a roughly equal degree).  By contrast in high-risk samples (e.g. a clinic setting) the 5 finer scales may come into their own, as there is much more discrimination between them at higher scores (e.g. a child with a score of 7 on the hyperactivity scale is specifically at greater risk of a hyperactivity disorder, to a greater degree than they are at increased risk of a behavioural disorder)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goodman |first1=Anna |first2=Donna L. |last2=Lamping |first3=George B. |last3=Ploubidis |title=When to use broader internalising and externalising subscales instead of the hypothesised five subscales on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ): data from British parents, teachers and children |journal=Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology |date=November 2010 |volume=38 |issue=8 |pages=1179-91 |pmid=20623175 |doi=10.1007/s10802-010-9434-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SDQ users===
The [[PhenX Toolkit]] uses SDQ as its child protocol for General Psychiatric Assessment and for Broad Psychopathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Protocol Overview: General Psychiatric Assessment - Child |website=PhenX Toolkit, Ver 19.0 |date=17 January 2017 |url=https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php?pageLink=browse.protocoldetails&amp;id=120102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Protocol Overview: Broad Psychopathology - Child |website=PhenX Toolkit, Ver 19.0 |date=17 January 2017 |url=https://www.phenxtoolkit.org/index.php?pageLink=browse.protocoldetails&amp;id=610202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The SDQ is implemented in numerous [[electronic health record]] systems.

[[File:Physical examination.jpg|thumb|A medical examination]]
Some religions claim that praying for somebody who is sick can have positive effects on the health of the person being prayed for.

[[meta-study|Meta-studies]] of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is "no discernible effect" while a 2007 systemic review of intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that 7 of 17 studies had "small, but significant, effect sizes" but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=Masters /&gt;&lt;ref name=DRHodge /&gt;

==Introduction==
In comparison to other fields that have been scientifically studied, carefully monitored studies of prayer are relatively few. The field remains tiny, with about $5 million spent worldwide on such research. If and when more studies of prayer are done, the issue of prayer's efficacy may be further clarified.&lt;ref name="WashPostOne"&gt;Boorstein, Michelle. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/05/AR2008120502813.html Researchers Stepping Up Study of Health And Religiosity], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 6 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third party studies discussed here have all been performed using Christian prayers. Some have reported [[null results]], some have reported correlations between prayer and health, and some have reported contradictory results in which beneficiaries of prayer had worsened health outcomes. The parameters used within the study designs have varied, for instance, daily or weekly prayers, whether to provide patient photographs, with full or partial names, measuring levels of belief in prayer, and whether patients underwent surgery.

==Studies==

===Galton===
In 1872, the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] scientist [[Francis Galton]] made the first [[statistics|statistical analysis]] of third-party prayer. He hypothesized, partly as satire, that if prayer were effective, members of the [[British Royal Family]] would live longer than average, given that thousands prayed for their well-being every Sunday, and he prayed over randomized plots of land to see whether the plants would grow any faster, and found no correlation in either case.&lt;ref name="galton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dawkins"/&gt;

===Byrd and Harris===
A 1988 study by Randolph C. Byrd used 393 patients at the [[San Francisco General Hospital]] [[Coronary care unit|coronary care unit (CCU)]]. Measuring 29 health outcomes using three-level (good, intermediate, or bad) scoring, the prayer group suffered fewer newly diagnosed ailments on only six of them. Byrd concluded that "Based on these data there seemed to be an effect, and that effect was presumed to be beneficial", and that "intercessory prayer to the Judeo-Christian God has a beneficial therapeutic effect in patients admitted to a CCU."&lt;ref name="Byrd"/&gt; The reaction from the scientific community concerning this study was mixed. Several reviewers considered Byrd’s study to be well-designed and well-executed,&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain and Hall 2001, 34&lt;/ref&gt; while others  remained skeptical.  A criticism of Byrd's study, which also applies to most other studies, is the fact that he did not limit prayers by the friends and family of patients, hence it is unclear which prayers, if any, may have been measured.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

The Byrd study had an inconsistent pattern of only six positive outcomes amongst 26 specific problem conditions. A systematic review suggested this indicates possible [[Type I and type II errors|Type I]] errors.&lt;ref name=DRHodge /&gt;

A 1999 follow-up by William S. Harris et al. attempted to replicate Byrd's findings under stricter experimental conditions, noting that the original research was not completely blinded and was limited to only "prayer-receptive" individuals (57 of the 450 patients invited to participate in the study refused to give consent "for personal reasons or religious convictions").&lt;ref name="HarrisGowdaKolb"/&gt;  Using a different, continuous weighted scoring system – which admittedly was, like Byrd's scoring, "an unvalidated measure of CCU outcomes" – Harris et al. concluded that "supplementary, remote, blinded, intercessory prayer produced a measurable improvement in the medical outcomes of critically ill patients", and suggested that "prayer be an
effective adjunct to standard medical care."&lt;ref&gt;Harris et al. 1999, 2273&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when they applied Byrd’s scores to their data, they could not document an effect of prayer using his scoring method. Critics have suggested that both Byrd's and Harris's results can be explained by chance.&lt;ref name="Tessman"/&gt; Richard P. Sloan compared the Byrd and Harris studies with the [[Texas sharpshooter fallacy|sharpshooter fallacy]], "searching through the data until a significant effect is found, then drawing the bull's-eye."&lt;ref name="Sloan"/&gt;

===O'Laoire===
A 1997 study by O'Laoire measured the effects on the agents performing daily prayers and reported benefits not only for the beneficiaries, but also for the agents, and the benefit levels correlated with the belief levels of agents and beneficiaries in some cases. The study measured [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. This study used beneficiary names as well as photographs.&lt;ref name="OLaoire"/&gt;

===Sicher===
In 1998 Fred Sicher et al. performed a small scale double-blind randomized study of 40 patients with advanced [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sicher|first=F|author2=Targ, E|author3= Moore D, 2nd |author4=Smith, HS|title=A randomized double-blind study of the effect of distant healing in a population with advanced AIDS. Report of a small scale study.|journal=The Western Journal of Medicine|date=December 1998|volume=169|issue=6|pages=356–63|pmid=9866433|pmc=1305403}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lake112 &gt;''Textbook of Integrative Mental Health Care'' by James Lake 2006 {{ISBN|1-58890-299-4}} page 112&lt;/ref&gt; The patients were in category C-3 with [[CD4]] cell counts below 200 and each had at least one case of AIDS-defining illness.&lt;ref name=Scott259 &gt;''Handbook of Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Mental Health'' edited by Scott Shannon 2001 Academic Press {{ISBN|0-12-638281-6}} page 259&lt;/ref&gt; The patients were randomly assigned to receive distant intercessory healing or none at all. The intercession took place by people in different parts of the United States who never had any contact with the patients. Both patients and physicians were blind to who received or did not receive intercession.&lt;ref name=Scott259 /&gt; Six months later the prayer group had significantly fewer AIDS illnesses, less frequent doctor visits, and fewer days in the hospital.&lt;ref name=Lake112 /&gt; However, CD4 counts and scores on other [[physiology|physiological]] tests had no significant variation between the two groups of patients.&lt;ref name=Scott259 /&gt;

===Mayo clinic===
A 2001 double-blind study at the [[Mayo Clinic]] randomized 799 discharged coronary surgery patients into a [[Scientific control|control]] group and an intercessory prayer group, which received prayers at least once a week from 5 intercessors per patient. Analyzing "primary end points" (death, cardiac arrest, rehospitalization, etc.) after 26 weeks, the researchers concluded "intercessory prayer had no significant effect on medical outcomes after hospitalization in a coronary care unit."&lt;ref name="AvilesWhelanHernke"/&gt;

===The IVF-ET prayer scandal===
In 2001 the ''Journal of Reproductive Medicine'' published an experimental study by three [[Columbia University]] researchers indicating that prayer for women undergoing [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]]-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) resulted in a success rate (50%) of [[pregnancy]] double that of women who did not receive prayer.&lt;ref name="ChaWirthLobo"/&gt; [[Columbia University]] issued a news release saying that the study had been carefully designed to eliminate [[bias]].&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;  The most vocal [[skeptic]] was [[Bruce Flamm]], a clinical professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the [[University of california|University of California at Irvine]], who found that the experimental procedures were flawed.&lt;ref name="FlammOne"/&gt;  One of the study's authors, Cha, responded to criticism of the study in the November 2004 issue of JRM.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reproductivemedicine.com/toc/auto_abstract.php?id=21868&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2001, the [[DHHS|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS)]] office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) confirmed a report by the Columbia University Health Sciences Division that one of the study’s authors, Rogerio Lobo, only learned of the study six to twelve months after the study was completed, and that he had only provided editorial assistance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/detrm_letrs/dec01f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The name of [[Columbia University]] and Lobo were retracted from the study.&lt;ref name="FlammThree"/&gt;

===Retroactive intercessory prayer===
A 2001 study by Leonard Leibovici used records of 3,393 patients who had developed blood infections at the [[Rabin Medical Center]] between 1990 and 1996 to study ''retroactive'' intercessory prayer.&lt;ref name="Leibovici"/&gt;  To compound the alleged miraculous power of prayer itself, the prayers were performed ''after'' the patients had already left the [[Rabin Medical Center|hospital]]. All 3,393 patients were those in the [[Rabin Medical Center|hospital]] between 1990 and 1996, and the prayers were conducted in 2000. Two of the outcomes, length of stay in the hospital and duration of fever, were found to be significantly improved in the intervention group, implying that prayer can even change events ''in the past.'' However, the "[[mortality rate]] was lower in the intervention group, but the difference between the groups was not significant."  Leibovici concluded that "Remote, retroactive intercessory prayer was associated with a shorter stay in hospital and a shorter duration of fever in patients with a bloodstream infection." Leibovici goes on to note that in the past, people knew the way to prevent diseases (he cites scurvy) without understanding why it worked.  In saying so, he suggests that if prayer truly does have a positive effect on patients in hospital, then there may be a naturalist explanation for it that we do not yet understand.  After many scientists and scholars criticized this retroactive study,&lt;ref name="Thornett"/&gt; Leibovici stated in 2002 that the "article has nothing to do with religion. I believe that prayer is a real comfort and help to a believer. I do not believe it should be tested in controlled trials."&lt;ref name = Lighthearted /&gt;  The study has been summarised as being "intended lightheartedly to illustrate the importance of asking research questions that fit with scientific models."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;

In 2003, [[Larry Dossey]], the [[executive editor]] of the journal ''[[Explore: The Journal of Science &amp; Healing]]'' and an advocate of [[faith healing]]&lt;ref name = Gorski /&gt; co-authored a paper responding to Leibovici which discussed possible mechanisms to explain the results reported.&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt;  Olshansky and Dossey invoked quantum mechanics to explain not only the benefits of intercessory prayer, but also how it might operate retroactively,&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt; drawing strong criticisms from physicist [[Victor J. Stenger|Victor Stenger]] and physician [[Jeffrey Bishop]].&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt; The [[observer effect (physics)|observer effect]] is regularly used to suggest that conscious control of physical reality is predicted by quantum mechanics, but this misconception "can be traced to a misinterpretation of [[particle-wave duality|wave-particle duality]]."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  In relation to [[backwards causation|backwards causality]], Stenger noted that "the results of some quantum experiments may be interpreted as evidence for events in the future affecting events in the past at the quantum level, [but] no theoretical basis exists for applying this notion on the macroscopic scale of human experience."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  He concluded that while "the atoms in biological systems are quantum in nature ... their collective behaviour does not exhibit any quantum effects. ... What is more, even if the brain were a quantum system, that would not imply that it can break the laws of physics any more than electrons or photons, which are inarguably quanta."&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  One further point which illustrates that Dossey and Olshansky do not understand the physics they are using is seen in their invocation of [[quantum nonlocality]] in explaining backward causation, stating that "[r]etroactive prayer may be less absurd than [Leibovici] supposes, in the light of the discovery of non-local phenomena."&lt;ref name = BMJ_Dossey /&gt;  Unfortunately, the two are mutually incompatible: in allowing reverse causality in a model, the phenomenon of nonlocality ceases.&lt;ref name = Stenger /&gt;  Dossey has written in ''Explore'' about coining the term "nonlocal mind" in 1987,&lt;ref name = Nonlocal /&gt; though quantum nonlocality goes back to a 1935 paper by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Boris Podolsky|Podolsky]], and [[Nathan Rosen|Rosen]].&lt;ref name = EPR /&gt;  Olshansky and Dossey defended their work from various critics in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'s rapid response section&lt;ref name = ODrespond /&gt;

Olensky and Dossey are not alone amongst alternative medicine proponents in having missed the point which Leibovici was making.  In 2004, Stephen Wright described the Olshansky and Dossey contribution as a "thoughtful essay,"&lt;ref name = Wright /&gt; and it was praised by an editorial in the ''[[Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine]]'' the same year.&lt;ref name = Jobst /&gt;  In 2005, Olshansky and Dossey's work was included in a critical review published in ''Explore'' which concluded that "Religious activity may improve health outcomes."&lt;ref name = ExploreCritReview /&gt;  Their work was also defended in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' itself in 2004.&lt;ref name = BMJdefender /&gt;  Dossey authored an ''Explore'' paper defending experiments on the medical effects of prayer in 2005.&lt;ref name = Twenty /&gt;

===The MANTRA study===
A 2005 MANTRA (Monitoring and Actualisation of [[Noetic theory|Noetic]] Trainings) II study conducted a three-year clinical trial led by [[Duke University]] comparing intercessory prayer and MIT (Music, Imagery, and Touch) therapies for 748 cardiology patients. The study is regarded as the first time rigorous scientific protocols were applied on a large scale to assess the feasibility of intercessory prayer and other healing practices. The study produced null results and the authors concluded, "Neither masked prayer nor MIT therapy significantly improved clinical outcome after elective catheterization or percutaneous coronary intervention."&lt;ref name="KrucoffCraterGallup"/&gt;  Neither study specified whether photographs were used or whether belief levels were measured in the agents or those performing the prayers.

===The STEP project===
Harvard professor [[Herbert Benson]] performed a "Study of the Therapeutic Effects of Intercessory Prayer (STEP)" in 2006.&lt;ref name="STEP"/&gt;  The STEP, commonly called the "[[Templeton Foundation]] prayer study" or "Great Prayer Experiment", used 1,802 [[coronary artery bypass surgery]] patients at six hospitals. Using [[double-blind]] protocols, patients were [[randomize]]d into three groups, individual prayer receptiveness was not measured. The members of the experimental and control Groups 1 and 2 were informed they might or might not receive prayers, and only Group 1 received prayers. Group 3, which served as a test for possible [[psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic effects]], was informed they would receive prayers and subsequently did. Unlike some other studies, STEP attempted to standardize the prayer method. Only first names and last initial for patients were provided and no photographs were supplied. The congregations of three [[local church|Christian churches]] who prayed for the patients "were allowed to pray in their own manner, but they were instructed to include the following phrase in their prayers: "for a successful surgery with a quick, healthy recovery and no complications".&lt;ref name="Shermer"/&gt;  Some participants complained that this mechanical way they were told to pray as part of the experiment was unusual for them. [[Complication (medicine)|Complications]] of surgery occurred in 52 percent of those who received prayer (Group 1), 51 percent of those who did not receive it (Group 2), and 59 percent of patients who knew they would receive prayers (Group 3). There were no statistically significant differences in major complications or thirty-day mortality. In ''[[The God Delusion]],'' [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote, "It seems more probable that those patients who knew they were being prayed for suffered additional stress in consequence: [[performance anxiety]]', as the experimenters put it. Dr Charles Bethea, one of the researchers, said, "It may have made them uncertain, wondering am I so sick they had to call in their prayer team?'"&lt;ref name=DelusionQuote&gt;{{cite book | chapter=The Great Prayer Experiment | chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=god%20delusion&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | author=Richard Dawkins | title=[[The God Delusion]] | year=2006 | pages=87–88 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Study co-author Jeffery Dusek stated that: "Each study builds on others, and STEP advanced the design beyond what had been previously done.  The findings, however, could well be due to the study limitations."&lt;ref name="HarvardNewsRel"/&gt;  Team leader Benson stated that STEP was not the last word on the effects of intercessory prayer and that questions raised by the study will require additional answers.&lt;ref name="HarvardGazette"/&gt;

==Literature reviews==
A [[meta-analysis]] of several studies related to distant intercessory healing was published in the ''[[Annals of Internal Medicine]]'' in 2000.&lt;ref name=astin &gt;John A. Astin, et al. ''The Efficacy of "Distant Healing" A Systematic Review of Randomized Trials'' [[Annals of Internal Medicine]] June 6, 2000 vol. 132 no. 11 903-910 [http://www.annals.org/content/132/11/903.abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; The authors analyzed 23 trials of 2,774 patients. Five of the trials were for prayer as the distant healing method, 11 were with noncontact touch, and 7 were other forms. Of these trials, 13 showed statistically significant beneficial treatment results, 9 showed no effect, and 1 showed a negative result. The authors concluded that it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding distant healing and suggested further studies.&lt;ref name=astin /&gt;

A 2003 [[levels of evidence]] review found "some" evidence for the hypothesis that "Being prayed for improves physical recovery from acute illness".&lt;ref name="PowellShahabiThoresen"/&gt;  It concluded that although "a number of studies" have tested this hypothesis, "only three have sufficient rigor for review here" (Byrd 1988, Harris et al. 1999, and Sicher et al. 1998). In all three, "the strongest findings were for the variables that were evaluated most subjectively. This raises concerns about the possible inadvertent unmasking of the outcomes assessors. Moreover, the absence of a clearly plausible biological mechanism by which such a treatment could influence hard medical outcome results in the inclination to be skeptical of results." This 2003 review was performed before the 2005 MANTRA study and the 2006 STEP project, neither of which were conclusive in establishing the efficacy of prayer.

Various broader meta-studies of the literature in the field have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that "There is no scientifically discernable effect for intercessory prayer as assessed in controlled studies".&lt;ref name=Masters &gt;K. Masters, G. Spielmans, J. Goodson "Are there demonstrable effects of distant intercessory prayer? A meta-analytic review." ''[[Annals of Behavioral Medicine]]'' 2006 Aug;32(1):21-6. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16827626]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2007 systemic review of 17 intercessory prayer studies found "small, but significant, effect sizes for the use of intercessory prayer" in 7 studies, but "prayer was unassociated with positive improvement in the condition of client" in the other 10, concluding that based upon the [[American Psychology Association]]'s Division 12 ([[clinical psychology]]) criteria for evidence-based practice, intercessory prayer "must be classified as an experimental intervention." The review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies had failed to produce significant findings.&lt;ref name=DRHodge&gt;David R. Hodge, "A Systematic Review of the Empirical Literature on Intercessory Prayer" in ''Research on Social Work Practice'' March 2007 vol. 17 no. 2 174-187 {{doi|10.1177/1049731506296170}} [http://rsw.sagepub.com/content/17/2/174.abstract Article abstract] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202025826/http://rsw.sagepub.com/content/17/2/174.abstract |date=2011-12-02 }} [http://www.sagepub.com/vaughnstudy/articles/intervention/Hodge.pdf Full length article]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Taxation}}
A '''sugary drink tax''' or '''soda tax''' is a [[tax]] or [[fee|surcharge]] designed to reduce consumption of drinks with [[added sugar]]. Drinks covered under a soda tax often include [[Carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drinks]], [[sports drinks]] and [[energy drinks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Consumption of Sports Drinks by Kids and Adolescents|url=http://healthyeatingresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/HER-Sports-Drinks-Research-Review-6-2012.pdf |website= Healthy Eating Research |accessdate= 18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax is a matter of public debate in many countries and [[beverage production|beverage producers]] like [[Coca-Cola]] often oppose it.

[[Type II diabetes]] is a growing health concern in many developed and developing countries around the world, with 1.6 million deaths directly due to this disease in 2015 alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Diabetes Fact Sheet |url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs312/en/ |publisher=World Health Organisation |date= November 2016 |accessdate= 20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike sugar from food, the sugar from drinks enters the body so quickly that it can overload the pancreas and the liver, leading to [[diabetes]] and heart disease over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sugar-Sweetened Beverages |url= http://www.sugarscience.org/sugar-sweetened-beverages/ |work= SugarScience |publisher= University of California, San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 study said that consuming one to two sugary drinks a day increases your risk of developing diabetes by 26%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Sugar-sweetened beverages and risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis|first1=Vasanti S. |last1=Malik |first2=Barry M. |last2=Popkin|first3=George A.|last3=Bray |first4=Jean-Pierre |last4= Després |first5=Walter C. |last5=Willett |first6=Frank B. |last6=Hu |date=1 November 2010 |publisher= |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=33 |issue=11 |pages=2477–2483  |doi=10.2337/dc10-1079 |pmid= 20693348 |pmc= 2963518}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heart disease is responsible for 31% of all global deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/en/ |title=Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)|website=World Health Organization|access-date=2017-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although one sugary drink has minimal effects on the heart, consuming sugary drinks daily are associated with long term consequences.

Trends indicate that traditional soda consumption is declining in many developed economies, but growing rapidly in middle income economies such as Vietnam and India. In the United States, the single biggest market for carbonated soft drinks, consumers annual average per capita purchase of soda was 154 liters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Silver|first1=Marc|title=Guess Which Country Has The Biggest Increase In Soda Drinking|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/19/415223346/guess-which-country-has-the-biggest-increase-in-soda-drinking|publisher=National Public Radio|date=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denmark]] began taxing soft drinks and juices in the 1930s. More recently, [[Finland]] reintroduced an earlier soft drink tax in 2011, while [[Hungary]] taxes sugary drinks as part of its 2011 public health product tax, which covers all food products with unhealthy levels of sugar. [[France]] introduced a targeted sugar tax on soft drinks in 2012.&lt;ref name=ECSIP&gt;{{cite report |title=Food taxes and their impact on competitiveness in the agri-food sector |url=http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/5827/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/pdf |pages=27–30 |date=16 July 2014 |id=Ref. Ares (2014) 2365745 |author=ECSIP |publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a national level similar measures have also been announced in [[Mexico]] in 2013 and in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2016. In November 2014, [[Berkeley, California]] was the first city in the U.S. to pass a targeted tax on surgary drinks.

===Tobacco taxes===
Proponents of soda taxes cite the success of [[tobacco taxes]] worldwide when explaining why they think a soda tax will work to lower soda consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bittman|first1=Mark|title=Is Soda the New Tobacco?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/weekinreview/14bittman.html|website=The New York Times|date=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where the main concern with tobacco is cancer, the main concerns with soda are diabetes and obesity. The  tactics used to oppose soda taxes by soda companies mimic those of tobacco companies, including funding research that downplays the health risks of its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Soda the New Tobacco?|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/big-soda-is-fighting-science-on-sugar-2015-11|publisher=Business Insider|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics and economic theory of the tax ===
The [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] reports that a targeted tax on sugar in soda could generate $14.9 billion in the first year alone. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) estimates that three-cent-per-ounce tax would generate over $24 billion over four years.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, [http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/chicago_fed_letter/2011/cflmarch2011_284.pdf "Who would be affected by soda taxes?"] The Fed Letter, No. 284 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some tax measures call for using the revenue collected to pay for relevant health needs: improving diet, increasing physical activity, obesity prevention, nutrition education, advancing healthcare reform, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title =Soda Tax Weighed to Pay for Healthcare| url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124208505896608647|date=2009-05-12 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Janet | last=Adamy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area to which the revenue raised by a soda tax might go, as suggested by Mike Rayner of the United Kingdom, is to subsidize healthier foods like fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext | title=Fat Taxes and the Financial Crisis | author=McColl, Karen | journal=[[The Lancet]] |date=March 2009 | volume=373 | issue=9666 | pages=797–798 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60463-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The imposition of a sugar tax means that sellers of sugary drinks would have to increase the price of their goods by an amount P2 from the original price X, and then take on the rest of the tax themselves (P1) in the form of lower profit per unit sold. The tax burden on consumers (P2) makes it more expensive for consumers to buy sugary drinks and hence a higher proportion of their incomes would have to be spent to buy the same amount of sugary drinks. This decreases the equilibrium quantity of sugary drinks that will be sold. Whether the sugary drinks tax is imposed on the seller or consumer, in both cases the tax burden is shared between both.&lt;ref name="website elasticity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thismatter.com/economics/tax-incidence.htm|title=Tax Incidence: How the Tax Burden is Shared Between Buyers and Sellers|first=William C.|last=Spaulding|website=thismatter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way that the tax burden is divided upon the consumer and seller depends on the price elasticity for sugary drinks. The tax burden will fall more on sellers when the price elasticity of demand is greater than the price elasticity of supply while on buyers when the price elasticity of supply is greater than the price elasticity of demand. The price elasticity for sugary drinks is different from country to country. For instance, the price elasticity of demand for sugary drinks was found to be -1.37 in Chile while -1.16 in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Guerrero-López, Carlos M. 2017"&gt;Guerrero-López, Carlos M., Mishel Unar-Munguía, and M. Arantxa Colchero. "Price Elasticity Of The Demand For Soft Drinks, Other Sugar-Sweetened Beverages And Energy Dense Food In Chile". BMC Public Health 17.1 (2017): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colchero, M.A. et al. "Price Elasticity Of The Demand For Sugar Sweetened Beverages And Soft Drinks In Mexico". Economics &amp; Human Biology 19 (2015): 129-137. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence if both of those results were realistic and the price elasticity of supply would be the same for both, the tax burden on consumers would be higher in Mexico than in Chile.&lt;ref name="website elasticity"/&gt;

===The reason for implementing a sugar tax in microeconomic terms===
The reasons for a sugar tax are the negative externalities of consuming sugar. As over-consumption of sugar causes health problems (external costs) such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and other diseases, and lost productivity, the third party impacted by this is the ‘public health system’ that will need to deal with those issues. More demand for health services leads to higher costs for health care and hence this increased stress on the public health system is a negative consumption externality of sugar consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Briggs | first1 = Adam | year = 2016 | title = Sugar Tax Could Sweeten A Market Failure | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 531 | issue = 7596| pages = 551–551 | doi=10.1038/531551a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brownell, Kelly D. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brownell | first1 = Kelly D. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2009 | title = The Public Health And Economic Benefits Of Taxing Sugar-Sweetened Beverages | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 361 | issue = 16| pages = 1599–1605 | doi=10.1056/nejmhpr0905723| pmc = 3140416 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics terms, the marginal social benefit (MSB) of sugar consumption is less than the marginal private benefit (MB). This can also be illustrated in the following equation. MSB = MB – Marginal External Cost (MXC). This is the case due to the fact that consumers think only of the benefit of sugar consumption to them (MB) and not the negative externalities to third parties (MXC) and so want to consume at the unregulated market equilibrium to maximize their utility. This means that there is overconsumption of sugar and a welfare loss is created.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saez|first1=Emmanuel|url=http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/course131/externalities1_ch05.pdf|title=Externalities: Problems and Solutions Chapter 5|publisher=UC Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sugary drinks tax, a Pigovian tax, is a way to correct the negative externality by regulating the consumption of sugary drinks.&lt;ref name="Guerrero-López, Carlos M. 2017"/&gt; Without a sugary drink tax, taxpayer money is used to pay for higher health care costs incurred from high consumption of sugar. Although this solution corrects the negative consumption externality, taxpayers that consume sugary drinks moderately and hence do not contribute to higher health care costs, still need to pay for this negative externality. Hence a sugary drinks tax may be a more appropriate solution as tax revenue that is collected from the sugar tax can be used to create childhood nutrition programs or obesity-prevention programs.&lt;ref name="Brownell, Kelly D. 2009"/&gt; This is a solution that could also correct the negative externality of sugar consumption as well as is a way to make the parties that cause the negative externality pay their fair share.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Countries ==
===Australia===
The [[Australian Beverages Council]] announced in June 2018 that the industry would cut sugar content by 10% by 2020, and by another 10%  by 2025. This was seen as an attempt to stave off a sugar tax. There were no plans to reduce the sugar content in the high sugar drinks. The plan is primarily to increase consumption of low-sugar or no-sugar drinks. sales of [[Coca-Cola Amatil]]'s fizzy drinks have fallen 8.1% by volume from 2016 to 2018.  The [[Australian Medical Association]] continued to press for a sugar tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Australian soft drink industry vows to slash use of sugar by 20 per cent |url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australian-soft-drink-industry-vows-to-slash-use-of-sugar-by-20-per-cent-20180625-p4znkm.html |accessdate=7 September 2018 |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
A 2016 proposal for a 20% sugary drink tax, campaigned by Educar Consumidores, was turned down by the Colombian [[legislature]] despite popular support for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jacobs|first1=Andrew|last2=Richtel|first2=Matt|title=She Took On Colombia’s Soda Industry.

=== Denmark ===
[[Denmark]] instituted a soft drink tax in the 1930s (it amounted to 1.64 Danish krone per liter), but announced in 2013 that they were going to abolish it along with an equally unpopular [[fat tax]], with the goal of creating jobs and helping the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/Denmark-to-scrap-decades-old-soft-drink-tax|title=Denmark to scrap decades-old soft drink tax|last1=Scott-Thomas|first1=Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics claimed that the taxes were notably ineffective; to avoid the fat and sugar taxes, local retailers had complained that Danes simply went to Sweden and Germany, where prices were lower to buy butter, ice cream and soda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Strom|first1=Stephanie|title='Fat Tax’ in Denmark Is Repealed After Criticism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/business/global/fat-tax-in-denmark-is-repealed-after-criticism.html|website=The New York Times|date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark repealed the fat tax in January 2013 and repealed the tax on soft drinks in 2014.

=== France ===

A 2016 study by Mazzochi has shown that the sugary drinks tax saw a 19 euro-cent per liter increase in price of non-pure fruit juices, a 16 euro-cent per liter increase for diet sodas and little impact on regular soft drinks prices. The study also estimated that the quantity consumed of the taxed drinks has decreased by 9 centiliters per week per person after the tax has been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Mazzochi (University of Bologna), “The impact of the French soda tax on prices, purchases and tastes: an ex post evaluation”, Food Economics and Policy Seminar, TSE, April 28, 2017, 11:00–12:30, room MS 003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, soda companies launched a media campaign to discourage the Mexican Chamber of Deputies and Senate from approving the 10% soda tax.

[[Norway]] has had a generalized sugar tax measure on refined sugar products since 1922, introduced to boost state income rather than reducing sugar consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tisdall|first1=Jonathan|title="Chocolate tax" should go|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1846927.ece|work=Aftenposten|date=26 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626022943/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/business/article1846927.ece|archivedate=26 June 2007}}

In January 2018, the Norwegian government increased the sugar tax level by 83% for general sugar-containing ready-to-eat products, and 42% for beverages. The sugar tax per litre was bumped up to 4.75 kroner, and applies to beverages which are either naturally or artificially sweetened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/tema/okonomi-og-budsjett/skatter-og-avgifter/avgiftssatser-2018/id2575160/|title=Avgiftssatser 2018|last=Finansdepartementet|date=2017-10-12|website=Regjeringen.no|language=no|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Arab Emirates===
On October 2017, the [[United Arab Emirates]] introduced a 50% tax on soft drinks and a 100% tax on energy drinks, to curb unhealthy consumption of sugary drinks that can lead to diabetes; it also added a 100% tax on cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/uae-dubai-sugar-diabetes-tax-soda-energy-drinks-tobacco-2017-10 UAE imposes 'sin' tax on soda, tobacco, and energy drinks] Business Insider October 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax is imposed at the point of production or importation, in two bands. Drinks with total sugar content above 5g per 100 millilitres are taxed at 18p per litre and drinks above 8g per 100 millilitres at 24p per litre. The measure is estimated to generate an additional £1 billion a year in tax revenue which will be spent on funding for sport in UK schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gander|first1=Kashmira|title=Budget 2016: George Osborne announces sugar tax on soft drinks industry|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/budget-2016-george-osborne-announces-sugar-tax-a6934206.html|publisher=The Independent|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/budget-2017-sugar-tax-philip-hammond-fight-obesity-child-weight-gain-fizzy-drinks-a7618316.html|title=New sugar tax confirmed in fight to combat rising obesity|date=8 March 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Criticism ====
The tax has been criticised on several grounds, including its likely efficacy and its narrow base. UK [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] [[Will Quince]] as, "patronising, regressive and the [[nanny state]] at its worst."&lt;ref name=SDIL&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neville|first1=Sarah|title=UK tax on sugary drinks is 'nannying' and ‘impractical’|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5b41e47a-ec53-11e5-bb79-2303682345c8.html |url-access=subscription |website=Financial Times|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition a study by the [[University of Glasgow]], which sampled 132,000 adults, found that focusing on sugar in isolation misleads consumers as reducing fat intake is also crucial to reducing obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/news/headline_474903_en.html|title=University of Glasgow - University news - Focusing on sugar in the fight against global obesity could be misleading|website=www.gla.ac.uk|accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an opposing standpoint, Professor [[Robert Lustig]] of the [[University of California, San Francisco]] School of Medicine, has argued that the UK tax measure may not go far enough and that, "juice should be taxed the same way as soda because from a metabolic standpoint juice is the same as soda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaminska|first1=Izabella|title=Robert Lustig: godfather of the sugar tax|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/311a74ec-ed24-11e5-888e-2eadd5fbc4a4.html?siteedition=intl|website=Financial Times|date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campaigners have since called for the soft drinks tax to be extended to include confectionery and sweets to help tackle [[childhood obesity]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/may/12/sugar-tax-must-apply-to-sweets-as-well-as-drinks-say-campaigners  Sugar tax must apply to sweets as well as drinks, say campaigners] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

A one-cent-per-ounce soda tax passed on November 10, 2016, by a 9-8 vote, with [[Cook County Board of Commissioners]] President [[Toni Preckwinkle]] breaking the 8-8 tie.

Taxing soda can lead to a reduction in overall consumption, according to a scientific study published in the ''[[Archives of Internal Medicine]]'' in March 2010. The study found that a 10 percent tax on soda led to a 7 percent reduction in calories from soft drinks. These researchers believe that an 18 percent tax on these foods could cut daily intake by 56 calories per person, resulting in a weight loss of 5 pounds (2&amp;nbsp;kg) per person per year. The study followed 5,115 young adults ages 18 to 30 from 1985 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, [https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6275T720100308 Tax Soda, Pizza To Cut Obesity Researchers say], 8 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pubs.ama-assn.org/media/2010a/0308.dtl#1 | title=Unhealthy Foods Become Less Popular With Increasing Costs | publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329092611/http://pubs.ama-assn.org/media/2010a/0308.dtl |archivedate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research from [[Duke University]] and the [[National University of Singapore]] released in December 2010 tested larger taxes and determined that a 20 percent and 40 percent taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages would largely not affect calorie intake because people switch to untaxed, but equally caloric, beverages. Kelly Brownell, a proponent of soda taxes, reacted by stating that “[t]he fact is that nobody has been able to see how people will really respond under these conditions.”&lt;ref&gt;Park, Alice (13 December 2010) [http://healthland.time.com/2010/12/13/study-sugar-tax-may-lead-to-only-modest-weight-loss "Study: Soda Taxes May Not Be Enough to Curb Obesity"] TIME.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2010 study concluded that while people would drink less soda as a result of a soda tax, they would also compensate for this reduction by switching to other high-calorie beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047272710001222 | title=The effects of soft drink taxes on child and adolescent consumption and weight outcomes | author=Fletcher, Jason M. | journal=Journal of Public Economics |date=December 2010 | volume=94 | issue=11–12 | pages=967–974 | doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2010.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these arguments, the [[American Public Health Association]] released a statement in 2012 in which they argued that "Even if individuals switch to 100% juice or chocolate milk, this would be an improvement, as those beverages contribute some nutrients to the diet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.apha.org/policies-and-advocacy/public-health-policy-statements/policy-database/2014/07/23/13/59/taxes-on-sugar-sweetened-beverages | title=Taxes on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: Policy Statement | publisher=APHA | date=30 October 2012 | accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study in the journal ''[[Preventive Medicine (journal)|Preventive Medicine]]'' concluded that "a modest tax on sugar-sweetened beverages could both raise significant revenues and improve public health by reducing obesity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Andreyeva | first1 = T. | last2 = Chaloupka | first2 = F.

A 2012 study by [[Y. Claire Wang]], also in the journal ''Health Affairs'', estimates that a penny per ounce tax on sugared beverages could prevent 2.4 million cases of diabetes per year, 8,000 strokes, and 26,000 premature deaths over 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Allison Aubrey, "Could a Soda Tax Prevent 2,600 Deaths Per Year?" NPR.org, 12 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, just before the city of Richmond began voting on a soda tax, a study was presented at a conference held by the [[American Public Health Association]] regarding the potential effects of such a tax in California. The study concluded that, given that soda's price elasticity is such that taxing it would reduce consumption by 10–20 percent, that this reduction "...is projected to reduce diabetes incidence by 2.9–5.6% and [[Coronary heart disease|CHD]] by 0.6–1.2%."&lt;ref&gt;[https://apha.confex.com/apha/140am/webprogram/Paper265089.html Health benefits, particularly in high risk populations, projected from an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages intake in California]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study in the ''[[American Journal of Agricultural Economics]]'' concluded that a 0.5-cent-per-ounce tax on soft drinks would reduce consumption, but "increase sodium and fat intakes as a result of product substitution," in line with the Duke University study mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ajae.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/07/28/ajae.aat049.full | title=Predicting the Effects of Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxes on Food and Beverage Demand in a Large Demand System | author=Zhen, Chen | journal=American Journal of Agricultural Economics |date=July 2013 | volume=95 | doi=10.1093/ajae/aat049 | pages=1–25| pmc=4022288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study published in the ''American Journal of Public Health'' concluded that Sugar-Sweetened Beverages (SSBs) don’t have a negative impact on employment. Even though job losses in the taxed industry occurred, they were offset by new employment in other sectors of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M. Powell, Roy Wada, Joseph J. Persky, Frank J. Chaloupka, “Employment Impact of Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Taxes”, American Journal of Public Health 104, no. 4 (April 1, 2014): pp. 672-677.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 modelling study estimated that a 20% tax on SSBs would decrease the consumption of SSBs in Australia by 12.6%. The tax could decline the prevalence of obesity in the Australian population, which could lead to gains in health-adjusted life years. The results showed an increase of 7.6 days in full health for a 20-24-year-old male and a 3.7 day increase in longevity for their female peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veerman | first1 = JL | last2 = Sacks | first2 = G | last3 = Antonopoulos | first3 = N | last4 = Martin | first4 = J | year = 2016 | title = The Impact of a Tax on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages on Health and Health Care Costs: A Modelling Study | url = https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0151460 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 4| page = e0151460 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0151460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Proposals ====
There have been a number of proposed taxes on sugary beverages, including:

* In 1914, U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] proposed a special revenue tax on soft drinks, beer and [[patent medicine]] after the outbreak of [[World War I]] caused a decline in imports and a corresponding decline in credit created by import [[tariff]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1914-09-01/ed-1/seq-1/ "Wilson Proposes Soft Drink Tax,"] Hawaiian Gazette. 1 September 1914. Page 1. Retrieved 1 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed taxation measure was not however linked to the anticipated health outcomes of reduced sugar sweetened beverage consumption. 
* In 1994, one of the first instances where the idea of a targeted tax on sugar sweetened drinks with a link to anticipated beneficial health outcomes, was proposed by [[Kelly D. Brownell]], Director of the [[Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale]]. 
* In a 2009 "Perspective" piece in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', Kelly D. Brownell, Director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale, and [[Thomas R. Frieden]], Director of the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], argue for taxing sugary beverages.

==== Public support ====
A 2016 poll by Morning Consult-Vox finds Americans split on their support of a soda tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://morningconsult.com/alert/poll-americans-split-soda-taxes/|title=Poll: Americans split on soda taxes |date=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attitudes seem to have shifted a lot since 2013 when a poll concluded that "respondents were opposed to government taxes on sugary drinks and candy by a more than 2-to-1 margin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2013/04/25/most-americans-oppose-soda-candy-taxes|title=Most Americans Oppose Soda, Candy Taxes|work=US News &amp; World Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; In California, however, support for a tax has been high for a few years. According to a [[Field Poll]] conducted in 2012, "Nearly 3 out of 5 California voters would support a special fee on soft drinks to fight childhood obesity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/health/article/Poll-shows-support-for-soda-tax-to-fight-obesity-3457423.php|title=Poll shows support for soda tax to fight obesity|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Support for a soda tax in New York was higher when pollsters say the money will go towards health care. A Quinnipiac University poll released in April 2010 found that New Yorkers opposed a state tax on soda of one penny per ounce by a 35-point margin, but opposition dropped to a margin of one point when respondents were told the money would go towards health care.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Bruce.

==== Lobbying ====
Fighting the creation of [[soft drink]] taxes, the [[American Beverage Association]], the largest U.S. trade organization for soft drink bottlers, has spent considerable money lobbying Congress. The Association's annual lobbying spending rose from about $391,000 to more than $690,000 from 2003 to 2008. And, in the 2010 election cycle, its lobbying grew to $8.67 million. These funds helped to pay for 25 lobbyists at seven different lobbying firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientlbs.php?lname=American+Beverage+Assn&amp;year=2009|title=Lobbying Spending Database-American Beverage Assn, 2009|publisher=[[Center for Responsive Politics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An industry group called "Americans Against Food Taxes," backed by juice maker Welch's, soft drink maker PepsiCo Inc, the American Beverage Association, the Corn Refiners Association, McDonald's Corporation and Burger King Holdings Inc used national advertising and conducted lobbying to oppose these taxes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN16158491 Tax Soft Drinks To Fight Obesity, US experts say] Reuters, 16 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The group has characterized the soda tax as a regressive tax, which would unfairly burden the poor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nofoodtaxes.com/facts/#education "Education, Not Taxes] Americans Against Food Taxes, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against the sugary drinks tax====
* The criteria on what drinks are taxed may not include equally bad substitutes like fruit juice, energy-dense snacks and biscuits.&lt;ref name="Silano, Marco 2017"&gt;Silano, Marco, and Carlo Agostoni. "To Tax Or Not To Tax Sugary Drinks? This Is The Question". Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017): 1. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The tax is regressive since consumers on lower incomes will be more negatively impacted by higher prices than consumers on higher incomes.&lt;ref name="Silano, Marco 2017"/&gt; This regressive effect of the sugary drinks tax can be counteracted if the collected tax revenue is used to subsidize healthier foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brownell | first1 = Kelly D. | last2 = Frieden | first2 = Thomas R. | year = 2009 | title = Ounces Of Prevention — The Public Policy Case For Taxes On Sugared Beverages | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 360 | issue = 18| pages = 1805–1808 | doi=10.1056/nejmp0902392}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cross-border shopping can also be an easy way out for consumers to not pay the tax as they will buy sugary drinks from areas where they are not taxed.&lt;ref name="Silano, Marco 2017"/&gt;

===Various island nations and territories===
Island nations and territories have been successful in passing soda taxes. Just like with [[tobacco taxes]], smaller communities are often the first to pass a new type of tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520222861|title=Tobacco War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Translational research informatics''' ('''TRI''') is a sister domain to or a sub-domain of [[biomedical informatics]] or [[medical informatics]] concerned with the application of [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] theory and methods to [[translational research]]. There is some overlap with the related domain of [[clinical research informatics]], but TRI is more concerned with enabling multi-disciplinary research to accelerate clinical outcomes, with [[clinical trials]] often being the natural step beyond translational research. 

[[Translational research]] as defined by the National Institutes of Health includes two areas of translation. One is the process of applying discoveries generated during research in the laboratory, and in preclinical studies, to the development of trials and studies in humans. The second area of translation concerns research aimed at enhancing the adoption of best practices in the community. Cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies is also an important part of translational research.

== Overview ==

Translational research informatics can be described as "an integrated software solution to manage the: (i) logistics, (ii) data integration, and (iii) collaboration, required by translational investigators and their supporting institutions". It is the class of informatics systems that sits between and often interoperates with: (i) [[health information technology]]/[[electronic medical record]] systems, (ii) [[CTMS]]/[[clinical research informatics]], and (iii) [[statistical analysis]] and [[data mining]]. 

Translational research informatics is relatively new, with most CTSA awardee academic medical centers actively acquiring and integrating systems to enable the end-to-end TRI requirements. One advanced TRI system is being implemented at the [[Windber Research Institute]] in collaboration with GenoLogics and [[InforSense]]. Translational Research Informatics systems are expected to rapidly develop and evolve over the next couple of years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5100">A '''uterine contraction''' is a [[muscle contraction]] of the [[uterine smooth muscle]].

==Throughout menstrual cycle==
The uterus frequently contracts throughout the entire [[menstrual cycle]], and these contractions have been termed ''endometrial waves'' or ''contractile waves''.&lt;ref name=aguilar2010&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq016 | last2 = Mitchell | first2 = S. | last3 = Knoll | first3 = A.

N. | title = Physiological pathways and molecular mechanisms regulating uterine contractility | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 725–744 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20551073}}&lt;/ref&gt; These appear to involve only the sub-[[endometrial]] layer of the [[myometrium]].&lt;ref name=aguilar2010/&gt; In the early [[follicular phase]], these contractions occur once or twice per minute and last 10–15 seconds with a low amplitude of usually 30 mmHg.&lt;ref name=aguilar2010/&gt; The frequency increases to 3–4 per minute towards [[ovulation]]. During the [[luteal phase]], the frequency and amplitude decrease, possibly to facilitate any [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]].

If implantation does not occur, the frequency remains low, but the amplitude increases dramatically to between 50 and 200 mmHg producing labor-like contractions at the time of [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name=aguilar2010/&gt; These contractions are sometimes termed ''menstrual cramps'',&lt;ref name=medicinenet&gt;[http://www.medicinenet.com/menstrual_cramps/page3.htm medicinenet.com &gt; Menstrual Cramps] Retrieved January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; although that term is often used for [[menstrual pain]] in general. These contractions may be uncomfortable or even painful, but they are generally significantly less painful than contractions during labour. A hot water bottle or exercising has been found to help.{{Cn|date=December 2012}}

A shift in the myosin expression of the [[uterine smooth muscle]] has been hypothesized to avail for changes in the directions of uterine contractions that are seen during the menstrual cycle.&lt;ref name=aguilar2010/&gt;

==Childbirth==
[[File:Courtesy Bellyband with chip Shima Seiki Haute Technology Laboratory DSCF2178.jpg | thumb | right | Knitted Bellyband with conductive thread and RFID chip to monitor contractions]]
A contraction refers specifically to the motion of the [[uterus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Uterine+Contraction}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the process of [[childbirth]]. Contractions, and labour in general, is one condition that releases the hormone [[oxytocin]] into the body.  Contractions become longer as labour intensifies.

Prior to actual labour, women may experience [[Braxton Hicks contractions]], sometimes known as "false labour."

Since every [[pregnancy]] is different, a doctor, [[midwife]] or other competent professional should always be consulted before any action is taken to reduce the pain. Some popular methods may be harmful to the mother and/or the baby, or may actually worsen the pain or lengthen the labour.

Uterine contractions during childbirth can be [[monitoring (medicine)|monitored]] by [[cardiotocography]], in which a device is fixated to the skin of the mother or directly to the fetal scalp. The pressure required to flatten a section of the uterine wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.btconnect.com/MalcolmBrown/entries/TOCODYNAMOMETER.html Tocodynamometer]. By Dr. Malcolm C Brown. Copyright 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 

A type of monitoring technology under development at [[Drexel University]] embeds conductive threads in the knitted fabric of a bellyband.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15864">Around the world, nearly 250 million children, about one in every six children, ages 5 through 17, are involved in [[child labor]].&lt;ref name=WHO_Childlab&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.who.int/occupational_health/topics/childlabour/en/ |title= Hazardous child labour |accessdate=2007-10-14|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children can be found in almost any economic sector. However, at a global level, most of them work in agriculture (70%).&lt;ref name=WHO_Childlab/&gt; Approximately 2.4 million [[adolescents]] aged 16 to 17 years worked in the U.S. in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics [2007].

==Work that poses special risks for young workers==
[[File:Teen Workers - Real Jobs, Real Risks (Mallory's Story) (2009).webm|thumb|A young worker describing a severe occupational injury]]
Because of their biologic, social, and economic characteristics, young workers have unique and substantial risks for work-related injuries and illnesses. Besides retail and agriculture, other areas of high risk for work-related injuries include construction and work activities involving motor vehicles and mobile machinery. Although safety requirements and [[child labor laws]] prohibit or restrict teen employment in certain kinds of industries and occupations, young workers may yet face risks on the job because an employer or a young employee may not be aware of applicable laws and may not be aware that a hazard exists, because the young employee may lack experience, or because there is inadequate training or supervision.

[[Child labor]] is the employment of children under an age determined by law or custom. This practice is considered exploitative by many countries and international organizations. Child labor was utilized to varying extents through most of history, but entered public dispute with the beginning of [[public education|universal schooling]], with changes in working conditions during [[industrialization]], and with the emergence of the concepts of [[worker's rights|workers']] and [[children's rights]]. Child labor is still common in some places. Even after passing child labor legislation, developing countries in particular still feature informal economies made up of child workers who are more exposed to human rights violations in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Furlong&gt;{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in agriculture===
There are roughly 250,000 children who work on U.S. farms, that do not live on the farm, and another 30 million children who visit farms annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agrinewspubs.com/Content/Default/Machinery/Article/Keep-kids-safe-on-farm-/-3/102/13392|title=Keep kids safe on farm  - AgriNews|website=www.agrinewspubs.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About every three days a child dies on a U.S. farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://southwestfarmpress.com/equipment/farm-related-childhood-deaths-are-down-still-too-many|title=Farm-related childhood deaths are down, but still too many|website=southwestfarmpress.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, most youth work fatalities occurred in the [[agriculture]] sector.&lt;ref name=pop&gt;{{cite journal|last = Windau|first = Janice|author2=Samuel Meyer  |title = Occupational injuries among young workers|journal = Monthly Labor Review|pages = 11–23|date=October 2005|url = http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/10/art2full.pdf|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]|accessdate = 2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two thirds of these [[death|fatalities]] could be attributed to [[transportation]] [[accidents]].&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; According to the "Occupational injuries among young workers" report, most of these transportation accidents occurred either by truck or by tractor. Tractor accidents alone counted for 1/4 of the youth worker fatalities from 1993 to 2002.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; For workers 13 years old and younger, agricultural fatalities accounted for 42 out of the 49 total fatalities for that age group between 1998 and 2002.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; There are fewer [[child labor]] restrictions on family-owned or operated [[farm]]s; workers as young as 13 can legally operate [[tractor]]s on farms if their family owns it or operates it.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt;

Experiences and exposures across different sectors of agriculture vary greatly. For example, children who worked on tobacco farms experienced a number of negative health effects including nausea, heat exhaustion, and burning eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/17/health/hrw-children-tobacco-workers-report/index.html|title=Kids working on tobacco farms experience nicotine poisoning - CNN.com|website=CNN|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in construction===
Between the years 1998 and 2002, [[construction]] accidents accounted for 18% of youth worker fatalities,&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; making construction the second most deadly industry for a young worker to be employed in during that time period. A significant number of young worker fatalities in this sector resulted from work that the young worker was not [[Legal (disambiguation)|legally]] authorized to do. For example, 16-year-old workers accounted for almost 20% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector between 1998 and 2002, even though workers 16 and younger are legally unauthorized to enter a construction site;&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; if they do work for the construction industry, they can only work in an office or sales department.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Additionally, [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino]] young workers made up 35% of the young worker fatalities in the construction sector.&lt;ref name=pop/&gt; Hispanics make up 14.4% of the United States' general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = U.S. Census Bureau|title = Population of the United States by Race and Hispanic/Latino Origin, Census 2000 and July 1, 2005| work = National Population Estimates|publisher = Pearson Education, Inc| year = 2007|url = http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0762156.html|accessdate = 2009-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in retail trades===
The second highest number of workplace fatalities between 1993 and 1997 among workers younger than age 18 occurred in the [[retail trade]]s (e.g., [[restaurants]] and retail stores).&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt; Between 1992 and 2000, 63% of these deaths were due to [[assaults]] and violent acts, most of which were [[homicides]]. Homicide associated with [[robbery]] is the probable cause for one fourth to one half of all young worker fatalities in retail trades.&lt;ref&gt;Windau J, Sygnatur E, Toscano G [1999]. Profile of work injuries incurred by young workers. Monthly Labor Review, June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Handling cash, working alone or in small numbers, and working in the late evening and early morning hours may contribute to workplace homicides [NIOSH 1996a].&lt;ref&gt;NIOSH [1996a]. Current intelligence bulletin 57: Violence in the workplace; risk factors and prevention strategies. Cincinnati, OH: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 96–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, more than half of all work-related nonfatal injuries to young workers occurred in retail trades, more than 60% of which were eating and drinking establishments. Cuts in retail trades were the most common type of injury treated in emergency departments, followed by burns in eating and drinking establishments and bruises, scrapes, and scratches in other retail settings.&lt;ref&gt;Mardis AL, Pratt SG [2003]. Nonfatal injuries to young workers in the retail trades and service industries in 1998. J Occup Environ Med 45(3):316–323.&lt;/ref&gt; Common hazards in restaurants include using knives to prepare food, handling hot grease from fryers, working near hot surfaces, and slipping on wet or greasy floors.&lt;ref&gt;NRC/IOM (National Research Council, Institute of Medicine) [1998]. Protecting youth at work: health, safety, and development of working children and adolescents in the United States. Washington, DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, certain types of machinery prohibited for use by young workers under current [[child labor laws]] are commonly found in retail establishments—including food slicers, paper balers, forklifts, dough and batter mixers, and bread cutting machines. Young workers may choose to operate unfamiliar machinery to prove [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]], independence, or maturity,&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Department of Public Health [1998]. Work-related injuries to teens. Newsletter from the teens at work: injury surveillance and prevention project. Boston, MA: Occupational Health Surveillance Program.&lt;/ref&gt; or they may be instructed to do so by an employer who is unaware of child labor laws or chooses to disregard them.

==U.S. federal and state programs==

===OSHA===
The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) within the U.S. [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] (DOL) is the Federal agency with primary responsibility for setting and enforcing standards to promote safe and healthful working conditions for all workers. Employers are responsible for becoming familiar with standards applicable to their establishments and for ensuring a safe working environment.

=== U.S. Public Health Service ===
The [[U.S. Public Health Service]] has a [[Healthy People 2010|Healthy People 2020]] objective to reduce emergency department injury rates among young workers, ages 15 through 19, to 4.9 injuries/100 full-time equivalents by 2020. The rate in 2007 was 5.3 injuries/100 full-time equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/Occupational-Safety-and-Health/objectives#5044|title=Occupational Safety and Health {{!}} Healthy People 2020|website=www.healthypeople.gov|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NIOSH===
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) within the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] plays a lead role in efforts to reduce injuries and illnesses among working youth by conducting and supporting science to guide prevention efforts, disseminating findings, and working with others in collaborative outreach.

The NIOSH funds the [[National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://youth.gov/federal-links/national-childrens-center-rural-and-agricultural-health-and-safety|title=National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety {{!}} Youth.gov|website=youth.gov|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.marshfieldresearch.org/nccrahs|title=Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation - National Children's Center for Rural and Agricultural Health and Safety|website=www.marshfieldresearch.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal child labor laws===
A workplace may be fully compliant with OSHA regulations and yet may place young workers at risk of injury or illness if applicable federal and state child labor laws are not followed. One study estimated that more than three-fourths of employers of young workers were unfamiliar with child labor laws. Lack of awareness of occupational safety and health laws by young workers, adults, and employers has been identified as a major obstacle to preventing injury and illness in young workers.{{ref label|NRC/IOM 1998 |10|a}} The primary Federal law governing the employment of workers under age 18 is the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) of 1938, which is enforced by the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration within DOL. Child labor provisions of the FLSA are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and prohibit their employment in jobs that pose safety or health risks. The FLSA does not cover all young workers. The FLSA applies to an entire business enterprise if the enterprise has annual gross revenues of $500,000 or more. Child Labor Regulation No. 3 restricts hours and specifies allowable employment activities for workers aged 14 and 15.

===State child labor laws===

States may also have their own child labor laws that are stricter than federal laws. If a state child labor law is less protective than federal law, or if no applicable state law exists, Federal child labor laws apply.{{ref label|NRC/IOM 1998 |10|b}}
