The '''999 phone charging myth''' is an [[urban myth]] which claims that if a [[mobile phone]] has low battery then dialing [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] (or any regional [[emergency number]]) charges the phone so it has more power. This was confirmed as a myth by several British police forces who publicly cited the dangers of making such calls.

== Basis ==
The basis for the myth was a feature of [[BlackBerry]] phones: If the battery level was too low, the phone automatically locked down phone features and shut down the phone radio for all calls except to emergency services. People discovered that if they dialed 999 then immediately hung up, it would override the shutdown for a number of minutes so that phone calls could be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialstudent.co.uk/calling-the-police-doesnt-charge-your-phone-battery/ |title=Calling The Police Doesn't Charge Your Phone Battery |publisher=Social Student |date=18 January 2016 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response ==
The myth is believed to have originated in BlackBerry forums around 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derbyshiretimes.co.uk/news/crime/derbyshire-ignore-phone-myth-cops-urge-1-5996352/amp |title=Ignore phone myth, cops urge |work=Derbyshire Times |date=30 August 2013 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.crackberry.com/blackberry-bold-9930-9900-f235/battery-too-low-radio-use-warning-694982/ |title="Battery too low for radio use" warning |publisher=BlackBerry Forums |date= |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[Derbyshire Constabulary]] released a press release telling people not to believe the myth that calling 999 charges the battery.&lt;ref name=db /&gt; They cited that for every silent or aborted 999 call received, the operators have to call the person back to make sure there is no emergency.&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2014-01-13/police-warning-over-mobile-phone-urban-myth/ |title=Police warning over mobile phone urban myth |publisher=ITV |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[hoax calls]] waste police time that could potentially block responses to real emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Cockerton |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/dialling-999-not-charge-mobile-2234973 |title=Dialling 999 does NOT charge mobile battery: Derbyshire Police issue warning over urban myth |work=The Mirror |date=29 August 2013 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bedfordshire Police]] also released information asking people not to call 999 except for an emergency as they stated that in the last six months of 2013 they had an increase in hoax 999 calls from people believing the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2014-01-15/police-dispel-999-myth/ |title=Police dispel 999 myth |publisher=ITV |date=15 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources supplemented these press releases by stating that misusing the 999 number is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/01/13/999-battery-hoax_n_4588617.html |title=Calling 999 Does NOT Boost Your Mobile Phone Battery, Police Warn As Hoax Persists |work=Huffington Post UK |date=13 January 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the police could cut off telephones being used to abuse the 999 service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutontoday.co.uk/news/you-might-be-charged-yourself-if-you-try-to-power-up-your-mobile-1-5873160/amp |title=You might be charged yourself if you try to power up your mobile |work=The Luton News |date=12 February 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related myth emerged: that when [[Siri]] on an [[iPhone]] is told, "Charge my phone to 100%", the phone would call emergency services as a secret safety code. This was later traced to a bug in [[Apple Inc|Apple]] programming that was fixed within a day. The myth continued to spread on social media as a prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/siri-charge-phone-police/ |title=Telling Siri to 'Charge My Phone to 100%' Summons Police |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]] and the [[Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center]] ended their partnership with the California AIDSRide over concerns that not enough money was going to the charities. They hired Honeycutt Group, a consulting firm started by three former Pallotta TeamWorks employees, to organize [[AIDS/LifeCycle]], a similar event. [[Dan Pallotta]] unsuccessfully sued the "copycat" event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/03/01/319484/index.htm | work=CNN | title=Dan Pallotta's bike-tour and walkathon business has raised more than $200 million for AIDS research &amp; other charities.

'''Accidental incest''' is [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or [[marriage]] between persons who were unaware of a family relationship between them which would be considered [[incest]]uous.

The laws of many jurisdictions [[Void marriage|void incestuous marriages]], even if entered into without awareness of the kinship. If an incestuous relationship is suspected, [[DNA testing]] may be used. Some jurisdictions permit offspring of IVF donations access to donation records or to adoption records.

==Causes==
People may be unaware of a [[kinship]] relationship between them in a number of circumstances. For example, [[artificial insemination]] with an anonymous [[sperm donation|donated sperm]] may result in offspring being unaware of any biological relations, such as paternity or half siblings. To reduce the likelihood of accidental incest, fertility clinics usually limit the number of times that a donor's sperm may be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9iJlAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RYgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2368,2279497&amp;dq=accidental-incest |title=Accidental Incest Risk Increases |date=15 March 1979 |work=Edmonton Journal |agency=Associated Press |page=61 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=coNSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hwUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6125,3788930&amp;dq=accidental-incest |title=Report From A Test Tube Baby |last=Atallah |first=Lillian |date=19 April 1976 |work=Ocala Star-Banner |page=35 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries have laws limiting the number of children a donor can father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/30/international/europe/30sperm.html |title=Spreading Scandinavian Genes, Without Viking Boats |last=Alvarez |first=Lizette |date=30 September 2004 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others limit sperm donations based on family numbers to enable one family to have true siblings.

[[Taiwan]] allows those conceived by artificial means to find out if they are related to a person they are considering marrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/05/11/2003360370 |title=DOH working on provision to stop accidental incest |last=Oung |first=Angelica |date=11 May 2007 |work=The Taipei Times |page=2 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |location=Taiwan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accidental incest may also arise in the following situations:
* Children separated from their family at birth,
* [[Child abandonment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Angelica |first=Jade Christine |title=A Moral Emergency: Breaking the Cycle of Child Sexual Abuse |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-F92TlEyr8oC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22accidental+incest%22&amp;ei=-P-HTa2tOKqO0QHR58T9DQ&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwATgK&amp;q=%22accidental%20incest%22 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sexual exploration.

==Notable cases==
*In 2008, it was reported that a British brother and sister, who were twins separated at birth, married without knowing of their relationship. According to the report, the relationship was discovered soon after their wedding, and the marriage was annulled. The case has raised the issue regarding whether adoptions should be kept secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/01/11/twins.married/?imw=Y&amp;iref=mpstoryemail |title=Unknowing twins married, lawmaker says |publisher=CNN |accessdate=23 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://culturekitchen.com/mole333/blog/accidental_incest_twins_separated_at_birth_marr |title=Accidental Incest: Twins Separated at Birth Marry |last=Sabater |first=Liza |publisher=Culture Kitchen |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been raised, however, about whether the story is, in fact, true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Henley |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/15/familyandrelationships.jonhenley |title=Did a pair of twins really get married by mistake? |work=The Guardian |accessdate=3 April 2012 |location=London |date=15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An engaged couple in South Africa, who had been together for five years and were expecting a child, discovered that they were brother and sister just before their wedding. They were raised separately and met as adults in college. Just before the wedding, their parents met and they came to realize that they were siblings. The couple broke off the relationship after the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stewart |last=Maclean |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2057081/Engaged-couple-discover-brother-sister-parents-meet-days-wedding.html |title=Engaged couple discover they are brother and sister when their parents meet just before wedding |newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] |date=3 November 2011 |accessdate=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Japan and the Philippines were the only confirmed stops of the tour, it has been revealed that the singer was planned to be performing dates in several Asian countries for the very first time.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"/&gt;

==Background==
The tour was organized to support the English language album ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', and was scheduled to take place in October and November 2014. Japan and the Philippines were officially announced. However, there were unofficial dates and venues for Taiwan, China, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand but because of the cancellation the ticket were never put on sale. In total, 14 concerts were supposed to take place.

==Commercial performance==
Celine's concerts in Tokyo and Osaka sold out immediately after tickets went on sale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hipjpn.co.jp/live/celine/ticket.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
On 13 August 2014, Dion has announced that the tour has been cancelled due to ongoing illness and family issues.

According to a statement released by the singer:

{{cquote|"I want to devote every ounce of my strength and energy to my [[René Angélil|husband]]'s healing, and to do so, it's important for me to dedicate this time to him and to our children," Dion said in a statement.
"I also want to apologize to all my fans everywhere, for inconveniencing them, and I thank them so much for their love and support."&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-puts-show-business-career-hold-her-health-and-family-reasons|title=Celine Dion announces show biz hiatus to focus on ailing husband|work=Celine: Las Vegas Official Website|publisher=[[AEG Live]]|accessdate=13 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813231818/http://www.celinedion.com/ca/news/celine-puts-show-business-career-hold-her-health-and-family-reasons|archive-date=13 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Dion did not return to Asia for a performance until her [[Celine Dion Live 2018|2018 tour]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/international/8455647/celine-dion-2018-asia-tour-dates&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening acts==
In the official announcement for the Japan and Philippine tour, it was revealed that the impersonator [[Véronic DiCaire]] had been invited to join Celine as the opening act for these shows.&lt;ref name="celinedion.com"/&gt;

==Set list==
The official setlist had yet to be announced, although in an exclusive video message to her Japanese fans, Dion promised a new show featuring songs from her latest English album, ''[[Loved Me Back to Life]]'', as well as fan favorites from the past.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dem_HyX9WcY&lt;/ref&gt; Celine was also rehearsing one song in Japanese and one in Mandarin for the tour.

The 2008 documentary was originally released in cinemas on 9 May. "Ben Hammott" relating to his alleged discoveries made in the vicinity of [[Rennes-le-Château]] since 1999; Burgess claims Ben Hammott would have found the treasure of [[Bérenger Saunière]]: a mummified corpse, which he believed were [[Mary Magdalene]]. In the film, Burgess interviews several people with alleged connections to the Priory of Sion, including a Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood. A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled ''Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus'' presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Howells, ''Inside The Priory of Sion: Revelations From The World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of The Bloodline of Jesus'' (Watkins Publishing, 2011). {{ISBN|1-78028-017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"In [[Holy Blood, Holy Grail]] Plantard claimed that the key to the mystery of Rennes-le-Château was that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were married and had children." Howells, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; By 21 March 2012 Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on [[Podcast]] interview (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php ''NightVision Radio'', entry dated Wednesday, March 21, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320110246/http://latalkradio.com/Rene.php |date=March 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.benhammott.com/hammott-statement.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36109">This is a chronicle of important events that took place under the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1636–1912) in what is now [[China]]. It spans from the death of his predecessor [[Hong Taiji]] (r. 1626–1643) in September 1643, to the emperor's own death on 5 February 1661, seven days into the eighteenth year of the Shunzhi [[Chinese era name|reign period]]. These dates do not correspond perfectly with the Shunzhi era itself, which started on 8 February 1644—on [[Chinese New Year|New Year's Day]] of the [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar year]] following the emperor's accession—and ended on 17 February 1662 (the last day of the 18th year of Shunzhi), more than one [[solar year]] after the emperor's death. The posthumous events related to the Shunzhi Emperor's burial and posthumous cult are also included.

==Dorgon regency==

===1643===
*'''September 21''': [[Hong Taiji]] dies after a successful seventeen-year reign during which the [[Qing]] became a major power in northeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oxnam|1975}} (p. 38), {{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}} (p. 297), and {{harvnb|Gong|2010}} (p. 51) all place Hong Taiji's death on September 21 (Chongde 崇德 8.8.9). {{harvnb|Dennerline|2002}} (p. 74) gives the date as September 9.&lt;/ref&gt; His death threatens to split the Manchus just as they are preparing to attack the Ming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dennerline|2002|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''September 26''': a [[Deliberative Council]] of princes and high officials is convened and decides that five-year-old Fulin, [[Hong Taiji]]'s ninth son, will succeed his father, but that Hong Taiji's half-brother [[Dorgon]] and [[Jirgalang]] will be his co-regents. This deal is a compromise between those who wanted to keep the throne in Hung Taiji's descent (the main candidate was Hong Taiji's eldest son [[Hooge (prince)|Hooge]]) and those who supported Dorgon.
*'''October 8''': at the age of six ''sui'', [[Fulin]] officially becomes [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fang|1943|p=255}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1644===
*'''February 8''': in [[Xi'an]], [[Li Zicheng]] founds the "[[Shun Dynasty|Great Shun]]" dynasty and proclaims himself King.
*'''February 17''': [[Jirgalang]] willingly yields control of all official matters to his co-regent [[Dorgon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=299}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''March 5''': Dorgon sends an amicable letter to Li Zicheng proposing that they "devise a plan in common to unite their forces" against the Ming.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=304}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''March 17''': the Shun army occupies [[Taiyuan]] in [[Shanxi]].
*'''April 5''': Seeing the progress of rebel armies in north China, the Chongzhen Emperor issues a call for the immediate help of any military commandant in the empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Struve|1988|p=641}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''April 24''': Li Zicheng enters [[Beijing]], the capital of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming empire]].
*'''April 25''': the [[Chongzhen Emperor]] commits suicide on a hill behind the [[Forbidden City]].
*'''April 26''': [[Wu Sangui]], a powerful Ming general, moves his army through [[Shanhai Pass]] (at the eastern end of the [[Great Wall]]) and marches toward Beijing in response to the emperor's distress call. When he hears that the capital has fallen, Wu returns to fortify Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu's departure from the fortified city of [[Xingcheng|Ningyuan]], where [[Battle of Ningyuan|Ming armies had defeated]] Qing founder [[Nurhaci]] in 1626, leaves all territory outside the Great Wall under Qing control.
*'''April 29''': the victorious Li Zicheng holds an audience with several thousand Ming officials outside the Donghua Gate of the Forbidden City. Assisted by his main [[Grand Secretary]] [[Niu Jinxing]] (牛金星), Li selected 92 officials to serve in the Shun government. The remaining literati are given over to Shun generals for punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=277–79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 5''': Wu Sangui routs an army led by Tang Tong, which Li Zicheng had despatched to attack Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 10''': Tang Tong's defeated army returns toward Shanhai Pass with reinforcements, but is again defeated by Wu Sangui. Wu takes the city of Yongping (永平) on the road to Beijing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 296"/&gt;
*'''May 13''': words reach the Qing capital of Shengjing that Li Zicheng has been brutalizing former Ming officials and the population of Beijing. Grand Secretary Fan Wencheng uses these news to argue for a Qing intervention in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=304}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon agrees to mount a military expedition to punish the rebels and occupy the Central Plains of China.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=305}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 14''': Dorgon leads the Qing "Grand Army" out of Shengjing and starts marching south toward the Great Wall.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt;
*'''May 18''': After the defeat of two of his armies a few days earlier, Li Zicheng decides to take Shanhai Pass himself: he leaves Beijing with an army of 60,000 troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=296}}, note 212.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 20''': two of Wu Sangui's lieutenants arrive at Dorgon's camp at the [[Liao River]] carrying a message from their master asking the Manchus to help Wu defeat Li Zicheng's bandits and restore the Ming dynasty in return for "great profits" (大利).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=297}} (date of arrival at the Manchus' camp) and 300–1 (content of the letter).&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon sends a letter back to Wu Sangui offering.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Later that day the Manchus hear for the first time that the Chongzhen emperor was dead.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 305"/&gt; Still on that day, but as a result of earlier plans, small groups of Qing troops start to cross the Great Wall to distribute written proclamations announcing that the Qing army will not harm the population and will only kill Li Zicheng's bandits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=306–307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 25''': By that date, Li Zicheng's army was already camping in the outskirts of Shanhai Pass, near the Sha River a few kilometers west of the Shanhai Pass garrison; Wu Sangui sends his troops to confront him there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=309}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon receives a letter confirming that Wu Sangui has accepted to work for the Qing: he takes his army on a forced march toward Shanhai Pass.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=310}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 26''': having covered more than 150 kilometers in 24 hours, Dorgon's troops settle eight kilometers away from the Pass to rest for a few hours. They are awoken at midnight to continue marching.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt;
*'''May 27''': [[Battle of Shanhai Pass]]. At dawn Dorgon's main army reaches the gates of Shanhaiguan, where Dorgon receives Wu Sangui's formal surrender.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 310"/&gt; The armies deploy for battle: placed in the vanguard, Wu's troops are ordered to charge the Shun army, but they are unable to break the rebels' line and suffer heavy casualties. By the late afternoon, they are on the verge of defeat when a sandstorm starts blowing on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon chooses this moment to intervene: galloping around Wu's right flank, Qing bannermen destroys Li's left wing.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 311"/&gt; The Shun army is defeated and retreats chaotically toward Yongping; thousands are massacred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=311–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 28''': Li Zicheng retreats from Yongping toward Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wu Sangui is named Prince Pingxi; his remaining troops shave their heads and join the Qing forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=312}}, note 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 31''': Li Zicheng reenters Beijing with his troops, which started to loot the capital.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 313"&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 3''': as a "final gesture of defiance" after his decisive defeat at Shanhai Pass, Li Zicheng officially declares himself [[Emperor of China|Emperor]] of the Great Shun at the Wuying dian 武英殿.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313}} (citation and date); {{harvnb|Gong|2010|p=74}} (Wuying dian).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 4''': after 42 days in Beijing, Li Zicheng sets the imperial palaces on fire and abandons the capital to flee toward the west.&lt;ref name="Wakeman 313"/&gt; The Beijing population massacres rebels who had not fled; nearly two thousand are killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|page=313–14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 5''': led by Dorgon, Qing troops are welcomed into the capital; the Beijing population is shocked because it was expecting Wu Sangui to bring back the Ming heir apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|pages=314–15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''June 7''': Dorgon issues special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepts to cut their hair and to surrender, the officials will be allowed to stay at their post.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=416}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (See June 25.)
*'''June 25''': because peasant rebellions quickly erupted around the capital in reaction to the haircutting order of June 7, Dorgon issues an edict saying that people will be allowed to arrange their hair the way they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 420–422. {{harvnb|Gong|2010|p=84}} gives the date as June 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''July 14''': Dorgon declares Beijing (which he calls "Yanjing" 燕京) the new capital of the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naquin|2000|p=289}} (gives the date as Shunzhi 1.6.11).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mukden]] (present-day Shenyang), which had been the Qing capital since 1634, is retained as a secondary capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rawski|1998|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''July 29''': at the request of his superior, German [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Johann Adam Schall von Bell]] petitions the Qing throne, claiming that the Jesuit calendar is more accurate than the other ones available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=857}}, note 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''October 19''': the six-year-old Emperor arrives in Beijing through the Zhengyang Gate, where he is welcomed by Dorgon.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985|p=857}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''October 31''': the Jesuit Johann Adam Schall von Bell is made Director of the Bureau of Astronomy (欽天監) after a test of the Jesuits' prediction for an eclipse on September 1 proved to be more accurate than those of the court's official astronomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 857–58, note 24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''November 8''': a formal ritual of imperial enthronement is held for Fulin, during which the merits of Dorgon as regent are compared to those of the [[Duke of Zhou]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 858 and 860.&lt;/ref&gt; Dorgon's title is raised from "Prince Regent" to "Uncle Prince Regent" (Shufu shezheng wang 叔父攝政王), in which ''shufu'' (''ecike'' in Manchu) represents a rank higher than that of imperial prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wakeman|1985}}, pp. 860–61, and p. 861, note 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3678">A '''crash cover''' is a [[Philately|philatelic]] term for a type of [[Cover (philately)|cover]],  (including the terms '''air accident cover''', '''interrupted flight cover''', '''wreck cover''') meaning an envelope or package that has been recovered from a [[fixed-wing aircraft]], [[airship]] or [[aeroplane]] crash, train wreck, [[shipwreck]] or other accident. Crash covers are a type of [[interrupted mail]].

[[File:Crash Cover Nov 2 1929.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Example of a salvaged U.S. Air Mail Crash Cover (CAM #24, Indianapolis, IN, Nov. 2, 1929)]] [[Aviation accidents and incidents|Crashes]] of flights carrying [[airmail]] were a regular occurrence from the earliest days of mail transport by air. In many cases of [[aircraft]] crashes, train wreck and shipwrecks, it was possible to recover some or even all of the mail being carried, with perhaps some charring around the edges of some pieces if there had been a fire, or water damage from [[flying boat]] crashes or shipwrecks. In such cases, the authorities typically apply a [[postal marking]] (cachet), label, or [[mimeograph]] that gets affixed to the cover explaining the delay and damage to the recipient, and possibly enclose the letter in an "ambulance cover" or "body bag" if it was badly damaged and then send it to its intended destination.

Aviation related crash covers are a specialised collecting area of [[aerophilately]] and are much-prized items of [[postal history]], because they are generally rare, but as tangible artifacts of often-tragic accidents they have a story to tell. The 367 covers salvaged from the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] are especially desirable,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapsnewyork.org/covers/crash.html Collecting Air Crash Covers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/museum/1d_Hindenburg.html Hindenburg crash covers]&lt;/ref&gt; with prices ranging from US$10,000 and up; a cover at the [[Corinphila]] auction in May 2001 realized 85,000 Swiss francs (US$75,000).

The [[American Air Mail Society]] has a "Crash Cover Committee" specializing in the study of crash covers. There is also a Wreck &amp; Crash Mail Society, whose members collect all types of crash &amp; wreck covers.

==Early life==
Monn was born and raised in [[Fayetteville, Pennsylvania|Fayetteville]], Pennsylvania as one of six children. As a child, he showed an early interest in fashion design with hopes of attending the [[Parsons School of Design]]. In 1981 at age 18, Monn earned a job at Butte Knit, a clothing factory in his town that was a part of the Jonathan Logan Corporation. This job soon led him to New York City where he rented a studio apartment near [[Mindy Grossman]]'s. While in New York, Monn took up interior decorating for himself and his friends (including Grossman).&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Haute"/&gt;

==Career==
Prior to beginning his event and interior design career, Monn worked in the jewelry business for 12 years. In 2003, Gayfryd Steinberg hired Monn as the event planner and designer for the Library Lions Gala at the New York Public Library's main campus. Since then, Monn has been designing events for a wide variety of occasions.&lt;ref name="Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news | last=Gordon| first=Amanda| title =Authentic, Simple &amp; Refined: A Night With David Monn| newspaper =[[The New York Sun]]| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =| date =August 14, 2008 | url =http://www.nysun.com/out-and-about/authentic-simple-refined-a-night-with-david-monn/83889/| accessdate =March 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he managed the festivities for the grand opening of the [[Time Warner Center]].

'''Diminished value''', Diminution in Value, or commonly referred to as "DV" are the terms generally used to describe the economic loss in a property's value as a result of having been damaged. Diminished Value (DV) is often associated with vehicles that have been damaged, however, it is applicable to other property of value including collectibles such as jewelry, artwork, etc. For the purposes herein, reference will involve the loss in value of a damaged automobile where the term is often applied.

Unlike "depreciation", which is an anticipated and predictable loss in value over time, ‘Inherent Diminished Value’ is a loss in value due to a specific, sudden and unexpected negative occurrence. Diminished value of an automobile following an accident may occur in one of three ways (or a combination thereof):

(1) repair-related diminished value;

(2) Immediate diminished value; and

(3) inherent diminished value.

'''Repair-related diminished value''' is the loss of value due to the inability to perfectly repair the vehicle, so it is worth less after repairs than it was before the wreck. '''Immediate Diminished Value''' – The difference in resale value of a vehicle immediately before damage has occurred and immediately after damage has occurred (prior to repair).  As courts are rarely the chosen venue for recovery of property damage, the standard of "Immediate Diminished Value" is rarely employed in resolving Property Damage claims. This also refers to a loss of value caused by the insurer's direct involvement in the claim adjustment in which the insurer exerts control over the repairs and repairs are incomplete, insufficiently performed, or otherwise restore the vehicle to less than the standard condition.

'''Inherent Diminished Value''' - Assumes optimal repair quality has been achieved and is defined as the amount by which the resale value of a repaired vehicle has been reduced simply because the subject vehicle now has a significant damage history. This is the most widely recognized and accepted form of Diminished Value. It is also the basis upon which any supplemental form of Diminished Value would be added. A common "Supplemental" form of Diminished Value is "Repair Related Diminished Value".

Usually, a frame or structurally damaged vehicle cannot be re-sold as a "[[certified pre-owned]] vehicle."

The true measure of a damaged vehicle's inherent loss in value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. The standard rule as to establishing a value on late model vehicles would be: 20-25% behind book (Black Book, KBB, NADA) and utilize actual sales results, and not on advertised prices.

While some may claim Diminished Value (DV) is subjective and based upon perception or speculation, the old adage "perception becomes reality' applies and as such Diminution in Value is real simply because, for the most part, no reasonable and prudent person is willing to pay the same price for a vehicle with a history of damage as they would for one never having been damaged. Retailers often offer discounts for scratches and dents on appliances, electronics and dented canned goods; it is, therefore, reasonable that the value of a damaged motor vehicle will suffer a lessening in value.

Additional factors may be taken into consideration in evaluating the loss in value of a damaged and repaired vehicle and may include, but not be limited to: the vehicle itself (i.e. rare collectible, originality, market desirability etc.), the vehicle’s pre-loss condition, severity of the sustained damages (i.e. frame damage, flood, fire etc.), the subject vehicle’s history (i.e. one owner, prior damage/repair, death of occupants etc.), quality and thoroughness of the performed repairs, (i.e. quality of parts, materials, workmanship, etc.) and additional value considerations including, but not limited to values associated with pre-owned certification programs.etc.

Auto insurance companies may not readily recognize or offer to pay for diminished value. Each state may have differing opinions of DV. Example; The state of Georgia allows the insured party (the first-party Policyholder) to make a claim for their remaining economic loss for DV from their own insurance company while the neighboring state of Florida does not. Most states, however, allow the victim of another's negligence (third-party) to make a DV claim from the at-fault party.

The length of time to collect Diminished Value will vary depending upon each state's statute of limitations for first party (contractual) claims and third-party (restatement of tort) claims.

==Diminished Value Appraisal==
{{original research|section|date=January 2013}}
A diminished value [[wikt:appraisal|appraisal]] evaluates the difference in value of a [[motor vehicle]] after a collision repair. Reports are usually compiled by an Auto Appraisal Expert experienced in the field of DV and who may provide expert testimony for Appraisals, Arbitration, Mediation or Litigation in a court of law. This Assessment report is used when filing or disputing a diminished value claim against another party and/or an [[insurance]] company. The report measures a damaged vehicle’s inherent loss in value. The diminished value can be measured as the difference in the value of the vehicle before the loss to that after the loss, prior to or after repair. In most cases even if the repair was done expertly, the value of the automobile will still be considerably less after a loss. When consumers find that a vehicle has been in an accident, most consumers will never pay the same price for a repaired vehicle as compared to one with no loss history.

Some reports include an assessment of the damage done to a motor vehicle, the quality of the performed repair, the market value of the vehicle before and after the accident.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diminishedvalue.law/info-center/how-to-prove-diminished-value-of-a-vehicle/|title=Coffey Trial Law - Diminished Value|website=www.diminishedvalue.law|language=en|access-date=2017-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;There are no set rules for measuring diminished value, and since every vehicle loses value differently, a one size fits all formula would be fundamentally inaccurate.

==Regional==
Recognition of concept of diminished value varies from country to country {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===United States===
Some states' statutes acknowledge diminished value and provide the ability for consumers to collect first party claims of DV from their own insurance companies under their own policies. Most states allow the consumer to collect third party claims from the at-fault driver's insurance company. Some states recognize liability for third party claims but not first party claims.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mwl-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diminution-of-value-in-all-50-states.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
In Georgia, vehicle owners can collect DV against their own policy.

=== Florida ===
Diminished value is part of the Florida Standard Civil Jury Instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Standard Jury Instructions - Civil|url=http://www.floridasupremecourt.org/civ_jury_instructions/instructions.shtml#500|publisher=State of Florida|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diminished value [[case law]] in Florida is based primarily on two cases.

* Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company, '''819 So.2d 732''' (Florida 2002).
The ability to receive diminished value [[financial compensation]] from an at-fault driver for their negligence was decided by the [[Florida Supreme Court]] in the Siegle vs. Progressive Consumer's Insurance Company case.  After Siegle insurance companies are able to exclude responsibility for the payment of diminished value to the vehicle that they insure through the language in the policy.
* McHale vs. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co. '''409 So.2d 238''' (1982)
The [[Florida Third District Court of Appeal]], upheld that the correct measure of damages is the cost of repair plus any reduction in the value of the vehicle. The Court also directed that proving the reduction in value is the burden of the [[Plaintiff]] bringing the claim.

=== Louisiana ===
Diminished value is provided in [http://legis.la.gov/legis/Law.aspx?d=408380 Louisiana Revised Statute 9:2800.17].  The vehicle owner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that the fair market value would be less than its value before the vehicle was damaged.

===Washington===
On July 15, 2014, a policyholder in Washington state filed a proposed class action lawsuit in the Superior Court of Pierce County seeking diminished value insurance benefits under their automobile insurance policies.  The insurance company filed a notice to remove the lawsuit to federal district court on August 20, 2014.  The case is titled ''Johnston v. United Services Automobile Ass'n''.

===Canada===
The ability to recover damages for accelerated depreciation varies from Province to Province.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In [[British Columbia]], law recognizes this loss as a recoverable damage and quantify the claim based on the diminished value at the time the collision occurs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20c%20--/court%20rules%20act%20rsbc%201996%20c.%2080/05_regulations/19_168_2009%20supreme%20court%20civil%20rules/168_2009_02.xml Rule 11-2 BC Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rules addressing the admissibility of depreciation reports in court vary by jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  For example, in British Columbia, Canada, [http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20C%20--/Court%20Rules%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%2080/05_Regulations/19_168_2009%20Supreme%20Court%20Civil%20Rules/168_2009_02.xml#part11 the BC Supreme Court requires such reports to comply with Rule 11].

[[File:Post-and-Grant-Avenue-Look.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins from the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]], remembered as one of the worst [[natural disaster]]s in the history of the [[United States]].]]

A '''disaster''' is a serious disruption, occurring over a relatively short time, of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental loss and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources.&lt;ref name="ifrc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=What is a disaster?|url=http://www.ifrc.org/en/what-we-do/disaster-management/about-disasters/what-is-a-disaster/|website=www.ifrc.org|publisher=International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EHA"&gt;{{Cite paper |date=March 2002 |title=Disasters &amp; Emergencies: Definitions |url=http://apps.who.int/disasters/repo/7656.pdf |language=en-GB-oxendict|location=[[Addis Ababa]]|publisher=Emergency Humanitarian Action |access-date=2017-11-26 |via=World Health Organization International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary academia, disasters are seen as the consequence of inappropriately [[risk management|managed risk]]. These risks are the product of a combination of both hazards and vulnerability. Hazards that strike in areas with low vulnerability will never become disasters, as in the case of uninhabited regions.&lt;ref name=quarantelli&gt;Quarantelli E.L. (editor) "Where We Have Been and Where We Might Go", ''What is a Disaster?: A Dozen Perspectives on the Question'', London, Routledge, 1 edition 1998, pp.146–159&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing countries suffer the greatest costs when a disaster hits&amp;nbsp;– more than 95 percent of all deaths caused by hazards occur in developing countries, and losses due to natural hazards are 20 times greater (as a percentage of [[GDP]]) in [[developing countries]] than in [[industrialized countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/EXTDISMGMT/0,,menuPK:341021~pagePK:149018~piPK:149093~theSitePK:341015,00.html|title= World Bank: Disaster Risk Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luis Flores Ballesteros.

==Etymology==
The word ''disaster'' is derived from Middle [[French language|French]] ''désastre'' and that from Old [[Italian language|Italian]] ''disastro'', which in turn comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[pejorative]] prefix δυσ-, (''dus-'') "bad"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2328613|title= Dus, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ἀστήρ (''aster''), "star".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2316528|title= Aster, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, "A Greek-English Lexicon", at Perseus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The root of the word ''disaster'' ("bad star" in Greek) comes from an [[astrology|astrological]] sense of a calamity blamed on the position of planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etymonline.com/?term=disaster "Disaster"] in Etymology online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==
Researchers have been studying disasters for more than a century, and for more than forty years [[disaster research]]. The studies reflect a common opinion when they argue that all disasters can be seen as being human-made, their reasoning being that human actions before the strike of the hazard can prevent it developing into a disaster. All disasters are hence the result of human failure to introduce appropriate [[emergency management]] measures.&lt;ref name=atrisk&gt;Blaikie, Piers, Terry Cannon, Ian Davis &amp; Ben Wisner. ''At Risk – Natural hazards, people's vulnerability and disasters'', Wiltshire: Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-25216-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazards are routinely divided into natural or human-made, although complex disasters, where there is no single root cause, are more common in [[developing country|developing countries]]. A specific disaster may spawn a secondary disaster that increases the impact. A classic example is an [[earthquake]] that causes a [[tsunami]], resulting in coastal [[flooding]].

===Natural disaster===
{{Main article| Natural disaster}}

A natural disaster is a natural process or phenomenon that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.

Various phenomena like [[earthquakes]], [[landslides]], [[volcanic eruptions]], floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, tsunamis, and cyclones are all natural hazards that kill thousands of people and destroy billions of dollars of habitat and property each year. However, the rapid growth of the world's population and its increased concentration often in hazardous environments has escalated both the frequency and severity of disasters. With the tropical climate and unstable [[Landform|landforms]], coupled with deforestation, unplanned growth proliferation, non-engineered constructions make the disaster-prone areas more vulnerable. Developing countries suffer more or less chronically from natural disasters due to ineffective communication combined with insufficient budgetary allocation for [[Emergency management|disaster prevention and management]]. [[Asia]] tops the list of casualties caused by natural hazards.
[[Image:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|[[Airplane crash]]es and [[terrorist attack]]s are examples of man-made disasters: they cause pollution, kill people, and damage property. This example is of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 at the World Trade Center in New York.]]

===Man-made disasters===
{{Main article|Anthropogenic hazard}}
Human-instigated disasters are the consequence of technological hazards. Examples include [[stampede]]s, [[fire]]s, transport accidents, industrial accidents, oil spills and nuclear explosions/radiation. War and deliberate attacks may also be put in this category. As with natural hazards, man-made hazards are events that have not happened—for instance, terrorism. Man-made disasters are examples of specific cases where man-made hazards have become reality in an event.

On 19 February 1978, Egyptian special forces raided [[Larnaca International Airport]] near [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], in an attempt to intervene in a [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]]. Earlier, two assassins had killed prominent Egyptian newspaper editor [[Yusuf Sibai]] and then rounded up as hostages several Arabs who were attending a convention in [[Nicosia]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=1978: Egyptian forces die in Cyprus gunfight | date=1978-02-19 | publisher= | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/19/newsid_2565000/2565701.stm | work =BBC | pages = | accessdate = 2008-02-02 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cypriot forces were trying to negotiate with the hostage-takers at the airport, Egyptian troops launched their own assault without authorization from the Cypriots. The unauthorized raid led to the Egyptians and the Cypriots exchanging gunfire, killing or injuring more than 20 of the Egyptian commandos.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; As a result, Egypt and Cyprus severed political ties for several years after the incident.

== Hijacking ==
In the late hours of 18 February 1978, Yusuf Sibai, editor of a prominent [[Egypt]]ian newspaper and a friend of the [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Anwar Sadat]], was [[assassinated]] by two gunmen at a convention being held at the [[Nicosia]] Hilton. The two assassins rounded up 16 Arab convention delegates as hostages (among them, two P.L.O. representatives and one Egyptian national) and demanded transportation to [[Larnaca International Airport]]. They also demanded and were supplied with a [[Cyprus Airways]] DC-8 aircraft. Following negotiations with the Cypriot authorities, the hijackers were allowed to fly the aircraft out of Cyprus with 11 hostages and four crew members. The aircraft, however, was denied permission to land in [[Djibouti]], [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and was forced to return and land in [[Cyprus]] a few hours later.

According to a report in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Sadat was aggrieved by the assassination of his personal friend and begged the Cypriot President, [[Spyros Kyprianou]] to rescue the hostages and extradite the terrorists to Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Murder and Massacre on Cyprus | date= March 6, 1978 | publisher= | url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915969-2,00.html | work =[[Time Magazine]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-10-23 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cypriot President responded by promising to oversee the rescue operation and any negotiations personally, and travelled to the airport himself. According to the same report however, Sadat dispatched an elite [[Unit 777|antiterrorism unit]] (Task Force 777) to Cyprus aboard a [[C-130 Hercules]] transport aircraft. Cairo merely informed Kyprianou that ''"people are on the way to help rescue the hostages"'' and did not reveal who was on board nor what their intentions were.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Upon landing in Cyprus, the Egyptian force immediately launched an all out assault, dispatching a single [[Jeep]] all-terrain vehicle with three men to race ahead of an estimated 58 troops (another report has this figure at 74&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19780219-1 |title=Criminal Occurrence description |accessdate=2008-02-02 |date=1978-02-19 |publisher=Aviation Safety Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;) moving towards the hijacked aircraft on foot.

== Egyptian raid ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
As the [[Egypt]]ian troops advanced quickly towards the hijacked DC-8 aircraft and the [[Cypriot National Guard]] forces who surrounded it, the Cypriot forces reportedly issued a single verbal warning to halt and submit, though in other reports, the Cypriots issued two verbal warnings, the second a demand for the Egyptians to return to their aircraft. As this occurred, the occupants of the Jeep and the Cypriot National Guardsmen exchanged gunfire, and the Egyptian Jeep was struck by a [[rocket propelled grenade]] (RPG), as well as gunfire, killing all three occupants. As the vehicle came to a halt, the [[Cyprus|Cypriots]] and the main Egyptian force confronted each other at a range of less than {{convert|300|m|yd}}, and it is variously reported that the Egyptians, who lacked any form of cover, dropped down onto the tarmac in prone firing positions. At this moment, the two forces engaged each other with heavy gunfire, and the Cypriots opened fire on the Egyptian C-130H aircraft with a 106&amp;nbsp;mm anti-tank missile, striking it in the nose and killing all three crew on board.

With their aircraft destroyed, the Egyptian force and the Cypriot National Guard exchanged heavy gunfire for nearly an hour in sporadic fighting on the open tarmac. Some of the Egyptian troops took cover in a nearby empty [[Air France]] aircraft.

Cypriot President Spyros Kyprianou, who was watching the events unfolding from the airport control tower, was forced to withdraw from the windows and take cover as Egyptian commandos struck the tower with automatic gunfire.

==Aftermath==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}
Of the Egyptian commando force, 15 men were killed, in addition to three crew of the C-130H Hercules transport aircraft who were killed when it was struck by a missile. An estimated 15 more Egyptian commandos were reported to have been taken injured to [[Larnaca]] General Hospital with gunshot wounds.

Following the assault, it emerged that the surrender of the two hostage-takers had already been secured at the time of the failed Egyptian attack, and the two men were taken prisoner by the Cypriots and later extradited to [[Egypt]], where they received death sentences, later commuted to life sentences.

On 20 February, Egypt recalled its diplomatic mission and requested the Cyprus government to do the same in Cairo. Cyprus requested the withdrawal of Egypt's military attaché.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Watts | coauthors= | title=Angry Egyptians call envoys home as Cyprus dispute grows | date=February 21, 1978 | publisher= | url=http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | work=[[The Times]] Digital Archive | pages=1; Issue 60242; col F | accessdate=2008-05-02 | language= | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030906202207/http://www.galeuk.com/times/ | archivedate=September 6, 2003 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortcuts in engineering design can lead to '''engineering disasters'''.  Engineering is the science and technology used to meet the needs and demands of society.&lt;ref&gt;"Engineering." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; These demands include [[buildings]], [[aircraft]], [[Marine vessel|vessel]]s, and computer software. In order to meet society’s demands, the creation of newer technology and infrastructure must be met efficiently and cost-effectively.  To accomplish this, managers and engineers have to have a mutual approach to the specified demand at hand. This can lead to shortcuts in engineering design to reduce costs of construction and fabrication. Occasionally, these shortcuts can lead to unexpected design failures.

==Importance of safety==
In the field of engineering, the importance of safety is emphasized. Learning from past engineering failures and infamous disasters such as the Challenger explosion brings the sense of reality to what can happen when appropriate safety precautions are not taken. Safety tests such as [[tensile testing]], [[finite element analysis]] (FEA), and failure theories help provide information to design engineers about what maximum forces and stresses can be applied to a certain region of a design. These precautionary measures help prevent failures due to overloading and deformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dax|first=Mark|title=Failure Analysis Prevents Disaster Reoccurance|journal=R&amp;D Magazine|date=Dec 1997|pages=30–31|publisher=EBSOhost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background of failure==
Failure occurs when a structure or device has been used past the limits of design that inhibits proper function.&lt;ref&gt;"Failure." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 23 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; If a structure is designed to only support a certain amount of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]], or loading and the user applies greater amounts, the structure will begin to deform and eventually fail. Several factors contribute to failure including a flawed design, improper use, financial costs, and miscommunication.

==Failure due to static loading==
[[File:Metal yield.svg|thumbnail|Stress–strain curve showing typical yield behavior for ductile metals. Stress (σ) is shown as a function of strain (ϵ). Stress and strain are correlated through Young's Modulus: σ=Eϵ where E is the slope of the linear section of the plot.]]
Static loading is when a force is applied slowly to an object or structure. Static load tests such as tensile testing, bending tests, and torsion tests help determine the maximum loads that a design can withstand without permanent deformation or failure. Tensile testing is common when calculating a stress-strain curve which can determine the [[yield strength]] and [[ultimate strength]] of a specific test specimen.

[[File:Tensile testing on a coir composite.jpg|thumbnail|Tensile testing on a composite specimen]]

The specimen is stretched slowly in tension until it breaks, while the load and the distance across the gage length are continuously monitored. A sample subjected to a tensile test can typically withstand stresses higher than its yield stress without breaking. At a certain point, however, the sample will break into two pieces. This happens because the microscopic cracks that resulted from yielding will spread to large scales. The stress at the point of complete breakage is called a material’s ultimate tensile strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Doehring|first=James|first2=Lauren|last2=Fritsky|title=What Is a Static Load?|publisher=WiseGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a [[stress-strain curve]] of the material's behavior under static loading. Through this tensile testing, the yield strength is found at the point where the material begins to yield more readily to the applied stress, and its rate of deformation increases.&lt;ref name="Machine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Norton|first=Robert L.|title=Machine Design: An Integrated Approach|location=Boston|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure due to fatigue==
When a material undergoes permanent deformation from exposure to radical temperatures or constant loading, the functionality of the material can become impaired.&lt;ref&gt;"CreepAbout Our Definitions: All Forms of a Word (noun, Verb, Etc.) Are Now Displayed on One Page." Merriam-Webster. Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 23 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Materials" /&gt; This time–dependent plastic distortion of material is known as [[creep (deformation)|creep]]. Stress and temperature are both major factors of the rate of creep. In order for a design to be considered safe, the deformation due to creep must be much less than the strain at which failure occurs. Once the static loading causes the specimen to surpass this point the specimen will begin permanent, or plastic, deformation.&lt;ref name="Materials"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbeler|first=R. C.|title=Mechanics of Materials|location=Boston|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mechanical design, most failures are due to time-varying, or dynamic, loads that are applied to a system. This phenomenon is known as fatigue failure. [[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]] is known as the weakness in a material due to variations of stress that are repeatedly applied to said material.&lt;ref&gt;"Fatigue." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Feb. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when stretching a rubber band to a certain length without breaking it (i.e. not surpassing the yield stress of the rubber band) the rubber band will return to its original form after release; however, repeatedly stretching the rubber band with the same amount of force thousands of times would create micro-cracks in the band which would lead to the rubber band being snapped. The same principle is applied to mechanical materials such as metals.&lt;ref name="Machine" /&gt;

Fatigue failure always begins at a crack that may form over time or due to the manufacturing process used. The three stages of fatigue failure are: 
* 1.) Crack initiation- when repeated stress creates a fracture in the material being used
* 2.) Crack propagation- when the initiated crack develops in the material to a larger scale due to tensile stress.
* 3.) Sudden fracture failure- caused by unstable crack growth to the point where the material will fail

Note that fatigue does not imply that the strength of the material is lessened after failure. This notion was originally referred to a material becoming "tired" after cyclic loading.&lt;ref name="Machine"/&gt;

==Failure due to miscommunication==

Engineering is a precise discipline and in order to be precise, communication among project developers is pertinent for a successful product. There are several forms of miscommunication that can lead to a flawed design in a system. There are various fields of engineering that have to intercommunicate when working toward a mutual goal. These fields include civil, electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical, biological, and environmental engineering. When creating a modern automobile, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, and environmental engineers are required to work together to produce a fuel-efficient, durable product for consumers. If engineers do not adequately communicate among one another, a potential design could have flaws and be unsafe for consumer purchase. '''Engineering disasters''' can be a result of such miscommunication. Such disasters include the [[2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] during [[Hurricane Katrina]], the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster]], and the [[Hyatt Regency walkway collapse]].&lt;ref name="Hyatt"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Richard D.|title=Investigation of the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Walkways Collapse|location=Washington, D.C.|journal=U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="levee"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2070 |publisher=United States Department of Defense |title=Defense.gov News Transcript: Defense Department Special Briefing on Efforts to Mitigate Infrastructure Damage from Hurricane Katrina |author1=Carl Strock |last-author-amp=yes |accessdate=22 Feb 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231001622/http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2070 |archivedate=2012-12-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

==Failure due to software==

Software has played a role in many high-profile disasters.

==Infamous disasters in engineering==
Engineering products and inventions are utilized everyday including computers, microwaves, and elevators. A broken microwave can have limited consequences; however, when larger projects such as infrastructures and airplanes fail, multiple people can be affected which leads to an '''engineering disaster'''. A disaster is defined as a calamity that results in significant damage which may include the loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;"Disaster." Definition of in Oxford Dictionaries (British &amp; World English). N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale engineering disasters are recorded in the history books. Just like any other mistake, these disasters become reminders and guidelines of how to improve and not repeat the same mistakes. In-depth observations and post-disaster analysis have been documented to a large extent to help prevent similar disasters from occurring.

{{Main article|Hyatt Regency walkway collapse}}

[[File:HRWalkway.svg|thumbnail|left|Depiction of the modified design made by the fabricator]]

On the night of July 17, 1981, in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], [[United States]], two suspended walkways of the [[Hyatt Regency Hotel]] collapsed, killing 114 people and injuring 200 more. During this calamity, the hotel was hosting a dance competition. There were numerous competition attendants and observers standing and dancing on the suspended walkways when connections supporting the ceiling rods that hoisted both the second and fourth floor walkways across the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]] failed and collapsed onto the crowded first floor atrium below.&lt;ref name="Hyatt2"&gt;"Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse." ENGINEERING.com. N.p., n.d. Web. 22 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

During investigation after the walkway collapse, architectural engineer Wayne G. Lischka noticed a substantial alteration of the original design. The fabricator constructed a double-rod support system rather than the originally designed single-rod system without approval of the engineering design team. In doing so, the created support beams doubled the loading on the connector which resulted in the failure of the walkway. It was documented that even the single-rod system would have barely supported the expected load and would not have met Kansas City Building Code standards.&lt;ref name="Hyatt2" /&gt;

The final analysis of the damage had several conclusions reported including:
* The maximum load capacity of the fourth floor walkway was only 53% the maximum load capacity of Kansas City Building Code standards
* The fabrication alterations from the original design doubled the load that was received by the fourth floor walkway
* The deformation and distortion of the fourth floor hanger rods support the notion that the collapse began at that point
* No evidence that the quality of construction or material selection played a role in the walkway collapse.&lt;ref name="Hyatt" /&gt;

===Aeronautics===

====Challenger explosion (1986)====
{{Main article|Space Shuttle Challenger disaster}}
The '''Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster''' occurred on January 28, 1986, when the [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'' (OV-099)]] (mission [[STS-51-L]]) broke apart 73 seconds into its flight, leading to the deaths of its seven crew members. Disintegration of the vehicle began after an [[O-ring]] seal in its right [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] (SRB) failed at liftoff.

====Columbia disaster (2003)====
{{Main article|Space Shuttle Columbia disaster}}

[[File:Crew of STS-107, official photo.jpg|thumbnail|left|The crew of the STS-107 mission.]]

The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred on February 1, 2003, while reentering Earth's atmosphere over [[Louisiana]] and [[Texas]]. The shuttle unexpectedly disintegrated, resulting in the death of all seven astronauts on board. The cause was later discovered to be damage to thermal shielding tiles from impact with a falling piece of foam insulation of an external tank during launch. It was the seventh known instance of this particular piece breaking free during launch.&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Accident Investigation Board, Report Volume 1, August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; As the shuttle re-entered Earth's atmosphere at a speed of Mach 23 (28,400km/h ; 17,647mph), the wing experienced temperatures of {{convert|2800|°F}}. The damage from the insulation strike experienced during launch proved fatal as the shuttle disintegrated during the mission return.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunbar|first=R. L. M.|last2=R.|first2=Garud|title=Distributed Knowledge and Indeterminate Meaning: The Case of the Columbia Shuttle Flight|journal=Organization Studies|volume=30|issue=4|year=2009|pages=397–421|doi=10.1177/0170840608101142}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA's investigation team found melted aluminum on the thermal tiles and inside edges of the left wing of the spacecraft, supporting the notion that the Columbia's destruction was due to hot gases that penetrated the damaged spot on the wing.&lt;ref&gt;"Molten Aluminum found on Columbia's thermal tiles". USA Today. Associated Press. March 4, 2003. Retrieved February 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger L.M. Dunbar of [[New York University]] and Raghu Garud of [[Pennsylvania State University]] procured a case description of what missteps [[NASA]] had taken that led to the Columbia spacecraft catastrophe. Mission control deemed that foam shedding was a not a safety factor prior to launch, believed damage of the shuttle panels were not a significant issue which in-turn delayed analysis on damages as of January 17, 2003, and denied mission action request between January 18 and 19. It was not until January 24, 2003, that mission control had classified the damage as a problematic issue. These missteps in communication between mission control and the debris assessment team inhibited a proper examination of the damages to the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

===Vessels===

====Liberty ships in WWII====
{{Main article|Liberty ship}}
Early Liberty ships suffered [[Liberty ship#Hull cracks|hull and deck cracks]], and a few were lost to such structural defects. During World War II, there were nearly 1,500 instances of significant [[brittle fracture]]s. Three of the 2,710 Liberties built broke in half without warning. In cold temperatures the steel hulls cracked, resulting in later ships being constructed using more suitable steel.

====Steamboat Sultana (1865)====
{{Main article|Sultana (steamboat)}}

[[File:Sultana Disaster.jpg|thumbnail|Depiction of the steamboat Sultana disaster]]
On the night of April 26, 1865, the passenger steamboat Sultana exploded on the [[Mississippi River]] seven miles north of [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. This maritime disaster is categorized as the worst in [[United States]] history. The explosion resulted in the loss of 1,547 lives, surpassing the total number of deaths caused by the sinking of the ''[[Titanic]]''. The Sultana was overcrowded due to a soldier prisoner exchange towards the end of the [[United States Civil War]]. The overcrowding contributed significantly to the high death toll. Another reason for the high number of deaths is that the steamer was made mostly of wood, which was documented to have been completely engulfed in flames approximately seven minutes after the explosion. The explosion happened around midnight which was when the Mississippi River was at flood stage. It was documented that the single metal lifeboat on board the Sultana was thrown from the upperdeck landing on several people swimming from the steamer resulting in further deaths.&lt;ref name="Sultana"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berryman |first=J.O. |last2=Potter |last3=Oliver |first3=S. |title=The Ill-Fated Passenger Steamer Sultana: An Inland Maritime Mass Disaster of Unparalleled Magnitude |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |publisher=JFSCA |volume=33 |issue=3 |date=May 1988 |pages=842–850 |url=http://library-resources.cqu.edu.au/JFS/PDF/vol_33/iss_3/JFS333880842.pdf }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disaster was believed to be the result of a repaired boiler explosion that led to the explosion of two of the three other boilers. The boiler had been previously found to have had a leak and was improperly repaired by boilermaker R.G. Taylor due to orders from Captain J. Cass Mason because of time constraints in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. While chief engineer Nathan Wintringer approved the repaired boiler, Taylor stated that the boiler could not be considered safe since the boiler appeared to be burned from being worked on with too little water.&lt;ref name="Sultana" /&gt; Traveling along the Mississippi River, the boiler exploded causing fire to spread throughout the steamer. The fire on board led to the collapse of both of the Sultana's smokestacks, killing many passengers. The sultanas captain died with the ship.

A '''false ending''' has two contexts: in literature, film and video games it is a narrative device where the plot seems to be heading to its conclusion, but in reality, there's still more to the story; in a musical composition, however, it is a complete stop of the work or song for one or more seconds before continuing.

The presence of a false ending can be anticipated through a number of ways: the medium itself might betray that it isn't the true ending (i.e. it's only halfway into a book or a song, a film's listed running time hasn't fully elapsed, only half the world has been explored in a video game, etc.), making only stories with indeterminate running length or a multi-story structure able to pull this off effectively; another indicator is the feeling that too much of the story is incomplete when the false ending comes, making it feel like there has to be more.

==Film==

In ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'' , it seems like the criminal case that the movie revolves around is completely closed with no loose ends until one of the witnesses admits that she lied about important details to give more importance towards the trial of the people who raped her, exposing a cover-up conspiracy. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', the director keeps using editing techniques that are indicative of endings in scenes that could be used as such, but continues until the movie finally ends. ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' has two false endings. Another example is in ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', where, at a very climatic stage in the film, the screen fades away and says ''[[Cliffhanger|To be continued]]'', which is then followed by the word "Immediately."

Some movies come to a formal ending, followed by the rolling of the credits, which is almost universally used to indicate that the film has ended, only to have the actors reappear in one or more [[mid-credits scene]]s. In comedy films, these sequences may be [[blooper]]s or [[outtake]]s. In other types of films, the mid-credit scenes may continue the narrative set out in the movie. The [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] movies have become notorious for this, in some cases featuring a mid-credits scene and an end-credits scene in the same movie.

In the police comedy ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' (2007), two police officers realize that a cult is controlling their town. After the two officers defeat the head of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance and his members, who have been causing problems in the town, the pair are celebrating their success at the police station, and the movie appears to be wrapping up. Then a surviving member of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance enters the station and shoots an old musket, which triggers an old-fashioned mine.

==Television==

==Video games==
Some examples in video games include ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' and ''[[Wild ARMs]]''. Both involve confrontations with the major antagonists at what seems like their final lairs, but instead a crisis occurs and the story continues. A third is in ''[[Naval Ops: Warship Gunner]]'', upon sinking the ''Druna Skass'' a second time (Which can only happen if the player plays though the game again, as the game resets itself to the beginning if you sink it once), the player is greeted by another supership, that looks just like the ''Druna Skass''. Yet another example is the [[survival horror]] game ''[[Obscure II]]'', in which the player must wait until the credits roll to their conclusion before gameplay resumes.

[[Role-playing video game]]s are notorious for having such plot devices. It usually involves the game's main antagonist being defeated, only for a previously mentioned character to be revealed as the "real" villain. One example is ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'', in which the main character is apparently about to have a boss fight with the former villain Zant, but Zant reveals he has been working for another Villain.
Another example is "[[Kid Icarus: Uprising]]" where after you defeat Medusa, credits roll but are quickly interrupted by Hades, the villain for the rest of the game.

In video games, it is difficult to use the false ending device effectively. Nevertheless, in the hands of a skilled designer, there are several methods that allow it to be done. In several video games, such as those with multiple playable characters and story lines, the game may appear to end after defeating a difficult boss, or clearing what appears to be the "Final" level, complete with credits, an [[Closing credits|outro]], and a return to the start screen. These endings are different from bad endings, as everything may appear to be resolved. However, fulfilling conditions such as clearing all the storylines, reloading the save file, or reaching the "ending" in a [[New Game+]] mode may give the player the option to continue on to the real ending.

An example of this is ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', and its sequel ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]''. In the former, while there are six stories to play, only the main character's, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character) | Sonic's]] is the most complete. The other characters' stories are simply side-stories. However, if "all" of the stories are completed, a final story appears that wraps up the game and acts as the "true" ending. In the latter, there are two stories to play, one for the heroes, and one for the villains. Of note is the plot device is hidden in a false [[Chaos Emerald]] being used that would destroy the space colony in which the villain [[Doctor Eggman]] is using as a base. It is at first implied that Eggman took the false Emerald, but in reality, when the last story is played, again, after the two normal stories are completed, a true conclusion is offered.

Another example could be the survival horror game ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', where, depending on your choice, you get to play with one of the two characters and get a certain ending for one of them to later discover, when you finish playing the second path with the second character, you fight the real final boss and the "true" ending (That may vary depending of which character you have chosen first) is shown. The main difference between both of the "true" endings are that places and times are exchanged, as well as the final dialogue from the game.

''The Consequence'', the second Kidman DLC for 2014's ''[[The Evil Within]]'', features a secret false ending in a similar manner to those shown in the ''Resident Evil'' franchise. At one point, Juli Kidman encounters the brain of the game's main antagonist, Ruben Victoriano, sealed [[Brain in a jar|inside a glass container]] hooked up to the STEM system in Beacon Hospital. Should the player choose to shoot the container and break it, the game cuts to black, then begins the credits sequence, cutting short on a postcard depicting Juli, Joseph and Sebastian on a postcard, before promptly returning to the game as Kidman exclaims "What the fuck?!", indicating the whole sequence was a hallucination.

==Music==
False endings are a known device in classical music. [[Josef Haydn]] was fond of them, for example inducing applause at the wrong place in the finales of his [[String Quartets, Op. 33 (Haydn)#Fourth_movement|String Quartet, Op. 33 No. 2]] (nicknamed "The Joke")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2009/may/29/haydn-playful-composer-tom-service |title=Haydn composed existential comedy |first=Tom |last=Service |authorlink=Tom Service |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=29 May 2009 |accessdate=19 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Symphony No. 90 (Haydn)|Symphony No. 90]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sarahhicksconductor.com/web/buzz_details.aspx?ItemId=554184 |title= Haydn’s Head Fake |date=16 May 2010 |first=Sarah |last=Hicks |authorlink=Sarah Hicks |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first movement of [[Prokoviev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] contains false endings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/composition/4176 |title=Symphony No. 1 in D major, Op. 25, "Classical" |first=Richard |last=Rodda |website=[[Kennedy Center]] |accessdate=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unsourced|section|date=February 2018}}
In music, a number of [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] [[song]]s use false endings in which the music is arranged so that the song appears to be coming to its ending (e.g., reaching a final [[Cadence (music)|cadence]] on the [[tonic (music)|chord of the home key]] and then stopping), but then the music recommences. Examples include [[The Rascals]]' "[[Good Lovin']]"; [[The Four Tops]]' "[[Bernadette (Four Tops song)|Bernadette]]", "[[White Room]]" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]]; "[[The Peace!]]" by [[Morning Musume]]; "[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]" by [[Led Zeppelin]]; "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]" by [[The Beatles]]; "[[Monday, Monday]]" by [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]; and "[[But You Know I Love You]]" by [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]]. Another notable example of a musical false ending is "[[(Everything I Do) I Do It for You]]" by [[Bryan Adams]] - because the original song was six and a half minutes long, the false ending became the end of the single/video edit of the song (the album version had a fadeout ending).

In addition, several other songs have also had false endings, such as "[[Angels (Amy Grant song)|Angels]]" by [[Amy Grant]], a #1 Christian hit in 1984. Another example is "[[Keep on Dancing (The Gentrys song)|Keep On Dancing]]", a 1965 Top 10 hit for the group [[The Gentrys]] from Memphis, Tennessee. In both songs, there is a pause of two seconds before the music starts all over again. Also, "[[When I Grow Up (To Be a Man)]]" by [[The Beach Boys]], has a sudden stop and resumes 1 second later as the band counts numbers of years of age until the song fades, counting from 19 to 30. The [[Alice in Chains]] track "Rain When I Die" has a fade-out false ending lasting about 20 seconds, then the music comes back, and then it fades once more, thus providing the real ending. "[[Weather with You]]" by [[Crowded House]] appears to be ending and then another small instrumental is followed by a final chorus.

'''Fame Kills: Starring Kanye West and Lady Gaga''' was a planned co-headlining [[concert tour]] by American rapper [[Kanye West]] and singer [[Lady Gaga]]. For the tour, which would have supported West's fourth album ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' (2008) and Gaga's ''[[The Fame Monster]]'' EP (2009), the pair conceived a production that would unite their different musical audiences. The tour was scheduled to run from November 2009 to January 2010, but was canceled after public controversy regarding [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards#Kanye West controversy and debated incidents|West's interruption]] of [[Taylor Swift]]'s Best Female Video speech at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]]. Shortly after the cancellation, Gaga embarked on her own tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]], while West took a break from his career.

==Background and development==
[[File:LadyGaga-EqualityMarch-Crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gaga only agreed to tour with West under the condition that everything "remain gay".]]
In June 2009, West announced on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' he would be touring with Gaga, but she would not perform as an opening act. "She's talented and so incredible that she's not an opening act", he said. "We're doing it together, with no opening act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West To Tour With Lady Gaga|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=June 9, 2009|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101210202610/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1613630/20090610/west_kanye.jhtml|archivedate=December 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, Gaga expressed her belief that the tour would be "one of the most groundbreaking moments in touring history."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1618664/20090813/lady_gaga.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga Promises 'Groundbreaking' Tour With Kanye West|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=August 13, 2009|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the singer agreed to collaborate with West, she demanded that the tour would remain accessible to her [[gay]] fans. "I'm gay", she recalled telling West in an interview with ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine, "my music is gay. My show is gay. And I love that it's gay. And I love my gay fans and they're all going to be coming to our show. And it's going to ''remain'' gay."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|title=The Lady Is a Vamp|last=Stein|first=Joshua David|author2=Michelson, Noah|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|publisher=Joe Landry|page=2|accessdate=September 11, 2011|date=August 9, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309102723/http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/08/09/lady-vamp|archivedate=March 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tour's stage was designed by Gaga and West as a [[wiktionary:traverse|traverse]]; "Instead of being on just one end of the arena, the stage traverses the entire arena", Gaga noted. "It's not really in-the-round; it's more of a runway." The concept of the tour was to feature the performers on opposite ends of the stage, with Gaga's end representing "home and humble beginnings" and West's end representing "the fame", with the two fighting for each other's positions throughout the show. West would perform his singles, Gaga would perform hers, and then the duo would perform several duets.&lt;ref name="Aswad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1622849/20091001/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West/ Lady Gaga's Fame Kills Tour Canceled|last=Aswad|first=Jem|author2=Dinh, James|date=October 1, 2009|publisher=MTV News.

Gaga said she enjoyed designing Fame Kills with West, calling themselves "creative kindreds."&lt;ref name="Groundbreaking"/&gt; She explained that they did not plan to tour for themselves, but rather for "everybody else"; the goal of the tour would have been to bring two different groups of fans and music enthusiasts together. "I make pop music and Kanye's fans love pop music because he has changed what [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] means", she said. "For me, the tour is more about just bringing people together and having a big dance party. The show is a celebration of creativity, art, fashion and choreography." She also noted that West showed her a lot during the creative planning of the show, such as one instance where Gaga wanted to put side panels on the stage that would have obstructed the view for some fans. "He was like, 'I'm not selling a ticket to a fan who can't see the show,' and he's right", she said.&lt;ref name="Aswad"/&gt;

A promotional video for the tour was released in September 2009. West posted the video on his blog accompanied by the text, "What happened to all the rock stars? The fame killed them!" The 30-second clip features slow-motion footage of a topless Gaga being carried by a man presumed to be West. Daniel Kreps from ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described it as "soft 70s porn", while adding that he had "no idea what [the text in the video] has to do with the 30-second clip, but we're sure it'll start to make more sense as more promos roll out as we approach the tour's launch."&lt;ref name="Kreps"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-gets-nsfw-in-promo-for-joint-tour-with-kanye-west-20090923|title=Lady Gaga Gets NSFW in Promo For Joint Tour With Kanye West|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=September 23, 2009|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014223017/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-the-monster-ball-lady-gaga-reveals-plans-for-ambitious-new-tour-20091021|archivedate=October 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|title=Nude Lady GaGa 'Fame Kills' tour promo released|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=July 31, 2014|work=[[NME]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304091358/http://www.nme.com/news/lady-gaga/47489|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kanyecolorconcert.jpg|thumb|West ''(pictured)'' was criticized for his interruption of [[Taylor Swift]]'s VMA speech. The incident reportedly put the fate of the Fame Kills tour in question.]]
Following singer [[Taylor Swift]]'s win for the music video "[[You Belong with Me]]" at the [[2009 MTV Video Music Awards]] for [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]], West stormed the stage, grabbed Swift's microphone, and declared that singer [[Beyoncé]] deserved the award for her "[[Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)]]" video. He declared, "Yo, Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'm going to let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time." West was profusely criticized from celebrities and fans alike over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|title=Kanye West interrupts Taylor Swift's VMAs moment: What was he thinking?|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|date=September 13, 2009|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5u4qjZcIO?url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/09/13/kanye-west-taylor-swift/|archivedate=November 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/09/14/kanye.west.reaction/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=Anger over West's disruption at MTV awards|last=France|first=Lisa Respers|date=September 14, 2009|publisher=[[CNN]]. [[Turner Broadcasting System]]|accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the interruption, the status of Fame Kills was rumored to be in question. A representative from a US urban radio station commented: "I think this could potentially affect his upcoming tour with Lady Gaga. This isn't an urban tour&amp;nbsp;— urban audiences can be a bit more forgiving than mainstream audiences are. I can see him going on stage and people booing him. It's unfortunate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|title=Will Kanye West's VMAs Outburst Hurt His Upcoming Tour?|last=Conception|first=Mariel|date=September 16, 2009|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=October 16, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716062129/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/touring/1265216/will-kanye-wests-vmas-outburst-hurt-his-upcoming-tour|archivedate=July 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a week after the ticket sales began, the tour was canceled but no reason was given.&lt;ref name="Canceled"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West Cancel 'Fame Kills' Tour|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 29, 2009|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202205432/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-west-cancel-fame-kills-tour-20091029|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various rumors circulated as to why the tour was canceled. It was suspected that it was canceled due to poor ticket sales, feuding between Gaga and West's management teams, and Gaga's desire to play in smaller venues. Gaga's choreographer, [[Laurieann Gibson]], said the tour was terminated due to "creative differences" between the singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|title=Lady Gaga, Kanye West's "Fame Kills" Tour Killed By Poor Sales?|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=October 2, 2010|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120109011526/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lady-gaga-kanye-wests-fame-kills-tour-killed-by-poor-sales-20091002|archivedate=January 9, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaga claimed that the cancellation was a mutual decision, and added that she would soon embark on her own headlining tour, [[The Monster Ball Tour]] in the coming weeks, while West would be taking a break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|title=Lady Gaga Speaks: Solo Tour Soon, Kanye Taking Time Off|last=Prince|first=David J.|author2=Concepcion, Mariel|date=October 2, 2009|work=Billboard|accessdate=September 11, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412053639/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267208/lady-gaga-speaks-solo-tour-soon-kanye-taking-time-off|archivedate=April 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, West claimed that Gaga had been solely responsible for canceling the tour following the MTV incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|title=Kanye West Talks Why His Joint Tour With Lady Gaga Was Canceled (Hint: Taylor Swift)|last=Lee|first=Christina|date=April 11, 2016|work=Idolator|accessdate=June 11, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616140319/http://www.idolator.com/7629558/kanye-west-talks-why-his-joint-tour-with-lady-gaga-was-canceled-hint-taylor-swift|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

GigMasters was founded in 1997 by New York area entrepreneurs Michael Caldwell and Kevin Kinyon. In February of that year, the company launched the first version of its website. In September 2010, GigMasters raised $200,000 in expansion funding from investor James Marciano.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 2013, about half of the company's booking were wedding-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/fading-glory-demand-elvis-impersonators-isnt-what-it-used-be "Fading glory: Demand for Elvis impersonators isn't what it used to be"]. ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'',  September 7, 2013.  by LAURA CARROLL&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, the company raised $1.3 million in series A funding by [[XO Group]], parent company of TheKnot.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digiday.com/media/bridal-publishers-tie-knot-content-commerce/ "Bridal publishers tie the knot between content and commerce"].

In September 2014, Inc. Magazine ranked GigMasters as one of the nation's 5000 fastest growing private companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inc.com/inc5000/list/2014/state/ct Top Companies in Connecticut on the 2014 Inc. 5000] ''INC'', 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, 2015, the Caldwell and Kinyon, creators of GigMasters, sold the company for $8.5 million to [[XO Group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/The-Knot-owner-buys-Norwalk-s-GigMasters-6550809.php "The Knot owner buys Norwalk‘s GigMasters"].

A '''hoax''' is a falsehood deliberately fabricated to masquerade as the truth. It is distinguishable from errors in observation or judgment,&lt;ref name=MacDougall_6&gt;{{cite book | title = Hoaxes | first = Curtis D. | last = MacDougall | isbn = 0-486-20465-0 | publisher = Dover | page = 6 | year = 1958 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[rumor]]s, [[urban legend]]s, [[pseudoscience]]s, and [[April Fools' Day]] events that are passed along in [[good faith]] by believers or as jokes.&lt;ref name=Brunvand_194&gt;{{cite book | title = Encyclopedia of Urban Legends | first = Jan H. | last = Brunvand | authorlink = Jan Harold Brunvand | isbn = 1-57607-076-X | page = 194 | publisher = W. W. Norton &amp; Company | year = 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of propaganda}} 
{{expand section|date=January 2017}}

Although [[practical joke]]s have likely existed for thousands of years, one of the earliest recorded hoaxes in history was the [[drummer of Tedworth]] in 1661.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WaT5XC9BptIC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=earliest%20historical%20recorded%20hoax&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X#v=onepage&amp;q=%22earliest%20known%20hoaxes%22&amp;f=false|title=Paranormal Nation: Why America Needs Ghosts, UFOs, and Bigfoot|first=Marc E.|last=Fitch|date=21 March 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The communication of hoaxes can be accomplished in almost any manner that a fictional story can be communicated:  in person, via [[word of mouth]], via words printed on paper, and so on.  As the [[communications technology|technology of communication]] has advanced, the speed at which hoaxes spread has also advanced:  a rumor about a ghostly drummer, spread by word of mouth, will impact a relatively small area at first, then grow gradually.  However, hoaxes could also be spread via [[chain letters]], which became easier as the cost of mailing a letter dropped.  The invention of the [[printing press]] in the 15th century brought down the cost of a mass-produced books and pamphlets, and the [[rotary printing press]] of the 19th century reduced the price even further (see [[yellow journalism]]).  During the 20th century, the hoax found a mass market in the form of [[supermarket tabloid]]s, and by the 21st century there were [[fake news website]]s which spread hoaxes via [[social networking]] websites (in addition to the use of email for a modern type of [[chain letter]]).

==Etymology==
The English [[philologist]] [[Robert Nares]] (1753–1829) says that the word ''hoax'' was coined in the late 18th century as a contraction of the verb ''[[wiktionary:hocus|hocus]]'', which means "to cheat," "to impose upon"&lt;ref name="Nares1822"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nares|first=Robert |title=A glossary; or, Collection of words ... which have been thought to require illustration, in the works of English authors|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjITAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=235|year=1822|publisher=R. Triphook|location=London|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; or (according to Merrian-Webster) "to befuddle often with drugged liquor."&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{cite web | title = Merriam-Webster Dictionary: Hocus | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hocus?show=0&amp;t=1288021817 | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | year = 2010 | accessdate = 25 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hocus'' is a shortening of the [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] [[incantation]] ''[[Hocus Pocus (magic)|hocus pocus]]'',&lt;ref name=MW/&gt; whose origin is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Hocus Pocus (magic)|Hocus Pocus]] article for more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2017}}

==Definition==
[[File:Candle in the Dark by Thomas Ady.gif|thumb|[[Thomas Ady]]'s ''A candle in the dark ...'' (1656) contains one of the earliest mentions of ''[[Hocus Pocus (magic)|hocus pocus]]'', the origin of the word ''hoax''.&lt;ref name=AHD&gt;{{cite book | title = More Word Histories and Mysteries: From Aardvark to Zombie | author = Editors of the American Heritage Dictionaries | page = 110 | isbn = 0-618-71681-5 | publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt | year = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Feejee mermaid.jpg|thumb|upright|[[P. T. Barnum]]'s [[Fiji mermaid]] (1842)]]

[[Robert Nares]] defined the word ''hoax'' as meaning "to cheat," dating from [[Thomas Ady]]'s 1656 book ''A candle in the dark, or a treatise on the nature of witches and [[witchcraft]]''.&lt;ref name="AHD"/&gt;

The term ''hoax'' is occasionally used in reference to urban legends and rumors, but the [[folklorist]] [[Jan Harold Brunvand]] argues that most of them lack evidence of deliberate creations of falsehood and are passed along in good faith by believers or as jokes, so the term should be used for only those with a probable conscious attempt to deceive.&lt;ref name=Brunvand_194/&gt; As for the closely related terms ''[[practical joke]]'' and ''prank'', Brunvand states that although there are instances where they overlap, ''hoax'' tends to indicate "relatively complex and large-scale fabrications" and includes deceptions that go beyond the merely playful and "cause material loss or harm to the victim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = American Folklore: An Encyclopedia | first = Jan H. | last = Brunvand | authorlink = Jan Harold Brunvand | isbn = 0-8153-3350-1 | page = 587 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Professor Lynda Walsh of the [[University of Nevada, Reno]], some hoaxes—such as the [[Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814]], labeled as a hoax by contemporary commentators—are financial in nature, and successful hoaxers—such as [[P. T. Barnum]], whose [[Fiji mermaid]] contributed to his wealth—often acquire monetary gain or fame through their fabrications, so the distinction between ''hoax'' and ''[[fraud]]'' is not necessarily clear.&lt;ref name=Walsh_24&gt;{{cite book | title = Sins Against Science: The Scientific Media Hoaxes of Poe, Twain, And Others | first = Lynda | last = Walsh | publisher = State University of New York Press | isbn = 0-7914-6877-1 | pages = 24–25 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alex Boese, the creator of the [[Museum of Hoaxes]], states that the only distinction between them is the reaction of the public, because a fraud can be classified as a hoax when its method of acquiring financial gain creates a broad public impact or captures the imagination of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What Is A Hoax? | first = Alex | last = Boese | year = 2008 | url = http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/What_is_a_hoax/ | accessdate = 25 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest recorded media hoaxes is a fake [[almanac]] published by [[Jonathan Swift]] under the pseudonym of [[Isaac Bickerstaff]] in 1708.&lt;ref name=Walsh_17&gt;{{cite book | title = Sins Against Science: The Scientific Media Hoaxes of Poe, Twain, And Others | first = Lynda | last = Walsh | publisher = State University of New York Press | isbn = 0-7914-6877-1 | pages = 17–18 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swift predicted the death of [[John Partridge (astrologer)|John Partridge]], one of the leading astrologers in England at that time, in the almanac and later issued an [[elegy]] on the day Partridge was supposed to have died. Partridge's reputation was damaged as a result and his astrological almanac was not published for the next six years.&lt;ref name=Walsh_17/&gt;

It is possible to perpetrate a hoax by making only true statements using unfamiliar wording or context, such as in the [[Dihydrogen monoxide hoax]]. Political hoaxes are sometimes motivated by the desire to ridicule or besmirch opposing politicians or [[political institution]]s, often before elections.

A hoax differs from a [[magic (illusion)|magic]] trick or from [[fiction]] (books, [[movies]], [[theatre]], [[radio]], [[television]], etc.) in that the audience is unaware of being deceived, whereas in watching a magician perform an illusion the audience expects to be tricked.

A hoax is often intended as a practical joke or to cause embarrassment, or to provoke social or political change by raising people's awareness of something. It can also emerge from a marketing or advertising purpose. For example, to market a [[romantic comedy]] movie, a director staged a phony "incident" during a supposed [[wedding]], which showed a bride and preacher getting knocked into a pool by a clumsy fall from a best man.&lt;ref name=twsMarE28/&gt; A resulting video clip of ''Chloe and Keith's Wedding'' was uploaded to [[YouTube]] and was viewed by over 30 million people and the couple was interviewed by numerous talk shows.&lt;ref name=twsMarE28/&gt; Viewers were deluded into thinking that it was an authentic clip of a real accident at a real wedding; but a story in ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2009 revealed it was a hoax.&lt;ref name=twsMarE28&gt;{{cite news
 |author= Oldenburg, Ann

Governments sometimes spread false information to facilitate their objectives, such as going to war.  These often come under the heading of black propaganda. There is often a mixture of outright hoax and [[Censorship|suppression and management of information]] to give the desired impression. In wartime and times of international tension rumors abound, some of which may be deliberate hoaxes.

Examples of politics-related hoaxes:
* [[Belgium]] is a country with a [[Flemish]]-speaking region and a [[French language|French]]-speaking region. In 2006 French-speaking television channel [[RTBF]] interrupted programming with [[Flemish Secession hoax|a spoof report]] claiming that the country had split in two and the [[Monarchy of Belgium|royal family]] had fled.
* On Saturday 13 March 2010 the [[Imedi]] television station in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] broadcast [[Imedi Media Holding#2010 Russian invasion hoax|a false announcement]] that [[Russia]] had invaded Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Ivan|title=Fake Russian invasion broadcast sparks Georgian panic|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/03/14/georgia.invasion.scare/|accessdate=12 December 2016|publisher=CNN|date=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Peter Hancock has identified six steps which characterise a truly successful hoax:&lt;ref name=hancock15&gt;{{cite book | title = Hoax Springs Eternal: The Psychology of Cognitive Deception | first = Peter | last = Hancock | publisher = Cambridge U.P. | isbn = 9781107417687 | pages = 182–195 | year = 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identify a constituency- a person or group of people who, for reasons such as piety or patriotism, or greed, will truly care about your creation.
* Identify a particular dream which will make your hoax appeal to your constituency.
* Create an appealing but "under-specified" hoax, with ambiguities
* Have your creation discovered.
* Find at least one champion who will actively support your hoax.
* Make people care, either positively or negatively – the ambiguities encourage interest and debate

Hoaxes vary widely in their processes of creation, propagation, and entrenchment over time. Examples include:
*[[List of scholarly publishing hoaxes|Academic hoaxes]]
*[[List of religious hoaxes|Religious hoaxes]]
*Hoaxes perpetrated on occasions when their initiation is considered socially appropriate, such as [[April Fools' Day]]
*Criminal Hoaxing, such as the case of John Samuel Humble, aka [[Wearside Jack]]. Criminal hoaxing diverts time and money of police investigations with communications purporting to come from the actual criminal. Once caught, hoaxers are charged under criminal codes such as [[Perverting the course of justice]].
*Anthropologists were taken in by the "[[Piltdown Man]] discovery" that was widely believed from 1913 to 1953
*[[Apocryphal]] claims that originate as a hoax gain widespread belief among members of a culture or organization, become entrenched as persons who believe it repeat it in [[good faith]] to others, and continue to command that belief after the hoax's originators have died or departed
*Hoaxes formed by making minor or gradually increasing changes to a warning or other claim widely circulated for legitimate purposes
*Hoaxes perpetrated by "scare tactics" appealing to the audience's subjectively rational belief that the expected cost of not believing the hoax (the cost if its assertions are true times the likelihood of their truth) outweighs the expected cost of believing the hoax (cost if false times likelihood of falsity), such as claims that a non-malicious but unfamiliar program on one's computer is [[malware]]
*Some [[urban legend]]s and rumors with a probable conscious attempt to deceive&lt;ref name=Brunvand_194/&gt;
*[[Humbug]]s
*Computer [[virus hoax]]es became widespread as [[Computer virus|viruses]] themselves began to spread. A typical hoax is an [[email]] message warning recipients of a non-existent threat, usually forging quotes supposedly from authorities such as [[Microsoft]] and [[IBM]]. In most cases the [[payload (software)|payload]] is an exhortation to distribute the message to everyone in the recipient's [[Software address book|address book]]. Thus the e-mail "warning" is itself the "virus." Sometimes the hoax is more harmful, e.g., telling the recipient to seek a particular [[computer file|file]] (usually in a [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]); if the file is found, the computer is deemed to be infected unless it is deleted. In reality the file is one required by the operating system for correct functioning of the computer.
*[[Internet]] hoaxes became more common after the start of [[social media]]. Some websites have been used to hoax millions of people on the Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/09/24/how-serial-hoaxers-duped-the-internet-with-fake-4chan-threats-against-emma-watson/ |title=How serial hoaxers duped the Internet |publisher=Washington Post |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A [[List of hoaxes#Proven hoaxes of exposure|hoax of exposure]] is a semi-comical or private [[sting operation]]. It usually encourages people to act foolishly or credulously by falling for patent nonsense that the hoaxer deliberately presents as reality. A related activity is [[culture jamming]].
*Art-world hoaxes:
**The "Bruno Hat" art hoax, arranged in [[London]] in July 1929, involved staging a convincing public exhibition of [[paintings]] by an imaginary reclusive artist, Bruno Hat. All the perpetrators were well-educated and did not intend a fraud, as the newspapers were informed the next day. Those involved included [[Brian Howard (poet)|Brian Howard]], [[Evelyn Waugh]], [[Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne|Bryan Guinness]], [[John Banting]] and [[Thomas David Freeman-Mitford|Tom Mitford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leicestergalleries.com/19th-20th-century-paintings/d/still-life-with-pears/10464 |title=Leicester Galleries website on '&amp;#39;Bruno Hat'&amp;#39;, accessed 28th May 2011 |publisher=Leicestergalleries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** ''[[Nat Tate: An American Artist 1928-1960]]'': a 1998 art world hoax, by [[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]]
** [[Disumbrationism]]: a modern art hoax
** [[Pierre Brassau]]: exposing art critics to "modern paintings" made by a chimpanzee
** ''[[Spectra (book)|Spectra: A Book of Poetic Experiments]]'': a modernist poetry hoax
** [[Ern Malley]], the popular but fictitious [[Australian]] poet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5810">The term '''international crisis''' is widespread term without a single common definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Acuto|first=Michele|title=Diplomats in Crisis|journal=Diplomacy &amp; Statecraft|date=7 September 2011|volume=online|doi=10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09592296.2011.599661|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To some, it involves "a sequence of interactions between the governments of two or more sovereign states in severe conflict, short of actual war, but involving the perception of a dangerously high probability of [[war]]".&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Glenn H. and Diesing, Paul: 1977. Conflict Among Nations: Bargaining, Decision Making and System Structure in International Crises. defines an international crisis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Lebow gives a breakdown of three types of international crises:
* '''Justification of Hostilities'''.&lt;ref&gt;Lebow, Richard N.:1981. Between Peace and War: The Nature of International Crisis.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the nations decides, before the crisis starts, to go to [[war]] and constructs a crisis to justify it. The pattern of justification is almost always the same: Rouse public opinion, make impossible demands, try to legitimize the demands, deny your real intentions then employ the rejection of the demands as a reason for war. A recent example, commonly employed by [[Public image of George W. Bush|critics of George W. Bush]], is the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]], which precipitated the [[Iraq War]].
* '''Spinoff Crisis'''. The nations are involved in a war or crisis with another nation or nations and this precipitates another crisis, e.g. the [[RMS Lusitania|Lusitania]] incident in 1915.
* '''Brinkmanship'''. Intentionally forcing a crisis to get the other side to back down. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962 is a well-known example of [[brinkmanship]].

With the exception of a justification of hostilities, the study of international crises assumes that neither side actually wants to go to war, but must be visibly prepared to do so. In the words of [[Groucho Marx]], "Always be sincere, even if you don't mean it".

==Strategies==
George's book presents an overview of the process and conflicting goals of [[crisis management]] as well as many examples.&lt;ref&gt;George, Alexander L (ed): 1991. Avoiding War: Problems of Crisis Management.&lt;/ref&gt; He discusses a number of strategies, including:

===Offensive strategies===
*[[blackmail]]
*limited and reversible response
*controlled pressure
*[[attrition warfare|attrition]]
*[[fait accompli]]

===Defensive strategies===
*[[coercion]]
*limited [[conflict escalation|escalation]]
*[[tit-for-tat]]
*test of capabilities
*"drawing a line"
* Buying time strategy
* Conveying commitment and resolve to avoid miscalculation by the adversary

==List of defused crises==
International crises tend to result in war, almost by definition; they are then remembered best not as crises but as [[Casus belli|causes of wars]]. For information on international crises that resulted immediately in war, see [[List of wars]].
&lt;!-- 2008 South Ossetia war (C[ommonly]K[nown]A[s] Russo-Georgian war) belongs to aforementioned [[list of wars]] (or, more precisely, to [[List of wars 2003–10]]) rather than to "ongoing crises" below --&gt;
Given the above, some of the crises that are best-known ''as crises'' were defused. The following crises did not immediately provoke large-scale violence, but set of anger in countries:

* [[War in sight crisis]] (1875)
* [[Anglo-Portuguese Crisis]] (1889–1890)
* [[Venezuelan crisis of 1895]], between Venezuela and the United Kingdom
* [[Fashoda Incident]] (1898–1899)
*[[Venezuelan crisis of 1902–03]], between Venezuela and Britain, Germany and Italy
* [[First Moroccan Crisis]] (1904–1906)
*[[Dutch–Venezuelan crisis of 1908]], between Venezuela and the Netherlands
* [[Bosnian crisis]] (1908–1909)
* [[Agadir Crisis]] (1911)
* [[Åland crisis]] (1916–1920)
* [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]] (1936)
* [[Anschluss]] (1938)
* [[May Crisis 1938|May Crisis]] (1938)
* [[Munich Agreement|Sudetenland Crisis]] (1938)
* [[Iran crisis of 1946|Iran crisis]] (1946–1947)
* [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948–1949)
* [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962)
* [[USS Pueblo (AGER-2)|''Pueblo'' incident]] (1968)

An '''international incident''' is a seemingly relatively small or limited action or clash that results in a wider dispute between two or more [[nation-states]]. International incidents can arise from unanticipated actions involving citizens, government officials, or armed units of one or more nation-states, or out of a deliberate but small provocative action by [[espionage]] agents of one nation-state, or by [[terrorists]], against another nation-state.

An international incident usually arises during a time of relative [[peace]] between nation-states, and in general is, on the surface, an unexpected event. Conflicts that grow out of a series of escalating [[skirmish]]es between nation-states generally are not considered international incidents; however, [[terrorist]] actions can and often do become international incidents. However, historical views of past international incidents often reveal the incident was the flashpoint of a simmering conflict between nation-states, or organizations opposing nation-states.

Wars have often been provoked by international incidents, and [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] efforts to prevent international incidents from growing into full-scale armed conflicts often have been unsuccessful. In the aftermath of the [[First World War]], the [[League of Nations]] was established to help nations who were parties to an international incident achieve a solution to the incident through diplomatic means. Initially, the League of Nations had some success in working to find diplomatic solutions, however the failure of the League of Nations to prevent [[World War II]] resulted in the disbandment of the League of Nations in favor of the [[United Nations]]. As with its predecessor, the United Nations provides a means by which nations involved in an international incident can work to resolve the matter diplomatically rather than through the use of force.

The term is also applied to various incidents that can disrupt international [[commerce]], and to [[celebrities]] or other well-known people who commit [[gaffe]]s or otherwise act inappropriately, causing the [[Mass media|press]] and sometimes governments to criticize their actions.

The [[International Court of Justice]] keeps a list of legal disputes between nation-states, many of which result from international incidents. The [[Royal Mail]] of the [[United Kingdom]] keeps a list on its website of current international incidents that might disrupt mail service.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmail.com/service-update/international Royal Mail – International Incident Bulletin].

The campaign resulted in a resolution by the [[United States Senate]] and contributed to the decision to send troops by the [[African Union]]. The film also called for an April 20 world wide canvassing campaign, called "Cover the Night". On April 5, 2012, Invisible Children released a follow-up video, titled ''[[#Kony 2012 Part II|Kony 2012: Part II&amp;nbsp;– Beyond Famous]]'', which failed to repeat the success of the original.

==''Kony 2012''==
The film documents the [[Invisible Children, Inc.|Invisible Children]]'s plans and efforts to capture [[Joseph Kony]].

==Invisible Children==
The Invisible Children charity has focused on obtaining the support of a select group of individuals in order to "help bring awareness to the abuse and killing of children in the [[East Africa|East]] and Central African countries at the hands of Kony and his leadership."

As part of the campaign, American supporters were asked to put up posters in their hometowns in an action named "Cover the Night", which took place on April 20, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Harris in New York |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/13/kony-2012-invisble-children-day-of-action |title=Kony 2012 organisers plan massive day of action across US cities |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |date=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invisible Children website offers posters and T-shirts in an attempt to gain wider recognition. They also created action kits to help spread awareness that include campaign buttons, posters, bracelets and stickers.&lt;ref name="Lees0307"/&gt;

The "Cover the Night" event took place worldwide on April 20, 2012, and was to be conducted by supporters who were encouraged to perform some sort of charity work that morning in their local community. Then, that evening, they were to post flyers and posters throughout their city for the Kony 2012 campaign. The turnout for the event worldwide was much smaller than initially expected, with no organized spots officially announced and much fewer people attending than had pledged to attend. A tweet from Invisible Children stated, "There is no official meet-up as we are asking people to act locally with friends+family {{sic}} in their neighborhoods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Catch Kony campaign loses couch potatoes |author=Nick Miller |url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/catch-kony-campaign-loses-couch-potatoes-20120421-1xdqc.html |newspaper=The Age |date=April 22, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One gathering in [[Vancouver]] had only 17 people; another in [[Brisbane]] had fewer than 50 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 campaign fails to go offline in Vancouver |author=Mike Hager |url=http://www.globaltvbc.com/kony+2012+campaign+fails+to+go+offline+in+vancouver/6442625789/story.html |newspaper=[[Global BC]] |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=KONY 2012's struggle to remain visible |author=Chris Paine |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/kony-2012-how-the-phenomenon-faded/story-e6freuzr-1226334893369 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kelowna]], [[British Columbia]], several signs and posters were put up, including two large banners that were "placed on both sides of the pedestrian overpass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kelowna makes Kony famous|url=http://www.kelownacapnews.com/news/148386225.html |newspaper=Kelowna Capital News |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canberra]], several [[Facebook]] groups resulted in a few gatherings of two or three people each; [[Pierre Johannessen]], a "law firm partner who runs a charity for disadvantaged children", distributed around 3,000 posters to the groups to be put up throughout the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 poster boy for Civic unrest |author=Douglas Fry |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/kony-2012-poster-boy-for-civic-unrest-20120421-1xebl.html |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |date=April 22, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], 200 posters were put up by "college students and other people in their teens and 20s", along with a number of chalk and stencil messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 supporters 'cover the night' in downtown Phoenix |url=http://downtowndevil.com/2012/04/21/26874/kony-2012-phoenix-uganda/ |newspaper=Downtown Devil |date=April 21, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear left}}

The film sparked a heated controversy regarding its merits, with very differing opinions being expressed by various [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] workers, government and international officials, journalists, and other groups and individuals.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/efforts-arrest-joseph-kony-must-respect-human-rights-2012-03-08 |title=Efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights |publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=WTF Was Kony 2012?

=== Social Media Response ===
After the video was released, various social media outlets went into a frenzy and exploded the Kony 2012 movement into the world-wide news.  The video, directed by [[Jason Russell]], began to generate a tremendous amount of social media attention.  After being the quickest video to reach 100 million views within 6 days,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kony 2012 took over social media with hashtags like #Kony2012. The social media impact was so relevant that, on March 6 and 7, more people were talking about Kony 2012 through Facebook posts than the newly released Apple iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.notothequo.com/kony-2012-social-media-case-study-stats-and-insights/|title=Kony 2012 Social Media Case Study {{!}} Stats and Insights - N2Q Consulting|date=2012-03-08|work=N2Q Consulting|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with [[Facebook]], nearly 66% of Twitter conversations during March 5&amp;nbsp;– March 12 were about the Anti-Kony movement.  Social media outlets, such as Facebook, were responsible for informing 27% of young adults of the Kony 2012 video, compared to 10% who learned about it through other traditional platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2012/03/15/the-viral-kony-2012-video/|title=The Viral Kony 2012 Video|date=2012-03-15|work=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Kony 2012 made a significant impact throughout social media platforms. During that short period of time, it became YouTube's number one video of reaching a certain number of views within a short period of time, along with over 5 million related tweets occurring over just a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media/Files/Reports/2012/The_Viral_Kony_2012_Video.pdf|title=The Viral Kony 2012 Video|last=Rainie|first=Lee|date=|website=Pew Research|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2012 Kony cumulative video views.png|thumb|Cumulative views on YouTube, showing a lower, though steady, view growth rate after its first ten days.&lt;ref name=WaybackKony/&gt;]]
In under a week, the video created by Invisible Children, Kony 2012 had been viewed over 100 million times.&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"&gt;http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/12/kony-2012-documentary-becomes-most-viral-video-in-history/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine credits Invisible Children's strong base of followers on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Unlike other videos that accidentally "go viral", Kony 2012 was created to elicit emotional responses and encourage viewers to share the footage and spread the hashtag. This attracted the attention of celebrities like [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Rihanna]], [[Bill Gates]], [[Ryan Seacrest]], [[Justin Bieber]], and [[Kim Kardashian-West]].&lt;ref name="newsfeed.time.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;https://www.npr.org/2014/06/14/321853244/the-kony-2012-effect-recovering-from-a-viral-sensation&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the video's popularity, not all interactions were positive. But the more criticism the video drew, the more people watched it and shared it so that they could be a part of the conversation. Their Public Relations team was not ready for the over night fame and failed to control the narrative of the fall out.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

Forbes gives a breakdown of 12 reasons why the video went so viral. They cite that the video invoked positive feelings, grabbed viewers attention, made it personal, referenced mainstream media, pulled on the heartstrings, conveyed immediacy, made it simple, made it real, gave it a scale, used celebrities, created events, and made it easy to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2012/03/09/12-lessons-from-kony-2012-from-social-media-power-users/#45f979dd4328&lt;/ref&gt; These 12 basic tactics affected viewers so much so that the Kony 2012 campaign sold out of merchandise when their two interns could not keep up with the hundreds of thousands of action kits supporters could buy. Jason Russel told Business Insider, "We sourced every single red T-shirt in the entire US. There were no more to buy."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/the-guy-behind-the-kony-2012-video-finally-explains-how-everything-went-so-weird-2013-3?page=2&lt;/ref&gt; The google trends for searches like "Joseph Kony" and "Kony 2012" all show flatlines until the video was released where the spike reaches all the way to 100%.&lt;ref&gt;https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=Kony%202012&lt;/ref&gt; Before Invisible Children released the video, Joseph Kony and the LRA were mostly unknown to America and the rest of the world.

[[Human Rights Watch]] (HRW)'s Africa division senior researcher [[Anneke Van Woudenberg]] wrote in a statement: "We've spent years investigating the horrors perpetrated by the LRA in central Africa—Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, [[Central African Republic]] (CAR), and South Sudan. We gathered evidence at massacre sites—wooden clubs covered in dried blood, rubber strips from bicycle tires used to tie up the victims, and freshly dug graves—and spoke to hundreds of boys and girls forced to fight for his army or held captive as [[sexual slavery|sex slaves]]. And we're elated that #stopKony is a trending topic on [[Twitter]]—if anyone deserves global notoriety it's Kony." She added: "Arresting Kony and other senior LRA leaders would reaffirm that those who commit mass atrocities will face justice. It will also help end the scourge of one of the most brutal rebel groups in Africa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/03/09/how-catch-joseph-kony |title=How to Catch Joseph Kony &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; HRW's LRA researcher Ida Sawyer reaffirmed, "we definitely support the message of the film and we think it's great that they're bringing so much attention to the film with Kony's crimes and the phenomena of the LRA."&lt;ref name=real&gt;{{cite news|author1=Polly Curtis |author2=Tom McCarthy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check-with-polly-curtis/2012/mar/08/kony-2012-what-s-the-story#block-14 |title=Kony 2012: what's the real story? |work=The Guardian |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |date=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]], which had documented what it described as the LRA's "horrific impact on the lives of thousands of civilians in Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Uganda" and for years had been calling for the LRA leaders to be arrested, welcomed the massive public response to the Kony 2012 campaign. Erwin van der Borght, the organization's Africa director, wrote in a statement: "Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest for far too long and this campaign is a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial," but added: "Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect [[human rights]]", especially because "many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment", and ensure the protection of civilians.&lt;ref name="Amnesty International"/&gt;

Opinions on the film were mixed in [[Gulu]], one of former centers of rebel activities in northern Uganda, during a showing of the film, with several of the leaders expressing support and criticism. One of the attendees, State Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Henry Oryem Okello]], said that the criticisms directed at the film and Invisible Children were "unfounded", going on to state, "Invisible Children has done visible things in [[Acholi]][land], for example offering scholarships to thousands of children and anyone against them is our enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 video divides opinion in Gulu |author1=Sam Lawino |author2=Moses Akena |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/1369072/-/ax98g6z/-/ |newspaper=Saturday Monitor |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Betty Bigombe]], a Ugandan cabinet minister and former peace negotiator, said, "I do not know whether it makes any difference as far as taking [Kony] out is concerned.

Journalist [[Nicholas D.

He also said that complexity had long been "a leading excuse for inaction during atrocities" and that Kony remains a threat in Uganda's neighbour countries, so the simplicity of the film "has left the American public more informed" than it would be otherwise, and that if he "were a Congolese villager", he would "welcome these uncertain efforts over the sneering scorn of do-nothing armchair cynics."&lt;ref name=Kristof&gt;{{cite news |title=Viral Video, Vicious Warlord |author=[[Nicholas D.

Mikaela Luttrell-Rowland from [[Clark University]]'s Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies stated that it was "irresponsible to prize feel good, simplistic messages over complex history and to treat [[consumerism|consumerist]]-consciousness raising as interchangeable with education."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mikaela-luttrellrowland/consumerism-trumps-educat_b_1337067.html Consumerism Trumps Education: The Kony 2012 Campaign], ''Huffington Post'', November 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Africa researcher [[Alex de Waal]] accused the film of "peddling dangerous and patronizing falsehoods," criticized the campaign as "naive" for "elevating Kony to a global celebrity, the embodiment of evil," that might only help him as a terrorist and cult leader, and called for instead "demystifying Kony—reducing him to a common criminal and a failed provincial politician."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.tufts.edu/reinventingpeace/2012/03/10/dont-elevate-kony/ |title=Don't Elevate Kony &amp;#124; Reinventing Peace |publisher=Sites.tufts.edu |date=March 10, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One point of criticism is that the film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only in the hundreds, and Kony himself was believed to be in the Central African Republic rather than Uganda—a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video.&lt;ref name="Keating20120307"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/03/07/guest_post_joseph_kony_is_not_in_uganda_and_other_complicated_things |title=Guest post: Joseph Kony is not in Uganda (and other complicated things) |accessdate=March 8, 2012|date=March 7, 2012|work=Foreign Policy|author=Keating, Joshua}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem raised questions about the plausibility of Ugandan army intervention, which the video advocates. Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the Ugandan army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of the other countries where the LRA is active.&lt;ref name=infamous&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/08/148239201/joseph-kony-is-now-a-star-but-will-he-be-caught | title=Joseph Kony is Infamous&amp;nbsp;– But will he be caught? | publisher=NPR | accessdate=March 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dinaw Mengestu]], an [[Ethiopian American]] writer and Africa researcher, wrote that the real world Kony is "not a click away", and a simple solution of raising popular awareness, "a beautiful equation that can only work so long as we believe that nothing in the world happens unless we know about it&amp;nbsp;... only works in the [[Myopia|myopic]] reality of the film, a reality that deliberately eschews depth and complexity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warscapes.com/reportage/not-click-away-joseph-kony-real-world |title=Not a Click Away: Joseph Kony in the Real World |publisher=Warscapes |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Amanda Weisbaum of the charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] said that "just getting rid of one person does not solve the problem" and the film's focus should have been rather on helping ex-child soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/blogs/technotalk/not-enough-focus-on-child-soldiers-lives-in-kony-2012-war-child/ |title=Not enough focus on child soldiers’ lives in "Kony 2012" -War Child&amp;nbsp;– AlertNet |publisher=Trust.org |date=April 4, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705072012/http://www.trust.org/alertnet/blogs/technotalk/not-enough-focus-on-child-soldiers-lives-in-kony-2012-war-child |archivedate=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Goddard, president and CEO of [[ChildFund|ChildFund International]], wrote that "by narrowing the focus on Kony, by defining success so singularly, it gives people a greater sense that the issue [of globally widespread conscription of young children] can be resolved.

After the film's release, there was criticism in Uganda of its failure to state more clearly that Kony and his forces fled northern Uganda in 2006 and were dispersed across the jungles of three neighbouring countries. Fred Opolot, spokesman for the Ugandan government, said, "It is totally misleading to suggest that the war is still in Uganda."&lt;ref name="pflanz"/&gt; Arthur Larok, [[ActionAid]]'s director in Uganda, said, "It doesn't sound like a fair representation of Uganda.

A March 2012 mass showing of the film in [[Lira, Uganda|Lira]], the site of one of Kony's worst atrocities in Uganda, was met with jeering and thrown objects at the screen and at the group African Youth Initiative Network, which screened the film and provided translations.

On March 8, 2012, Invisible Children released an official response addressing the criticisms directed at ''Kony 2012''. As an explanation for the simplicity of the movie, they stated that "in [their] quest to garner wide public support of nuanced policy, [they] sought to explain the conflict in an easily understandable format." Jedidiah Jenkins, the director of idea development for Invisible Children, responded to the new criticisms by saying that they were "myopic" and that the video itself was a "tipping point" that "got young people to care about an issue on the other side of the planet that doesn't affect them."&lt;ref name="Post1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Invisible Children responds to criticism about 'Stop Kony' campaign |author=Elizabeth Flock |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/invisible-childrens-stop-kony-campaign/2012/03/07/gIQA7B31wR_blog.html?wprss=blogpost |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to concerns about working with the Ugandan government, Invisible Children explained that they "do not defend any of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Ugandan government or the Ugandan army". They added that the reason why they are working with the Ugandan army even though Kony is no longer in Uganda is that the army is "more organized and better equipped than that of any of the other affected countries (DRC, South Sudan, CAR) to track down Joseph Kony" and that they want all of the governments in the region to work together to arrest Kony.&lt;ref name="Invisible Children Website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Invisible Children Critiques |url=http://www.invisiblechildren.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/critiques.html |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308102109/http://www.invisiblechildren.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/critiques.html |archivedate=March 8, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins stated, "There is a huge problem with [[political corruption]] in Africa.

A video titled ''Thank you, KONY 2012 Supporters'' was released on March 12, 2012 to address the criticisms directed at the film and to be "fully transparent", according to Invisible Children CEO Ben Keesey. The film begins with Keesey discussing the three things that the charity focuses on, which are to "create films with compelling narratives, promote international advocacy and run on-the-ground initiatives." He also points out that "overhead and travel costs are essential to those efforts", as a part of the group's management expenses, along with going toward "thousands of free screenings of the group's films worldwide, as well as toward bringing survivors of the Lord's Resistance Army&amp;nbsp;... to speak at these events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Invisible Children Releases New Video in Response to ‘Kony 2012’ Criticism |author=Samantha Grossman |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/03/12/invisible-children-releases-new-video-in-response-to-kony-2012-criticism/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=March 12, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keesey explains the way the charity's annual expenditures are made, with "80.5 percent to 85.7 percent of total annual spending from fiscal 2007 to 2011" going toward {{"'}}program expenses'—money that directly benefits their cause",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Kony 2012: Invisible Children release new film responding to criticism |author=[[Staff writer]] |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/joseph-kony/9139970/Joseph-Kony-2012-Invisible-Children-release-new-film-responding-to-criticism.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=March 13, 2012 |accessdate=March 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finished by urging interested parties to make inquires to the group via [[Twitter]], using the account @invisible and hashtag #AskICAnything.

The website Kickstriker, a parody of [[Kickstarter]], contains a fake appeal to crowdsource the "hiring private military contractors from [[Academi]] (formerly Blackwater), who will be immediately deployed to central Africa" with a mission to capture or kill Kony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kickstriker.com/kony |title=Capture Kony: Bring Joseph Kony to Justice |publisher=Kickstriker |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Invisible Children sent the Kickstriker team a [[cease and desist]] warning to take down the parody page, accusing them of "causing public confusion through your use of Invisible Children's copyrighted and trademarked property" and threatening a legal action.

===Reception===
In a pre-release comment, [[popular culture]] expert [[Robert Thompson (professor)|Robert Thompson]] said: "The fact is, the story has developed in so many odd ways with all the controversy, and the sequel can't really promise the bang of that first video—which is informing people of something they did not know before. Now we're getting into the details, which is never that thrilling."&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite news|author=Julie Watson Associated Press |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1156866--kony-2012-new-video-on-african-warlord-tackles-criticisms-fired-at-invisible-children |title=Kony 2012: New video on African warlord tackles criticisms fired at Invisible Children&amp;nbsp;– |work=Toronto Star |date=April 5, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LRA researcher Craig Valters of the LSE's department of International Development said that the second video "overwhelmingly" failed to answer criticisms raised by the first film.&lt;ref name=sequel/&gt; On the other hand, Mike Pflanz, East Africa correspondent for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', said that the sequel was "a more solid, moving and, finally, accurate presentation of the ongoing battle to capture Joseph Kony" and that, in comparison to the original video, the "new video is couched in nuance and deploys dialogue more commonly heard in a United Nations workshop&amp;nbsp;– displacement, rehabilitation, post-conflict&amp;nbsp;– than in a YouTube smash."&lt;ref name=part2&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony2012: Part II more solid, moving and accurate presentation than first film |author=Mike Pflanz |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/joseph-kony/9188955/Kony2012-Part-II-more-solid-moving-and-accurate-presentation-than-first-film.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=April 5, 2012 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the sequel "does not seem to have captured the public's imagination in quite the same way as Invisible Children's earlier video did, failing to significantly trend on social media websites."&lt;ref name=sequel/&gt; By April 16, 2012, it had received 1.7 million views in 11 days, less than 2% of what the first video had in its first five days. Matt Fiorentino, director of marketing at video measurement firm Visible Measures, considered the first campaign a never-seen-before anomaly, and despite being dwarfed by its predecessor, the number of views ''Beyond Famous'' received was "pretty good" when compared to a regular social campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Todd Wasserman|url=http://mashable.com/2012/04/16/kony-sequel-traffic/ |title=KONY Sequel Got 2% of the Traffic of Its Predecessor |publisher=Mashable.com |date=April 16, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' nevertheless described ''Beyond Famous'' as "one of the top 25 non-profit campaigns ever."&lt;ref name=numbers&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012 in numbers |author=Antonia Kanczula |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/apr/20/kony-2012-facts-numbers?newsfeed=true |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=April 20, 2012 |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

===United States===
On March 21, 2012, a resolution "condemning Joseph Kony and his ruthless guerrilla group for a 26-year campaign of terror" was put forward by [[United States Senate|Senators]] [[Jim Inhofe]] and [[Chris Coons]]. The resolution stated that it would back "the effort of Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and the newest country, South Sudan, to stop Kony and his Lord's Resistance Army", along with an official statement of support "for the U.S. effort to help regional forces pursue commanders of the militia group." Overall, the resolution received support from 34 senators, both [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate pushes measure condemning Kony |author=Donna Cassata |url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2012/03/21/senate_pushes_measure_condemning_kony/|date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 2, 2015 |work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Politico"&gt;{{cite news |title=Joseph Kony captures Congress' attention |author=Scott Wong |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74355.html |newspaper=[[Politico]] |date=March 22, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Support among senators for the resolution came about after the release of the ''Kony 2012'' video and its subsequent popularity. One of the resolution leaders, Senator Chris Coons, became aware of the situation after his daughters asked him what he was doing to stop Kony and Senator [[Roy Blunt]] was informed "at a Missouri caucus in St. Louis when a constituent quizzed him about Kony". One of the co-sponsors of the resolution, Senator [[Lindsey Graham]], stated that, "When you get 100 million Americans looking at something, you will get our attention. This YouTube sensation is gonna help the Congress be more aggressive and will do more to lead to his demise than all other action combined."&lt;ref name="Politico"/&gt;

===Africa===
{{see also|Lord's Resistance Army insurgency}}

On March 23, 2012, the [[African Union]] (AU) announced its intentions to send an international brigade of 5,000 military troops "from Uganda, South Sudan, Central African Republic and Congo, countries where Kony's reign of terror has been felt over the years ... to join the hunt for rebel leader Joseph Kony" and to "neutralize" him. According to the statement, the mission commenced on March 24, 2012, and the search "will last until Kony is caught",&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kony 2012: African Union ramps up hunt for Uganda rebel leader in wake of viral video |author=Rodney Muhumuza |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1150843--kony-2012-african-union-ramps-up-hunt-for-uganda-rebel-leader-in-wake-of-viral-video |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=March 23, 2012 |accessdate=March 23, 2012 |work=The Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the task force will be disbanded.

The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said the agency welcomed the "unprecedented" initiative to "end the atrocities in the region" and urged all involved to respect human rights and minimize risk to civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2012/03/kony-lords-resistance-army-increased-attacks.html |title=Kony militia steps up attacks in Congo, Central African Republic |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=April 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; AU [[counter-terrorism]] envoy Francisco Madeira said, "We need to stop Kony." The ICC chief prosecutor [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] voiced confidence that the video will "produce the arrest of Joseph Kony this year," adding: "That is the impact of the campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--[if IE 6]&gt; &lt;![endif]--&gt; |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/04/01/204536.html |title=Viral video will spur Kony arrest this year: ICC&amp;nbsp;– Yahoo!

'''Let's Do It! World''' is a global civic movement that started from [[Estonia]], asking people worldwide to join a series of local, national and regional clean-up events.  Among other projects, it is the founder of '''[[World Cleanup Day]]'''.

The Let's Do It! movement was first conceived in Estonia in year 2008, where a country clean-up action called '''[[Let's Do It 2008|Let's do it!]]''' (in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]: "Teeme Ära!") cleaned up 10,000 tons of illegal waste by more than 50,000 volunteers in one day. Following Estonia's lead many countries also started their own country clean-up events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/domestic-news/general/15176-finland-gets-spring-cleaning.html |title=Finland gets spring cleaning |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715071118/http://blog.heifer.org/2011/07/ukrainian-participants-clean-up-their.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=Ukrainian Participants Clean Up Their Village |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 a new initiative called Let's do it!

Today, the movement has grown into a network of 113 countries. All together, 14 million participants have been engaged in movement's activities.&lt;ref&gt;Kalev Leetaru: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/07/30/how-pokemon-and-location-based-augmented-reality-could-save-the-planet/#4f804c9766cc "How Pokémon And Location-Based Augmented Reality Could Save The Planet"] Forbes, 2016-07-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Let's Do It! World is an accredited member of the [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)]].

Since 2017, the movement uses [[W sign]] aka Three Fingers Up as a symbol.

==The origins of the massive cleanup movement==
On the 3rd of May 2008 over 50,000 people came out of their homes to clean up Estonia, the rest followed the process via all the media channels. That's 4% out of a population of 1,3 million - which would equal 15,3 million in the USA or 57 million in India. The idea spread from Estonia to the whole Europe and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |title=Anti-garbage campaigners plan mass Internet-led clean up |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129054219/http://www.france24.com/en/20100125-anti-garbage-campaigners-plan-mass-internet-led-clean |archivedate=2010-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next spring, in 2009, Latvia and Lithuania cleaned their countries with more than 250,000 people participating and have done it henceforth for three years, engaging more people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hCNrezFwQUYGj2rJNJJ75ENwcDgQ |title=AFP: Massive clean-up drive in Latvia, Lithuania |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 March 2010 Portugal cleaned their country with 200,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.net/2010/03/20/massive-countryside-clean-up-in-portugal/ |title=Massive countryside clean-up in Portugal |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Let's Clean Slovenia in One Day!|Slovenia followed shortly]], breaking all records with 270,000 people (which is 13% of the overall population of the country) taking part in the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/?/video/international/2010/05/03/wv.clean.up.slovenia.cnn |title=CNN: Big clean up in Slovenia |date= |accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of June the same year, Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine was cleaned.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; By the end of 2011 more than 2.5 million people have participated in Let’s Do It! cleanup actions in 16 countries – Estonia, India, Slovenia, Serbia, Finland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Bulgaria, Moldova, Ukraine, Cambodia, Russia, Hungary and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letsdoitworld.org/statistics |title=Let's Do It!

==World Cleanup actions until 2018==
After a successful World Cleanup 2012 project, the network set more ambitious goals. During the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140310071639/http://www.letsdoitworld.org/news/civic-leaders-40-countries-gather-kosovo-erase-massive-waste-problem Let's Do It! Clean World Conference held in Prishtina], Kosovo on the 6th-9th of February 2014, it was agreed, that the aim of the global movement is to clean up the whole World from illegally dumped solid waste and to then keep the planet clean. To reach the essential transformation in the global society, the leaders of country cleanups set the ambitious goal to involve 380 million people by 2018. According to Let's Do It! World, this is around 5% of the world’s population and is estimated to be the amount to create a lasting change.

==Biggest cleanup actions==

The most massive cleanup actions (data: October 2014) within the movement have happened in Slovenia, Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Kosovo and in Albania.

In 2012, 289,000 '''Slovenians''' came out of the homes and cleaned up the entire country in just one day. This is 14% of the country's population.

In 2013, 375,000 cleaned up the country in '''Bulgaria''' in a one-day country cleanup action (13,9% of country's population).

In 2012, 210,000 people (10% of country's population) cleaned up '''Latvia''' from illegal waste in just one day.

In 2013, a massive civic cleanup action also took place in '''Kosovo''', bringing together 132,000 people (7% of the population) and in the same year, Albania also had a massive cleanup action, uniting 147,000 people (5,25%) to clean up the country in just one day.

In 2015, 250,000 people (8,6% of country's population) cleaned up '''Lithuania''' from illegal waste in one day.

In 2015, over 500,000 people participated in Let's Do It! actions in '''Ukraine''' cleaning up illegal dump-sites around the country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11590">The '''list of modern [[fan conventions]]''' for various genres of entertainment extends to the first conventions held in the 1930s. 

Some fan historians claim that the 1936 Philadelphia Science Fiction Conference, a.k.a. [[Philcon]], was the first  science fiction convention ever held. Others, such as [[Fred Patten]] and [[Rob Hansen]], make this claim for the January 1937 event in [[Leeds]], [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;Mike Glyer. [http://www.fiawol.org.uk/fanstuff/THEN%20Archive/1937conFirst.htm "THE FIRST EVER CONVENTION,"] ''The Story So Far'' (Worldcon, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the Leeds Science Fiction League, which was specifically organised as a conference, with a program and speakers. Out of this came the first incarnation of the  [[British Science Fiction Association]].

While a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935-1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impeti for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] (1956-1970)
* science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., ''[[Star Trek]]'') in the 1960s-1970s
* the growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming
* the growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* the growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

[[File:Mountjoy Prison.jpg|thumb|[[Mountjoy Prison]] where on October 31, 1973 three IRA members escaped in a hijacked helicopter.&lt;ref name="mountjoy"/&gt;]]
[[File:La-Sante-Prison-MCB.jpg|thumb|[[Prison de la Santé]] where on May 26, 1986 Michel Vaujour was flown out of the prison by his wife.&lt;ref name="lesante"/&gt;]]

A helicopter [[prison escape]] is made when an inmate escapes from a [[prison]] by means of a [[helicopter]]. This list includes prisoner escapes where a helicopter was used in an attempt to free prisoners from a place of internment, a prison or correctional facility.

One of the earliest instances of using a helicopter to escape a prison was the escape of Joel David Kaplan, nicknamed "Man Fan", on August 19, 1971 from the Santa Martha Acatitla in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;  Kaplan was a New York businessman who not only successfully escaped the prison but eventually escaped Mexico and went on to write a book about his experience, ''The 10-Second Jailbreak''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_book"&gt;{{cite book | last = Eliot Asinof| authorlink = | title = The 10-Second Jailbreak: The helicopter escape of Joel David Kaplan|edition= 1973|page= 268 | publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston; 1st edition| isbn= 0-03-001011-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France has had more recorded helicopter escape attempts than any other country, with at least 11.&lt;ref name="aiton_2005"/&gt; One of the most notable French jail breaks occurred in 1986, when the wife of bank robber Michel Vaujour studied for months to learn how to fly a helicopter.  Using her newly acquired skills, she rented a white helicopter and flew low over Paris to pluck her husband off the roof of his fortress prison. Vaujour was later seriously wounded in a shootout with police, and his pilot wife was arrested.&lt;ref name="lesante"/&gt;

The record for most helicopter escapes goes to convicted murderer [[Pascal Payet]], who has used helicopters to escape from prisons in 2001, 2003, and most recently 2007.&lt;ref name="Grasse"&gt;{{cite news | date = 14 July 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6899274.stm | title = French inmate in second breakout | publisher = BBC News| accessdate = May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another multiple helicopter escapee is [[Vasilis Paleokostas]] who on February 22, 2009 escaped for the second time from the [[Korydallos Prison|same prison]].&lt;ref name="korydallos"/&gt; Because of this, many prisons have taken applicable precautions, such as nets or cables strung over open prison courtyards.&lt;ref name="Blade_1988"&gt;{{cite news |ref=harv|title= 3 Escapes caught after copter chase|first= |last=AP |authorlink=Associated Press |author2= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19880712&amp;id=4VtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669,2993901 |format= |newspaper= [[The Blade (Toledo)|Toledo Blade]]|publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date= Jul 12, 1988 |page= |pages=Cover and p.7 |at= |accessdate= June 8, 2014 |language= |quote= |archiveurl=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19880712&amp;id=4VtQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kw4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5669,2993901 |archivedate=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaplan Fund, was named in a 1964 Congressional investigation as a conduit for [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] money to [[Latin America]]. In 1962 he was convicted of killing his New York business partner, Louis Melchior Vidal, Jr., in [[Mexico City]].  Kaplan always maintained his innocence and on August 19, 1971, a helicopter landed in the Santa Martha Acatitla prison yard where he made his escape accompanied by Carlos Antonio Contreras Castro, a [[Venezuela]]n counterfeiter. Both men were flown to the United States and then different planes flew Kaplan to [[California]] and Castro to [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt;  The escape is told in a book, ''The 10-Second Jailbreak: The Helicopter Escape of Joel David Kaplan''.&lt;ref name="Kaplan_book"/&gt; It also inspired the 1975 movie ''[[Breakout (1975 film)|Breakout]]'', which starred [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Robert Duvall]].

Three members of the IRA were [[1973 Mountjoy Prison helicopter escape|able to escape]]: JB O'Hagan, [[Seamus Twomey]] and Kevin Mallon.

The Mountjoy helicopter escape became [[Republican Movement (Ireland)|Republican lore]] and was immortalized by "[[The Helicopter Song]]", which contains the lines ''"It's up like a bird and over the city.

| Marina Paquet held a sawed off shotgun against the back of the head of a helicopter pilot. She demanded that he land in the Orsainville prison courtyard, where her boyfriend (awaiting extradition to California on a murder charge) was set to escape. The pilot, Brian Jenner, feigned a panic attack, put the helicopter through some rough maneuvers and was then able to convince Paquet, in the back seat of the Jet Ranger, to turn over her shotgun and her knife. Jenner then gave her the choice of any landing spot, except the prison. She chose to go back to the airport.

The pilot then explained, in great detail, exactly where they were and where they would be landing on arrival at the Quebec City airport. He added that the police would surely be aware by then, that she had hijacked the helicopter but would not yet be aware that she had given up her arms to the pilot. All the time Jenner was squeezing the transmit button on his cyclic stick and the tower was picking up all the details. The moment they touched down at the airport, the woman bailed from the helicopter but the police, who had been advised of the situation by the control tower, were hiding out all over the place and captured Paquet within seconds.

The plan was thwarted when [[Antony Moynihan, 3rd Baron Moynihan|Lord Tony Moynihan]], himself an exile in the Philippines, informed the [[Australian Federal Police]], who then ran it as a sting operation. Tony Moynihan would later become an informer against [[Howard Marks]] in a Florida trial.

|{{sortname|Ben|Kramer|nolink=1}}
|Famous Apache Boat owner and racer Ben Kramer tried to escape by helicopter from the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a Federal Prison (holding) in Southwest Miami on April 17, 1989. The escape failed when the rookie pilot, Charles Clayton Stevens, hovered 12 inches off the ground in a very tight space (200'long by 50' wide).

|The chartered helicopter&amp;nbsp;— carrying two armed passengers, a pilot and a technician&amp;nbsp;— first tried to rip off the chicken-wire fence surrounding Trikala prison with a hook dangling from a rope. But that didn't work, so a rope was lowered down to whisk away Panagiotis Vlastos. Another prisoner, an unnamed Albanian national also in the courtyard at the time, may also have been part of the escape plan.

At the same time, the armed passengers used AK47 assault rifles and Uzi submachine gun to fire on the prison guards.  One guard, who was inside a post, was slightly injured by shards of flying glass. He and others returned fire, injuring Vlastos, who had managed to climb into the helicopter, as well as the helicopter's technician. Vlastos fell from a height of about 3 meters (10 feet) into the courtyard, and the helicopter was eventually grounded in the parking lot.

Prison officials told TV stations Mega and NET that they recovered well over 500 bullets fired from the helicopter. The Ministry of Justice, in statements describing the escape attempt, added that the helicopter passengers also carried, but did not use, "improvised explosive devices."

|Pola Roupa&lt;br /&gt;Nikos Maziotis
|A helicopter pilot foiled an attempted hijack of his apparatus by an armed woman who authorities believe wanted to use it to help convicted terrorist Nikos Maziotis escape from Korydallos prison.  
In 2013, Maziotis was convicted in absentia to 50 years in prison for setting up the now-defunct Revolutionary Struggle terrorist group, simple complicity in attempted murder, and a series of attacks claimed by group. He had been on the run since 2012 and was arrested in July 2014.
According to the anti-terrorist squad, the helicopter was leased by a woman who has since been identified by the pilot as Maziotis’ wife, Pola Roupa, at the municipality of Ermionida, in the Argolis regional unit of the Peloponnese on Sunday, and was supposed to fly to the island of Kythnos after picking up six more passengers.
Describing the incident in an announcement, anti-terror police said that the helicopter was near Athens, when the woman pulled out a gun and told the pilot to redirect the aircraft towards the city. The pilot immediately tried to disarm the woman which caused him to lose control of the helicopter and start to lose altitude. During the struggle, the woman shot at him three times without injuring him. Instead, the bullets pierced the instruments. The pilot managed to land the helicopter at an uninhabited mountainous area near the town of Thiva. The woman immediately opened the door and ran away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helicopter pilot foils hijack attempt, part of an escape plan for convicted terrorist|url=http://www.amna.gr/english/article/12946/Helicopter-pilot-foils-hijack-attempt--part-of-an-escape-plan-for-convicted-terrorist/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
  Please list here only the incidents which are
  * notable
  * have a Wikipedia article or section
  * described as blunders in multiple valid sources
--&gt;
*[[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)]] was sometimes referred to as "Fort Blunder", because the first version of the U.S. fort was inadvertently built on the Canadian side of the border.
* The [[NASA]] [[Mars Climate Orbiter]], launched in 1998, burned up in the Martian atmosphere. A mixup between metric and [[U.S. customary unit|US Standard]] measurements in the controlling software caused the spacecraft to miss its intended 140–150&amp;nbsp;km altitude above Mars during orbit insertion, instead entering the Martian atmosphere at about 57&amp;nbsp;km.
* The NASA [[Genesis (spacecraft)|Genesis]] mission was an attempt to sample particles from the solar wind. It successfully collected a sample and returned to Earth. However at the last moment the landing parachute failed to open and the return capsule smashed into the ground at high speed, contaminating the samples. The parachute failure was traced to an [[Genesis (spacecraft)#Mishap_Investigation_Board_(MIB)|accelerometer installed backwards]].
* The Quebec bridge disaster. 
* [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)]]
* [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] caused by a faulty blowout preventer.

Local news, in contrast to national or international news, caters to the news of their regional and local communities; they focus on more localized issues and events.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Local Journalism and Local Media : Making the Local News|last=Franklin|first=Bob|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1998|isbn=|location=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/aul/detail.action?docID=240326|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key features of local newsrooms includes regional politics, business, and human interest stories.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Kelly M.|last2=Tang|first2=Tang|date=2015-10-02|title=#SocialJournalism: Local News Media on Twitter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|journal=International Journal on Media Management|volume=17|issue=4|pages=241–257|doi=10.1080/14241277.2015.1107569|issn=1424-1277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local news readership has been declining in recent years, according to a recent study.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wadbring|first=Ingela|last2=Bergström|first2=Annika|date=2017-02-01|title=A Print Crisis or a Local Crisis?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|journal=Journalism Studies|volume=18|issue=2|pages=175–190|doi=10.1080/1461670X.2015.1042988|issn=1461-670X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Television ==
Opt-outs of local [[television news]] are frequent before, during, or after national evening news [[television program]]ming.  Often times, television networks can also commission or make provisions for their local stations to produce a longer standalone local news programmes.  In some cases, local television markets/viewing areas within a country may even have a dedicated 24-hour local news channel. Local news stations have also started covering less and less local politics in favor of stories that they believe will garner more clicks or attention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A study has also shown that there has also been less investigative journalism within local news stations in recent years.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Differences ===
Local news largely covers the following:
* local sports
* local crime and justice
* local weather
* local business and economy
* local events
* local education
* local politics
* local traffic updates (especially during morning newscasts)

National and international news, however, tend to cover a wider range of content, including news concerning specialized institutions of wide-ranging international power or influence, such as:
* (inter)national political and intergovernmental events
* stock markets
* (inter)national sports competitions
* regional environmental events
* media/entertainment events
* science/technology events
* air traffic/aviatory transport events
* defense/security events

=== Practices in each country ===
In the [[United States]], local news is provided on local [[commercial broadcasting]] channels (some of which are [[television network]] [[Network affiliate|affiliate]]s).  They can either be standalone newscasts that run for at least a half-hour or short segments that air attached to national morning newscasts approximately 25 and 55 minutes past the hour.  As not all stations are owned and operated by a television network, the graphics, branding, and studio designs of a station's newscasts often differ from the network they are affiliated with although in recent years, affiliates have made some form of on-air reference to their corresponding networks in the branding of their newscasts.  In addition, the local news departments of stations also superimpose their on-screen digital clocks, thermometers, and (occasionally) local news tickers on graphics provided by networks during morning network newscasts.  Some cable channels are dedicated to local news coverage.  Examples of this include [[NY1]] in New York and [[NewsChannel 8 (cable channel)|NewsChannel 8]] in the Washington DC market.

In the [[United Kingdom]], most local news is provided on a local network station with similar branding and studio design to that of the national network news. Examples of this include the nationally networked [[BBC News]] and its regional news services such as [[BBC North West Tonight]] (on [[BBC North West]]) and [[BBC Newsline]] (on [[BBC Northern Ireland]]); the nationally networked [[ITV News]] and its regional stations including [[ITV Granada]] and [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]].  The long version of BBC and ITV's local news shows often air during the 18:00 hour on weekday evenings.  STV, which simulcasts most of the ITV network's programmes in Scotland, is not owned and operated by ITV but has its own branded newscast that broadcasts Scottish-centred news at the same time as ITV's regional news services.

In France, most local news is aired on France Televisions' [[France 3]].  Additionally BFM TV also has a local news channel for the Ile-de-France region called BFM Paris.

Norway's public broadcaster, [[NRK1]], airs a local news programme called NRK Distriktsnyheter (name of viewing area) every weekday evening at 18:45 Central European Time, just before the main national newscast Dagsrevyen.  A replay of all local newscasts across the country is shown on NRK2 the following morning (Tuesday to Saturday).

In Sweden, SVT's regional news is simply called SVT Nyheter (name of viewing area) which shares the same branding as the network's main newscast, Rapport.  Unlike SVT's counterparts in the US and UK, during morning programmes, the local news opt-out airs in the middle of each half-hour.  Since June 2007, the morning regional cut-ins no longer feature an in-studio presenters but instead show compiled short reports from various correspondents across the region.  When SVT World was still airing, the simulcast of the morning programme featured a different regional opt-out during each half-hour.  A 13-minute standalone local newscast airs at 18:30 Central European Time each weekday evening after Sportnytt (SVT's sport news) on SVT1.  Additionally, a short local news segment is incorporated into SVT's other evening newscast Aktuellt which airs on SVT2.  In that case, this local news segment shares the same branding and graphics as Aktuellt.  There are no local SVT newscasts on Saturdays.

==Newspapers==
A lot of newspapers specialise in covering the cities they are based in.  Although paper copies of local newspapers are usually sold and circulated exclusively in the local areas they operate (with entities such as libraries or relatives wanting a copy of the paper where a family member is mentioned being mailed copies of outside of circulation areas), companies may make digital copies of their newspapers available to interested readers directly on their website or through services such as PressReader often with a paid subscription.

In the United States, although newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' have a 'national' focus on their front pages, they still have dedicated sections for news in the areas they are based in.  Weather sections also highlight conditions in the local area and the sport sections feature local teams alongside national sport stories.  Their local editions also feature local classified ads.

==Local News in the Digital Age==
In the age of digital media, local news readership has started to fall.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be attributed to the younger generation's disinterest in traditional news sources and the inability of news stations to fully integrate their business models and practices into the age of digital journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While national and international news industries began using Twitter as a way to break news and interact with their audiences, local news mediums have fallen behind, trending towards using Twitter as a secondary source for spreading information rather than a primary tool for audience engagement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Since Internet sites reach a larger audience, more local news agencies have started their own websites to compete in the digital age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Websites are a great way for local news stations to produce more interactive content, which engages the audiences and increases readership.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aside from the Internet, Twitter specifically has become a great way to engage the younger generation in news, gain more readership, and spread information.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; National news sources have started using Twitter to quickly notify the public of breaking news and to interact with their readers, but local news have failed to integrate Twitter and other forms of social media into their journalism practices as successfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While local TV news stations have actually been a bit more effective with using social media, local newspapers have overall fallen behind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By engaging the audience and spreading important information, social media has been considered a solid method for strengthening the core standards of journalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As a result, social media like Twitter has become a vital tool for news agencies to incorporate into their everyday practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

As a result of the transition to digital content, local news agencies have had to change their business models. Although they previously gained revenue from subscriptions, more agencies have started making money from online advertising, but this only accounts for a small portion of revenue.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This loss in revenue has been linked to a decline in local journalistic integrity, because with less profit, the need to make money through clickbait articles has become a necessity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Neil deGrasse Tyson''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|ɡ|r|æ|s}}; born October 5, 1958) is an American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], author, and [[science communication|science communicator]]. Since 1996, he has been the [[Frederick P. Rose]] Director of the [[Hayden Planetarium]] at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City. The center is part of the [[American Museum of Natural History]], where Tyson founded the Department of Astrophysics in 1997 and has been a research associate in the department since 2003.

Tyson studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Columbia University]]. From 1991 to 1994 he was a postdoctoral research associate at [[Princeton University]]. In 1994, he joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist and the Princeton faculty as a visiting research scientist and lecturer. In 1996, he became director of the planetarium and oversaw its $210-million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000.

From 1995 to 2005, Tyson wrote monthly essays in the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, some of which were later published in his books ''[[Death by Black Hole]]'' (2007) and ''[[Astrophysics for People in a Hurry]]'' (2017). During the same period, he wrote a monthly column in ''Star Date'' magazine, answering questions about the universe under the pen name "Merlin". Material from the column appeared in his books ''Merlin's Tour of the Universe'' (1998) and ''Just Visiting This Planet'' (1998). Tyson served on a [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry|2001 government commission]] on the future of the U.S. aerospace industry, and on the 2004 [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy|Moon, Mars and Beyond]] commission. He was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]] in the same year. From 2006 to 2011, he hosted the television show ''[[NOVA ScienceNow]]'' on [[PBS]]. Since 2009, Tyson hosted the weekly podcast ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]''. A spin-off, also called ''[[StarTalk (2015 TV series)|StarTalk]]'', began airing on National Geographic in 2015. In 2014, he hosted the television series ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', a successor to [[Carl Sagan]]'s 1980 series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Fox |title=Cosmos – A Spacetime Odyssey |url=http://www.cosmosontv.com/ |accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] awarded Tyson the [[Public Welfare Medal]] in 2015 for his "extraordinary role in exciting the public about the wonders of science".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html Neil deGrasse Tyson to Receive Public Welfare Medal – Academy's Most Prestigious Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301210506/http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/feb-26-2015-NASawards.html |date=March 1, 2015 }}" (February 26, 2015).

He credited Dr. Mark Chartrand III, director of the planetarium at the time, as his "first intellectual role model" and his enthusiastic teaching style mixed with humor inspired Tyson to communicate the universe to others the way he did.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer &amp; Shepherd-Wynn 2012, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson obsessively studied astronomy in his teen years, and eventually even gained some fame in the astronomy community by giving lectures on the subject at the age of fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=February 15, 2013 |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Prodigy Astronomer |url=http://www.parlemagazine.com/black-history-month/959-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson--the-prodigy-astronomer.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216182841/http://www.parlemagazine.com/black-history-month/959-dr-neil-degrasse-tyson--the-prodigy-astronomer.html |deadurl=yes |publisher=Parlemagazine.com |accessdate=May 27, 2013 |archivedate=December 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], who was a faculty member at [[Cornell University]], tried to recruit Tyson to Cornell for [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] studies.&lt;ref name=Whitaker2000 /&gt; In his book, ''The Sky Is Not the Limit'', Tyson wrote:

{{quote|My letter of application had been dripping with an interest in the universe. The admission office, unbeknownst to me, had forwarded my application to Carl Sagan's attention. Within weeks, I received a personal letter...&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aOwWoZyvUV8C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=degrasse+cornell+sagan+admissions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s51LVOeNPIehyQSfmYDYBw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=degrasse%20cornell%20sagan%20admissions&amp;f=false The Sky Is Not the Limit: Adventures of an Urban Astrophysicist] Neil deGrasse Tyson, Prometheus Books 2010, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tyson revisited this moment on his first episode of ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]''. Pulling out a 1975 calendar belonging to the famous astronomer, he found the day Sagan invited the 17-year-old to spend a day in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]. Sagan had offered to put him up for the night if his bus back to the Bronx did not come. Tyson said, "I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of ''person'' I wanted to become."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Standing Up in the Milky Way]] |series=[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]] |date=March 9, 2014 |network=[[National Geographic Channel]], [[FX (TV network)|FX]], [[Fox Life]], et al. |season=1 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 3, 2014 |title=A Successor to Sagan Reboots 'Cosmos' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/science/space/a-successor-to-sagan-reboots-cosmos.html?_r=0 |accessdate=March 17, 2014 |publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson chose to attend [[Harvard University|Harvard]] where he majored in physics and lived in [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier House]]. He was a member of the [[Sport rowing|crew]] team during his freshman year, but returned to wrestling, [[Letterman (sports)|lettering]] in his senior year.

[[File:Tyson &amp; students.jpg|thumb|Tyson with students at the 2007 [[American Astronomical Society]] conference]]
Tyson's research has focused on observations in [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], [[stellar evolution]], [[galactic astronomy]], [[bulge (astronomy)|bulges]], and [[star formation|stellar formation]]. He has held numerous positions at institutions including the [[University of Maryland]], [[Princeton University]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and the Hayden Planetarium.

In 1994, Tyson joined the Hayden Planetarium as a staff scientist while he was a research affiliate in Princeton University. He became acting director of the planetarium in June 1995 and was appointed director in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"Powerplay: On the Move". ''Black Enterprise'' '''27''' (1): 58. August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As director, he oversaw the planetarium's $210 million reconstruction project, which was completed in 2000. Upon being asked for his thoughts on becoming director, Tyson said "when I was a kid... there were scientists and educators on the staff at the Hayden Planetarium... who invested their time and energy in my enlightenment... and I've never forgotten that. And to end up back there as its director, I feel this deep sense of duty, that I serve in the same capacity for people who come through the facility today, that others served for me".&lt;ref name="Point of Inquiry"&gt;{{Cite episode |url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/neil_degrasse_tyson_the_sky_is_not_the_limit/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson – The Sky Is Not the Limit |last=deGrasse Tyson |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil deGrasse Tyson |series=Point of Inquiry |number= |format=podcast |publisher= |date=August 17, 2006 |accessdate=February 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tyson has written a number of popular books on astronomy. In 1995, he began to write the "Universe" column for ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine. In a column he authored for a special edition of the magazine, called "City of Stars", in 2002, Tyson popularized the term "[[Manhattanhenge]]" to describe the two days annually on which the evening sun aligns with the [[street grid]] in Manhattan, making the sunset visible along unobstructed side streets. He had coined the term in 1996, inspired by how the phenomenon recalls the sun's solstice alignment with the [[Stonehenge]] monument in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8631317/Sun-to-strike-New-York-streets-in-Manhattanhenge.html |title=Sun to strike New York streets in 'Manhattanhenge' |date=July 11, 2011 |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson's column also influenced his work as a professor with [[The Great Courses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320231400/http://www.thegreatcourses.com/tgc/professors/professor_detail.aspx?pid=257 |deadurl=yes |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |website=The Great Courses |accessdate=June 13, 2012 |archivedate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] appointed Tyson to serve on the [[Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry]] and in 2004 to serve on the [[President's Commission on Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy]], the latter better known as the "Moon, Mars, and Beyond" commission. Soon afterward, he was awarded the [[NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal]], the highest civilian honor bestowed by NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |title=American Museum of Natural History |author=(c) Copyright 2003, American Museum of Natural History |website=amnh.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022134532/http://www.amnh.org/science/bios/bio.php?scientist=tyson |archivedate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tyson &amp; Kepler team.jpg|thumb|left|Tyson in December 2011 at a conference marking 1,000 days after the launch of the spacecraft ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'']]
In 2004, Tyson hosted the four-part ''Origins'' miniseries of the PBS ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/origins/ |title=NOVA – Origins |year=2004 |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |author=WGBH Educational Foundation |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with Donald Goldsmith, co-authored the companion volume for this series, ''Origins: Fourteen Billion Years Of Cosmic Evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |first2=Donald |last2=Goldsmith |year=2004 |publisher=W.W.

As director of the Hayden Planetarium, Tyson bucked traditional thinking in order to keep [[Pluto]] from being referred to as the ninth planet in exhibits at the center. Tyson has explained that he wanted to look at commonalities between objects, grouping the terrestrial planets together, the gas giants together, and Pluto with like objects, and to get away from simply counting the planets. He has stated on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', ''[[The Daily Show]]'', and ''[[BBC Horizon]]'' that this decision has resulted in large amounts of hate mail, much of it from children.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Colbert Report]]'', August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) confirmed this assessment by changing Pluto to the [[dwarf planet]] classification.

Tyson recounted the heated online debate on the [[Cambridge Conference Network]] (CCNet), a "widely read, UK-based Internet chat group", following [[Benny Peiser]]'s renewed call for reclassification of Pluto's status.&lt;ref name=TysonPluto2008&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet |first=Neil deGrasse |last=Tyson |page=194 |date=January 19, 2008 |publisher=W.W.

Tyson has been vice-president, president, and chairman of the board of the [[Planetary Society]]. He was also the host of the PBS program ''[[Nova ScienceNow]]'' until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/sciencenow |title=NOVA – scienceNOW |website=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) |accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended and was a speaker at the [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival]] symposium in November 2006. In 2007, Tyson was chosen to be a regular on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]'s popular series ''[[The Universe (TV series)|The Universe]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson in Sydney.JPG|thumb|Tyson promoting the ''Cosmos'' TV series in Australia for National Geographic, 2014]]
In May 2009, Tyson launched a one-hour radio talk show called ''[[StarTalk (podcast)|StarTalk]]'', which he co-hosted with comedian [[Lynne Koplitz]]. The show was syndicated on Sunday afternoons on [[KEIB|KTLK AM]] in Los Angeles and [[WJFK (AM)|WHFS]] in Washington DC. The show lasted for thirteen weeks, but was resurrected in December 2010 and then, co-hosted with comedians [[Chuck Nice]] and [[Leighann Lord]] instead of Koplitz. Guests range from colleagues in science to celebrities such as [[GZA]], [[Wil Wheaton]], [[Sarah Silverman]], and [[Bill Maher]]. The show is available via the Internet through a live stream or in the form of a [[podcast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://startalkradio.net/ |title=StarTalk Radio Show |accessdate=May 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Tyson was the keynote speaker at the 93rd International Convention of the [[Phi Theta Kappa]] International Honor Society of the Two-year School. He and [[James Randi]] delivered a lecture entitled ''Skepticism'', which related directly with the convention's theme of ''The Democratization of Information: Power, Peril, and Promise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Phi Theta Kappa Honors Seminar Series |url=http://austincc.collegiatelink.net/organization/ptk/calendar/details/109382 |publisher=Austing Community College |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Tyson announced that he would appear in a YouTube series based on his radio show ''StarTalk''. A premiere date for the show has not been announced, but it will be distributed on the [[Nerdist YouTube Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOir4aMu0vYI Nerdist Channel Sneak Peek] (March 27, 2012) from YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; On February 28, 2014, Tyson was a celebrity guest at the [[White House Student Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Alan |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/students-are-stars-white-house-film-festival-n40846 |title=Students Are Stars at White House Film Festival |publisher=NBC News |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he helped revive Carl Sagan's ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'' television series, presenting ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'' on both FOX and the National Geographic Channel.

Tyson has written and broadcast extensively about his views of science, spirituality, and the spirituality of science, including the essays "The Perimeter of Ignorance"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance The Perimeter of Ignorance] from Tyson's website&lt;/ref&gt; and "Holy Wars",&lt;ref name="HolyWars" /&gt; both appearing in ''Natural History'' magazine and the 2006 ''Beyond Belief'' workshop. In an interview with comedian [[Paul Mecurio]], Tyson offered his definition of spirituality: "For me, when I say spiritual, I’m referring to a feeling you would have that connects you to the universe in a way that it may defy simple vocabulary. We think about the universe as an intellectual playground, which it surely is, but the moment you learn something that touches an emotion rather than just something intellectual, I would call that a spiritual encounter with the universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mecurio |first1=Paul |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson |url=https://soundcloud.com/paul-mecurio-show/neil-degrasse-tyson |website=The Paul Mecurio Show |publisher=Alive and Social |accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has argued that many great historical scientists' belief in [[intelligent design]] limited their scientific inquiries, to the detriment of the advance of scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="HolyWars"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2005/11/01/the-perimeter-of-ignorance |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: "The Perimeter of Ignorance" |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked during a question session at the [[University at Buffalo]] if he believed in a higher power, Tyson responded: "Every account of a higher power that I've seen described, of all religions that I've seen, include many statements with regard to the benevolence of that power. When I look at the universe and all the ways the universe wants to kill us, I find it hard to reconcile that with statements of beneficence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZhOm6N4-I0&amp;feature=channel |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: God and Science |id=Quote starts at ~55 seconds |publisher=University at Buffalo YouTube channel |date=April 9, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale McGowan [https://books.google.com/books?id=KXKDLP_PyEQC&amp;q=tyson#v=snippet&amp;q=tyson&amp;f=false Atheism For Dummies]; {{ISBN|978-1118509203}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|341}} In an interview with ''[[Big Think]]'', Tyson said, "So what people are really after is what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God, and I would say if I find a word that came closest, it would be agnostic ... at the end of the day I'd rather not be any category at all."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tyson |first=Neil deGrasse |title=Neil explains his views on youtube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzSMC5rWvos |publisher=Big Think on YouTube |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, in the same interview with ''Big Think'', Tyson mentioned that he edited Wikipedia's entry on him to include the fact that he is an agnostic:&lt;blockquote&gt;I'm constantly claimed by atheists. I find this intriguing. In fact, on my Wiki page – I didn't create the Wiki page, others did, and I'm flattered that people cared enough about my life to assemble it – and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." I said, "Well that's not really true." I said, "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an agnostic." I went back a week later it had been rewritten and it said "Neil deGrasse Tyson is an atheist." – again within a week – and I said, "What's up with that?" so I said "Alright, I have to word it a little differently." So I said, okay "Neil deGrasse Tyson, widely claimed by atheists, is actually an agnostic."&lt;ref name="Neil on YouTube.com" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;During the interview "Called by the Universe: A Conversation with Neil deGrasse Tyson" in 2009, Tyson said: "I can't agree to the claims by atheists that I'm one of that community. I don't have the time, energy, interest of conducting myself that way... I'm not trying to convert people. I don't care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/programs/the-science-studio/neil-degrasse-tyson |title=TSN: Called by the Universe |website=The Science Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, philosopher and secularism proponent [[Massimo Pigliucci]] asked Tyson "What is it you think about God?" Tyson replied "I remain unconvinced by any claims anyone has ever made about the existence or the power of a divine force operating in the universe."  Pigliucci then asked him why he expressed discomfort with the label "atheist" in his Big Think video. Tyson replied by reiterating his dislike for one-word labels, saying "That's what adjectives are for. What kind of atheist are you? Are you an ardent atheist? Are you a passive atheist? An apathetic atheist? Do you rally, or do you just not even care? So I'd be on the 'I really don't care' side of that, if you had to find adjectives to put in front of the word 'atheist.'" Pigliucci contrasted Tyson with scientist [[Richard Dawkins]]: "[Dawkins] really does consider, at this point, himself to be an atheist activist. You very clearly made the point that you are not." Tyson replied: "I completely respect that activity.

=== Race and social justice ===
In an undated interview at [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], Tyson talked about being black and one of the most visible and well-known scientists in the world. He told a story about being interviewed about a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] burst from the sun on a local [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate in 1989. "I'd never before in my life seen an interview with a black person on television for expertise that had nothing to do with being black. And at that point, I realized that one of the last stereotypes that prevailed among people who carry stereotypes is that, sort of, black people are somehow dumb. I wondered, maybe ... that's a way to undermine this sort of, this stereotype that prevailed about who's smart and who's dumb. I said to myself, 'I just have to be visible, or others like me, in that situation.' That would have a greater force on society than anything else I could imagine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtMWvJiFR9E |title=A Story About Race – Neil deGrasse Tyson |date=March 1, 2013 |work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2008/05/16/pursuing-a-science-career |title=Pursuing a Science Career |website=haydenplanetarium.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, at a conference at the [[National Academy of Sciences]], Tyson responded to a question about whether genetic differences might keep women from working as scientists. He said that his goal to become an astrophysicist was, "...hands down the path of most resistance through the forces ... of society." He continued: "My life experience tells me, when you don’t find blacks in the sciences, when you don’t find women in the sciences, I know these forces are real and I had to survive them in order to get where I am today. So before we start talking about genetic differences, you gotta come up with a system where there’s equal opportunity. Then we can start having that conversation."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7ihNLEDiuM National Academy of Sciences conference], YouTube accessed October 31, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2014 interview with ''[[Grantland]]'', Tyson said that he related his experience on that 2005 panel in an effort to make the point that the scientific question about genetic differences can't be answered until the social barriers are dismantled. "I'm saying before you even have that conversation, you have to be really sure that access to opportunity has been level". In that same interview, Tyson said that race is not a part of the point he is trying to make in his career or with his life. According to Tyson, "[T]hat then becomes the point of people's understanding of me, rather than the astrophysics. So it's a failed educational step for that to be the case. If you end up being distracted by that and not [getting] the message". He purposefully no longer speaks publicly about race. "I don't give talks on it. I don't even give Black History Month talks. I decline every single one of them. In fact, since 1993, I've declined every interview that has my being black as a premise of the interview".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/a-conversation-with-neil-degrasse-tyson-about-cosmos-race-and-celebrity |title=A Conversation With Neil deGrasse Tyson About 'Cosmos,' Race, and Celebrity " |author=Rembert Browne |website=Grantland|date=2014-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NASA ===
[[File:Bill Nye, Barack Obama and Neil deGrasse Tyson selfie 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|Tyson, [[Bill Nye]] and U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] take a [[selfie]] at the [[White House]], 2014]]
Tyson is an advocate for expanding the operations of the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]. Arguing that "the most powerful agency on the dreams of a nation is currently underfunded to do what it needs to be doing".&lt;ref name="buffalo2010"&gt;{{cite web |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson at UB: What NASA Means to America's Future |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQhNZENMG1o |publisher=University at Buffalo Communications |accessdate=November 30, 2012 |date=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyson has suggested that the general public has a tendency to overestimate how much revenue is allocated to the space agency. At a March 2010 address, referencing the proportion of tax revenue spent on NASA, he stated, "By the way, how much does NASA cost? It's a half a penny on the dollar. Did you know that? The people are saying, 'Why are we spending money up there...' I ask them, 'How much do you think we're spending?' They say 'five cents, ten cents on a dollar.' It's a half a penny."&lt;ref name="buffalo2010" /&gt;

In March 2012, Tyson testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|United States Senate Science Committee]], stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Right now, NASA's annual budget is half a penny on your tax dollar. For twice that—a penny on a dollar—we can transform the country from a sullen, dispirited nation, weary of economic struggle, to one where it has reclaimed its 20th century birthright to dream of tomorrow.&lt;ref name="tysontranscript"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=4 Dec 2012 |date=7 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tysontranscript_video"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/watch/2012/03/07/past-present-and-future-of-nasa-us-senate-testimony-video |title=Past, Present, and Future of NASA – U.S. Senate Testimony (Video) |publisher=Hayden Planetarium |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |date=March 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Inspired by Tyson's advocacy and remarks, [[Penny4NASA]], a campaign of the Space Advocates nonprofit,&lt;ref name="space-advocates-2014"&gt;{{cite web |title=About Us – Space Advocates |url=http://www.spaceadvocates.com/about |publisher=Space Advocates |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 2012 by John Zeller and advocates the doubling of NASA's budget to one percent of the Federal Budget.&lt;ref name="penny4nasa-whywefight"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why We Fight |url=http://www.penny4nasa.org/why-we-fight |publisher=Penny4NASA |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Space Chronicles|Space Chronicles: Facing the Ultimate Frontier]]'' Tyson argues that large and ambitious space exploration projects, like getting [[Exploration of Mars|humans to Mars]], will probably require some sort of military or economic driver in order to get the appropriate funding from the [[United States Federal government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/neil-degrasse-tyson-how-space-exploration-can-make-america-great-again/253989/ |title=Neil deGrasse Tyson: How Space Exploration Can Make America Great Again |first=Chris |last=Heller |website=theatlantic.com |publisher=The Atlantic |date=March 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal rights ===
Tyson collaborated with the organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) on a [[public service announcement]] that stated, "You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that kindness is a virtue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Interview With PETA |url=http://www.peta.org/features/Dr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also granted PETA an interview in which he discussed the concept of intelligence (both of human and other animals), the failure of humans to heretofore communicate meaningfully with other animals, and the need of humans to be [[Empathy|empathetic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr. Neil deGrasse Tyson's Exclusive PETA Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL6hj6xLE8w&amp;eurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peta.org%2Ffeatures%2FDr-Neil-deGrasse-Tyson-Interview.aspx&amp;feature=player_embedded |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/05/peta-neil-degrasse-tyson-peta_n_912491.html |title=Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson Featured In PETA Ad |journal=Huffington Post |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/worlds-sexiest-astrophysicist-neil-degrasse-tyson-in-peta-ad-video.html |title="World's Sexiest" Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson In PETA Ad (Video)) |publisher=Treehugger |date=August 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 23, 2014 |author=Kessler, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al Jazeera English Doha Newsroom 1.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Al Jazeera English]] Newsroom, [[Doha]], 2008 ]]

'''News''' is [[information]] about current events. This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events. It is also used as a platform to manufacture opinion for the population see [[propaganda]].

Common topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.

==Meaning==
===Etymology===
The [[English language|English]] word "news" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of "new". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nový|nový]]'', "new"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' – and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"News", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. "Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''rēs nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events). Compare later {{smallcaps|novel n.}}"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=news|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jessica Garretson Finch]] is credited with coining the phrase "current events" while teaching at [[Barnard College]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref name=obituary&gt;{{cite news|title=Mrs. John Cosgrave Is Dead Founded Finch Junior College: Was Institution's President Nearly 50 Years; Coined 'Current Events' Phrase|publisher=New York Herald Tribune|date=1 November 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newness===
As its name implies, "news" typically connotes the presentation of new information.&lt;ref name=Stephens13&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith7&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 7. "In the information which [the newspaper] chose to supply, and in the many sources of information which it took over and reorganized, it contained a bias towards recency or newness; to its readers, it offered regularity of publication. It had to be filled with whatever was available, unable to wait until information of greater clarity or certainty or of wider perspective had accumulated."&lt;/ref&gt; The newness of news gives it an uncertain quality which distinguishes it from the more careful investigations of history or other scholarly disciplines.&lt;ref name=Smith7 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 10. Salmon quotes [[Théophraste Renaudot]]: "History is the record of things accomplished. A ''Gazette'' is the reflection of feelings and rumors of the time which may or may not be true."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pettegree3&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 3. "Even as news became more plentiful in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the problem of establishing the veracity of news reports remained acute. The news market—and by the sixteenth century it was a real market—was humming with conflicting reports, some incredible, some all too plausible: lives, fortunes, even the fate of kingdoms could depend upon acting on the right information."&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas historians tend to view events as causally related manifestations of underlying processes, news stories tend to describe events in isolation, and to exclude discussion of the relationships between them.&lt;ref name=Park675&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), pp. 675–676. "News is not history because, for one thing among others, it deals, on the whole, with isolated events and does not seek to relate them to one another either in the form of causal or in the form of teleological sequences."&lt;/ref&gt; News conspicuously describes the world in the present or immediate past, even when the most important aspects of a news story have occurred long in the past—or are expected to occur in the future. To make the news, an ongoing process must have some "peg", an event in time which anchors it to the present moment.&lt;ref name=Park675 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schudson, "When? Deadlines, Datelines, and History"; in ''Reading The News'' (1986), ed. Manoff &amp; Schudson; pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, news often addresses aspects of reality which seem unusual, deviant, or out of the ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the famous dictum that "Dog Bites Man" is not news, but "Man Bites Dog" is.&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), p. 678.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another corollary of the newness of news is that, as new technology enables new media to disseminate news more quickly, 'slower' forms of communication may move away from 'news' towards 'analysis'.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 56. "It is axiomatic in journalism that the fastest medium with the largest potential audience will disseminate the bulk of a community's breaking news. Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commodity===
According to some theories, "news" is whatever the news industry sells.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. "... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public."&lt;/ref&gt; Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. "The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. "[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media."&lt;/ref&gt; From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. "News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity."&lt;/ref&gt; A news agency supplies this resource "wholesale" and publishers enhance it for retail.&lt;ref name=Globalization6&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. "News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MacGregor&gt;Phil MacGregor, "International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tone===
Most purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.&lt;ref&gt;Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. "Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. […] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report. In such a world, naïve empiricism could not last."&lt;/ref&gt; News is also sometimes said to portray the [[truth]], but this relationship is elusive and qualified.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, another property commonly attributed to news is [[sensationalism]], the disproportionate focus on, and exaggeration of, emotive stories for public consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 2. "Sensationalism appears to be a technique or style that is rooted somehow in the nature of the news. News obviously can do much more than merely sensationalize, but most news ''is'', in an important sense, sensational: it is intended, in part, to arouse, to excite, often—whether the subject is a political scandal or a double murder—to shock."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SKH&gt;Jesper Strömbäck, Michael Karlsson, &amp; Nicolas Hopmann, "Determinants of News Content: Comparing journalists' perceptions of the normative and actual impact of different event properties when deciding what's news". ''Journalism Studies'' 13.5–6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; This news is also not unrelated to [[gossip]], the human practice of sharing information about other humans of mutual interest.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 26, 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt; A common sensational topic is violence; hence another news dictum, "if it bleeds, it leads".&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newsworthiness===
Newsworthiness is defined as a subject having sufficient relevance to the public or a special audience to warrant press attention or coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/newsworthiness |title=definition of newsworthiness by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus, and Encyclopedia |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists apply news values to identify a news story. News values determine how much attention a news story is given by a media outlet, and the attention it is given by its audience or readers.&lt;ref name="Spencer-Thomas 2011"&gt;{{Cite web | title = News Values | last = Spencer-Thomas | first = Owen | work = [[Owen Spencer-Thomas]] | date = 2011 | accessdate = 2018-10-13 | url = http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries and at some points in history, what news media and the public have considered "newsworthy" has met different definitions, such as the notion of [[news values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues |title=News values: immediacy and technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many news values seem to be common across cultures. People seem to be interested in news to the extent which it has a big impact, describes conflicts, happens nearby, involves well-known people, and deviates from the norms of everyday happenings.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; War is a common news topic, partly because it involves unknown events that could pose personal danger.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|History of telecommunication}}

===Folk news===
Evidence suggests that cultures around the world have found a place for people to share stories about interesting new information. Among Zulus, Mongolians, Polynesians, and American Southerners, anthropologists have documented the practice of questioning travelers for news as a matter of priority.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 14, 305. "The desire to pass on tales of current events could be found even in cultures that did not have writing—let alone printing presses or computers—to whet or satisfy their thirst for news. Observers have often remarked on the fierce concern with the news that they find in preliterate or semiliterate peoples. […] It is difficult, if not impossible, to find a society that does not exchange news and that does not build into its rituals and customs means for facilitating that exchange."&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficiently important news would be repeated quickly and often, and could spread by word of mouth over a large geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Even as printing presses came into use in Europe, news for the general public often travelled orally via monks, travelers, town criers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The news is also transmitted in public gathering places, such as the Greek forum and the Roman baths. Starting in England, [[coffeehouses]] served as important sites for the spread of news, even after telecommunications became widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 8. "A particularly lively forum for the exchange of news by word of mouth—the coffeehouse—flourished in England well after the development of the newspaper, and in some countries, the coffeehouse has survived even the introduction of television."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Muslim world, people have gathered and exchanged news at [[mosque]]s and other social places. Travelers on pilgrimages to Mecca traditionally stay at [[caravanserai]]s, roadside inns, along the way, and these places have naturally served as hubs for gaining news of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In late medieval Britain, reports ("tidings") of major events were a topic of great public interest, as chronicled in Chaucer's 1380 ''[[The House of Fame]]'' and other works.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government proclamations===
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0007253 Ständebuch ^ Beruf ^ Ausrufer.jpg|thumb|Woodcut by [[Tommaso Garzoni]] depicting a town crier with a trumpet]]

Before the invention of newspapers in the early 17th century, official government bulletins and [[edicts]] were circulated at times in some centralized empires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519215200/http://mashable.com/follow/topics/news/|date=May 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documented use of an organized [[courier]] service for the diffusion of written documents is in [[Egypt]], where [[Pharaoh]]s used couriers for the diffusion of their decrees in the territory of the State (2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsams.nl/ |title=United Courier Systems |publisher=Ucsams.nl |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2014}} [[Julius Caesar]] regularly publicized his heroic deeds in Gaul, and upon becoming Emperor of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] began publishing government announcements called ''[[Acta Diurna]]''. These were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 9"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, parliamentary declarations were delivered to [[Reeve (England)|sheriffs]] for public display and reading at the market.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specially sanctioned messengers have been recognized in [[Culture of Vietnam|Vietnamese culture]], among the [[Khasi people]] in India, and in the [[Meskwaki|Fox]] and [[Ho-Chunk|Winnebago]] cultures of the American midwest. The [[Zulu Kingdom]] used runners to quickly disseminate news. In West Africa, news can be spread by [[griot]]s. In most cases, the official spreaders of news have been closely aligned with holders of political power.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 27–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Town criers]] were a common means of conveying information to citydwellers. In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322–1325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''—"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition"—and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, "Fanno bandire" (2013), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. "Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'. Unlike the signs, which contained only information regarding the merchant, the criers also informed the citizens of the news of the day. Because the crier, or his agent, was compensated for his assistance in getting the advertising message out in the context of the news, there are interesting parallels with the newspaper of today (Applegate, 1993; Roche, 1993; Schramm, 1988)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Ottoman Empire]], official messages were regularly distributed at [[mosque]]s, by traveling holy men, and by secular criers. These criers were sent to read official announcements in marketplaces, highways, and other well-traveled places, sometimes issuing commands and penalties for disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early news networks===
The spread of news has always been linked to the communications networks in place to disseminate it. Thus, political, religious, and commercial interests have historically controlled, expanded, and monitored communications channels by which news could spread. [[Mail|Postal services]] have long been closely entwined with the maintenance of political power in a large area.&lt;ref name=Fang14&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens27&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 27. "Whoever controlled the messengers could select which anecdotes and information would be favored by this treatment. Therefore, whoever controlled the messengers gained not only a conduit to the members of a society—the ability to inform them of new regulations—but gained a measure of power over the selection of news the members of a society received—the power, for example to ensure that they received news of triumphs but not necessarily of debacles. Messengers were controlled, for the most part, by kings, chiefs, headmen. They were rarely channels of dissent."&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the imperial communication channels, called the "[[Royal Road]]" traversed the [[Assyrian Empire]] and served as a key source of its power.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, "Royal Roads" (1995), p. 129. "The ability of the Assyrian court to challenge a huge and permanent stream of information seems to have been one of the essential factors for the long maintenance of Assyrian domination, over the vast areas in the Near East."&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Empire maintained a vast network of roads, known as ''[[cursus publicus]]'', for similar purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Visible chains of long distance signaling, known as [[optical telegraph]]y, have also been used throughout history to convey limited types of information. These can have ranged from smoke and fire signals to advanced systems using semaphore codes and telescopes.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bakker13 /&gt; The latter form of optical telegraph came into use in Japan, Britain, France, and Germany from the 1790s through the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Distelrath45 /&gt;

====Asia====
[[File:KaiYuanZaBaoRemake.jpg|thumb|Reproduction of Kaiyuan Za Bao court newspaper from the Tang dynasty]]
The world's first written news may have originated in [[Spring and Autumn period|eighth century BCE China]], where reports gathered by officials were eventually compiled as the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. The annals, whose compilation is attributed to [[Confucius]], were available to a sizeable reading public and dealt with common news themes—though they straddle the line between news and history.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Origins of the Modern Chinese Press'' (2007), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Han dynasty]] is credited with developing one of the most effective imperial surveillance and communications networks in the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14. "The Chinese civilization was one of the earliest to have found it convenient to set up a systematic news-collection network across a large land mass. During the Han dynasty (206BC–AD219) the imperial court arranged to be supplied with information on the events of the Empire by means of a postal empire similar to the princely message systems of the European Middle Ages, when the postmasters of the Holy Roman Empire were required to write summaries of events taking place within their regions and transmit them along specified routes."&lt;/ref&gt; Government-produced news sheets, called [[tipao]], circulated among court officials during the late Han dynasty (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' ("Bulletin of the Court") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials.&lt;ref name=Smith14 /&gt; The court created a Bureau of Official Reports (''Jin Zhouyuan'') to centralize news distribution for the court.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, ''Origins of the Modern Chinese Press'' (2007), p. 14. "However, it was in the Tang dynasty that a specific bureau—the Bureau of Official Reports (''Jin Zhouyuan'')—was created to accommodate the local representatives. During this time, there were many rising powerful dukes, princes or governor-generals in charge of the large territories, equal in size to a modern province in China. These dukes or princes would naturally provide for their own news service at the capital Chang'an, which handled all official documents submitted by these representatives and transmitted imperial edicts in return. Recent archaeological research has uncovered such official reports from the Tang dynasty. Two archive documents of that period, originally found in Dunhuang have been regarded by Chinese scholars as the earliest forms of newspaper in the world (Fang 1997 53–8)"&lt;/ref&gt; Newsletters called ''ch'ao pao'' continued to be produced and gained wider public circulation in the following centuries.&lt;ref name=Smith14a&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14. "At a later stage of its development, during the Sung period (960–1278), the ''ti pao'' was made to circulate among the purely intellectual groups, and during the Ming (1367–1644) was seen by a wider circle of society."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1582 there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in [[Beijing]], during the late [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="brook xxi"&gt;[[Timothy Brook (historian)|Brook, Timothy]]. (1998). ''[[The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China]]''. Berkeley: [[University of California Press]]. {{ISBN|0520221540}} (Paperback). p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan had effective communications and postal delivery networks at several points in its history, first in 646 with the [[Taika Reform]] and again during the [[Kamakura period]] from 1183–1333. The system depended on ''hikyaku'', runners, and regularly spaced relay stations. By this method, news could travel between Kyoto and Kamakura in 5–7 days. Special horse-mounted messengers could move information at the speed of 170 kilometers per day.&lt;ref name=Distelrath45&gt;Distelrath, "Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan" (2000), pp. 45–46 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Gordenker, "Postal Symbol"; ''Japan Times'', 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese shogunates were less tolerant than the Chinese government of news circulation.&lt;ref name=Smith14&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), p. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The postal system established during the [[Edo period]] was even more effective, with average speeds of 125–150&amp;nbsp;km/day and express speed of 200&amp;nbsp;km/day. This system was initially used only by the government, taking private communications only at exorbitant prices. Private services emerged and in 1668 established their own ''[[Kabunakama|nakama]]'' (guild). They became even faster, and created an effective optical telegraphy system using flags by day and lanterns and mirrors by night.&lt;ref name=Distelrath45 /&gt;

====Europe====
In Europe, during the Middle Ages, elites relied on runners to transmit news over long distances. At 33 kilometres per day, a runner would take two months to bring a message across the [[Hanseatic League]] from Bruges to Riga.&lt;ref&gt;Distelrath, "Development of the Information and Communication Systems in Germany and Japan" (2000), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lampe &amp; Ploeckl, "Spanning the Globe" (2014), 247.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period]], increased cross-border interaction created a rising need for information which was met by concise handwritten newssheets. The driving force of this new development was the commercial advantage provided by up-to-date news.&lt;ref name=Pettegree3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCusker &amp; Gravesteijn, ''Beginnings of Commercial and Financial Journalism'' (1991), p. 21. "Business thrives on the most recent news. The merchants of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, no less than those of today, required the 'freshest advices' in order to conduct their affairs profitably."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1556, the government of [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] first published the monthly ''Notizie scritte'', which cost one [[gazette|gazetta]].&lt;ref name="WAN timeline"&gt;[http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html Wan-Press.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111093302/http://www.wan-press.org/article2822.html |date=2012-01-11 }}, A Newspaper Timeline, [[World Association of Newspapers]]&lt;/ref&gt; These [[avviso|avvisi]] were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently to Italian cities (1500–1700)—sharing some characteristics of [[newspapers]] though usually not considered true newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Infelise, Mario. "Roman Avvisi: Information and Politics in the Seventeenth Century." Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492–1700. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002. 212, 214, 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; ''Avvisi'' were sold by subscription under the auspices of military, religious, and banking authorities. Sponsorship flavored the contents of each series, which were circulated under many different names. Subscribers included clerics, diplomatic staff, and noble families. By the last quarter of the seventeenth century ''avvisi'' long passages from were finding their way into published monthlies such as the [[Mercure de France]] and, in northern Italy, ''Pallade veneta''.&lt;ref&gt;Selfridge-Field, Eleanor.

Postal services enabled merchants and monarchs to stay abreast of important information. For the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximillian I]] in 1490 authorized two brothers from the Italian Tasso family, Francesco and Janettto, to create a network of courier stations linked by riders. They began with a communications line between Innsbruck and Mechelen and grew from there.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248&gt;Lampe &amp; Ploeckl, "Spanning the Globe" (2014), 248.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1505 this network expanded to Spain, new governed by Maximilian's son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip]]. These riders could travel 180 kilometers in a day.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; This system became the [[Reichspost|Imperial Reichspost]], administered by Tasso descendents (subsequently known as [[Lamoral II Claudius Franz, Count of Thurn and Taxis|Thurn-und-Taxis]]), who in 1587 received exclusive operating rights from the Emperor.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248 /&gt; The [[La Poste (France)|French postal service]] and [[General Post Office|English postal service]] also began at this time, but did not become comprehensive until the early 1600s.&lt;ref name=LampePloeckl248 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1620, the English system linked with Thurn-und-Taxis.&lt;ref name=Bakker13&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

These connections underpinned an extensive system of news circulation, with handwritten items bearing dates and places of origin. Centred in Germany, the network took in news from Russia, the Balkans, Italy, Britain, France, and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 18–19. "Since the late Middle Ages a formal network of correspondents and intelligence agents had come into being across the bulk of the European continent, busily sending news of military, diplomatic and ecclesiastical affairs along a series of prescribed routes. The information was handwritten and passed along carefully organized chains, each item being labeled with its place and date of origin."&lt;/ref&gt; The German lawyer [[Christoph von Scheurl]] and the [[Fugger]] house of Augsburg were prominent hubs in this network.&lt;ref name=Bakker11 /&gt; Letters describing historically significant events could gain wide circulation as news reports. Indeed, personal correspondence sometimes acted only as a convenient channel through which news could flow across a larger network.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, "Take Writing" (2006), pp. 35–45.&lt;/ref&gt; A common type of business communication was a simple listing of current prices, the circulation of which quickened the flow of international trade.&lt;ref name=Bakker10&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallionen, "Information, communication technology, and business" (2004), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Businesspeople also wanted to know about events related to shipping, the affairs of other businesses, and political developments.&lt;ref name=Bakker10 /&gt; Even after the advent of international newspapers, business owners still valued correspondence highly as a source of reliable news that would affect their enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Kallionen, "Information, communication technology, and business" (2004), p. 21. "Although the businessmen obtained information from newspapers and other public sources, for instance, from the consuls stationed in foreign towns, they placed special value on the letters received directly from their foreign partners. This is precisely the key to the existence of a network relationship: the parties were dependent on the resources controlled by both parties, both goods and information, so by mutual co-operation both parties gained mutual benefits. Long-term, personal networks were particularly well suited for transmitting information that required high reliability.&lt;/ref&gt; Handwritten newsletters, which could be produced quickly for a limited clientele, also continued into the 1600s.&lt;ref name=Bakker11&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the newspaper===

{{see also|History of newspapers and magazines}}
The [[History of paper|spread of paper]] and the [[History of printing|printing press]] from China to Europe preceded a major advance in the transmission of news.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, ''History of Mass Communication'' (1997), pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of printing presses and the creation of new markets in the 1500s, news underwent a shift from factual and precise economic reporting, to a more emotive and freewheeling format. (Private newsletters containing important intelligence therefore remained in use by people who needed to know.)&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 6–8. "So this sort of news reporting was very different from the discreet, dispassionate services of the manuscript news men. News pamphlets were often committed and engaged, intended to persuade as well as inform. News also became, for the first time, part of the entertainment industry. What could be more entertaining than the tale of some catastrophe in a far-off place, or a grisly murder? This was not unproblematic, particularly for the traditional leaders of society who were used to news being part of a confidential service, provided by trusted agents."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[List of the oldest newspapers|first newspapers]] emerged in Germany in the early 1600s.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien]], from 1605, is recognized as the world's first formalized 'newspaper';&lt;ref name="Relation"&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2006|p=396}}; World Association of Newspapers: [http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html "Newspapers: 400 Years Young!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310235015/http://www.wan-press.org/article6476.html |date=2010-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while not a 'newspaper' in the modern sense, the Ancient Roman [[acta diurna]] served a similar purpose circa 131 BC.

The new format, which mashed together numerous unrelated and perhaps dubious reports from far-flung locations, created a radically new and jarring experience for its readers.&lt;ref&gt;Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 9. "The news reporting of the newspapers was very different, and utterly unfamiliar to those who had not previously been subscribers to the manuscript service. Each report was no more than a couple sentences long. It offered no explanation, comment, or commentary. Unlike a news pamphlet the reader did not know where this fitted in the narrative—or even whether what was reported would turn out to be important."&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of styles emerged, from single-story tales, to compilations, overviews, and personal and impersonal types of news analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

News for public consumption was at first tightly controlled by governments. By 1530, England had created a licensing system for the press and banned "seditious opinions".&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Licensing Order of 1643|Licensing Act]], publication was restricted to approved presses—as exemplified by The London Gazette, which prominently bore the words: "Published By Authority".&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament allowed the Licensing Act to lapse in 1695, beginning a new era marked by [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] and [[Tory (British political grouping)|Tory]] newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; (During this era, the [[Stamp Act 1712|Stamp Act]] limited newspaper distribution simply by making them expensive to sell and buy.) In France, censorship was even more constant.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, many Europeans read newspapers originating from beyond their national borders—especially from the [[Dutch Republic]], where publishers could evade state censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new United States saw a newspaper boom beginning with the Revolutionary era, accelerated by spirited debates over the establishment of a new government, spurred on by subsidies contained in the 1792 [[Postal Service Act]], and continuing into the 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt; American newspapers got many of their stories by copying reports from each other. Thus by offering free postage to newspapers wishing to exchange copies, the Postal Service Act subsidized a rapidly growing news network through which different stories could percolate.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 90. "The 1792 law codified the right of newspapers to exchange copies for free with one another, and by the 1840s the average newspaper received an astonishing 4,300 exchange copies a year. Editors relied on other papers for the national news that filled most of their columns. In effect, the federal government was encouraging local papers to become outlets for a national news network that the government itself did not control."&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers thrived during the colonization of the [[American frontier|West]], fueled by high literacy and a newspaper-loving culture.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 8–9, 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1880, San Francisco rivaled New York in number of different newspapers and in printed newspaper copies per capita.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 31, 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boosterism|Boosters]] of new towns felt that newspapers covering local events brought legitimacy, recognition, and community.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, ''Frontier Press'' (2008), pp. 67–69.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1830s American, wrote [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], was "a very civilized man prepared for a time to face life in the forest, plunging into the wilderness of the New World with his Bible, ax, and newspapers."&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 48. [''"Tout est primitif et sauvage autour de lui, mais lui est pour ainsi dire le résultat de dix-huit siècles de travaux et d'expérience. Il porte le vêtement des villes, en parle la langue; sait le passé, est curieux de l'avenir, argumente sur le présent; c'est un homme très civilisé, qui, pour un temps, se soumet à vivre au milieu des bois, et qui s'enfonce dans les déserts du Nouveau Monde avec la Bible, une hache et des journaux."'']&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the Revolution brought forth an abundance of newspapers and a new climate of press freedom, followed by a return to repression under Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Smith,''The Newspaper: An International History'' (1979), pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1792 the Revolutionaries set up a news ministry called the ''Bureau d'Esprit''.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some newspapers published in the 1800s and after retained the commercial orientation characteristic of the private newsletters of the Renaissance. Economically oriented newspapers published new types of data enabled the advent of [[statistics]], especially [[economic statistics]] which could inform sophisticated investment decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; These newspapers, too, became available for larger sections of society, not just elites, keen on investing some of their savings in the [[stock market]]s. Yet, as in the case other newspapers, the incorporation of advertising into the newspaper led to justified reservations about accepting newspaper information at face value.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Economic newspapers also became promoters of economic ideologies, such as [[Keynesianism]] in the mid-1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons, ''Power of the Financial Press'' (1989), pp. 81–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers came to sub-Saharan Africa via colonization. The first English-language newspaper in the area was ''The Royal Gazette and Sierra Leone Advertiser'', established in 1801, and followed by ''The Royal Gold Coast Gazette and Commercial Intelligencer'' in 1822 and the ''Liberia Herald'' in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; A number of nineteenth-century African newspapers were established by missionaries.&lt;ref name=Fosu60&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; These newspapers by and large promoted the colonial governments and served the interests of European settlers by relaying news from Europe.&lt;ref name=Fosu60 /&gt; The first newspaper published in a native African language was the ''Muigwithania'', published in Kikuyu by the Kenyan Central Association.&lt;ref name=Fosu60 /&gt; ''Muigwithania'' and other newspapers published by indigenous Africans took strong opposition stances, agitating strongly for African independence.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers were censored heavily during the colonial period—as well as after formal independence. Some liberalization and diversification took place in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspapers were slow to [[Arab culture|spread to the Arab world]], which had a stronger tradition of [[Communication#Verbal|oral communication]], and mistrust of the European approach to news reporting. By the end of the eighteenth century, the Ottoman Empire's leaders in Istanbul did monitor the European press, but its contents were not disseminated for mass consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the first written news in modern North Africa arose in Egypt under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], who developed the local paper industry and initiated the limited circulation of news bulletins called ''jurnals''.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 13–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1850s and 1860s, the private press began to develop in the multi-religious country of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Ayalon, ''The Press in the Arab Middle East: A History'' (1995), pp. 28–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newswire===
The development of the [[electrical telegraph]], which often travelled along railroad lines, enabled news to travel faster, over longer distances.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; (Days before Morse's Baltimore–Washington line transmitted the famous question, "What hath God wrought?", it transmitted the news that Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen had been chosen by the Whig nominating party.)&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 9"/&gt; Telegraph networks enabled a new centralization of the news, in the hands of [[wire services]] concentrated in major cities. The modern form of these originated with [[Charles-Louis Havas]], who founded Bureau Havas (later [[Agence France-Presse]]) in Paris. Havas began in 1832, using the French government's optical telegraph network. In 1840 he began using pigeons for communications to Paris, London, and Brussels. Havas began to use the electric telegraph when it became available.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Havas's protoges, [[Bernhard Wolff]], founded [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau]] in Berlin in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Another Havas disciple, [[Paul Reuter]], began collecting news from Germany and France in 1849, and in 1851 immigrated to London, where he established the [[Reuters]] news agency—specializing in news from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, William Saunders and Edward Spender formed the [[Central News Agency (London)|Central Press]] agency, later called the [[Press Association]], to handle domestic news.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Just before insulated telegraph line crossed the English Channel in 1851, Reuter won the right to transmit stock exchange prices between Paris and London.&lt;ref name=Wenzlhuemer90&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt; He maneuvered Reuters into a dominant global position with the motto "Follow the Cable", setting up news outposts across the [[British Empire]] in Alexandria (1865), Bombay (1866), Melbourne (1874), Sydney (1874), and Cape Town (1876).&lt;ref name=Wenzlhuemer90 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Associated Press]] became a news powerhouse, gaining a lead position through an exclusive arrangement with the [[Western Union]] company.&lt;ref name=Starr177 /&gt;

The telegraph ushered in a new global communications regime, accompanied by a restructuring of the national postal systems, and closely followed by the advent of telephone lines. With the value of international news at a premium, governments, businesses, and news agencies moved aggressively to reduce transmission times. In 1865, Reuters had the scoop on the [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln assassination]], reporting the news in England twelve days after the event took place.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866, [[Transatlantic telegraph cable|an undersea telegraph cable]] successfully connected Ireland to Newfoundland (and thus the Western Union network) cutting trans-Atlantic transmission time from days to hours.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 17"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Headrick | first1 = Daniel R. | last2 = Griset | first2 = Pascal | year = | title = Submarine Telegraph Cables: Business and Politics, 1838–1939 | url = | journal = Business History Review | volume = 75 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Meikle, ''Interpreting News''; Palgrave Macmillan, 2009; p.

The rebels proceeded to disrupt the British telegraph network, which was rebuilt with more redundancies.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzlhuemer, ''Connecting the Nineteenth-Century World'' (2013), pp. 211–215.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902–1903, Britain and the U.S. completed the circumtelegraphy of the planet with transpacific cables from Canada to Fiji and New Zealand (British Empire), and from the US to Hawaii and the occupied Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, ''Struggle for Control of Global Communication'' (2002), pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. reassertions of the Monroe Doctrine notwithstanding, Latin America was a battleground of competing telegraphic interests until World War I, after which U.S. interests finally did consolidate their power in the hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, ''Struggle for Control of Global Communication'' (2002), pp. 153–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eisenbahnen- und Telegraphendichte der Erde um 1900.jpg|thumb|World railway and telegraph system, 1900]]
By the turn of the century (i.e., circa 1900), Wolff, Havas, and Reuters formed a news cartel, dividing up the global market into three sections, in which each had more-or-less exclusive distribution rights and relationships with national agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 26–27. "The principal feature of the world's news market in the second half of the 19th century and the first third of the 20th, was the cartel. This was an oligopolistic and hierarchical structure of the global news market controlled by Reuters, Havas and Wolff at the top tier, in partnership with an ever-increasing number of national news agencies. Each member of the triumvirate had the right to distribute its news service, incorporating news of the cartel, to its ascribed territories: these territories were determined by periodic, formal agreements. […] The triumvirate of Reuters, Havas, and Wolff supplied world news to national news agencies in return for a service of national news […] (although the practice was rather more complicated) the national agencies had exclusive rights to the distribution of cartel news in their territories, and the cartel had exclusive rights to the national agency news services."&lt;/ref&gt; Each agency's area corresponded roughly to the colonial sphere of its mother country.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Reuters and the Australian national news service had an agreement to exchange news only with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the high cost of maintaining infrastructure, political goodwill, and global reach, newcomers found it virtually impossible to challenge the big three European agencies or the American Associated Press.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 Reuters (in partnership with the Press Association, England's major news agency for domestic stories) expanded into "soft" news stories for public consumption, about topics such as sports and "human interest".&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the big three wire services opened relations with ''Vestnik'', the news agency of Czarist Russia, to their group, though they maintained their own reporters in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the [[Russian Revolution]], the outside agencies maintained a working relationship with the Petrograd Telegraph Agency, renamed the Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA) and eventually the [[TASS|Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS)]].&lt;ref name=Palmer184&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinese Communist Party]] created its news agency, the Red China News Agency, in 1931; its primary responsibilities were the ''Red China'' newspaper and the internal ''Reference News''. In 1937, the Party renamed the agency ''[[Xinhua]]'', New China. Xinhua became the official news agency of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=XinXin&gt;Xin Xin, "A developing market in news: Xinhua News Agency and Chinese newspapers"; ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 28.1 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

These agencies touted their ability to distill events into "minute globules of news", 20–30 word summaries which conveyed the essence of new developments.&lt;ref name=Palmer184 /&gt; Unlike newspapers, and contrary to the sentiments of some of their reporters, the agencies sought to keep their reports simple and factual.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Palmer, "What Makes News", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; The wire services brought forth the "inverted pyramid" model of news copy, in which key facts appear at the start of the text, and more and more details included as it goes along.&lt;ref name="Allan, 2004 p. 17"/&gt; The sparse telegraphic writing style spilled over into newspapers, which often reprinted stories from the wire with little embellishment.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 20 September 1918 ''Pravda'' editorial, Lenin instructed the Soviet press to cut back on their political rambling and produce many short anticapitalist news items in "telegraph style".&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), pp. 25–26. Translating Lenin: "Why instead of 200–400 lines you can't write in 20–10 lines about such simple, well-known, clear, and already mastered to a great degree, widespread phenomena like the base betrayals of the Mensheviks, those lackeys of the bourgeoisie, like the Anglo-Japanese invasion for the restoration of the holy law of capital; like the chattering teeth of the American millionaires against Germany, and so on, and so on. It is necessary to talk about this, it is necessary to register each new fact in this regard, but in a few lines; to pound out in 'telegraph style' the new appearances of old, already known and evaluated policies."&lt;/ref&gt;

As in previous eras, the news agencies provided special services to political and business clients, and these services constituted a significant portion of their operations and income. The wire services maintained close relationships with their respective national governments, which provided both press releases and payments.&lt;ref name=OBB23&gt;Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 23–24. "Earnings were generally derived from the sale of news services to media, financial or economic institutions, and governments, which were important as sources of revenue and as sources of intelligence, and it is generally considered that their news services reflected their respective national interests."&lt;/ref&gt; The acceleration and centralization of economic news facilitated regional economic integration and [[economic globalization]]. "It was the decrease in information costs and the increasing communication speed that stood at the roots of increased market integration, rather than falling transport costs by itself. In order to send goods to another area, merchants needed to know first whether in fact to send off the goods and to what place. Information costs and speed were essential for these decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Bakker, "Trading Facts" (2011), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio and television===
The [[British Broadcasting Company]] began transmitting radio news from London in 1922, dependent entirely, by law, on the British news agencies.&lt;ref name=Allen26&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; BBC radio marketed itself as a news by and for social elites, and hired only broadcasters who spoke with upper-class accents.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 31. "It was quite normal for the average listener to be depicted as dressed immaculately in full evening dress, seated or standing elegantly with an expensive brand of cigarette in his hand, listening to his set. The BBC was happy to live up to this stereotype. Radio announces always arrived in evening dress, and announcers were chosen from the upper classes of English society. More importantly, they had to be able to speak the King's English just as the King spoke it."&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC gained importance in the May 1926 general strike, during which newspapers were closed and the radio served as the only source of news for an uncertain public. (To the displeasure of many listeners, the BBC took an unambiguously pro-government stance against the strikers).&lt;ref name=Allen26 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USA, RCA's Radio Group established its radio network, NBC, in 1926. The Paley family founded CBS soon after. These two networks, which supplied news broadcasts to subsidiaries and affiliates, dominated the airwaves throughout the period of radio's hegemony as a news source.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Radio broadcasters in the United States negotiated a similar arrangement with the press in 1933, when they agreed to use only news from the Press–Radio Bureau and eschew advertising; this agreement soon collapsed and radio stations began reporting their own news (with advertising).&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; As in Britain, American news radio avoided "controversial" topics as per norms established by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]].&lt;ref name=Allen34&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939, 58% of Americans surveyed by ''Fortune'' considered radio news more accurate than newspapers, and 70% chose radio as their main news source.&lt;ref name=Allen34 /&gt; Radio expanded rapidly across the continent, from 30 stations in 1920 to a thousand in the 1930s. This operation was financed mostly with advertising and public relations money.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 27. "Thus WEAF planted the seeds of a new business that eventually grew to envelop the broadcasting industry: advertising, public relations, and propaganda. From about 1927 this revolution was under way. Advertising agencies, manufacturers, sponsors, promoters, and the sellers of medical and life insurance were jockeying for places in a world of propaganda disseminated by radio broadcasting."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union began a major international broadcasting operation in 1929, with stations in German, English and French. The [[Nazi Party]] made use of the radio in its rise to power in Germany, with much of its propaganda focused on attacking the Soviet Bolsheviks. The British and Italian foreign radio services competed for influence in North Africa. All four of these broadcast services grew increasingly vitriolic as the European nations prepared for war.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The war provided an opportunity to expand radio and take advantage of its new potential. The BBC reported on [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of Normandy]] on 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. of the morning it took place, and including a clip from German radio coverage of the same event. Listeners followed along with developments throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. set up its [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] which by 1942 sent programming across South America, the Middle East, and East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], a centrally located high-power station on the continent, was [[Germany Calling|seized by Germany]], and then [[Radio 1212|by the United States]]—which created fake news programs appearing as though they were created by Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting American troops in the Pacific, the Japanese government broadcast the "[[The Zero Hour (World War II)|Zero Hour]]" program, which included news from the U.S. to make the soldiers homesick.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 87–91.&lt;/ref&gt; But by the end of the war, Britain had the largest radio network in the world, broadcasting internationally in 43 different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 39, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Its scope would eventually be surpassed (by 1955) by the worldwide [[Voice of America]] programs, produced by the [[United States Information Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 108–114, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain and the United States, television news watching rose dramatically in the 1950s and by the 1960s supplanted radio as the public's primary source of news.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., television was run by the same networks which owned radio: CBS, NBC, and an NBC spin-off called ABC.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward R. Murrow]], who first entered the public ear as a war reporter in London, made the big leap to television to become an iconic newsman on CBS (and later the director of the United States Information Agency).&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 179, 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ted Turner]]'s creation of the [[Cable News Network]] (CNN) in 1980 inaugurated a new era of [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] satellite news broadcasting. In 1991, the BBC introduced a competitor, [[BBC World Service Television]]. Rupert Murdoch's Australian [[News Corporation]] entered the picture with [[Fox News Channel]] in the US, [[Sky News]] in Britain, and [[STAR TV]] in Asia.&lt;ref name=McNair108 /&gt; Combining this new appartus with the use of [[Embedded journalism|embedded reporters]], the United States waged the 1991–1992 [[Gulf War]] with the assistance of nonstop [[Media coverage of the Gulf War|media coverage]].&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN's specialty is the [[crisis]], to which the network is prepared to shift its total attention if so chosen.&lt;ref name=HachtenCNN&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 45–48. "When a major crisis breaks out overseas, ABC, CBS, and NBC will issue news bulletins and then go back to scheduled programming and perhaps do a late-evening wrap-up, but CNN stays on the air for long stretches of time continually updating the story. The networks' version of the story will be seen in the United States; CNN's version will be seen all over the world."&lt;/ref&gt; CNN news was transmitted via [[INTELSAT]] communications satellites.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt; CNN, said an executive, would bring a "town crier to the global village".&lt;ref name=Tomlinson /&gt;

In 1996, the Qatar-owned broadcaster [[Al Jazeera]] emerged as a powerful alternative to the Western media, capitalizing in part on anger in the Arab &amp; Muslim world regarding biased coverage of the Gulf War. Al Jazeera hired many news workers conveniently laid off by [[BBC Arabic Television]], which closed in April 1996. It used [[Arabsat]] to broadcast.&lt;ref name=McNair108&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 108–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
The early internet, known as [[ARPANET]], was controlled by the U.S. Department of Defense and used mostly by academics. It became available to a wider public with the release of the [[Netscape]] browser in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; At first, news websites were mostly archives of print publications.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; An early [[online newspaper]] was the ''Electronic Telegraph'', published by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shane Richmond, "[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6545788/Telegraph.co.uk-15-years-of-online-news.html Telegraph.co.uk: 15 years of online news]"; ''The Telegraph'', 11 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 earthquake in California was one of the first big stories to be reported online in real time.&lt;ref name=Allan175&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 175–176.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the release of web browser Netscape made news sites accessible to more people.&lt;ref name=Allan175 /&gt; On the day of the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in April 1995, people flocked to newsgroups and chatrooms to discuss the situation and share information. The ''Oklahoma City Daily'' posted news to its site within hours. Two of the only news sites capable of hosting images, the ''San Jose Mercury News'' and ''Time'' magazine, posted photographs of the scene.&lt;ref name=Allan175 /&gt;

Quantitatively, the internet has massively expanded the sheer volume of news items available to one person. The speed of news flow to individuals has also reached a new plateau.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; This insurmountable flow of news can daunt people and cause [[information overload]]. [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] called this period the "technetronic era", in which "global reality increasingly absorbs the individual, involves him, and even occasionally overwhelms him."&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases of government crackdowns or revolutions, the Internet has often become a major communication channel for news propagation; while it's a (relatively) simple act to shut down a newspaper, radio or television station, mobile devices such as smartphones and netbooks are much harder to detect and confiscate. The propagation of internet-capable mobile devices has also given rise to the [[citizen journalist]], who provide an additional perspective on unfolding events.

==News media today==

News can travel through different [[Media (communication)|communication media]].&lt;ref name=Globalization6 /&gt; In modern times, printed news had to be phoned into a newsroom or brought there by a [[reporter]], where it was typed and either transmitted over wire services or [[editing|edited]] and manually [[typesetting|set in type]] along with other news stories for a specific edition. Today, the term "[[breaking news]]" has become trite as [[commercial broadcasting]] [[United States cable news]] services that are available 24 hours a day use live [[communications satellite]] technology to bring current events into [[consumer]]s' homes as the event occurs. Events that used to take hours or days to become common knowledge in towns or in nations are fed instantaneously to consumers via [[radio]], [[television]], [[mobile phone]], and the [[internet]].

Speed of news transmission, of course, still varies wildly on the basis of where and how one lives.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin42&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 42–43. "In contrast, the Masai, a nomadic community of cattle raisers in Kenya, Africa, spend their lives on the move; consequently, their contact with the media is sporadic. As a result, members of the Masai community did not learn about the September 11 attack in New York until the following June."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspaper===
[[File:NYTimes-Page1-11-11-1918.jpg|thumb|A newspaper is one of the most common ways to receive the latest news.]]
{{Main|Newspaper}}
Most large cities in the United States historically had morning and afternoon newspapers. With the addition of new communications media, afternoon newspapers have shut down and morning newspapers have lost circulation. Weekly newspapers have somewhat increased.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt; In more and more cities, newspapers have established local market monopolies—i.e., a single newspaper is the only one in town. This process has accelerated since the 1980s, commensurate with a general trend of [[consolidation of media ownership|consolidation in media ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt; In China, too, newspapers have gained exclusive status, city-by-city, and pooled into large associations such as Chengdu Business News. These associations function like news agencies, challenging the hegemony of Xinhua as a news provider.&lt;ref name=XinXin /&gt;

The world's top three [[List of newspapers in the world by circulation|most circulated newspapers]] all publish from Japan.

About one-third of newspaper revenue comes from sales; the majority comes from advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers have struggled to maintain revenue given declining circulation and the free flow of information over the internet; some have implemented [[paywall]]s for their websites.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

In the U.S., many newspapers have shifted their operations online, publishing around the clock rather than daily in order to keep pace with the internet society. Prognosticators have suggested that print newspapers will vanish from the U.S. in 5–20 years.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;Shelley Thompson, "The Future of Newspapers in a Digital Age", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Many newspapers have started to track social media engagement for trending news stories to cover. Spain's [[Público (Spain)|Público]] has [https://ijnet.org/en/blog/how-spains-p%C3%BAblico-redefined-its-strategy-and-grew-its-audience-40-percent reshaped their social media strategy and grew their audience by 40 %].

===Television===
Internationally distributed news channels include [[BBC News]], [[CNN]], [[Fox News]], [[MSNBC]], and [[Sky News]]. Televisions are densely concentrated in the United States (98% of households), and the average American watches 4 hours of television programming each day. In other parts of the world, such as Kenya—especially rural areas without much electricity—televisions are rare.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin42 /&gt;

The largest supplier of international video news is Reuters TV, with 409 subscribers in 83 countries, 38 bureaus, and a reported audience of 1.5 billion people each day. The other major video news service is [[Associated Press Television News]]. These two major agencies have agreements to exchange video news with ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, and [[Eurovision (network)|Eurovision]]—itself a sizeable video news exchange.&lt;ref name=Hachten39&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN International]] is a notable broadcaster in times of crisis.&lt;ref name=HachtenCNN /&gt;

===Internet===
[[Online journalism]] is news that is reported on the [[internet]]. News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also bi- or multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals. Millions of people in countries such as the United States and South Korea have taken up blogging. Many blogs have rather small audiences; some blogs are read by millions each month.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 124–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media sites, especially Twitter and Facebook, have become an important source of breaking news information and for disseminating links to news websites. Twitter declared in 2012: "It's like being delivered a newspaper whose headlines you'll always find interesting—you can discover news as it's happening, learn more about topics that are important to you, and get the inside scoop in real time."&lt;ref&gt;Einar Thorsen, "Live Blogging and Social Media Curation: Challenges and Opportunities for Journalism", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Cell phone cameras have normalized citizen [[photojournalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Caitlin Patrick &amp; Stuart Allan, "'The Camera as Witness: The Changing Nature of Photojournalism", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Schudson]], professor at the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]], has said that "[e]verything we thought we once knew about journalism needs to be rethought in the Digital Age."&lt;ref name="Schudson 2011 205"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PK3tgAEACAAJ|isbn=978-0393912876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the work of journalism can be done from anywhere and done well. It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of "news" itself. As Schudson has given emphasis to, the answer is not easily found; "the ground journalists walk upon is shaking, and the experience for both those who work in the field and those on the outside studying it is dizzying".&lt;ref name="Schudson 2011 205"/&gt;

Schudson has identified the following six specific areas where the ecology of news in his opinion has changed:
* The line between the reader and writer has blurred.
* The distinction among tweet, blog post, Facebook, newspaper story, magazine article, and book has blurred.
* The line between professionals and amateurs has blurred, and a variety of "pro-am" relationships has emerged.
* The boundaries delineating for-profit, public, and non-profit media have blurred, and the cooperation across these models of financing has developed.
* Within commercial news organizations, the line between the news room and the business office has blurred.
* The line between old media and new media has blurred, practically beyond recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|pages=207–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These alterations inevitably have fundamental ramifications for the contemporary ecology of news. "The boundaries of journalism, which just a few years ago seemed relatively clear, and permanent, have become less distinct, and this blurring, while potentially the foundation of progress even as it is the source of risk, has given rise to a new set of journalistic principles and practices",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schudson puts it. It is indeed complex, but it seems to be the future.

Online news has also changed the geographic reach of individual news stories, diffusing readership from city-by-city markets to a potentially global audience.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

The growth of social media networks have also created new opportunities for automated and efficient news gathering for journalists and newsrooms. Many newsrooms (broadcasters, newspapers, magazines, radio and TV) have started to perform [https://ezyinsights.com/best-practices-in-news-gathering/ news gathering on social media platforms]. Social media is creating changes in the consumer behaviour and news consumption. According to a [http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/06/12/growth-in-mobile-news-use-driven-by-older-adults/ study by Pew Research], a large portion of Americans read news on digital and on mobile devices.

Because internet does not have the "column inches" limitation of print media, online news stories can, but don't always, come bundled with supplementary material. The medium of the [[world wide web]] also enables [[hyperlinking]], which allows readers to navigate to other pages related to the one they're reading.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

Despite these changes, some studies have concluded that internet news coverage remains fairly homogenous and dominated by news agencies.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Paterson2006&gt;Chris Paterson, "News Agency Dominance in International news on the Internet", ''Papers in International and Global Communication'' 01/06 (Center for International Communications Research), May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; And journalists working with online media do not identify significantly different criteria for newsworthiness than print journalists.&lt;ref name=SKH /&gt;

==News agencies==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079071-0007, Bonn, Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.jpg|thumb|Reuters office in Bonn, Germany, 1988]]
News agencies are services which compile news and disseminate it in bulk. Because they disseminate information to a wide variety of clients, who repackage the material as news for public consumption, news agencies tend to use less controversial language in their reports. Despite their importance, news agencies are not well known by the general public. They keep low profiles and their reporters usually do not get bylines.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnston | first1 = Jane | last2 = Forde | first2 = Susan | title = "The Silent Partner: News Agencies and 21st Century News"; | url = | journal = International Journal of Communication | volume = 5 | issue = | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest [[news agency]] still operating is the [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broderick |first=James F. |authorlink= |author2=Darren W. Miller  |editor= |others= |title=Consider the source: A Critical Guide to 100 Prominent News and Information Sites on the Web |origyear= |edition= |series= |year=2007 |publisher=Information Today, Inc. |location= |language= |isbn=978-0910965774 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=1 |chapter= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1835 by a Parisian translator and [[Advertising agency|advertising agent]], [[Charles-Louis Havas]] as [[Agence Havas]]. By the end of the twentieth century, [[Reuters]] far outpaced the other news agencies in profits, and became one of the largest companies in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 2; Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Thomson Reuters employed more than 55,000 people in 100 countries, and posted an annual revenue of $12.9 billion.&lt;ref name=MacGregor /&gt;

[[United Press International]] gained prominence as a world news agency in the middle of the twentieth century, but shrank in the 1980s and was sold off at low prices. It is owned by the [[Unification Church]] company [[News World Communications]].

News agencies, especially Reuters and the newly important [[Bloomberg News]], convey both news stories for mass audiences and financial information of interest to businesses and investors.&lt;ref name=OBB21 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ewha&gt;John Bartram Ewha, "News Agency Wars: the battle between Reuters and Bloomberg"; ''Journalism Studies'' 4.3 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg LP, a private company founded by [[Michael Bloomberg]] in 1981, made rapid advances with computerized stock market reporting updated in real time. Its news service continued to exploit this electronic advantage by combining computer-generated analytics with text reporting. Bloomberg linked with Agence France Presse in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Ewha /&gt;

Following the marketization of the Chinese economy and the media boom of the 1990s, [[Xinhua]] has adopted some commercial practices including subscription fees, but it remains government-subsidized. It provides newswire, news photos, economic information, and audio and video news. Xinhua has a growing number of subscribers, totaling 16,969 in 2002, including 93% of Chinese newspapers.&lt;ref name=XinXin /&gt; It operates 123 foreign bureaus and produces 300 news stories each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hong | first1 = Junhao | title = "From the World's Largest Propaganda Machine to a Multipurposed Global News Agency: Factors in and Implications of Xinhua's Transformation Since 1978"; | url = | journal = Political Communication | volume = 28 | issue = | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other agencies with considerable reach include [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur]] (Germany), [[Kyodo News]] (Japan), the ''[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata]]'' (Italy), the [[Middle East News Agency]] (Egypt), [[Tanjug]] (Serbia), [[EFE]] (Spain), and [[Anadolu Agency]] (Turkey).&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the internet, [[news aggregators]] play a role similar to that of the news agency—and, because of the sources they select, tend to transmit news stories which originate from the main agencies. Of articles displayed by [[Yahoo! News]] in the U.S., 91.7% come from news agencies: 39.4% from AP, 30.9% AFP, and 21.3% Reuters. In India, 60.1% of Yahoo! News stories come from Reuters. [[Google News]] relies somewhat less on news agencies, and has shown high volatility, in the sense of focusing heavily on the most recent handful of salient world events.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013 /&gt; In 2010, Google News redesigned its front page with automatic geotargeting, which generated a selection of local news items for every viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa M. George &amp; Christiaan Hogendorn, "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2357586 Local News Online: Aggregators, Geo-Targeting and the Market for Local News]"; November 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global news system==
In the 20th century, global news coverage was dominated by a combination of the "Big Four" news agencies—Reuters, Associated Press, Agence France Press, and United Press International—representing the [[Western bloc]], and the Communist agencies: [[Russian News Agency "TASS"|TASS]] from the Soviet Union, and [[Xinhua]] from China.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of major world events, and analyses of all international news coverage in various newspapers, consistently found that a large majority of news items originated from the four biggest wire services.&lt;ref name=Watanabe2013&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Watanabe | first1 = Kohei | title = The western perspective in Yahoo! News and Google News: Quantitative analysis of geographic coverage of online news | url = | journal = International Communication Gazette | volume = 75 | issue = 2| year = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television news agencies include [[Associated Press Television News]], which bought and incorporated World Television News; and Reuters Television.&lt;ref name=Hachten39 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg News created in the 1990s, expanded rapidly to become a player in the realm of international news.&lt;ref name=OBB21&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 21. "Bloomberg's influence is greater than the number of its terminals may suggest, as it feeds financial data and economic news through the AP network to AP members and clients in the United States, and to many national networks through national news agencies. Indeed, it boasts having the second largest 'wholesale' news distribution in the United States, after AP&gt; It has print, radio and television distribution in many countries: Bloomberg television is distributed via Astra satellite service in Europe."&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press also maintains a radio network with thousands of subscribers worldwide; it is the sole provider of international news to many small stations.&lt;ref name=Hachten39 /&gt;

By some accounts, dating back to the 1940s, the increasing interconnectedness of the news system has accelerated the pace of [[History of the world|world history]] itself.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), p. 7. "Since World War II, an intricate an worldwide network of international news media has evolved, providing an expanded capability for information flows. This relationship between the capacity and the need to communicate rapidly has resulted from the interaction of two long-term historical processes: the evolution toward a single global society and the movement of civilization beyond four great benchmarks of human communication—speech, writing, printing, electronic communications (telephone and radio)—into a fifth era of long-distance instant communication based on telecommunications (mainly satellites) and computer technology. Harold Lasswell believed that the mass media revolution has accelerated the tempo and direction of world history. What would have happened later has happened sooner, and changes in timing may have modified substantive developments."&lt;/ref&gt;

===New World Information and Communication Order===
The global news system is dominated by agencies from Europe and the United States, and reflects their interests and priorities in its coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Boyd-Barrett, "'Global' News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Euro-American control of the global news system has led to criticism; that events around the world are constantly compared to events like the [[Holocaust]] and [[World War Two]] which are considered foundational in the West.&lt;ref name=Zeiler31&gt;Barbie Zeiler, "Cannibalizing Memory in the Global Flow of News"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 31–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, a significant amount of news reporting from the Third World has been characterized by some form "development journalism", a paradigm which focuses on long-term development projects, social change, and nation-building.&lt;ref&gt;Fosu, "The Press and Political Participation" (2014), pp. 67–73.&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1987 the U.S. media reported on a riot in the Dominican Republic—the first major news item regarding that country in years—the resulting decline in tourism lasted for years and had a noticeable effect on the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[English language]] predominates in global news exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused the global news system of perpetuating [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref name=Tomlinson&gt;John Tomlinson, "Cultural Globalization and Cultural Imperialism", in Mohammadi (ed.), ''International Communication and Globalization (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 105–108.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics further charge that the Western media conglomerates maintain a bias towards the status quo economic order, especially a pro-corporate bias.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28 /&gt;

The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) has promoted a [[New World Information and Communication Order]], which envisions an international news exchange system involving national news agencies in every country. UNESCO encouraged the new states formed from colonial territories in the 1960s to establish news agencies, to generate domestic news stories, exchange news items with international partners, and disseminate both types of news internally.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 8. "The UN, through UNESCO, consistently endeavored to encourage the spread and development of national news agencies, and of news-exchange arrangements between them, especially during the great wave of independence in Africa during the 1960s. Setting up a national news agency became one of the essential things, part of the 'script', of what it meant to be a 'nation'. Through a national news agency, a state could lay down information links domestically and internationally which would facilitate the generation and exchange of news."&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, the 1980 [[MacBride report]], "Many Voices, One World", called for an interdependent global news system with more participation from different governments. To this end, also, UNESCO formed the [[Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Inter Press Service]], founded in 1964, has served as an intermediary for Third World press agencies.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Inter Press Service's editorial policy favors coverage of events, institutions, and issues which relate to inequality, [[economic development]], [[economic integration]], natural resources, population, health, education, and [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=Giffard194&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt; It gives less coverage than other agencies to crime, disasters, and violence. Geographically, 70% of its news reporting concerns Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt; IPS has the most subscribers in Latin America and southern Africa.&lt;ref name=Giffard194 /&gt; IPS receives grants from organizations such as the [[United Nations Development Program]] and other United Nations agencies, [[Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung]], [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Graz-Seckau|Diocese of Graz]], the [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[MacArthur Foundation]], and the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] to report news on chosen topics, including the environment, sustainable development, and women's issues.&lt;ref&gt;C. Anthony Giffard, "Alternative News Agencies", in Boyd-Barrett &amp; Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), pp. 196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1960s, the [[United States Agency for International Development]], the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], and UNESCO developed the use of satellite television for international broadcasting. In India, 1975–1976, these agencies implemented an experimental satellite television system, called the [[Satellite Instructional Television Experiment]], with assistance from the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]], and [[All India Radio]].&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further transformation in global news flow===
By the 1980s, much of the Third World had succumbed to a [[Latin American debt crisis|debt crisis]] resulting from unrepayably large loans accumulated since the 1960s. At this point, the [[World Bank]] took an active role in the governance of many countries, and its authority extended to communications policy. The policy of developing Third World media gave way to a global regime of [[free trade]] institutions like the [[World Trade Organization]], which also protected the free flow of information across borders.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 33–38.&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank also promoted privatization of national telecommunications, which afforded large multinational corporations the opportunity to purchase networks and expand operations in the Third World.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 58–72, 133–136. "In almost all cases, a combination of privatization schemes and higher rates of public investment led to double-digit growth in teledensity figures throughout the 1990s and continuing today (see Table 3.3). Private telecommunications operators were drawn to emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India, among others, because technological innovation coupled with policy reforms promised access to lucrative high-density business and urban middle-class consumers. […] The few comparative studies of telecommunications reform in the South show that the political environment—whether the state is responsive to democratic public interest—\and its relative power vis-à-vis foreign capital and G8 nations have shaped the terms of reform."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mohammadi, "Communication and the Globalizing Process in the Developing World", in Mohammadi (ed.), ''International Communication and Globalization (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries with less telecommunications infrastructure, people, especially youth, tend today to get their news predominantly from mobile phones and, less so, from the internet. Older folks listen more to the radio. The government of China is a major investor in Third World telecommunications, especially in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 22–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Some issues relating to global information flow were revisited in light of the internet at the 2003/2005 [[World Summit on the Information Society]], a conference which emphasized the role of civil society and the private sector in [[information society]] governance.&lt;ref&gt;Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 136–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==News values==
{{Journalism sidebar}}

[[News values]] are the professional norms of [[journalism]]. Commonly, news content should contain all the "[[Five Ws]]" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.

Journalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to "let the reader decide" the truth of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of "impartiality" on news broadcasters.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;Sue Wallace, "Impartiality in the News", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.

Mid-twentieth-century news reporting in the United States focused on political and local issues with important socio-economic impacts, such as the landing of a living person on the moon or the cold war. The focus similarly remains on political and local issues; the news [[mass media]] now comes under criticism for over-emphasis on "non-news" and "gossip" such as celebrities' personal social issues, local issues of little merit, as well as biased sensationalism of political topics such as terrorism and the economy. The dominance of celebrity and social news, the blurring of the boundary between news and reality shows and other popular culture, and the advent of citizen journalism may suggest that the nature of 'news' and news values are evolving and that traditional models of the news process are now only partially relevant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.owenspencer-thomas.com/journalism/newsvalues] News Values. URL Retrieved June 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Newsworthiness does not only depend on the topic, but also the presentation of the topic and the selection of information from that topic.

Although newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20–23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = "The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880–1930"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture &amp; Society | volume = 22 | issue = | year= 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, "Searching for Meaning" (2006), pp. 15, 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests. Individuals and organizations who are the subject of news reports may use [[news management]] techniques to try to make a favourable impression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Helen|title=Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public|chapter=Spinning the News|year=2006|page=57|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=lixOlrqPeqoC|isbn=978-1416548614|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because each individual has a particular point of view, it is recognized that there can be no absolute objectivity in news reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php?page=all |title=Re-thinking Objectivity |publisher=CJR |accessdate=2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists can collectively shift their opinion over what is a controversy up for debate and what is an established fact, as evidenced by homogenization during the 2000s of news coverage of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Sara Shipley Hiles &amp; Amanda Hinnart, "Climate Change in the Newsroom: Journalists' Evolving Standards of Objectivity When Covering Global Warming"; ''Science Communication 36.4, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators on news values have argued that journalists' training in news values ''itself'' represents a systemic bias of the news. The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others. A journalist can be sure of objectivity in reporting that an official or public figure has made a certain statement. This is one reason why so much news reporting is devoted to official statements.&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 143–145.&lt;/ref&gt; This lemma dates back to the early history of public news reporting, as exemplified by an English printer who on 12 March 1624 published news from Brussels in the form of letters, with the prefacing comment: "Now because you shall not say, that either out of my owne conceit I misliked a phrase, or presumptuously tooke upon me to reforme any thing amisse, I will truly set you downe their owne words."&lt;ref&gt;Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Strong objectivity|Feminist critiques]] argue that discourse defined as objective by news organizations reflects a male-centered perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In their selection of sources, journalists rely heavily on men as sources of authoritative- and objective-seeming statements.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; News reporting has also tended to discuss women differently, usually in terms of appearance and relationship to men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The critique of traditional norms of objectivity comes from within news organizations as well. Said Peter Horrocks, head of television news at BBC: "The days of middle-of-the-road, balancing Left and Right, impartiality are dead. […] we need to consider adopting what I like to think of as a much wider 'radical impartiality'—the need to hear the widest range of views—all sides of the story."&lt;ref name=Wallace /&gt;

==Social organization of news production==
===News organizations===
Viewed from a [[sociology of knowledge|sociological perspective]], news for mass consumption is produced in hierarchical organizations. Reporters, working near the bottom of the structure, are given significant autonomy in researching and preparing reports, subject to assignments and occasional intervention from higher decision-makers.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Owners at the top of the news hierarchy influence the content of news indirectly but substantially. The professional norms of journalism discourage overt censorship; however, news organizations have covert but firm norms about how to cover certain topics. These policies are conveyed to journalists through socialization on the job; without any written policy, they simply learn how things are done.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Breed, "Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis" ([https://umdrive.memphis.edu/cbrown14/public/Mass%20Comm%20Theory/Week%208%20Journalism%20Studies/Breed%201955.pdf pdf]), from ''Social Forces'' 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 108–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 139–140, 146–152. "One method management could use to control its journalists would be to establish rules and regulations. This bureaucratic form would not be very efficient […] A more efficient method for controlling behavior in nonbureaucratic organizations, such as news organizations, is through professionalism. Professionalism "''makes the use of discretion predictable.'' It relieves bureaucratic organizations of responsibility for devising their own mechanisms of control in the discretionary areas of work (Larson, 1977: 168) (emphasis in original)."&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists comply with these rules for various reasons, including job security.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Breed, "Social Control in the Newsroom: A Functional Analysis" ([https://umdrive.memphis.edu/cbrown14/public/Mass%20Comm%20Theory/Week%208%20Journalism%20Studies/Breed%201955.pdf pdf]), from ''Social Forces'' 33 (1955); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 111–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists are also systematically influenced by their education, including [[journalism school]].&lt;ref&gt;John Soloski, "News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

News production is routinized in several ways. News stories use familiar formats and subgenres which vary by topic. "Rituals of objectivity", such as pairing a quotation from one group with a quotation from a competing group, dictate the construction of most news narratives. Many news items revolve around periodic press conferences or other scheduled events. Further routine is established by assigning each journalist to a [[Beat reporting|beat]]: a domain of human affairs, usually involving government or commerce, in which certain types of events routinely occur.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common scholarly frame for understanding news production is to examine the role of information [[Gatekeeping (communication)|gatekeepers]]: to ask why and how certain narratives make their way from news producers to news consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Pamela J. Shoemaker, "A New Gatekeeping Model", from ''Gatekeeping'' (1991); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 57. "Simply put, gatekeeping is the process by which the billions of messages that are available in the world get cut down and transformed into hundreds of messages that reach a given person on a given day."&lt;/ref&gt; Obvious gatekeepers include journalists, news agency staff, and wire editors of newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;David Manning White, "The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News", from ''Journalism Quarterly'' 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideology, personal preferences, source of news, and length of a story are among the many considerations which influence gatekeepers.&lt;ref&gt;David Manning White, "The 'Gate Keeper': A Case Study in the Selection of News", from ''Journalism Quarterly'' 27 (1950); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Although social media have changed the structure of news dissemination, gatekeeper effects may continue due to the role of a few central nodes in the social network.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas John Erneste, "Toward a Networked Gatekeeping Theory: Journalism, News Diffusion, and Democracy in a Networked Model"; Dissertation accepted at University of Minnesota, January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

New factors have emerged in internet-era newsrooms. One issue is "click-thinking", the editorial selection of news stories—and of journalists—who can generate the most website hits and thus advertising revenue. Unlike a newspaper, a news website has detailed data collection about which stories are popular and who is reading them.&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Nguyen, "Online News Audiences: The challenges of web metrics", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; The drive for speedy online postings, some journalists have acknowledged, has altered norms of fact-checking so that verification takes place after publication.&lt;ref name=JohnstonForde /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Redden, "[http://research.gold.ac.uk/6540/ The Mediation of Poverty: The News, New Media and Politics]"; Dissertation accepted at Goldsmiths, University of London, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists' sometimes unattributed echoing of other news sources can also increase the homogeneity of news feeds.&lt;ref name=Matthews /&gt; The digital age can accelerate the problem of [[circular reporting]]: propagation of the same error through increasingly reliable sources. In 2009, a number of journalists were embarrassed after all reproducing a fictional quotation, originating from Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Matthews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Timmer, "[https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/05/wikipedia-hoax-reveals-limits-of-journalists-research/ Wikipedia hoax points to limits of journalists' research: A sociology student placed a fake quote on Wikipedia, only to see it show up …]"; ''Ars Technica'', 7 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

News organizations have historically been male-dominated, though women have acted as journalists since at least the 1880s. The number of female journalists has increased over time, but organizational hierarchies remain controlled mostly by men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 119–121.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of British news organizations estimate that more than 80% of decision-makers are men.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar studies have found '[[Old boy network|old boys' networks]]' in control of news organizations in the United States and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 127–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, newsrooms tend to divide journalists by gender, assigning men to "hard" topics like military, crime, and economics, and women to "soft", "humanised" topics.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with institutions===
For various reasons, news media usually have a close relationship with the state, and often church as well, even when they cast themselves in critical roles.&lt;ref name=Fang14 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stephens27 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Salmon90&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship seems to emerge because the press can develop symbiotic relationships with other powerful social institutions.&lt;ref name=Salmon90 /&gt; In the United States, the [[Associated Press]] wire service developed a "bilateral monopoly" with the [[Western Union]] telegraph company.&lt;ref name=Starr177&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), pp. 175–177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annteresa Lubrano, ''The Telegraph: How Technology Innovation Caused Social Change''; New York: Garland, 1997; pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=IVWAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72 72]–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The news agencies which rose to power in the mid-1800s all had support from their respective governments, and in turn served their political interests to some degree.&lt;ref name=OBB23 /&gt; News for consumption has operated under [[Statism|statist]] assumptions, even when it takes a stance adversarial to some aspect of a government.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 5. "Free of an extended view of the history of press-government relations, it is easy to maintain a romantic image of the journalist, when unchained by repressive regulation, as a staunch adversary of government; it is easy to overlook the basic pro-authoritarian role that has been played by those who spread news: their success in occupying the minds of the governed with a belief in the importance, if not the inevitabiltiy, of a system of government."&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, a large proportion of routine news production involves interactions between reporters and government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schudson, "The Sociology of News Production", from ''Media, Culture &amp; Society'' (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), p. 14. "One study after another comes up with essentially the same observation, and it matters not whether the study is at the national, state, or local level—the story of journalism, on a day-to-day basis, is the story of the interaction of reporters and officials."&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, journalists tend to adopt a hierarchical view of society, according to which a few people at the top of organizational pyramids are best situated to comment on the reality which serves as the basisi of news.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 62–63. "To clarify, H.S. Becker (1967) employs the notion of a 'hierarchy of credibility' to specify how, in a system of ranked groups, participants will take it as given that the members of the highest group are best placed to define 'the way things really are' due to their 'knowledge of truth'. Implicit in this assumption is the view that 'those at the top' will have access to a more complete picture of the bureaucratic organization's workings than members of lower groups whose definition of reality, because of this subordinate status, can only be partial and distorted."&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, therefore, news tends to normalize and reflect the interests of the power structure dominant in its social context.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, &amp; Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger &amp; S.H. Chaffee; reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 34–37. "In sum, a considerable body of research supports the argument that inter-organizational- and institutional-level forces, realized in a journalistic culture of 'objectivity,' fostered by, and in the service of, progressive liberal capitalism, constrain what journalists report. News thus exhibits an identifiable and widely shared form and a content broadly consonant with the social structures and values of its political-economic context."&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) rival and may surpass governments in their influence on the content of news.&lt;ref name=VanLeuvenJoye&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Leuven | first1 = Sarah | last2 = Joye | first2 = Stijn | title = "Civil Society Organizations at the Gates?

===State control===
{{Main|State media}}

Governments use international news transmissions to promote the national interest and conduct [[political warfare]], alternatively known as [[public diplomacy]] and, in the modern era, [[international broadcasting]]. International radio broadcasting came into wide-ranging use by world powers seeking cultural integration of their empires.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 4–6, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government used BBC radio as a diplomatic tool, setting up Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese services in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; American propaganda broadcasters include [[Voice of America]] and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], [[Crusade for Freedom|set up during the Cold War]] and still operating today.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 177–182.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States remains the world's top broadcaster, although by some accounts it was surpassed for a time circa 1980 [[Radio Moscow|by the Soviet Union]]. Other major international broadcasters include the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, North Korea, India, Cuba, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 129–133, 132, 206–207.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the world (and especially, formerly, in the Soviet bloc), international news sources such as the [[BBC World Service]] are often welcomed as alternatives to domestic state-run media.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have also funneled programming through private news organizations, as when the British government arranged to insert news into the Reuters feed during and after World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, ''History of International Broadcasting'' (1992), pp. 21, 55. "The Reuters news service would be broadcast from Rugby with an insertion written by the Foreign Office. The secret agreement provided that both Leafield and Rugby Radio would carry 720 000 words per year, at a cost of three and a half pence per word. During and after the Second World War, these two radio stations transmitted news whose content had been falsified with the intention of deceiving the enemy."&lt;/ref&gt; Past revelations have suggested that the U.S. military and intelligence agencies create news stories which they disseminate secretly into the foreign and domestic media. Investigation into the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] pursued in the 1970s found that it owned hundreds of news organizations (wire services, newspapers, magazines) outright.&lt;ref&gt;Parenti, ''Inventing Reality'' (1993), pp. 66–68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 116–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet news warfare also involved the creation of front groups, like the [[International Organization of Journalists]]. The Russian [[KGB]] heavily pursued a strategy of [[disinformation]], planting false stories which made their way to news outlets worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 113–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadcasts into Iraq before the [[Gulf War|Second Gulf War]] mimicked the style of local programming.&lt;ref&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), p. 49; also see&lt;/ref&gt; The US also launched Middle East Broadcasting Networks, featuring the satellite TV station [[Alhurra]] and radio station [[Radio Sawa]] to beam 24-hour programming to Iraq and environs.&lt;ref&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), p. 49; also see: Josh Getlin and Johanna Neuman, "[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/may/10/news/war-iraqmedia10 Vying for Eyes, Ears of Iraq]"; ''Los Angeles Times'', 10 May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, [[Al Jazeera]], a TV and internet news network owned by the government of [[Qatar]], has become one of the foremost news sources in the world, appreciated by millions as an alternative to the Western media.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; State-owned [[China Central Television]] operates 18 channels and reaches more than a billion viewers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Iran's [[Press TV]] and Russia's [[Russia Today]], branded as RT, also have multiplatform presences and large audiences.

As distinct from [[advertising]], which deals with marketing distinct from news, [[public relations]] involves the techniques of influencing news in order to give a certain impression to the public. A standard public relations tactic, the "third-party technique", is the creation of seemingly independent organizations, which can deliver objective-sounding statements to news organizations without revealing their corporate connections.&lt;ref&gt;Rampton &amp; Stauber, ''Trust Us, We're Experts'' (2001), pp. 13–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Public relations agencies can create complete content packages, such as [[Video News Release]]s, which are rebroadcast as news without commentary or detail about their origin.&lt;ref&gt;Rampton &amp; Stauber, ''Trust Us, We're Experts'' (2001), pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Video news releases seem like normal news programming, but use subtle [[product placement]] and other techniques to influence viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), pp. 395–396.&lt;/ref&gt;

Public relations releases offer valuable newsworthy information to increasingly overworked journalists on deadline.&lt;ref name=Matthews&gt;Jamie Matthews, "Journalists and their sources: The twin challenges of diversity and verification", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; (This pre-organized news content has been called an [[information subsidy]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curtin | first1 = Patricia A. | title = Reevaluating Public Relations Information Subsidies: Market-Driven Journalism and Agenda-Building Theory and Practice | url = | journal = Journal of Public Relations Research | volume = 11 | issue = 1| year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist relies on appearances of autonomy and even opposition to established interests—but the public relations agent seek to conceal their client's influence on the news,. Thus, public relations works its magic in secret.&lt;ref name=VanLeuvenJoye /&gt;&lt;ref name=MoloneyJacksonMcQueen /&gt;

Public relations can dovetail with state objectives, as in the case of the [[Nayirah (testimony)|1990 news story]] about Iraqi soldiers taking "babies out of incubators" in Kuwaiti hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Parenti, ''Inventing Reality'' (1993), p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Nigerian Civil War]], both the federal government and the secessionist Republic of Biafra hired public relations firms, which competed to influence public opinion in the West, and between them established some of the key narratives employed in news reports about the war.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Rothmyer, "What really happened in Biafra? Why did themes such as mass starvation and genocide alternately surface and fade? A study of media susceptibility to public relations manipulation." ''Columbia Journalism Review'' 9.3, Fall 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the position of the public relations industry has grown stronger, while the position of news producers has grown weaker. Public relations agents mediate the production of news about all sectors of society.&lt;ref name=MoloneyJacksonMcQueen&gt;Kevin Moloney, Daniel Jackson, &amp; David McQueen, "News journalism and public relations: a dangerous relationship", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==News consumption==
Over the centuries, commentators on newspapers and society have repeatedly observed widespread human interest in news.&lt;ref name=Stephens13 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 1–2, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Elite members of a society's political and economic institutions might rely on news as one limited source of information, for the masses, news represents a relatively exclusive window onto the operations by which a society is managed.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), pp. 93–94. "Because political events and issues in modern societies typically take place in specialized locations, most citizens experience politics vicariously. […] For elites, information from the media becomes just one of many sources of data. Because of their political involvement and interest and their vast base of prior knowledge, elites treat media coverage as foreground, or sources of new and/or specific information. […] Nonelites, on the other hand, are not so interested in politics, and they have relatively little prior knowledge about political issues. For nonelites, media coverage is not only a source of new data, but their only source of information."&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular people in societies with news media often spend a lot of time reading or watching news reports.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers became significant aspects of national and literary culture—as exemplified by James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', which derives from the newspapers of June 16 (and thereabouts), 1904, and represents the newspaper office itself as a vital part of life in Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brandon Kershner, ''The Culture of Joyce's Ulysses''; Palgrave Macmillan, 2010; see Chapter Five, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=yc7HAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA79 Newspapers and Periodicals: Endless Dialogue]". Also see: James Broderick, "'Give Us This Day Our Daily Press': Journalism in the Life and Art of James Joyce", Dissertation accepted at City University of New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1945 study by sociologist [[Bernard Berelson]] found that during the 1945 New York newspaper strike, New Yorkers exhibited a virtual addiction to news, describing themselves as "lost", "nervous", "isolated", and "suffering" due to the withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Berelson, "[http://simson.net/ref/1948/What_missing_the_newspaper_means.pdf What 'missing the newspaper' means]", in ''Communications Research 1948–1949'', ed. Lazarsfeld &amp; Stanton; New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1949; quoted in Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Television news has become still further embedded in everyday life, with specific programming anticipated at different times of day.&lt;ref name="Allen47"&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 47–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Children tend to find the news boring, too serious, or emotionally disturbing. They come to perceive news as characteristic of adulthood, and begin watching television news in their teenage years because of the adult status it confers.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 113–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

People exhibit various forms of skepticism towards the news. Studies of [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] readers found that many of them gain pleasure from seeing through the obviously fake or poorly constructed stories—and get their "real news" from television.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and cultural cohesion===
An important feature distinguishing news from private information transfers is the impression that when one reads (or hears, or watches) it, one joins a larger public.&lt;ref name=Starr24&gt;Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 24. "Publications weave invisible threads of connection among their readers. Once a newspaper circulates, for example, no one ever truly reads it alone. Readers know that others are also seeing it at roughly the same time, and they read it differently as a result, conscious that the information is now out in the open, spread before a public that may talk about the news and act on it."&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard news serves to unify its receivers under the banner of a culture, or a society, as well as into the sub-demographics of a society targeted by their favorite kind of news.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 17. "The newspaper has ceased to be a personal organ and has become a social product; it no longer represents the interests of an individual, but it represents rather a group activity. The press groups society and unifies each group, as Scott-James has pointed out. It unifies society on national lines and thus the press of each country has developed in its own characteristic direction. It unifies the groups interested in religion, in politics, in business, in automobiles, in sports, in education, or in fashion, and from these groups having unified interests there has developed the press that ministers to each specialized group."&lt;/ref&gt; News thus plays a role in [[nation-building]], the construction of a national identity.&lt;ref&gt;Motti Neiger, Eyal Zandberg, and Oren Meyers, "Localizing Collective Memory: Radio Broadcasts and the Construction of Regional Memory"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 156–160. "In Israel, radio played a decisive role in establishing and consolidating the nation during the first decades after the creation of the State (Pansler, 2004). The exclusive position enjoyed by radio in the field of electronic broadcasting during the crucial first twenty years of Israel's existence since 1948, when the press was politically divided and television was absent—Israel's first television channel started broadcasting in 1968—gave it much weight in setting the collective agenda."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Photojournalism|Images connected with news]] can also become iconic and gain a fixed role in the culture. Examples such as [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]]'s photograph ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]]'', [[Nick Ut]]'s photograph of [[Phan Thi Kim Phuc]] and other children running from a napalm blast in Vietnam; [[Kevin Carter]]'s photograph of a starving child being stalked by a vulture;&lt;ref name=Zeiler31 /&gt; etc.

With the new interconnectedness of global media, the experience of receiving news along with a world audience reinforces the social cohesion effect on a larger scale.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 6–7. "But [news] is an illusion which, when we receive it, and when we extend to it our trust in its authority as a representation of the real, transports us from the relative isolation of our domestic environments, the parochialism of our streets and small towns, the crowded bustle of our big cities, to membership of virtual global communities, united in access to ''these'' events, communally experienced at ''this'' moment, through global communications networks. […] It is, indeed, more like the fear and exhiliration experienced by watching a movie on the big screen, but with an added viscerality contributed by the awareness that this scene, unlike a movie, is ''really happening'', right now, to real people."&lt;/ref&gt; As a corollary, global media culture may erode the uniqueness and cohesion of national cultures.&lt;ref name=SilverblattZlobin28&gt;Silverblatt &amp; Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 28–31. "A major liability of transnational media conglomerates is the loss of distinctive local culture. Transnational media conglomerates have a distinctly American influence—regardless of their country of origin. For instance, although Bertlesmann is a German-based corporation, in 2001, its largest proportion of its revenue (35 percent) came from its U.S. media subsidiaries, including Bantam, Doubleday Dell, and Random House publishing companies, ''Family Circle'' and ''McCall's''' magazines, and Arista and RCA record labels."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public sphere===
This collective form experience can be understood to constitute a political realm or [[public sphere]].&lt;ref name=Starr24 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, the news media constitute a [[fourth estate]] which serves to check and balance the operations of government.&lt;ref name="Allen47"/&gt;

This idea, at least as a goal to be sought, has re-emerged in the era of global communications.&lt;ref&gt;Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, unprecedented opportunities exist for public analysis and discussion of world events.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 140–144.&lt;/ref&gt; According to one interpretation of the [[CNN effect]], instantaneous global news coverage can rally public opinion as never before to motivate political action.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 179–185.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, local and global communications media enabled instant exposure to and discussion of the Chinese government's actions in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]]. The news about Tiananmen Square traveled over fax machine, telephone, newspaper, radio, and television, and continued to travel even after the government imposed new restrictions on local telecommunications.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===News events===
As the technological means for disseminating news grew more powerful, news became an experience which millions of people could undergo simultaneously. Outstanding news experiences can exert profound influence on millions of people. Through its power to effect a shared experience, news events can mold the [[collective memory]] of a society.&lt;ref&gt;Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 211–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, "News as a Form of Knowledge" (1940), pp. 685–686. "In fact, the multiplication of the means of communication has brought it about that anyone, even in the most distant part of the world, may now actually participate in events—at least as listener if not as spectator—as they actually take place in some other part of the world. We have recently listened to Mussolini address his fascist followers from a balcony of Rome; we have heard Hitler speaking over the heads of a devout congregation in the Reichstag, in Berlin, not merely to the President, but to the people, of the United States. We have even had an opportunity to hear the terms of the momentous Munich agreement ten seconds after it had been signed by the representatives of four of the leading powers in Europe and the world. The fact that acts so momentous as these can be so quickly and so publicly consummated has suddenly and completely changed the character of international politics, so that one can no longer even guess what the future has in store for Europe and for the world."&lt;/ref&gt;

One type of news event, the [[media event]], is a scripted pageant organized for mass live broadcast. Media events include athletic contests such as the Super Bowl and the Olympics, cultural events like awards ceremonies and celebrity funerals, and also political events such as coronations, debates between electoral candidates, and diplomatic ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; These events typically unfold according to a common format which simplifies the transmission of news items about them.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 25–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually they have the effect of increasing the perceived unity of all parties involved, which include the broadcasters and audience.&lt;ref&gt;Dayan &amp; Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, international events such as a national declaration of independence, can be scripted in advance with the major news agencies, with staff specially deployed to key locations worldwide in advance of the life news broadcast. Public relations companies can participate in these events as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Chris | last2 = Andresen | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Hoxha | first3 = Abit | title = "The manufacture of an international news event: The day Kosovo was born"; | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–120 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1177/1464884911400846}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The perception that an ongoing crisis is taking place further increases the significance of live news. People rely on the news and constantly seek more of it, to learn new information and to seek reassurance amidst feelings of fear and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 57–61.&lt;/ref&gt; Crises can also increase the effect of news on social cohesion, and lead the population of a country to "rally" behind its current leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 73–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of a global news system goes hand in hand with the advent of [[terrorism]] and other sensational acts, which have power in proportion to the audience they capture. In 1979, the [[Iran hostage crisis|capture of American hostages in Iran]] dominated months of news coverage in the western media, gained the status of a "crisis", and influenced a presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 73–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africans overwhelmingly describe the end of Apartheid as a source of the country's most important news.&lt;ref&gt;Danie Du Plessis, "What's News in South Africa?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 303. "Virtually all references to political significance of news events refer to the historical events of the first part of the 1990s. Current political events are overshadowed so greatly by the start of the political process in South Africa that they have lost much of their significance to the participants. Both black and white participants in the focus group shared this response."&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, news events such as the assassinations of the 1960s (of [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]]), the 1969 [[moon landing]], the 1986 Challenger explosion, the 1997 death of Princess Diana, the [[Bush v. Gore|intervention of the Supreme Court]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] and the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth A. Skewes and Heather Black, "What's News in the United States?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, people cited numerous memorable news events involving death and war, including the death of [[King Hussein]], Princess Diana, and [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin]]. Positive news stories found memorable by Jordanians featured political events affecting their lives and families—such as the [[South Lebanon security belt|Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon]], and the [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Issa Taha Ali, "What's News in Jordan?" in Shoemaker &amp; Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

News coverage can also shape collective memory in retrospect. A study of Israeli news coverage leading up to the media event of the nation's 60th birthday found that news coverage of events like the Holocaust, World War Two, and subsequent Israeli wars increased the perceived importance of these events in the minds of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, "Memory-Setting: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory to the Study of Collective Memory"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, &amp; Zandberg; pp. 233–234. Also see: Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, "Setting the collective memory agenda: Examining mainstream media influence on individuals' perceptions of the past"; ''Memory Studies'' 7.4, October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===News making===
News making is the act of making the news or doing something that is considered to be newsworthy. When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.&lt;ref name="post.queensu.ca"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University – Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"/&gt; It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.&lt;ref name="post.queensu.ca"/&gt; The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.

Models of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.

News Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.&lt;ref name="Graber 1980"/&gt; Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.

===Psychological effects===
{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}

Exposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Schuster, et al., "A National Survey of Stress Reactions After the September 11, 2011, Terrorist Attacks", ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 345.20, 15 November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have indicated that children have been traumatized by exposure to television of other frightening events, including the Challenger disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Terr | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | title = Children's symptoms in the wake of Challenger: a field study of distant-traumatic effects and an outline of related conditions | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 156 | issue = 10| year = 1999 | pmid = 10518163 | doi=10.1176/ajp.156.10.1536 | pages=1536–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists themselves also experience trauma and guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Rees, "The Trauma Factor", in Fowler-Watt &amp; Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research also suggest that constant representations of violence in the news lead people to overestimate the frequency of its occurrence in the real world, thus increasing their level of fear in everyday situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altheide | first1 = David L. | title = The News Media, the Problem Frame, and the Production of Fear | url = | journal = Sociological Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 4| year= 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
The content and style of news delivery certainly have effects on the general public, with the magnitude and precise nature of these effects being tough to determine experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western societies, television viewing has been so ubiquitous that its total effect on psychology and culture leave few alternatives for comparison.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 12. "Some media may be so pervasive and so consistent in their effects that their impact is not noticeable. After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.&lt;/ref&gt;

News is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Zhong, "Searching for Meaning" (2006), pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt; The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.&lt;ref&gt;Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. "When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues."&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oera Linda Book''' is a manuscript written in a form of [[Old Frisian]], purporting to cover historical, mythological, and religious themes of remote antiquity, from 2194 BCE to 803 CE. Among academics in [[Germanic philology]], the document is widely considered to be a [[hoax]] or [[forgery]].

The manuscript first came to public awareness in the 1860s. In 1872, Jan Gerhardus Ottema published a Dutch translation and defended it as genuine. Over the next few years there was a heated public controversy, but by 1879 it was universally accepted that the text was a recent composition. Nevertheless, a public controversy was revived in the context of 1930s [[Nazi occultism]], and the book is still occasionally brought up in esotericism and [[Atlantis]] literature. The manuscript's author is not known with certainty, hence it is unknown whether the intention was to produce a [[hoax]], a [[parody]] or simply an exercise in poetic fantasy.

Historian Goffe Jensma published a monograph on the manuscript in 2004, ''De gemaskerde god'' ("The Masked God"), including a new translation and a discussion of the history of its reception. Jensma concludes that it was probably intended as a "hoax to fool some nationalist [[Frisia|Frisians]] and orthodox Christians", as well as an "experiential exemplary exercise" by Dutch theologian and poet [[Piet Paaltjens|François Haverschmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://historischhuis.nl/recensiebank/review/show/414] {{ISBN|90-6550-841-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zeker ook nieuw aan mijn boek is wat ik op grond van het handschrift zelf kon concluderen over de tijd van ontstaan en over de wijze waarop het is gemaakt, namelijk in een aantal fases en niet door één auteur, maar zeker door twee en vermoedelijk door drie auteurs.'' [http://www.semafoor.net/Jensmareactie.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of reception==

===19th century===
The Oera Linda Book, known in [[Old Frisian]] as ''Thet Oera Linda Bok'', came to light in 1867 when Cornelis Over de Linden (1811&amp;ndash;1874) handed the manuscript, which he claimed to have inherited from his grandfather, via his aunt, over to Eelco Verwijs (1830&amp;ndash;1880), the provincial librarian of Friesland, for translation and publication. Verwijs rejected the manuscript, but in 1872 Jan Gerhardus Ottema (1804&amp;ndash;1879), a prominent member of the Frisian Society for History and Culture, published a Dutch translation. Ottema believed it to be written in authentic [[Old Frisian]]. The book was subsequently translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876, and published by Trübner &amp; Co. of London.

Within the first few years after the appearance of the Oera Linda Book, its recent origin was established not only based on the exceptional claims being made, but also because of a number of anachronisms it contained. The text was nevertheless a source of inspiration for a number of occultists and speculative historians. While there was some debate among Dutch academics and in a number of newspapers about the book's authenticity during the 1870s, by 1879 it was widely recognized as a forgery.

===Nazi Germany===
More than forty years later, beginning in 1922, Dutch ''[[völkisch]]'' philologist [[Herman Wirth]] revived the issue. Wirth published a German translation of what he dubbed the "Nordic Bible" in 1933, as ''Die Ura Linda Chronik''.

A panel discussion on Wirth's book at the University of Berlin on 4 May 1934 was the immediate impulse for the foundation of the [[Ahnenerbe]] Nazi "[[think tank]]" by [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] and Wirth, together with [[Richard Walther Darré]]. Because of the infatuation of Himmler with the Oera Linda Book and its consequent association with Nazi occultism, it became known as "Himmler's Bible". Wirth's book was by no means universally acclaimed among the Nazi-era Nordicist academics, and the 1934 panel discussion was steeped in heated controversy. [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and his circle rejected it. [[Gustav Neckel]] had praised Wirth's work before publication, but upon seeing its content published a dismayed recension.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Tag'', Berlin,  31. December 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in defense of the book's authenticity were [[Walther Wüst]] and [[Otto Huth]], besides Wirth himself. Speaking against its authenticity were Neckel, Karl Hermann Jacob-Friesen (who identified it as a satirical hoax by Linden) and [[Arthur Hübner]]. Hübner was one of the most respected Germanists of his generation, and his verdict of the Oera Linda being a falsification settled the defeat of Wirth's party. The public defeat of Himmler's scholarly brand of "esoteric Nordicism" resulted in the foundation of Ahnenerbe, which attracted occultists such as [[Karl Maria Wiligut]] and was viewed with suspicion by the mainstream National Socialist ideologues of [[Amt Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Simon, [http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/gerd.simon/himmlerbibel.pdf Himmlers Bibel und die öffentlichkeitswirksamste Podiumsdiskussion in der Geschichte der Germanistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern esotericism===
The book experienced a revival of popularity in the English-speaking world with the writings of Robert Scrutton. In ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) he reproduced the full text of Sandbach's 1876 English translation, interspersed with his own commentaries on history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) {{ISBN|0-72217-665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) he became the first to link the book with the concept of [[earth mysteries]], and, in particular, [[ley lines]] and [[telluric current|telluric energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) {{ISBN|0-72217-667-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Scrutton's example, English language accounts of the Oera Linda Book tend to place it within the [[New Age]] or [[alternate history]] genres, and do not associate it with National Socialism, as is the case in Germany.

Another figure to formulate a contemporary [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan]] tradition influenced by the Oera Linda Book was Tony Steele, who considered the book to reveal the genuine truth about the ancient European [[megalith|megalithic culture]]. In ''Water Witches'' (1998) he examined the book's use as a cultural identity marker by the Frisian-descended canal folk of the [[The Midlands|English Midlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''Water Witches'' (1998) {{ISBN|1-86163-049-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) he connected the religious practices of the priestesses described in the book with later medieval [[witchcraft]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) {{ISBN|1-86163-140-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
Among those who doubt the book's authenticity, the most popular candidates for the author of the manuscript are Cornelis Over de Linden or Eelco Verwijs. A recent third choice is the Protestant preacher François Haverschmidt (1835&amp;ndash;1894), well known for writing poetry under the pseudonym Piet Paaltjens. Haverschmidt lived in Friesland and was an acquaintance of Verwijs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepsis.nl/oeralinda/ Skepsis.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goffe Jensma (2004) argued that Haverschmidt was the main writer of the book, with the help of Over de Linden and Verwijs. According to Jensma, Haverschmidt intended the Oera Linda Book as a parody of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]]. An article in late 2007 by Jensma&lt;ref&gt;Extraordinary professor of Frisian Language and Culture, in particular the literary-historical aspects of Frisian, at the Faculty of Humanities of the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]]&lt;/ref&gt; says that the three authors of the translation intended it "to be a temporary hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians and as an experiential exemplary exercise in reading the Holy Bible in a non-fundamentalist, symbolical way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/news/2004/11/122_00?lang=en ''Oera Linda-boek was poging van Haverschmidt om bijbel te ontkrachten''] [[Rijks Universiteit Groningen]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring clues that it was a forgery, J. G. Ottema took it seriously, and it achieved popularity for the reasons given above. Its creators felt unable to admit that they had written it, and it became the foundation for new occult beliefs. Jensma concludes his article by saying "It is a perfect irony that a book written to unmask the Holy Bible as a book of human making was to become a bible itself."&lt;ref name="Jensma"&gt;{{Citation|title=How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science.

==Contents==
Themes running through the Oera Linda Book include [[catastrophism]], [[nationalism]], [[matriarchy]], and [[mythology]]. The text alleges that Europe and other lands were, for a large part of their history, ruled by a succession of folk-mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess [[Frijjo|Frya]], daughter of the creator god Wr-alda and Jrtha, the earth mother. The claim is also made that this Frisian civilization possessed an alphabet that was the ancestor of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Phoenician alphabet]]s. Modern [[historiography]] is essentially ignored, particularly in the area of basic chronology of known events in the recent and distant past of Europe. Geological as well as geographical evidence that was readily available even as far back as Over de Linden's time is also mostly absent from the manuscript.

The earliest portion of the Oera Linda Book, namely ''Frya’s Tex'', was supposedly composed in 2194 BC, whereas the most recent part, the letter of Hidde Oera Linda, dates to AD 1256. Almost half of the entire book comprises ''The Book of Adela’s Followers'', the original text around which the rest grew. It is purported to have been compiled in the 6th century BC from a mixture of contemporary writings and ancient inscriptions. The last two sections of the Oera Linda Book contain a number of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] and the book itself breaks off in mid-sentence.

It also describes a lost land called [[Atlantis|Atland]] (the name given to Atlantis by the 17th century scholar [[Olof Rudbeck]]), which was supposedly submerged in 2194 BC, the same year as 19th century Dutch and Frisian almanacs, following traditional Biblical chronology given for [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="Jensma"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2535">An '''online newsroom''' (also known as a '''pressroom''', '''mediaroom''', '''press center''' or '''media center''') is a [[website]], [[web page]] or site section that contains distributable information about a corporation or organization. The online newsroom was initially created for corporate communicators and [[public relations]] firms to target traditional [[News media|media]] outlets, fundamentally newspapers, magazines, radio stations and television stations. Multiple public relations audience interests are now supported, including media relations, investor and analyst relations, community relations, and consumer [[social media]] relations.

Most online newsrooms provide [[press releases]] and kits, photographs, logos, audio, video, executive biographies, contact information, events, company history and awards and honors. Sometimes, they also contain industry news feeds.

Increasingly companies are aggregating their presence on various social media sites into their online newsrooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 Communicate magazine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225210651/http://www.communicatemagazine.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=658:hold-the-front-page&amp;catid=81:november-2009&amp;Itemid=112 |date=2012-02-25 }} Hold the Front Page, Communicate magazine, November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some newsrooms may accommodate interactive forums for product evangelists, disgruntled consumers and organizational spokespeople to engage in ongoing online conversation about the company or organization and its products, services or philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

'''Rene Peter Onno Rubiono van Helsdingen''' (born 25 February 1957)&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC"&gt;{{cite web|last = Helsdingen|first = Rene|url = http://www.renevanhelsdingen.com/biography.html|title = Rene van Helsdingen biography|publisher = |date = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Dutch pianist and composer. 

He studied classical music with Komter Loeber in [[Blaricum]] in the Netherlands from 1962–72. Then he studied jazz music with [[Terry Trotter]] and Lazlo Cser in Los Angeles in 1979. His earliest influences include [[Oscar Peterson]], [[McCoy Tyner]] and [[Bill Evans]]. 

Over the years pianist René has recorded and produced for many different labels, such as Virgin, Timeless, WEA, Dureco,  Zebra Acoustic, Pacific Music, Turning Point records, Munich Records, demajors Independent Music Industry Jakarta and his own labels: Relukreul records, and Helsdingen Music, The Netherlands. Helsdingen writes most of his repertoire.  Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' characterised him as "A rewarding pianist who can play comfortably in the groove, or create more impressionistic patterns, or quiet, subtle musings. Perhaps the most notable quality of his solos is brevity. René allows himself a few extended workouts and avoids the trap of repeating himself or overstating his case."&lt;ref&gt;The Age, Melbourne, 23 Dec. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Helsdingen has organized many successful tours, projects and festivals sponsored by ngo’s , governmental institutions, companies to which he was responsible with regard to the control over the budgets made available.

'''The Oprah Effect''' is the phenomenon in which consuming [[soft news]] causes the politically unaware to vote more consistently with their own views, articulated by Matthew A. Baum and Angela S. Jamison in their 2006 study, "''The Oprah Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/mbaum/documents/OprahEffect_JOP.pdf|author=Matthew Baum and Angels Jamison|title=The ''Oprah'' Effect: How Soft News Helps Inattentive Citizens Vote Consistently|publisher=The Journal of Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings and conclusions of the study centered around the distinction between hard and soft news as written about by Baum, and the complex interactions both types of news have on people with low and high political awareness. The term was pioneered by [[Oprah Winfrey]].

The increase of soft news content available has led some scholars to question its value in informing the public, and therefore question whether the media is properly fulfilling its duty to inform the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=Thomas|title=The Search for a Standard: Markets and the Media|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20|pages=139–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zeller|first1=John|title=A New Standard of News Quality: Burglar Alarms for the Monitorial Citizen|journal=Political Communication|date=2003|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oprah Effect was demonstrated by testing a dependent variable of voting consistently versus an independent variable which measured how often the voter watched daytime talk shows. Voting consistency measures the consistency between a voter's preferences and their vote. For the context of this experiment, the measure of voting consistently was created by applying Lau and Redlawsk's model of "correct" voting to data from the 2000 [[American National Election Studies|National Election Studies]]. Increased consumption of soft news caused low information voters to vote more consistently, but had no significant effect on more aware voters. Exposure to hard news modestly increased the voting consistency of politically aware individuals, but had no significant effect on those with low political awareness.

While Baum and Jamison agree that soft news contains lower quality political information, they conclude from their analysis that soft news fulfills a valuable duty by providing information to apolitical individuals. This is because soft news still exposes those individuals to the political information that they need to cast a vote for the candidate which best reflects their personal interests, even if it doesn't contain highly complex political information. They theorize that exposure to soft news has this effect on low information individuals because most people with little political knowledge have no interest in harder news, making their decision to consume soft news one between  consuming soft news or consuming no news. Even though soft news may not be highly informational, it's still beneficial compared to consuming no news. They also go even further, contending that even if an individual with little political knowledge were to consume hard news, the more complex political information would be difficult for them to comprehend, and they would get relatively little out of it. As a result, they conclude their results should give some pause to critics of the increase soft news content in the media, because it increases the voting consistency of those with little political knowledge.

'''This Is It''' was a planned [[concert residency]] by [[Michael Jackson]] which was scheduled to begin in July 2009 and end September 29, 2009 with a second leg which was scheduled to run from January 2010 through March 2010 with a total of 50 shows.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jacksons-this-is-it-tour-balloons-to-50-show-run-stretching-into-2010-20090312&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson announced This Is It at a press conference in the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]], stating that it would be his final series of concerts in London. [[AEG Live]], the concert promoters, released a promotional video that took up an entire commercial break, setting a record for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. Initially, only 10 concerts were announced, but following public demand, 40 more concerts were added. Ticket sales broke several records and Jackson's album sales increased following the announcement; AEG Live estimated that the first 10&amp;nbsp;dates alone would have earned Jackson approximately £50 million. 

In preparation for the concert series, Jackson had been collaborating with high-profile figures including fashion designer [[Christian Audigier]], choreographer [[Kenny Ortega]] and bodybuilder [[Lou Ferrigno]]. Prior to Jackson's death in 2009, Allgood Entertainment sued Jackson for $40 million, claiming that he had breached an exclusivity agreement with them by agreeing to the This Is It concerts; the case was dismissed.

After Jackson's death, AEG Live offered either refunds to ticket holders or a special "souvenir" ticket designed by Jackson.

There also would have been [[Aerial dance|aerial dancing]] similar to routines by [[Cirque du Soleil]].&lt;ref name = "NME 44599"/&gt; Carla Ferrigno told [[Reuters]] that [[Lou Ferrigno|her husband Lou]] had been helping Jackson train in advance of the shows.

On May 20, it was announced that the first concert would be pushed back five days to July 13 and three other July dates would be rescheduled for March 2010. AEG Live said that the delay was necessary because more time was needed for dress rehearsals. The revised schedule called for 27 shows between July 13 and September 29, 2009, followed by a three-month break, before resuming in the new year with 23 more shows between January 7 and March 6, 2010.&lt;ref name = "new dates"/&gt; Some fans petitioned for the reversal of AEG Live's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/michael-jackson/44820 |title=Michael Jackson fans launch petition over O2 Arena postponement |publisher=''NME'' |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late June, several hundred seats for each of the dates were put on sale. These seats were held back until production logistics were worked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8115638.stm |title=More Jackson tickets up for sale |publisher=BBC |date=June 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was suggested that after the London concerts, Jackson might head to [[Australia]], [[Europe]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Japan]] before moving on to North America. Randy Phillips, the CEO of [[AEG Live]], told The LA Times that Australia was part of Michael Jackson's international tour plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.take40.com/news/16590/michael-jackson-planning-australian-tour-before-his-death |title=Michael Jackson Planning Australian Tour Before His Death |publisher=Take 40 |date=June 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 6, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504000236/http://www.take40.com/news/16590/michael-jackson-planning-australian-tour-before-his-death |archivedate=May 4, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jermaine Jackson's 2011 book ''You Are Not Alone: Michael Through a Brother's Eyes'', after the London concerts were finished, Jackson was planning to extend his deal with AEG Live which included new music, a potential three-picture movie deal, a series of one-off concert dates starting in China, a halftime slot at one of the future [[Super Bowl]] games to surpass his own halftime show at the [[Super Bowl XXVII]] in January 1993 and two more tours (one of which was to be a final reunion with his brothers based on a promise made to their [[Katherine Jackson|mother]] to see her sons perform together one last time before she passed away). After the deal was completed, he planned to take time off from musical entertainment and move on to (possibly) directing his own film ideas, such as making a feature-length motion picture based on his 1982 song "Thriller" and [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|the music video of the same name]]. It was also later revealed that [http://www.damienshields.com/michael-jacksons-halloween-special-that-never-was/ a yearly Halloween television special] based on his horror-themed songs, such as "Thriller" and "Ghosts", was part of Jackson's deal with AEG Live.

In [[Trial of Conrad Murray|Conrad Murray's manslaughter trial]], David Walgren stated another one of Jackson's future plans was to open a children's hospital. This was heard in an audio tape Conrad Murray played of Jackson under the influence of propofol on May 10, 2009. His voice is barely recognisable in the recording, but he can be clearly heard saying that he wanted to build the greatest children's hospital in the world and name it after himself: The ''Michael Jackson's Children's Hospital''. Walgren also stated that while the tour was happening, Jackson wanted to buy an estate with streams, horses and animals so his three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket could live normal lives as their father performed the concerts, as he was photographed looking for a house in the United Kingdom with his children. Walgren also said that the tour would begin that summer, and Jackson could take his children out of school and bring them with him so they could see him perform in London.

===Songs prepared===
As shown in ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]'', songs prepared for the concerts included "[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]", "[[Jam (song)|Jam]]", "[[They Don't Care About Us]]", "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]", "[[Smooth Criminal]]", "[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]", a medley of songs by [[The Jackson 5]] consisting of "[[I Want You Back]]", "[[The Love You Save]]", "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" and "[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]", "[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]", "[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]", "[[Beat It]]", "[[Black or White]]", "[[Earth Song]]", "[[Billie Jean]]", and "[[Man in the Mirror]]". Later on, "[[Stranger in Moscow]]", "[[You Are Not Alone]]", "[[Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough]]", "[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock with You]]", "[[Dirty Diana]]" ,"[[You Rock My World]]", "[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson song)|Dangerous]]", "[[We Are the World]]", "[[Heal the World]]" and "[[Will You Be There]]" were also confirmed to have been planned for the shows. Due to the larger than usual roster of songs, as well as time constraints, Jackson would perform some songs with one verse less than he did in previous tours (such as "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", "Jam", "The Way You Make Me Feel" and "Black or White"). "[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" was rumored to have been reserved for select concerts. On the final dates, Jackson wanted to perform a ballad called "River Ripple", written by him, with an African choir and his children. During the final concert before "Man in the Mirror", Michael was slated to premiere a song called "Best of Joy", written and recorded in 2009 prior to Jackson's death. As of 2018, the full version of "River Ripple" remains unreleased (although snippets of the song have leaked on YouTube), while "Best of Joy" was officially released in 2010 on Jackson's first posthumous album of unreleased songs, ''[[Michael (album)|Michael]]''.

==Litigation==
In June 2009, concert promoter Allgood Entertainment, represented by Ira Meyerowitz and Jon Kekielek of MJlawfirm, sued Jackson for $40 million. He claimed that Jackson, through his manager [[Frank DiLeo]], had agreed to a single and a $30 million reunion concert with [[The Jackson 5]] and his sister [[Janet Jackson]]. According to the concert promoter, the alleged contractual agreement prevented Jackson from performing elsewhere before the reunion concert and for a three-month period after it. Thus, agreeing to a 50 date residency at the O2 arena was an alleged breach of the Allgood Entertainment contract. The filing company stated that AEG Live knew of the alleged agreement with Jackson and used their dominance in the industry to coerce Jackson into agreeing to the residency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8094537.stm |title=Jackson sued over reunion concert |publisher=BBC |date=June 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jun/12/michael-jackson-sued-o2-arena|title=Michael Jackson sued for O2 arena residency|publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Michaels |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/12/michael-jackson-comeback-concerts |title=Michael Jackson comeback concerts in jeopardy? |publisher=''The Guardian'' |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 12, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010, the judge dismissed the case, stating that there was no evidence of a binding agreement, no contracts were signed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11038050 | work=BBC News | title=Judge dismisses Jackson reunion claim | date=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was in limbo as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.recapthelaw.org/nysd/347380/ |title=AllGood Entertainment, Inc. et al v.

==Jackson's death and refunds==
{{Further|Death of Michael Jackson}}

On June 25, 2009, Jackson died after going into [[cardiac arrest]] which was caused by an overdose of [[Propofol]] and [[Benzodiazepine|benzodiazepines]], eighteen days before his planned first show. AEG Live, who persuaded Jackson to sign up for the shows, faced a liability of up to £300 million and an empty venue for the next nine months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwin|first=Adam|title=O2 arena counts cost as curtain closes on the greatest show of all|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article6580748.ece|publisher=The Times|date=June 26, 2009|accessdate=June 26, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The O2 arena stated that full refunds, including all ticket service charges, would be available to those who purchased tickets through authorized agents, but that "fans will have the option to be sent the actual tickets they would have received to attend the shows in lieu of the full refunds which are being offered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCLA Statement&amp;nbsp;— Michael Jackson|url=http://www.theo2.co.uk/inside/ucla-statement-michael-jackson.html |publisher=[[The O2 Arena]] |accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans who bought their tickets from private sellers potentially faced difficulties. eBay recommended that purchasers contact their sellers for refunds and stated that those who used PayPal can get their money back if the purchase was made during the last 45 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8120412.stm |title=Refund issues over Jackson gigs |publisher=''BBC News'' |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; then later stated that "all buyers on the site will receive a full refund for their ticket purchase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8122580.stm |title=eBay will refund Jackson tickets |publisher=BBC News |date=June 27, 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Jackson's death, AEG stated that they had over "100 hours of footage of preparations and rehearsals for the shows".&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32360110 |title=Judge OKs Jackson performance film deal |agency=Associated Press |work=[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]] |date=August 10, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 10, 2009, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff approved a deal between film distributor [[Columbia Pictures]] and AEG Live for the former company to purchase and distribute rehearsal footage of Jackson for a film entitled ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]''.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal6"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/showbiz/2009-08/06/content_8532737.htm |title=Michael Jackson film deal outlined in court papers |work=ChinaDaily.com |date=August 6, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deal3"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-jackson11-2009aug11,0,2938755.story |author=Christopher Smith |work=[[LA Times|LA Times.com]] |title=Sony Pictures to produce Michael Jackson film |accessdate=September 21, 2009 | date=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to court documents, Columbia paid $60 million (£35 million) for rights to the rehearsal footage.&lt;ref name="deal6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="filmdeal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/news/michael_jackson/news/13441 |title=Michael jackson This Is It film deal agreed |work=Uncut.co.uk |date=August 8, 2009|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The papers filed in court had reportedly stated that Jackson's estate will get 90% of the profits and that AEG Live will get the remaining 10% from the film's revenue.&lt;ref name="filmdeal2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deal4"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/aug/11/michael-jackson-film-october-release |author=Rosie Swash |title=Michael Jackson film gets October release date |work=[[Guardian.co.uk]] |date=August 11, 2009 |accessdate=October 2, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by [[Kenny Ortega]] who was also the director of the live concert. It was compiled mostly from footage that was shot as reference for production discussions and was never meant to be shown publicly.

'''Tim Soar''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[fashion designer]], [[graphic designer]], [[event planner]] and [[DJ]].

==Career==
Soar began his creative career working with designer [[Neville Brody]] on an interiors project POST Design.  This was followed by independent practice as a graphic designer, and then in the design company STAC collaborating with photographer [[Andrew Catlin]]. His work was focussed in music, producing artwork for numerous international record sleeves, publications and campaigns.

==Career as a DJ==
While working with Neville Brody, Soar became involved in the music industry and began working as a DJ. Soar had residencies at a number of venues and clubs across London. He was also involved in the writing and arrangement of [[23 Skidoo (band)|23 Skidoo]]'s song ''Just Like Everybody''. He was also part of the band called Toll, which released the album ''Christ Knows'' in 2006.

==Design label==
In 2005, Soar launched the Tim Soar design label and this was described as “really well-made menswear that mixes minimalism, sportswear, tailoring, and unusual fabrications.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://londonfashionweek.co.uk/designers_profile.aspx?DesignerID=1162|title=London Fashion Week - Tim Soar|website=londonfashionweek.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Soar described his foray from music to fashion design with these words:&lt;blockquote&gt;I felt that I had something to say about modern menswear and that it was time to move on from the flippant to something more serious. I was tired of seeing gimmicky menswear that was badly made and did not fit correctly. I set out to produce clothes that are a synthesis of minimalism and the avant garde made to the highest possible standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.notjustalabel.com/designer/soar|title=Soar {{!}} NOT JUST A LABEL|website=www.notjustalabel.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The first collection was presented by the London-based B-Store, the second collection by [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]], and has continued with packed shows at each [[London Fashion Week]] since Spring/Summer 09. His women's wear line debuted in 2011 with a capsule collection for Browns 24. Soar told [[Vogue (British magazine)|British Vogue]] that the concept is womenswear for boyish women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/tim-soar-launches-womenswear|title=Girls Who Like Boys|last=Alexander|first=Ella|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soar's collections are now available in numerous countries worldwide.

==Music Concrete==
Soar is also creative head of Music Concrete, a music consultancy that was established in 1987. It initially catered to the boutique hotel market but has since expanded into launches, fashion, and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musicconcrete.com/about-music-consultancy/|title=Music Concrete: Music consultant for hotels, spas and bars|website=musicconcrete.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked with many of the leading UK and international fashion designers and design houses, including [[Donna Karen]] [[Prada]], [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Levi's]], [[Fendi]], [[LVMH]], Mathew Williamson, Fendi and Adidas.

'''Unintentional discharge''' is the event of a [[firearm]] discharging (firing) at a time not intended by the user. An unintended discharge may be produced by an incompatibility between firearm design and usage, such as the phenomenon of [[cooking off]] a round in a closed bolt machine gun, a mechanical malfunction as in the case of [[slamfire]] in an automatic weapon, user induced due to training issues or negligence, or a simple accident. The phenomenon has also been defined in the scientific literature as ''an activation of the trigger mechanism that results in an unplanned discharge that is outside of the firearm’s prescribed use''. Where prescribed use refers to departmental policies and laws related to the operation of firearms (O'Neill, 2018).

==Accidental discharge==

An '''accidental discharge''' ('''AD''') may occur when the trigger of the firearm is deliberately pulled for a purpose other than shooting—dry-fire practice, demonstration, or function testing—but ammunition is unintentionally left in the chamber.  Unintentionally leaving a firearm loaded is more likely to occur when the individual handling the gun is poorly trained, and perhaps also with removable-magazine-fed firearms (as the magazine may be removed, giving an unloaded appearance even when a round remains chambered—see discussion of magazine-safeties below).

A second common cause of negligent discharges is when the gun-handler places their finger on the trigger before they have decided to shoot.  With the finger so positioned, many activities may cause the finger to compress the trigger unintentionally.  For example, if one attempts to holster the firearm with finger on trigger, the holster edge will drive the finger onto the trigger, and discharge is likely.  If one stumbles or struggles (with an adversary) with finger on trigger, the grasping motion of both hands will likely cause the trigger finger to compress the trigger.

[[Gun safety]] rules recognize the above possibilities, and aim to prevent them. The primary firearm safety rule usually listed by any source is a version of "Always keep the gun pointed in safe direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Izak|first1=Shultz|title=Gun Safe Reviews|url=http://www.shootingandsafety.com/best-gun-safe-reviews/|website=Shooting &amp; Safety|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this rule ensures that, should an accidental discharge occur, no harm will be done.  Second, one's finger should remain outside the trigger guard until the decision has been made to fire the weapon; even if (some would say especially if) one is facing a hostile adversary and has to be prepared to fire at a moment's notice, keeping the finger out of the trigger-guard until one has decided to shoot will prevent an accidental shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backwoodshome.com/articles2/ayoob103.html|title=The subtleties of safe firearms handling|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|date=February 2007|website=Issue #103|publisher=Backwoods Home Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a firearm is not in use, storing it unloaded and in a separate container from ammunition may also help prevent accidental discharges, especially if the stored firearm is "accessed" by an unauthorized user.

On occasion, an accidental discharge can occur by means other than the finger pulling the [[trigger (firearms)|trigger]], such as dropping a loaded weapon.  Because of this possibility, most currently produced pistols are designed with a "drop-safety" or [[Safety (firearms)#Firing pin block|firing pin block]], a mechanism inhibiting or isolating the firing pin, preventing accidental discharge if the firearm is dropped.  However, most long guns do not have drop-safeties.

Prevention of dropped-firearm ADs with long guns therefore depends on the user being familiar with the precautions needed for that particular gun: it is standard practice for all long-gun users to unload the firearm's chamber before any activity that might foreseeably result in a dropped firearm (e.g., climbing a fence while hunting), and before placing the firearm in a vehicle (where sudden deceleration may cause the firearm to act as if dropped).

Accidental discharges not involving trigger-pull can also occur if the firearm is mechanically unsound: poor maintenance, abuse, inept "gunsmithing," or the use of substandard materials or defective [[ammunition]] in the gun may all lead to breakage.

In World War II, early versions of the British [[Sten gun]] were notorious for accidentally discharging when dropped. While dropping any long gun with loaded chamber can be dangerous, the use of a soft bronze bolt in early Stens—allowing the [[Sear (firearm)|sear]] contact area to wear down quickly—made ADs even more likely.

As the early Sten gun illustrates, "poor design," including the specification of unsuitable component materials, is sometimes cited as a cause for some firearms being "unsafe."  Surely, any firearm that can discharge by itself when loaded is unsafe, and no user would want to handle a firearm that has a high likelihood of accidental discharge when employed for its intended use.  But, firearm designs incorporating fewer safeties are not intrinsically unsafe—see discussion of long-guns above—even if they do require competence and proper training for safe use.

A relevant discussion attends the use of [[Safety (firearms)#Magazine Interlocks|magazine-safeties]] in semi-automatic pistols.  Such safeties prevent the pistol from firing if there is a round in the chamber, but the magazine is removed.  Some self-defense experts dislike this feature, as it may allow the pistol to be "disabled" unexpectedly during a struggle, so that the pistol fails when needed.  Others feel that it may improve user safety and prevent some accidental discharges.  Both semi-auto pistol designs, with and without magazine-safeties, are currently manufactured.

One last form of accidental discharge, known as ''[[cooking off]],'' occurs when a weapon becomes overheated, with the firing chamber hot enough to ignite the propellant charge in the ammunition round, causing the cartridge to fire.  As recently as 1979, this problem doomed the innovative [[Heckler &amp; Koch G11]] during NATO trials.

"Cooking off" is typically encountered only in [[fully automatic]] weapons, such as [[machine gun]]s, when they are fired for long periods of time without allowing the barrel and chamber of the weapon to cool down to safe temperatures.  For this reason, modern crew-served machine guns are equipped with spare [[Gun barrel|barrel]]s to allow a machine gun crew to replace an overheated barrel with a cool one, thus restoring the weapon to action while the overheated barrel is allowed to cool. Also, the majority of machine guns fire from an [[open bolt]], so the round is chambered only after pressing the trigger, just before firing.

==Negligent discharge==

A '''negligent discharge''' ('''ND''') is a discharge of a [[firearm]] involving [[Culpability|culpable]] carelessness. In judicial and military technical terms, a negligent discharge is a chargeable offence. A number of [[armed force]]s automatically consider any [[accidental discharge]] to be negligent discharge, under the assumption that a trained soldier has control of his firearm at all times. This is the case in the [[United States Army]],&lt;ref&gt;Trevino, Abel. "Proper Weapons Practices Key to Ending Negligent Discharge Incidents in Iraq." ''army.mil''. United States Army. 1 March 2007. [http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/03/01/2065-proper-weapons-practices-key-to-ending-negligent-discharge-incidents-in-iraq/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canadian Army]], the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[British Army]] and various Police Forces within the United Kingdom.

From an article on a U.S. Air Force website:
